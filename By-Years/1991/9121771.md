This award is to purchase a high speed network testbed to support several
projects at Purdue University including research in admission control of
multimedia traffic for Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN)
technology, transient behavior in buffers in multimedia networks,
synchronization protocols and prototyping of a broadband Distributed Multimedia
Information System, heterogeneous distributed computing, and massively parallel
numeric computation. The network testbed will be implemented in collaboration
with the TeraNet project at Columbia University's Center for Telecommunications
Research The proposed equipment will be used to implement a three-node TeraNet
testbed in order to support various research projects related to Broadband
Integrated Services Digital Network, distributed multimedia systems, parallel
processing and distributed computing. The equipment will be used in
collaboration with the TeraNet project at Columbia University's Center for
Telecommunications Research.//
