The Pleiades is the best studied open star cluster in the sky. It is one of the
primary open clusters used to define the "Zero Age Main Sequence" and hence it
serves as a cornerstone for programs which use main-sequence fitting to derive
distances to other clusters in the Milky Way Galaxy. This role is called into
question by the "Pleiades distance controversy"; the distance to the Pleiades
from the Hipparcos space astrometry mission of about 120 pc is significantly
different from the distance of 133 pc derived from other techniques. In order to
resolve this issue, the PI will use Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to
derive a new, independent trigonometric parallax distance to the Pleiades. He
will complete all VLBI measurements for the sample of ten Pleiads and any
necessary auxiliary measurements with optical and infrared
telescopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the completion of this project the
Pleiades distance controversy will be resolved, solidifying the use of the
Pleiades in determining Galactic structure. In lockstep, the PI will launch a
multi-faceted education program that is aimed at the recruitment, retention, and
advancement of minority groups in science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics.
