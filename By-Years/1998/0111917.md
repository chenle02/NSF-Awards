In this project the methodology developed by Tripathi and Kitamura (2000) is
extended to test the validity of conditional moment restrictions. This approach,
referred to as the ``smoothed empirical likelihood (SEL)'' approach, is an
extension of the empirical likelihood (EL) technique developed elsewhere in the
statistical literature. An extension is necessary because the conventional EL
approach fails when dealing with conditional moment restrictions where the
conditioning variables are continuously distributed. It is demonstrated that a
likelihood ratio type test based on the SEL procedure is easy to construct and
straightforward to implement. It is asymptotically normal under the null
hypothesis and is able to detect local alternatives which converge to the null
at rates only slightly slower than the parametric rate. A distinguishing feature
of the proposed test is that it is asymptotically optimal in terms of an average
power criterion used by Wald to demonstrate the large sample optimality of the
parametric likelihood ratio statistic.
