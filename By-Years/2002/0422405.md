The Tech Stars Scholarship program provides 29 scholarships annually to
financially needy, academically talented students in the Pee Dee area of South
Carolina and helps them to complete associate degrees (with the option of
transferring to a four-year program) in computer science, computer technology,
and engineering technology. Diverse cohorts of talented students are being
recruited from high schools, the college student population, and from the
community. Extensive student support services are being offered including on-
campus child care, tutoring, industry internships, and open and staffed computer
laboratories. In addition the project is providing mentoring, off-campus access
to technology, recognition of success, and academic, personal, and career-
related assistance. The Tech Stars Scholarship program fosters diversity. At
least 50% of scholarships are being awarded to African American students and 50%
to female students. Through enhanced student support services and industry
involvement, 100% of Tech Stars are being retained through graduation. Of those
who graduate, 100% who desire enrollment in a four-year institution are being
assisted with the transfer process. Career awareness and job placement
assistance ensure that 100% of graduates who want to enter the workforce will be
employed in jobs related to their major within 3 months of graduation.
Intellectual Merit: The project employs research-based strategies for improving
student success. The work of the NSF-funded SC ATE Center of Excellence in
recruitment and retention of students for technology majors informs this plan
and helps ensure success. Special Tech Stars initiatives address career
awareness, access to technology, and women in technology to ensure student
involvement, nurturing, and recognition.

Broader Impact: The project is developing successful models for helping ensure
the success of first-generation college students, African Americans and females
in technology-based majors. The SC ATE National Resource Center is publishing
outcomes of the project and successful models for national access and use.
