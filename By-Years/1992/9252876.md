The Summer Science Camp Program is designed to rejuvenate the student interest
in natural science and mathematics at an early age. Annually, forty-eight
seventh and eighth grade African-American students are exposed to natural
sciences, mathematics, communication skills and computer science in an intensive
four-week residential summer session at Jackson State University (JSU).
Activities include classroom instruction and laboratory
demonstrations/experiments and involve individual as well as group interaction
with communication skills (oral and written), applications of mathematical
concepts, and computer applications. Upper level science technology students
serve as mentors for the participants and continue this contact throughout the
academic year as well as actively assist the instructors. In addition, speakers
from local industry and JSU serve as invited speakers; students take field trips
to science museums, planetariums and federal laboratories. Students will
participate in similar programs until grade twelve and will be tracked
throughout their academic career.
