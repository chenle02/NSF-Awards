94111478 Marx This Dissertation Improvement research investigates the
globalization of the police function in German society from the middle of the
19th to the early 20th century. This study examines from a sociological
perspective the changing nature of police globalization from the first formal
police cooperation initiative with German involvement in 1851 until the Nazi
take- over of the International Criminal Police Commission in 1938. The analysis
seeks to uncover the forms and intensity of the global dimensions of policing in
Berlin, Hamburg, Vienna and Strasbourg. Primary and secondary documents will be
analyzed using historical research methods. Primary documents consist of police
reports in state and police archives in specified regions. Secondary data
include studies on the history of policing and the identified societal
dimensions. This research seeks to advance knowledge on the emergence and basic
patterns of the globalization of policing, and to interpret the nature of police
globalization in relation to changing historical conditions.
