Viewers who browse web pages on the Internet are shown display ads such as
images and video. Traditionally, web page publishers and advertisers negotiate a
priori through sales teams to determine which ads are shown. An emerging way to
buy and sell display ads is via automated ad exchanges, which are marketplaces
where publishers and advertisers trade ad impressions via real time auctions.
This project explores computational, informational and economic aspects of such
ad exchange markets. It will abstract suitable models for such markets and study
the fundamental challenges, including problems in auction design, online
optimization, risk-bounded pricing, real time bidding strategies, and even
cryptography. Specific examples include the design of an optimal auction in the
presence of a hierarchy of intermediaries who are also auctioneers, determining
at each level of this hierarchy which intermediary to call for bids, and proving
the integrity of auctions at each level of the hierarchy. Solving these problems
requires new methods, concepts and tools from Economics, Finance and
Optimization, and Computer Science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ad exchanges will
impact nearly every user on the Internet. Progress on research challenges
described here has the potential to directly impact such systems and the
experience of nearly every user on the Internet. Further, facing the technical
challenges will bring together Computer Scientists and Economists, and also push
these disciplines to address very high performance challenges. For example,
auction and optimization solutions have to work in tens of milliseconds, the
time it takes for users to experience a web page access. This calls for new
algorithmic techniques beyond the current start of the art. Finally, a detailed
analysis of the role of information in ad exchanges-how much or little
information is relevant for the working of the marketplace-is of great interest
to Internet users and ultimately the society.
