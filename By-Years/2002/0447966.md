The overall goal of this project is to explore novel summarization models for
semi-structured data, in order to enable approximate query answering within
data-centric and document-centric databases. The following key problems are
investigated:

(a) Approximate query answering for data-centric XML databases. The project
explores summarization models that capture both the structural and the value-
based characteristics of a semi-structured data set. The developed models take
into account the heterogeneity of the value content and can be dynamically
maintained when the base data is modified.

(b) Document-centric XML summarization. A summarization model is explored that
enables the approximate computation of distance, under various metrics, between
a summarized document and an input query. The project investigates the
application of this model in approximate query answering for document retrieval
queries, as well as its integration within the query processing engine for the
fast computation of candidate matches.

(c) Relational synopses for join queries. A novel class of relational synopses
is explored that uses summarization models for semi-structured data in order to
approximate the statistical characteristics of a relational database.

The results of this research are applicable in areas that involve the
exploration of large semi-structured data sets, e.g., scientific databases or
digital libraries. To facilitate the evaluation of the proposed techniques in
these target areas, system prototypes will be developed and be made publicly
available. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students on data
reduction and approximation techniques, while the resulting publications,
collected data sets, and developed software will be made available on the web
for broader dissemination.
