Interdisciplinary (99) The faculties of the Chemical Engineering, Civil &
Environmental Engineering, and Biology Departments in an interdisciplinary
effort are applying engineering principles to living systems. The framework for
the project, modeled after a Michigan State University program, is the process
by which ethanol is produced from biomass by the action of microorganisms and/
or enzymes. This process is comprised of a series of unit operations that are
being developed into modules that emphasize the connection between engineering
systems and biological systems and require a multidisciplinary approach for
successful completion. Undergraduate students are being engaged in research
requiring teamwork among individuals from different disciplines, thereby
improving the understanding of fundamental physical, biological, and chemical
processes.
