This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project describes a compact and
low-cost optical based system for the rapid detection of chemicals. The detector
system relies on precision measurements of refractive index changes from
analytes absorbed within a thin film polymer coating. Significant advantages in
sensitivity and stability are obtained from the long coherence length of a laser
compared to existing methods. Feasibility will be demonstrated during the Phase
I effort with a proof of principle experiment designed to monitor trace amounts
of water vapor; Phase II will result in a fully designed and characterized
prototype system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A compact, high sensitivity monitor of
specific chemicals in both vapor and liquid having modest cost of material would
find wide spread application in the areas of environmental and industrial
detection. Large commercial markets have been identified for air and water
quality monitoring, the monitoring of volatile organic compounds, and trace
moisture &lt;br/&gt;
