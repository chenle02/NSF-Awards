Equipment is acquired, set up, and programmed to introduce an industrial quality
laboratory experience to students in the core course on electromagnetism. Three
stations (plus a utility station) are used for the conduct of measurements in
the three areas: optics, microwaves (frequency domain), and transient response.
All experiments are under computer control, and the students are responsible for
some of the programming, starting with a basic core set of programs. Students in
the core course are required to carry out four prescribed investigations plus
one of their own design. At the end of the course, they should be comfortable
with computer control of instruments, and with some fundamental properties of
electromagnetic signals in time and frequency domain. The principal equipment
consists of: (1) optical components, detectors, motion controllers, and fibers;
(2) microwave network analyzer, and (3) time-domain reflectometer. Computer
controls are used for all stations.
