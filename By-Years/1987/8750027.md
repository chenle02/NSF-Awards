A gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) is being used by the Chemistry
Department at Bates Colleges for undergraduate instruction beginning in the
sophomore year with organic chemistry and continuing in varying degrees in five
upper-level chemistry courses. The specific applications of GC/MS in these
courses has been designed to be similar to those encountered by industrial
chemists or by students undertaking graduate study.
