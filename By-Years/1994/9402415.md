9402415 Avrunin The major obstacle to developing automated tools for the
detection of faults in concurrent software systems is the state explosion
problem: the number of possible states of a concurrenet system is, in general,
exponential in the number of processes making up the system. but most real
concurrent software systems remain beyond the reach of existing approaches to
analysis. This project would continue the development of an approach to analysis
based on generating necessary conditions for the existence of certain executions
of a concurrent system and using integer programming to check the consistency of
those conditions. This approach does not require enumeration or explicit
representation of the states of the system being analyzed, and can be used to
check such properties as deadlock, starvation, mutual exlusion, and minimum and
maximum elapsed time between events. This project includes research intended to
take advantage of the compositional structure and symmetries of a concurrent
system and investigates connections with other automated analysis methods. ***
