This project will make direct measurements of the production rate of radiocarbon
in the atmosphere by exposing a known amount radiocarbon free air to atmospheric
radiation at a known altitude (near 16 km), latitude, and longitude using a
balloon platform. This is the first time that the production rate will be
directly measured in the atmosphere near the level of maximum production. The
measured rate will be compared directly with those previously calculated by
extrapolation from thermal neutron measurements. An accurate measurement of the
production rate is needed for using radiocarbon as a tracer of global hydroxyl
radical distribution, and for developing a better understanding of the global
carbon cycle.
