9725123 Chamberlain Fluid flow in an active orogen affects many properties of
the deforming rock mass by mechanically weakening or strengthening material and
by chemically interacting with the rock thru which they pass. This part of a
continuing project to understand the links between tectonism and fluid flow in
an active collisional setting and utilizes the central southern Alps of New
Zealand where extremely high uplift rates had produced intense fluid driving
forces. Evidence of fluid interactions along and basin ward from the fault will
be gathered and integrated with other geophysical data sets. Results are
expected to provide tests of recent fluid interaction models and to clarify the
extent and role of fluids in contractional deformation.
