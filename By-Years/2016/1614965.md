This project will analyze how cells degrade proteins anchored in membranes and
how this process affects plant development. The activities associated with this
project will provide training opportunities for undergraduates, a graduate
student, and a postdoctoral researcher in cell biology, biochemistry, light and
electron microscopy, and computational biology. It will also provide the
scientific community with tools and data to understand basic principles of plant
biology and the function of structures within cells called organelles. In
collaboration with the Medical Engineering Group and the Fabrication Laboratory
for 3D printing at the Wisconsin Discovery Center in Madison, three-dimensional
prints representing different organelles will be produced for outreach
activities with K-12 students in the Madison area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
ability of cells to perform basic cellular functions and to interact with each
other and with their environment relies on controlling the composition of their
plasma membrane, that is, the number and kind of receptors, transporters,
enzymes that are exposed to the cell surface. Plasma membrane proteins that need
to be degraded are first delivered to endosomes where are sorted into endosomal
lumenal vesicles for their degradation in lytic organelles, such as lysosomes
and vacuoles. Although essential for the life of all eukaryotic cells, how
endosomal vesicles form and how they sequester plasma membrane proteins is not
fully understood. This proposal aims to 1) analyze previously uncharacterized
features of the membrane geometry in plant endosomes by electron tomography and
computational simulations; 2) characterize a novel protein complex that could
mediate local modifications of membrane lipids to contribute to endosomal
maturation; 3) analyze the role of a novel connection between endosomal proteins
and the machinery that regulates the delivery of vesicles to the plasma
membrane.
