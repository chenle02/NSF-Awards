This research program focuses on the discovery and study of new metal-catalyzed
methods for the synthesis of polypeptides with unique stereochemistry and
structure. By identification of active intermediates, the mechanism of
ruthenium/rhodium/iridium amido-sulfonamide initiated alpha-amino acid
N-carboxyanhydride polymerizations will be elucidated. The origins of the
stereochemical selectivity of these polymerizations will be addressed through
studies of the dynamics of and monomer and ligand influences on the
stereochemistry of the chiral metal active species. These discoveries will then
guide the development of new initiators that will allow complete control of
polypeptide stereochemistry, including the formation of alternating D/L
stereocopolymers.

With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Timothy J. Deming, of the Departments of Chemistry and Materials Science at the
University of California, Santa Barbara, is studying new catalytic techniques
for polypeptide synthesis, offering promise for the selective and efficient
synthesis of complex polypeptides with unique molecular architectures.
Polypeptides represent one of the major classes of macromolecules utilized by
living organisms. These large molecules, comprised of many amino acids linked
together, display a wide range of important physical and chemical properties.
New approaches to the preparation of polypeptides offer promise for the
efficient synthesis of molecules anticipated to display new and/or unusual
properties, particularly in the development of new catalysts for selective
molecular transformations.
