The Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics (CATS) is concerned with
issues involving and affecting the statistical sciences, statistics education,
and uses of statistics. The Committee occupies a pivotal position in the
statistical community, providing expertise in methodology and policy
formulation. Members of CATS are appointed by the Chairman of the National
Research Council. This project is for core funding for CATS. CATS activities
supported exclusively by core funding are: one CATS meeting, CATS participation
in the annual Board on Mathematical Sciences Department Chairs Colloquium, the
initiation and administration of all CATS projects, and continuous oversight of
all CATS-related activities. These include giving recommendations on research
directions to federal agencies and reports on education in the statistical
sciences, interaction of the statistical sciences with other areas, the health
of the statistical sciences, and emerging research directions.
