The problems studied in this research project have as common theme the
qualitative study of critical points of functionals arising from geometry and of
their gradient flows. More specifically the principal investigator will continue
to study weak solutions to a family of nonlinear partial differential equations
(PDE) that are the sub-Riemannian analogues of the mean curvature flow PDE, the
minimal surface PDE, and the conformal n-Laplacian. The principal investigator
will also study a geometric function theory/nonlinear PDE approach to the
boundary regularity of biholomorphic mappings between strongly pseudoconvex sets
and pursue the study of extremal quasiconformal mappings in space.

Both in the natural sciences and in engineering it is important to study
equilibrium states of complex systems. Mathematics allows to model such states
as critical points of energy functionals and to study their properties by
analyzing certain differential equations associated to these functionals. The
properties of the solutions to these equations depend on a 'background geometry'
that models such real-life features as the non-homogeneity of materials, or the
presence of constraints (such as in the motion of robot arms, etc. etc. ...).
One of the most ubiquitous instances of such 'background geometry' is sub-
Riemannian geometry, modeling spaces where motion is possible only along a given
set of directions, as in applications to complex analysis, motion of robot arms
and control theory, quantum computing, satellites, quantum mechanics and in the
structural functions of the mammalian visual cortex. The PI will pursue this
work together with his students as well as his collaborators. The study of sub-
Riemannian geometry has been driven since its origins by "real world" problems
and the PI lectures to a wide variety of audiences from the post-graduate level
to the high school level.
