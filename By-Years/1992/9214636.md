This award provides one-half the funding necessary to support a major equipment
upgrade to an existing tandem accelerator system at Purdue University. Purdue
University is committed to providing the remaining funds needed for the project.
The Purdue accelerator facility is dedicated to the application of the
Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) technique in the geosciences. This equipment
upgrade will allow the facility to analyze for rare, long-lived, cosmogenic
isotopes such as chlorine-36, aluminum-26, iodine-129 and others with sufficient
accuracy for dating and tracer applications in a variety of fields including
ocean science, archaeology, solid earth sciences, atmospheric chemistry,
biological sciences, planetary sciences, and ecology.
