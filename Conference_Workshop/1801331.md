The Graduate Student Combinatorics Conference (GSCC) will be held April 6-8,
2017 at the University of Texas at Dallas. This will be the 14th annual GSCC,
which is traditionally organized by graduate students and has benefited greatly
from NSF support in the past. The GSCC focuses on graduate student research
presentations and will include keynote addresses by Catherine Yan (Texas A&M),
Karola Mészáros (Cornell), Fan Chung Graham (UCSD), and Po-shen Loh (Carnegie
Mellon). The GSCC provides a unique and invaluable opportunity for graduate
students in combinatorics to experience the benefits of taking part in a
research conference. Giving their own presentations allows graduate students to
develop their teaching and presentation skills, helping them succeed as junior
researchers. Combinatorics is a vibrant field of mathematics with applications
to many disciplines including algebra, geometry, topology, probability, computer
science, and analysis. This conference will inform junior investigators of
recent advances made in this lively and exciting field, and provide them with a
setting to present their own original research. The GSCC provides a great
opportunity for graduate students to network, and has led to joint research
projects among participants in the past. Website:

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
