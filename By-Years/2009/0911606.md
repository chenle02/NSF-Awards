The experiments will replicate and extend a key citation in the study of sexual
selection, Bateman (1948). This classic study of sex differences in mating
success variance (MSV) in Drosophila melanogaster used inbred individuals with
unique heritable mutant phenotypes to infer mating success. Mutant phenotypes
might have affected Bateman's results. Thus, in this research the investigators
will assign parentage using molecular DNA analyses of wild-type individuals in
three species, Drosophia melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, and D. hydei, which
differ in sperm size, sperm number per ejaculate, gamete size ratios, and female
remating latencies. The objectives are to verify that sex differences in MSVs in
D. melanogaster are similar to those Bateman found and to test the overlapping
predictions of more modern theories of the causes of sex differences in MSVs
through comparisons of three species that differ in factors widely-thought to
affect MSVs. The intellectual merit lies in the importance of sex differences in
MSV to sexual selection. Bateman's result that MSV is greater among males than
females is a central tenet of sexual selection, yet doubts about his results
remain because of the potential effects of deleterious mutant phenotypes. The
broader impacts include: (1) The PIs' will include undergraduate students in
their research. (2) The PIs will recruit interns from nearby historically black
colleges such as Spellman, Morehouse, and Clark-Atlanta. (3) The PI's will
improve the quality of K-12 education through sponsoring an outreach series on
biodiversity and animal behavior. (4) The PI's will recruit K-12 teachers to
participate in their research through the NSF-Research Experiences for Teachers
program. (5) The PIs will broadly disseminate the results of their research by
writing articles for the public.
