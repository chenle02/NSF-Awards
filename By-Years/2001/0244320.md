This project focuses on experiments in which microwave fields are used to
manipulate highly excited, or Rydberg, atoms. The objectives of the project are
to understand how atoms are ionized by microwave fields at frequencies that
range from the frequency of the Rydberg electrons orbital frequency to
frequencies as much as fifty times higher. The goal is to try to determine if
the electron orbit becomes synchronized with the microwave field if the
microwave frequency is at or very near the classical orbital frequency of the
Rydberg electron. If this is the case, this should provide an interesting
connection between quantum mechanics and classical physics. On the broader
impact, Rydberg atoms appear to be excellent systems for some applications, such
as far infrared detection and quantum computing.
