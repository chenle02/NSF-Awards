This project establishes a phonetics laboratory at Swarthmore College. The
laboratory is used for class work in linguistics courses on phonetics and
phonology, oral and written language, historical and comparative linguistics and
introduction to linguistics. Other departments use the laboratory for special
research projects. The new laboratory allows the objective identification of
sounds, quantifying of differences between sounds, and supports theoretical work
done in the classroom with technically verifiable work done in the laboratory.
It allows the study of speech synthesis and offers a new and extremely effective
introduction to the use of the scientific method. This last point is of
particular significance, since linguistics is in the social sciences division
and many students are naive of the scientific method and shy of technology.
Integrating science into linguistics courses provides an enjoyable and
relatively unthreatening introduction. The institution is matching the NSF grant
with an equal amount of funds.
