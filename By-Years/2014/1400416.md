For more than 40 years, electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) has played a central
role in the on-going research activities at the Carnegie Institution of
Washington. Carnegie staff, postdoctoral fellows and external collaborators
utilize EPMA for a wide range of scientific research, such as analyzing natural
and synthetic samples to understand the chemistry of Earth and the geological
processes that have formed it and related planetary materials. This award will
permit the acquisition of a state-of-the-art field emission (FE) electron
microprobe system to conduct automated, high resolution, quantitative elemental
microanalysis, multi-spectral imaging, and low-energy x-ray emission
measurements that will improve scientific throughput and enable future cutting-
edge research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system is designed for high
productivity and reliability, with easy operating procedures that enable precise
and sensitive in situ analyses by researchers of variable skill levels. It will
be housed in a user-friendly facility, with a dedicated facilities manager, that
will be utilized by staff, postdoctoral fellows, visiting scientists, graduate
students, and summer interns at Carnegie. The instrument will have significant
impact on the research programs in a number of fields including experimental
petrology and geophysics, high-pressure physics and mineral physics, inorganic
geochemistry, solar system origins, and astrobiology, thereby promoting
interdisciplinary collaborations.
