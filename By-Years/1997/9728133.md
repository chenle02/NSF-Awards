9728133 Klee The interactions of plants and disease-causing pathogens generally
fall into two types: compatible and incompatible. Incompatibility leads to
resistance while compatibility leads to disease. In the absence of a resistant
response, disease symptoms can spread leading to severe damage or death of the
plant. Using an ethylene-insensitive tomato mutant, we have demonstrated a
central role for this phytohormone in disease symptom development in compatible
tomato:pathogen interactions. We intend, through the use of mutants, to define
how ethylene controls disease development in compatible plant:pathogen
interactions. Experiments will define at a molecular genetic level the role of
ethylene in symptom development in the tomato:Xanthomonas interaction. Using
plants altered in ethylene synthesis or perception as well as plants deficient
in accumulation of salicylic acid (SA), the PIs will characterize the roles of
ethylene and SA in regulating early and advanced stages of disease. The PIs will
also examine a compatible interaction in Arabidopsis. An understanding of how
ethylene insensitivity attenuates symptom development to multiple pathogenic
organisms also offers the possibility of broad and durable host tolerance with
significant applications to agriculture.
