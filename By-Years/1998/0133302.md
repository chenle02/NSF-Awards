Increasingly, confidential information is placed on network-accessible
computers by organizations and individuals, yet neither the current practice nor
theories of computer security are adequate to ensure that this information
remains confidential. The lack of sound mechanisms for protecting confidential
information, especially in the presence of malicious code or hosts, creates
serious privacy, liability, and even national security concerns.

This research explores new security mechanisms that provide stronger, end-to-end
assurance that data remains confidential. The focus is on three important areas
where existing models are inadequate and existing enforcement methods are
impractical. First, confidentiality must be protected even in systems that
include both mutually distrusting principals and untrusted, possibly malicious
hosts. Second, concurrent and distributed systems create new challenges for
information flow control. Third, new techniques are needed for verifying that
binary code, including legacy code, protects confidential information.

The goal of this work is fast, practical, end-to-end assurance of
confidentiality for decentralized systems with mutual distrust. This kind of
assurance promises to significantly strengthen the security of the emerging
computing infrastructure.
