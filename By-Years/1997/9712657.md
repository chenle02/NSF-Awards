9712657 Kabanov This proposal will investigate complexes formed between nucleic
acids and cationic block copolymers and their potential use in delivering DNA
into cells. Both water soluble complexes (using polyethylene oxide/polyspermine
copolymers) and complexes soluble in non-polar media (polystyrene/poly N-ethyl
vinylpyridinium bromide) will be synthesized and investigated. Extensive
characterization of the complexes is planned via electron microscopy, circular
dichroism, light scattering, etc. The rate of DNA release from the complex under
several "cellular" mechanisms will also be studied. ***
