9615789 Lathrop This grant provides $83,279 as partial support of the costs of
developing an experimental dynamo via testing of a prototype apparatus which
thermally forces convection of liquid Sodium in an annulus in an attempt to
generate a magnetic field. In order to achieve large enough fluid velocities in
this apparatus, the titanium rotor which has been designed to handle large
stresses will need to be rotated at 25,000 rpm. Such high rotation rates are
necessary to overcome the scaling problems of an experimental apparatus designed
to model the Earth's geomagnetic field. The development of an experimental
dynamo has been a fundamental unsolved problem in geophysics and an unfulfilled
dream of international researchers for the last 40 years. The technical
difficulties of creating a laboratory sized system capable of generating a large
enough magnetic Reynolds number to simulate the Earth's geodynamo have been
daunting. This instrument, which has already been built and used for preliminary
tests will shed light on the physics of fluid dynamos and has the potential to
produce a magnetic field for the first time in a laboratory experiment. ***
