Objective: We propose to study and harness a new form of supercontinuum
generation to produce novel sources of broadband radiation with high stability
and/or low power generation requirements. Such sources would have a significant
impact on applications, including imaging, communications, and spectroscopy.

Intellectual Merit: Recent experiments have identified a new phenomenon known as
optical rogue waves, highly-rare, brief pulses of intense, broadband light
mathematically and physically analogous to infamous ocean waves,propagating
through optical fiber [Solli et al., Nature 450, 1054 (2007)]. Real-time capture
of these events has shown they follow extreme-value statistics. Subsequent work
has shown that optical rogue waves can be actively controlled to produce
enhanced broadband light sources through stimulated supercontinuum generation
[Solli et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 233902 (2008)].

Broader Impact: There is a practical and functional technology gap in available
supercontinuum sources, particularly at visible and near-IR wavelengths.
Existing sources either produce unstable supercontinuum or are difficult to
deploy outside of regulated laboratory environments. This research aims to
utilize stimulated supercontinuum generation, a new physical concept inspired by
nature, to produce high-quality, compact, and potentially low-cost white light
sources at visible/near-IR wavelengths. This research also seeks to apply
stimulated supercontinuum generation in silicon waveguides in order to overcome
physical effects that have significantly limited chip-scale spectral broadening.

This research effort involves cutting-edge optical and electronic experimental
work, simulations, and theoretical analysis. It will provide students and
postdoctoral scholars with versatile skills that are highly desirable in both
the industrial and academic workplaces.
