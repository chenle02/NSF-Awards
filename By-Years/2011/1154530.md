Through the College of Science Scholars Program, California State Polytechnic
University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona), an Hispanic Serving Institution, is
leveraging the infrastructure of its Science Educational Enhancement Services
(SEES) to increase the number of academically successful, financially
disadvantaged STEM students in the College of Science. By the end of the
project, Cal Poly Pomona will have awarded approximately 86 scholarships to
academically successful, financially disadvantaged junior/senior STEM students
with the majority of them having graduated with a B.S. degree and transitioned
into the workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SEES supportive community counsels
its members to effectively navigate the campus while providing opportunities for
academic support, career networking, and community outreach. Activities of the
College of Science Scholars Program include: &lt;br/&gt; - advising provided by
SEES faculty; &lt;br/&gt; - peer-led support through Academic Excellence
Workshops; &lt;br/&gt; - access to a study center for tutoring and computer
facilities; and&lt;br/&gt; - professional development and workforce links
through research apprenticeships, mentoring and cooperative education programs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through these strategic activities, scholarship recipients
are developing strong relationships with faculty and becoming efficient in their
time to graduation. When these scholars graduate and join the workforce, they
will be role models reflecting the highly diverse Cal Poly Pomona campus
(approximately 35% of the students at Cal Poly Pomona are members of populations
underrepresented in STEM fields) as well as exemplary representatives of
Southern California.
