The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project improves cultivation practices for shrimp aquaculture. Within the field
of fisheries and marine ecology, shrimp is often reduced to a prey species for
more commercially valuable stocks. The proposed technology improves financial
security for shrimp farmers, ensures food security, and reduces pressure on wild
stocks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project provides standardized real-
time estimates of shrimp biomass and behavior across regions. With robust
processing, this produces a well-integrated system for aquaculture monitoring.
While lab experiments are valued for understanding shrimp growth and development
in a controlled setting, they too are limited, with aquaculture research being
the least robust and available. The controlled setting that aquaculture offers
research is an untapped resource because the data are not standardized across
ponds, regions, or countries. By providing a mechanism for data standardization
the proposed platform contributes valuable data to the scientific community
working in wild fisheries and in aquaculture, and informs aquaculture practice
beyond research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
