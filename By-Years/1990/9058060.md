This a Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) project which relates to electric
power systems. The work deals with power system operation, control, and
efficient data processing. The main thrust is the validation of a security
assessment expert system for power system operations control. The system is
already in prototype form, and a detailed comparison of its performance will be
made in comparison with human expert methods. A second area of focus relates to
the use of the same or a similar expert system for the purpose of corrective
strategy generation. The function of this part of the expert system is the
duplication of human experts for the purpose of corrective strategy dispatch of
electric power systems. Throughout the project, there will be emphasis on
man/machine interfaces and suitable paradigms for engineering and scientific
visualization of the on-line controls.
