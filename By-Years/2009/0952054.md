In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms
Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Christopher Cramer of the
University of Minnesota and his research group will employ quantum chemical
computational methods to explore a number of important chemical processes,
including the activation of C-H bonds and molecular O2 and N2O, and water
splitting by various mono-and bimetallic catalyst systems. As part of the
investigation into these specific chemical systems, the Cramer team will also
compare the results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the
results of experiment and/or multireference wave function theory calculations.
The goal of this comparison is to validate the application of the simpler DFT
approach(es) to complex problems involving near degeneracies of frontier
orbitals. Finally, Prof. Cramer will continue work on the incorporation of
continuum solvation models into DFT and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to advancing our understanding of the specific
chemical systems mentioned above, Prof. Cramer's research program will advance
the fields of catalysis and computational chemistry, and possibly have
implications for energy conversion technology. The research program will also
provide a rich environment for the training of undergraduate and graduate
students, and outreach activities by Prof. Cramer and his group will introduce
the world of computational chemistry to audiences ranging from high school to
post-secondary levels. Finally, Prof. Cramer will include results from his
research in the next edition of his textbook, "Essentials of Computational
Chemistry," and will make any software resulting from this work available to
other researchers, thus broadening the impact of the project.
