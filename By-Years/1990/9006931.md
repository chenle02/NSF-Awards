Evidence to date suggests that exotic invariant continua play a determining
role in many dynamical systems. Kennedy will continue investigating how these
continua arise in dynamical systems and what role they play. Part of this
research involves teaming up with various researchers from dynamics in the hopes
that the combined expertise from dynamics and continuum topology will have a
better chance to solve the problems involved.
