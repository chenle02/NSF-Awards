Intellectual Merit: Diapycnal (mostly vertical) mixing plays a critical role in
determining the overall heat budget and water mass distribution of the global
ocean. Diapycnal diffusivities are best measured using specialized
microstructure sensors, which collect measurements with high vertical
resolution. In recent years a variety of fine-structure methods have emerged as
inexpensive alternatives to microstructure measurements. Fine-structure methods
take advantage of data from conductivity-temperature-depth instruments (CTDs),
lowered acoustic Doppler current profilers (LADCPs), and/or eXpendable CTDs
(XCTDs), all of which are routinely collected globally and through all seasons.
Finestructure methods thus appear to offer the possibility of inexpensively
mapping spatial and temporal variations in diffusivity on a global scale.
However, the error budgets associated with finestructure methods remain poorly
characterized. This proposed RAPID project is aimed at reducing the
uncertainties in fine-structure mixing estimates, by facilitating a detailed
inter-comparison of microstructure and fine-structure measurements. Thirty-six
XCTDs will be deployed during the January-February 2010 research cruise of the
Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing Experiment in the Southern Ocean (DIMES). The
project will also support analysis of the XCTD measurements using Thorpe scale
and strain fine-structure methods and comparison with microstructure estimates
and with similar shear-strain based fine-structure analyses planned for the
LADCP and CTD data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Results of this work
will contribute to a growing community effort to assess the uncertainties
associated with fine-structure methods for evaluating diapycnal mixing in the
ocean. These findings will play a critical role in determining whether fine-
structure methods can plausibly be used to map global variations in mixing.
Results should allow an assessment of the types of fine-structure methods that
are most effective. Since the project aims to place usable error bounds on fine-
structure based maps of global diffusivity, the findings from this project will
potentially have a profound impact on global predictive climate modeling
efforts. In addition, the project will contribute to the training of one
graduate student.
