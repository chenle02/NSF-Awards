9710044 McCorkle This project will analyze stable isotopes in live and core-top
(dead) benthic foraminifera, bottom waters, and interstitial waters from
material to be collected on cruises to the southeast Pacific (Chilean margin),
southeast Atlantic (Brazilian margin) and North Atlantic. Data from these
regions of varying productivity, bottom water chemistry and sedimentary
environment will permit the PI to examine factors which may control isotopic
variability of the shells, including organic flux, sediment oxidation state, and
calcite saturation state.
