This project is motivated by the growing demand for a middle-skill advanced
manufacturing technician workforce in the region, and will focus on developing
flexible career pathways with a particular emphasis on women and other rural
students. The project team will work to modularize existing curricula as well as
develop a core curriculum that will be used by advanced manufacturing technician
tracks. The Northeast Iowa Community College NICC and a number of industry
members and northeast Iowa secondary schools will collaborate closely in
completing the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will examine the skills
and body of knowledge required across advanced manufacturing technician
occupations. Project activities will include 1) an analysis of common curricula
in multiple technician programs, 2) training opportunities for secondary school
teachers and College faculty to better align curriculum along the K-14
experience, 3) development of distance learning options to expand access, 4) a
study of the efficacy of an open lab model that enables high school, college,
career pathway students, and industry professionals to work simultaneously, 5)
development of work experience options for technician students including
apprenticeships. The results of this project will build on a body of evidence
documenting the benefits of open lab structure, competency-based education, and
co-operative education. Project activities will align the efforts of secondary
educators, community college faculty, and industry needs.
