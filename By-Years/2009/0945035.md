This SBIR Phase I project will develop a technology to utilize carbon dioxide as
an environmentally benign herbicide that selectively acts on common lawn weeds.
This product would exploit the differences in temperature sensitivity between
weedy plants such as crabgrass and desirable plants such as fescue grass, which
is more cold tolerant. The Frostbite technology involves controlled expansion of
CO2 to generate controlled amounts of ice frost on target plants. The project
research plan involves evaluating the effectiveness of the technology against
weedy plants and optimization of the equipment for producing the dry ice spray.

The broader/commercial impact of the proposed project will be that the Frostbite
product would provide a safe, alternative lawn weed solution for homeowners,
landscapers, vineyard owners, organic farmers, and golf course workers. Adoption
of the optimized Frostbite product would have the potential to eliminate
concerns about soil and water contamination, cumulative herbicide exposure for
workers and the general population, and contamination tracked into homes related
to synthetic herbicide use.
