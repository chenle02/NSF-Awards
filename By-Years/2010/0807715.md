Morgan State University, an HBCU, will establish within the Physics Department
an undergraduate concentration area that focuses on geo-space science as a
career option. The project seeks to attract potential recruits to the physics
major while offering the geoscience community unconventional graduates with
quantitative training. The project has two thrusts: 1) scholarship support for
undergraduates doing geophysical research and 2) catalytic support to help
establish two new courses - Physical Geology and Planetary Science - which will
form the core of a set of pertinent electives. The course material will be
presented with strongly quantitative approaches to help train a diverse group of
scientists well prepared for wide ranging career options in geoscience fields.
The project is expected to establish a model for physical science and
engineering departments interested in attracting new students to the geosciences
at campuses that do not have the resources to establish a separate geoscience
department and degree program.
