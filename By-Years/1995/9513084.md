9513084 Olson This award supports the participation of 15 U.S. scientists in a
U.S.-Japan seminar entitled "Molecular Dynamics of Ligand Binding to Myoglobins
and Related Heme Proteins" to be held at Rice University in Houston, Texas on
March 2-5, 1997. The co-organizers are Professor John S. Olson from Rice
University and Professor Teizo Kitagawa from the Institute for Molecular
Science, Okazaki National Research Institutes, Japan. The specific aims of the
seminar are to: (1) summarize current successes in correlating computer
simulations with kinetic measurements of oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric
oxide binding to myoglobins and hemoglobins; (2) identify key problems
associated with extending computations and structure determinations to
physiologically important time scales (nano- to milliseconds); and (3) propose
new approaches to address these issues and their relationship to the design of
heme protein-based blood substitutes. The long-term goals are to create joint
research programs between a cross section of leading Japanese and American
scientists which will push further the limits of computational, protein
engineering, and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, and which will fulfill
the objectives of the U.S./Japan Program through the exchange and transfer of
scientific knowledge by international collaboration. ***
