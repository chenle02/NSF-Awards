Nickolay Gnedin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Gnedin is awarded funds at the
University of Colorado at Boulder to further develop new methods of modeling the
first reionization of the early universe. Current data on the cosmic background
radiation indicate that the gas content of the universe remained mostly neutral
from the time of recombination at a redshift of about 1000 to a time
corresponding to a redshift of about twenty. Observations of quasars at
redshifts of about six indicated that, at that time, the intergalactic medium
was highly ionized. Thus this "reionization", the shift of intergalactic gas
from mostly neutral to mostly ionized, must have happened sometime between the
times corresponding to redshifts of six and twenty. Dr. Gnedin will make
significant improvements on numerical methods of modeling radiative transfer
with the hope of achieving numerical convergence. These models will be able to
make quantitatively accurate predictions for the evolution of the intergalactic
medium for the first time. Dr. Gnedin will further compare the model results to
"Lyman Break Galaxies," some of the most primordial observed galaxies, in an
attempt to understand their formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Gnedin will
integrate his teaching and research by developing a new undergraduate course in
cosmology for non-science majors, and developing the cosmology portion of a web-
based course in general introductory astronomy. The web-based work will include
original simulations drawn from his research. He will also work with
undergraduate majors to develop a new planetarium show on
cosmology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
