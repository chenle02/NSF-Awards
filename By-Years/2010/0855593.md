The neutron is stable when confined inside a nucleus. Once removed however, it
is known to live for only about 15 minutes, decaying into a proton, electron,
and neutrino. Scientists would like a more accurate and reliable value of the
lifetime for understanding both the early days of the universe and the forces
that govern many of the processes that we observe each day. We are in the
process of measuring the lifetime of the neutron by confining them using
magnetic fields. Once confined, we are able to directly observe each neutron
decay, allowing us to measure the lifetime with improved accuracy.

This collaborative effort provides an excellent opportunity for both graduate
and undergraduate students to participate in a broad spectrum of research that
encompasses the areas of nuclear, low-temperature, atomic, and condensed matter
physics. Training future researchers in the field of neutron physics is also
essential to insure the ultimate success of new neutron facilities being
construted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the National Institute of
Standards and Technology. Many of the techniques developed will enable other
experiments that seek to improve our understanding of the Standard Model of
Physics, which describes all particles and their interactions in the world in
which we live.
