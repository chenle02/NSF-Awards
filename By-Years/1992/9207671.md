The proposed research will use comparative evidence from the ontogeny of
flowers to address phylogeny of legumes. Polarization methods will use outgroup
comparison. Preliminary trees based on 33 taxa representing major tribes of the
three subfamilies of Leguminosae and 30 traditional characters from mature
flower and vegetative structure were developed for comparative purposes. To
date, 17 qualitative ontogenetic characters with discrete character states have
been derived based on direct observation of floral ontogenies with SEM; most are
heterochronic. Preliminary results show some unexpected relationships among
tribes and subfamilies that need to be assessed in terms of characters used:
i.e., caesalpinioids Gleditsia and Ceratonia are a basal sister group to the
rest of the legumes; and Caesalpiniodeae appears non- monophyletic. The research
will also test the hypothesis that specialized character states are first
expressed late in floral ontogeny, using species of Sophora, a papilionoid with
diverse pollinators. In addition, presumably different development pathways
leading to convergent floral structure will be documented in three caesalpinioid
genera (Cassia s. str., Chamaecrista, Senna) that are strikingly alike in
specialized character states.
