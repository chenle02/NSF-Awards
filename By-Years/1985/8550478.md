This project will improve the subject matter and teaching background of high
school biology teachers. Beginning with the Winter Semester, 1986, and again
during the Fall Semester, 1986, In-Service Workshops will be conducted by
Brigham Young faculty members at two locations each semester. Thirty teachers
will participate each semester at each site. Fourteen topics chosen for
presentation have been selected by teachers in the school districts. Each period
will be devoted to lecture, laboratory work, and discussion of how the materials
can be used in the classroom.
