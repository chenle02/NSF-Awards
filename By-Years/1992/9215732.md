This research is intended to design and develop a high speed vision system for
precision inspection. It will consist of three hierarchial levels. The first
level will consist of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) for
performing the pattern matching operation. The second level of hierarchy will
consist of interface structures for efficient and concurrent data processing and
interface communications. The third level of the system will be designed and
implemented to perform the extension computation of pattern processing which is
done on a pixel by pixel basis. For this critical leve a special parallel
processing architecture will be researched. A proof of concept prototype will be
fabricated to verify the system. High speed precision vision inspection has a
very wide variety of uses in the manufacturing industry. They range from
inspection of labels in the food packaging industry to size information on
diesel injectors. The successful development of this system should impact the
productivity of a range of manufacturing enterprises.
