Previous field, petrologic and geochemical studies of the Eocene potassic mafic
igneous rocks of the Highwood Mountains province, Montana have established the
distribution f volcanic and intrusive rock types, the importance of magma
mixing, fractional crystallization and degassing processes i magma evolution,
and the existence of ancient enriched subcontinental lithosphere and Tertiary
subduction-related components in the mantle source regions of the parent magmas.
This project will amplify and extend this work by detailed elemental and
isotopic geochemical studies of primitive potassic to calcalkaline magmatic
rocks from throughout the Tertiary provinces of Montana. Important complementary
studies will focus on the petrology and geochemistry of lower crustal and upper
mantle xenoliths which have been collected from several provinces. From this
research it should be possible to map the extent of ancient enriched
subcontinental lithospheric mantle beneath the Montana-Wyoming province in
considerable detail, to determine directly the nature of the deep crust and
mantle lithosphere and their roles in magma genesis, and to critically evaluate
controversial tectonic models which involve shallow subduction in the
northwestern U.S. during the early Tertiary.
