This research concerns the design of multivariable controllers for systems that
can operate in a variety of different modes. Each mode of operation is assumed
to be described by a different mathematical model. Examples of such systems are
aircraft which go through a number of different flight regimes or a
manufacturing system which undergoes a component failure. Two approaches will be
investigated simultaneously; the first is to design a switching compensator
(i.e., changing the form of the compensator as the system changes its mode of
operation), while the second is to design a nonswitching compensator which
assures system stability for the various operating modes. The aim of this
project is to develop constructions and algorithms for stabilization, pole
placement, and tracking, etc., for certain classes of multimodal systems.
