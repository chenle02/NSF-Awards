Essentially all present-day traveltime tomographic inversions ignore diffractive
wavefront healing, and fail to account for the ability of a finite-frequency
seismic wave to "feel" 3D structure off of the unperturbed spherical-earth ray.
We used the support of NSF Grant EAR-9725496 to develop 3D banana-doughnut
traveltime sensitivity kernels, which correctly account for all such finite
frequency effects. We intend to continue these investigations under Grant
EAR-0105387, extending the theory to treat near-grazing and near-critical waves
that are not adequately modeled by the present formulation, and using our 3D
sensitivity kernels to invert the extensive global cross correlation traveltime
dataset collected over the past decade by Professor Guy Masters and his
collaborators at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. We shall also develop
and apply 2D variations in the phase velocity, 2D kernels that express the
sensitivity of a measured body-wave traveltime to topography on the core-mantle
boundary or the 410 km or 660 km discontinuities, 3D sensitivity kernels for
differential traveltime measurements made using seismic arrays, and 2D and 3D
sensitivity kernels for other seismic observables, including arrival angles and
amplitudes of both body and surface waves. Finally, we shall conduct an
extensive series of numerical validation and synthetic inversion studies, in
both pseudo-random media and realistic whole-mantle models, in order to
ascertain the degree of mantle roughness needed to give rise to significant
diffraction effects upon long-period seismic traveltimes.
