One of the most important processes in the evolution of flowering plants is
doubling of the chromosomes, or polyploidy. At least 50% of all plants and
nearly all of the major crop plants of the world are polyploid derivatives from
diploid, wild stocks. Knowledge of how the process of polyploidization works is
poor, as is understanding of the consequences with respect to the organization
and function of genes along the chromosomes. Dr. Jonathan Wendel of Iowa State
University is examining the problem of polyploidy using the cultivated cotton
plant and its wild relatives as a model system. Using modern molecular methods,
detailed genetic maps will be constructed of the chromosomes of both polyploid
and diploid species. The primary experiments involve isolating several hundred
pieces of DNA by restriction-site digests and ascertaining their relative
locations on individual chromosomes. Then, comparisons of gene arrangements
among species will reveal the extent to which particular pieces of DNA have
changed position on chromosomes and whether the DNA has undergone increase or
decrease in copy number. Such changes in DNA have been hypothesized to have
regulatory effects on the form and function of the organism. Dr. Wendel's
research will lay the basis for a genetic explanation of morphological
differences among plant species.
