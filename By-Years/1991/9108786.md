A series of Molecular Dynamics simulations on atomic arrays of several
different materials of up to one million atoms in order to determine critical
dislocation mobility parameters is proposed. These are the Peierls stress (the
stress required to initiate dislocation motion), and the temperature dependent
damping coefficient (obtained from the dislocation velocity as a function of
applied stress and temperature). These quantities are extremely difficult to
measure directly, or estimate by theoretical means, yet they are of considerable
importance in predicting and understanding the plastic response and fracture
behavior of materials. Computer simulation are ideally suited, now that reliable
interatomic interactions can be constructed for selected metal systems by means
of the Embedded Atom Method. This program would be the first serious attempt to
determine these quantities for specific metals by computer simulation methods.//
