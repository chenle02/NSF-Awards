In the last 50 years, computational linguistics research has touched barely 1%
of the world's languages. In 100 years, 90% of them will be extinct or nearly
so. What can computational linguistics offer to support the urgent task of
documenting and analyzing the world's endangered languages? Based on the
observation that bilingual parallel text is both the primary artifact collected
in documentary linguistics as well as the primary object of statistical
translation models, this project explores the use of machine translation to
accelerate the global language documentation effort. Specifically, it develops
novel ways to model any number of related languages simultaneously, pooling
information from all the languages to make stronger inferences about each. In
order to exploit language relationships, it explores methods that simultaneously
model phonological, morphological, lexical, and syntactic phenomena. In
addition, it develops algorithms to standardize highly variable transcription
practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These technologies, which will be field-tested
in the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea, are designed to enable speakers of
endangered languages who have no specialized linguistic training to create large
collections of translated oral literature, providing an authentic and
interpretable record of their language, serving current and future generations
of scholars, teachers, and learners. They will do so, moreover, at much less
cost than is needed to support the efforts to trained linguists and
ethnographers to create such collections.
