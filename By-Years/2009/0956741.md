This award from the Division of Materials Research provides support to Indiana
University to design and conduct research and development on four different
types of neutron spin manipulation devices that are required for advanced
polarized neutron instrumentation. Most of the design is based on computer
simulation of magnetic fields which interact with the neutrons. The principal
investigators will construct partial prototypes and test them using polarized
neutrons at the Low Energy Neutron Source (LENS) at Indiana University to reduce
technical risk for follow-on construction activities. The equipment will result
in qualitative and quantitative increases in scientific productivity, on at
least six existing or planned spectrometers at the country?s major neutron
sources. The broader impact of this proposal consists of providing neutron
scattering capabilities that will be available to all users of U.S. national
neutron facilities allowing them to obtain scientific information that is
currently inaccessible. The project provides opportunity for training of several
students who will contribute to the design, construction, and utilization of
next generation instruments for neutrons.
