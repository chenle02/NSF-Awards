This research by a Presidential Young Investigator deals with a theoretical
description of the spin coating process. Previously available models of this
important industrial process have been empirically based and are of limited
utility in predicting coating performance. The present investigation is to
provide a realistic and reliable model. Effects of inertia, surface tension,
centrifugal forces, and viscosity will be systematically investigated. The
effects of non-Newtonian fluid properties will also be included.
