The relationship between depth and chemistry is one of the most-studied aspects
of mid-ocean ridge basalt genesis, because such a relationship provides evidence
of the connection between physical processes in the mantle and the chemical
composition of the ocean crust. The mid-Atlantic ridge between the Kane and
Hayes fracture zones (24 - 33 N) has a change of 1500 meters in regional depth,
yet is erupting almost exclusively "normal MORB." Currently at Lamont more than
forty on and off-axis dredges from this regions exist, including twenty-nine
collected by the PI in January 1987 in a NSF funded project. Preliminary
microprobe data show that there are clearly defined, systematic variations in
major elements that are consistent with the global correlations between depth
and chemistry is shown by the PI and has associates. This region is ideal for
exploring the detailed systematic of depth/ chemistry relationships for normal
MORB in terms of major elements, trace elements and isotopes. It is proposed to
carry out precise analytical studies of major elements trace elements, highly
incompatible trace elements and isotopes from basalt glasses and whole rocks
this region to understand the complex problem of petrogensis of Mid Ocean Ridge
basalts.
