This project is to support a conference to develop and refine strategies for
strengthening the role of states in providing leadership in support of research.
The conference will be preceded by two preparatory stages. The first will be
obtaining and cataloging background information on what has been done in various
states to develop new initiatives for state support of water resources research.
In the second stage, detailed information will be compiled on three to five
approaches representative of candidate strategies for impovement. The conference
will then be used to analyze the approaches and refine candidate strategies to
facilitate greater state involvement in essential research.
