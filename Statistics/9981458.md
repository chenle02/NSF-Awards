Dennis 9981458 Understanding the fluctuations in animal numbers is a central
issue in population biology that has far-reaching impact on and implications for
problems ranging from food production to the conservation of species. Nonlinear
dynamics opens the way to a new phase of population research in which theory and
experimentation focus on phenomena such as cycles and quasi-periodicity, chaos
and strange attractors, multiple attractors and complicated basins of
attraction, saddle sets and their stable manifolds, and so on. This
interdisciplinary project, in which Robert Costantino, Jim Cushing, Brian
Dennis, Robert Desharnais, and Shandelle Henson collaborate, covers a spectrum
of activities essential to testing nonlinear population theory: the translation
of the biology into the language of mathematics and back again, the analysis of
deterministic and stochastic models, the development and application of
statistical techniques for the analysis of data, and the design and
implementation of biological experiments. A series of experiments with flour
beetles of the genus Tribolium provide rigorous experimental tests of nonlinear
phenomena. Topics include nonlinearity in the context of stochasticity, chaos
and population control, the impact of periodic environments on animal abundance,
demographic dynamics and natural selection, nonequilibrium species interactions,
and statistical questions concerning parameterization and validation of models.
With a sound understanding of the underlying dynamics of animal populations,
ecologists can anticipate the consequences of environmental degradation and
learn better ways to manage natural populations and control populations of
pests. For example, one of the experiments suggests that, by taking advantage of
the "sensitivity to initial conditions" that is the hallmark of a chaotic
system, managers can dramatically decrease pest population numbers without the
use of chemical pesticides by making small perturbations at critical times. The
marriage of ecological theory and experiments by the interdisciplinary research
team leads to new techniques for the application of mathematics to ecological
problems. The project is supported by the Applied Mathematics, Computational
Mathematics, and Statistics programs in MPS and the Population Biology and
Ecology programs in BIO.
