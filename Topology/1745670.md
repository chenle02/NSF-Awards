The aim of this Research Training Group project "RTG: Building Communities in
the Mathematical Sciences at Rice University" is to continue, enhance, broaden
and diversify the core ideas and values that were articulated by its founder
Edgar Odell Lovett; namely that it be a, "school of the highest grade looking,
in its educational programme, as much to investigation as to instruction." In
the context of the Mathematics Department, and more precisely, this Research
Training Group project, the Principal Investigators (who have a broad expertise
in Geometry and its connections with Analysis and Partial Differential
Equations, Geometric Analysis, Geometric Topology, and Algebraic Number Theory)
together with other faculty members, postdocs, graduate and undergraduate
students intend to focus on building communities which will impact, at all
stages of the academic pipeline, the number and readiness of people entering the
U.S. mathematical workforce (both academic and industrial), and bolstering in
particular the representation of women and underrepresented minorities in the
mathematical sciences. Moreover, structures put in place will see a vertical
community of women mathematicians, a vertical community of mathematicians from
low-income households and underrepresented minority groups, a community of young
scholars who will pursue research careers in industry, and a horizontal
community of strong junior and senior math majors.

The RTG Senior Faculty will use their research expertise and previous experience
to mentor research of junior mathematicians centered on Geometry. Reflecting the
strongly collaborative relationship of the team, contributions will come from
perspectives not only within but also across the disciplines of Analysis and
PDE, Geometric Analysis, Geometric Topology, Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic
Number Theory. To that end, vertical integration of postdocs and students will
allow collaborative research projects, and this will be aided by developing an
expository writing seminar in the mathematical sciences for freshmen as an
alternative entry point into mathematical thinking, as well as organize
conferences of RTG programs to share ideas, the highlights of which will be
stored in a public written record. The log-cabin conferences and undergraduate
conferences will give participants the opportunity to disseminate their research
and grow collaborative networks. There will be opportunities for summer
internships in local industries.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
