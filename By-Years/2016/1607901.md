The project focuses on studying large time and scale behavior for a variety of
probabilistic systems. Many of those were designed to model different natural
processes such as bacterial growth, crystal melting, very cold gases at atomic
levels, etc. An accurate analysis at large times or scales is typically very
difficult, and the project concentrates on models with additional algebraic
structure that originate in seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics. This
structure helps to discover new phenomena that tend to be universal (i.e.,
present in a very wide range of systems). As a result, using sophisticated
mathematical tools, the principal investigator seeks to find new universal laws
that play the role of the famous and familiar bell curve law and that can often
be observed through physical and numerical experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of the emerging field of integrable probability is to identify and analyze
exactly solvable probabilistic models. The models and results are often easy to
describe, yet difficult to find, and they carry essential information about
broad universality classes of stochastic processes. The project aims at
developing a bridge between deep algebraic and representation theoretic
structures on one end, and probabilistic systems on the other end, that would
allow to utilize the former in order to discover and study the latter. The
framework of Macdonald processes introduced and developed in the last five years
has been quite successful on this path, and it continues to grow. Known
applications include interacting particle systems, random growing interfaces in
(1+1) and (2+1) dimensions, random matrices and log-gases, and directed polymers
in random media. The framework is now poised to expand to include the theory of
solvable lattice models of statistical mechanics, offering completely new
perspective and new results in this well-established domain.
