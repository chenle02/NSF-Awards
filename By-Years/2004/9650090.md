This project makes use of image capture apparatus, personal computers, and
interactive software for the enhancement of the laboratory classes in the
department of biological sciences. The classes targeted in this project have an
annual enrollment in excess of 1,100 students and encompass the entire
biological sciences laboratory curriculum. Previously, the department has been
clearly deficient in computer-linked audiovisual instruction technology. The
faculty is updating this area of their laboratory teaching by using image
capture apparatus to prepare a series of tutorials that combine text, visual,
and audio resources into `show presentations` to be conveyed to students over a
local area network (LAN). A major difficulty experienced by large numbers of
students is their inability to derive a three-dimensional image from several
two-dimensional images such as consecutive serial sections through an organ or
tissue. The advent of three-dimensional imaging software offers a means by which
a three-dimensional image can be reconstructed from two-dimensional images. The
department intends to use such tools in the upper-level laboratory classes to
produce reconstructions of specimens to convey dynamic processes such as growth
and differentiation. Material to be studied in this endeavor includes apical
meristems, leaf primordia, and selected areas of developing chick embryos. These
presentations can then be used in the teaching of the introductory laboratory
classes. The project makes available to the students some educational software
that enables students taking genetics, ecology, and physiology to advance and
test hypotheses by simulating situations that are impossible to represent in
teaching laboratories and to generate models to examine complex biological
interactions in the environment.
