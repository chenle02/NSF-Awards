9417921 Onstott This award provides partial (52%) funding for the purchase of
equipment components to upgrade a Nd-YAG laser system installed and operated in
the Department of Geological and Geophysical Sciences at Princeton University.
The institution is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary to carry
out the project. The upgrade will allow the laser, which normally emits
radiation in the infra-red range to quadruple its frequency into the ultraviolet
range. The upgrade will improve the performance of the laser in applications
where it is used as a microprobe sampling device for argon-argon dating of
minerals. ***
