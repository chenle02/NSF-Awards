Title: Two New Laser Pulse-Measurement Techniques for Fiber Optics: Measuring
Ultraweak Ultrashort Pulses and Spatio-Temporally Complex Multi-Spatial-Mode
Pulses

Non-Technical Description: This project will involve developing two laser pulse-
measurement techniques to solve two important unsolved problems in fiber optics
and fiber lasers. The first will solve the long-standing problem of the
development of an ultrasensitive pulse-measurement technique for very low-energy
and relatively long laser pulses-pulses with very low intensities. Such pulses
occur in essentially all telecommunications environments, but also in many other
fields. The second measurement technique is for the fiber-mode-dispersion
problem: different spatial modes propagate at different velocities in a fiber
and so require a complete spatiotemporal light-measurement technique. The
proposed technique simultaneously generates many different-color holograms on a
single camera frame and will also be simple, fast, and convenient.

Technical Description: Current pulse-measurement techniques must use a thin
nonlinear-optical crystal, whose output scales as the square of the intensity
and crystal thickness and so yields a weak output beam. The first proposed
technique will instead use a very thick nonlinear-optical crystal, much longer
than is possible in other techniques, in a novel manner to yield much higher
efficiency. This crystal also simultaneously spectrally resolves the generated
pulse. Collinear, orthogonally polarized beams and a Type II crystal will also
be required. The second proposed technique generates multiple holograms
simultaneously, one for each wavelength in the pulse. Because a hologram using
single-wavelength light can yield the complete spatial electric field of a beam,
generating many holograms, one for each wavelength, coupled with a complete
measurement of the reference pulse, yields the complete spatio-spectral and
spatio-temporal electric field of even complex multi-mode light. Even better, it
can do so using only a single camera frame. Additional frames using additional
delays between the unknown and reference pulses can extend the range to
arbitrarily large delays and numbers of modes. Both techniques will be very
inexpensive, compact, experimentally simple to build and use, and easily
constructed from off-the-shelf components.
