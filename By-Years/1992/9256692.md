Professor David Allara is jointly funded by the Chemistry Division and the
Graduate Education and Research Division of NSF for a Graduate Research
Traineeship Program which will involve five graduate students in a core area of
molecular surface chemistry. This program will: 1) match the expertise of the
core faculty in the areas of advanced surface characterization methods for
polymer and biological interfaces, and computational approaches to surfaces; 2)
fill a recognized educational need in an area of demonstrated national
importance; and 3) provide a unique educational environment for graduate
training in the core area. An important aspect of the program includes the
creation of a central instrumentation facility which will enable students to
gain familiarity with state-of-the-art research equipment. Students will rotate
between labs to gain experience in multiple experimental approaches to the core
area. %%% Molecular surface chemistry has emerged as a technical area of
national importance which has a wide ranging impact on a variety of areas from
biology to materials science. It is of fundamental importance in establishing a
molecular level understanding of catalysis essential to many industrial
processes. There is clearly a need for scientists who are trained in this field
of science, and the support provided through this graduate traineeship grant
coupled with the expertise found in the Chemistry Department at Pennsylvania
State University will help to fulfill that need.
