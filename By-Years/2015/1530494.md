This research studies the extent to which environmental regulation moves
economic activity and associated pollution from regulated to unregulated regions
and leads to scrap of economically valuable assets. The project also creates a
public good for research by compiling and making publicly available an unusually
large dataset recording smog check tests of individual vehicles from many of the
states which operate "smog check" inspection and maintenance programs and which
have available records.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential existence of
"leakage" of pollution from regulated to unregulated areas is a widely-bemoaned
consequence of having regulation cover some regions and not others. Leakage
suggests that regulation is merely relocating pollution rather than reducing
economy-wide emissions. This research analyzes leakage in an important and
understudied setting, passenger transportation. Passenger vehicles contribute a
substantial share of total U.S. pollution emissions but efficient and effective
regulation of emissions from passenger transportation has proven difficult. The
analysis studies how emissions inspection and maintenance programs - the
centerpiece of the Clean Air Act's regulation for transportation - affect both
the trade of dirty vehicles from regulated to unregulated counties and vehicle
scrap decisions. The analysis also quantifies the extent to which vehicle trade
caused by smog check regulations moves emissions to regions where pollution has
relatively lower environmental damages. The research design exploits variation
in vehicle inspection stringency mandated by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.
The project data allow the researchers to track where all used vehicles are
traded within the entire United States at different points in time. The results
will inform scholars and policymakers about the importance of emissions leakage
in the regulation of mobile source air pollutants and the potential consequences
of administering regulation at local versus state or federal levels.
