The Center for Science Excellence Program (CSE) of Contra Costa College is a
strong program that helps science, mathematics and engineering students from
traditionally underrepresented populations successfully transfer from two-year
to four-year colleges. Contra Costa College is a two-year community college in
an urban, disadvantaged area. The goal of the Center for Science Excellence
program is for CCC students to transfer to four-year colleges and universities
as science, mathematics or engineering majors. In fact, 80% of CSE's first class
of has done so. The program has served 350 students since its inception six
years ago.&lt;br/&gt;The program provides multi-faceted mentoring for students,
which is the heart of the program. The mentors are experienced scientists. Their
mentoring activities include a wide range of academic tutoring, problem-solving
workplace scenarios, mock interviews, and so on. Mentors have regular meetings
together to share experiences and improve their mentoring methods. Several of
the mentors work in area institutions such as Lawrence Livermore and Sandia
National Laboratories, and students often visit these places and/or engage in
internships. As one professor said "the mentoring is consistent and regular
rather than casual." &lt;br/&gt;
