The objectives of this research are to validate current and proposed composite
micromechanical models by direct experimental measurements and to determine the
resulting stress state near damaged regions in materials subjected to tensile,
compressive, and bending loads. This will be accomplished with a unique test
methodology which employs a geometrically scaled up version of an polymeric
composite containing embedded sensors. These sensors provide a direct and
systematic approach to measure strain redistribution in a material and provides
previously unobtainable baseline data which are essential in validating existing
models and developing new ones.
