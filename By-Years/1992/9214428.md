This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Nebraska acquire an entire new
integrated single crystal x-ray diffractometer and structure analysis system,
with rotating anode generator and low temperature capabilities. Among the areas
of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are the following:
1. Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction Studies of Organic Materials a. Tracking
Chemical Reactions in the Solid State b. Organic Alloys - Mixed Polycyclic
Aromatic Hydrocarbon Crystals 2. Molecular Recognition Studies in the Solid
State 3. Bio-inorganic Model Systems a. Inorganic Complexes as Models of
Nitrogen Fixation b. Inorganic Complexes as Models of Hydrogenase and Carbon
Monoxide Dehydrogenase 4. Macromolecular Systems a. Primase Structure and
Function b. Photosystem I (PSI) c. Phototransformation of Phytochrome d.
Calmodulin-Peptide Binding Studies e. Free Metal Binding Monoclonal Antibodies
%%% Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the most powerful analytical method
for structure determination of solids. In synthetic inorganic, organic,
bioinorganic and organometallic chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is
an invaluable tool to characterize molecular structure. The information gained
from the knowledge of the intermolecular composition and structure helps to
develop new reactions of potentially general interest in catalysis or organic
synthesis.
