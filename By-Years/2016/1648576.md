The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to allow consumers to buy vehicles
enhanced by Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) that are more robust and
more accurate. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems in general, and fully
autonomous vehicles in particular, promise a number of advantages, such as: (1)
reducing the number of traffic fatalities in the US and abroad, (2) enabling
humans to spend less time driving and more time on other activities, and (3)
reducing fossil-fuel emissions. Practical implementations of Advanced Driver
Assistance Systems require a few key elements: sensors, perception systems,
motion planning systems, and control/actuation systems. Based on extensive
discussions with key individuals at automakers and automotive suppliers,
developing robust and accurate perception systems is the biggest obstacle toward
developing mass-producible autonomous road vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create perception
systems that utilize the rapidly evolving technologies of deep learning for
computer vision. Specifically, the company will utilize deep learning to provide
perceptual systems that are: 1) more robust in the presence of diverse and
rapidly evolving sensor configurations; 2) more accurate due to the early fusion
of sensor data; and 3) more accurate due to the application of state-of-the-art
deep learning algorithms for computer vision. The company is already engaged in
developing partnerships with automotive OEMs and semiconductor suppliers that
will enable it to deliver proofs-of-concept of its unique approach.
