DMS-0101066 Alejandro Adem This award provides partial support for participants
to attend a Workshop on Mathematical Aspects of Orbifold String Theory to be
held at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, May 4 through May 7, 2001. The
workshop will bring together groups of mathematicians and physicists to identify
and outline emerging problems associated with diverse mathematical developments
arising in orbifold string theory. In particular this event will foster
interdisciplinary research involving mathematical physics, algebraic geometry,
differential geometry, algebraic topology and representation theory. Recent
Ph.D.'s and graduate students are especially encouraged to attend and apply for
support. Further information, including invited speakers, schedule of talks,
housing information and a registration form is available at
