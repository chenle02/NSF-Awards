Inspired by the iconic example of DNA, which is composed of two strands of
natural polymers that are held together by weak forces and can be separated when
desired, Professor Smith of San Diego State University explores novel approaches
to controlling the reversible assembly and separation of synthetic polymer
strands. Such polymeric materials offer the potential for correction of defects
and stimuli-responsive properties. In addition to the potential for significant
impact in responsive materials, supramolecular polymers and switches, this
research program provides excellent education and training opportunities to a
diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom are from
groups under-represented in science. This research project encourages students
to decipher what is happening at the molecular level - sharpening their chemical
reasoning and problem solving abilities. These abilities are valuable in their
future careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this project is to
develop the chemistry of redox-active, linear hydrogen-bond dimers such that
binding strength can be strongly, but reversibly, perturbed by electrochemical
reduction/oxidation. This research program is broken into three specific aims.
Aim 1 is to establish the significance of two electrons and one proton (H+)
verse one electron transfer for strongly perturbing hydrogen bonding by
comparing the voltammetric behavior of these two types of systems. Aim 2 is to
develop new redox-active hydrogen bond dimers in which proton transfer across a
hydrogen bond is purposely used to amplify the effect of electron transfer in
such a way that binding strength is either greatly increased or decreased.
Finally, in Aim 3, the research team explores the use of the redox-active arrays
developed to create redox-responsive, supramolecular, polymeric systems.
