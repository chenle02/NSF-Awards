The objectives of this projects are to strengthen undergraduate instruction in
NMR with the use of a Fourier Transform NMR system. Laboratory experiments are
conducted that illustrate multinuclear resonance, spin-spin coupling
interactions between heteronuclei, relaxation phenomena, and variable
temperature studies. The courses in which these experiments are conducted are
the organic, instrumental analysis, physical measurements, advanced synthesis
techniques, biochemistry, natural products and independent study courses.
Computerized data acquisition and the Fourier Transform technique is also
introduced. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of
funds.
