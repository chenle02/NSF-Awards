The demand for high-speed computation in many digital signal processing (DSP)
and scientific application and the availability of low cost, high speed, high
density VLSI technology have provided a new dimension in implementing
architectures, particularly the evolvement of algorithm- based application-
specific architectures. Systolic array is one class of such architectures that
exploits the strength of VLSI and is particularly suitable for implementing many
DSP algorithms which are well-structured and locally recursive. As demand in
speed and application rises, many systolic arrays have become more complex in
terms of cell structure, interconnection topology, and data flow. Complete,
precise, and formal description of architectures has become vital for
unambiguous and complete communication among designers and implementers, as well
as for formal verification of design correctness. The main objective of the
research is to fully develop a solid formalism and apply it to systolic array
level specification and design verification: (1) The formalism must provide
simple, and yet complete and precise description (specification) of any systolic
structure and behavior; (2) the formalism and related techniques developed must
exploit unique attributes of systolic arrays ( synchrony, modularity,
regularity, spatial and temporal locality, pipelinability, repeatability, and
parallel processing ability) to produce notations and verification procedures
that are simple, elegant, and efficient; (3) the constructs and operators
involved should preferably be able to be unified with one useful lower level
formalism for coherent multilevel reasoning; (4) the techniques should be
automated and developed into a CAD tool eventually; (5) the formalism must be
further expanded for synthesis description and design debugging. The proposed
research will be carried out through rigorous and comprehensive survey,
theoretical analysis, design, and implementation.
