Fourteen mathematics faculty members from four Pennsylvania colleges and
universities will develop a lean and lively syllabus for a freshman science and
engineering calculus sequence. In consultation with other mathematicians,
scientists and engineers, a core of essential material will be determined.
Existing software, computer technology and placement tests will be evaluated,
and modified as needed. A test with related software and supplements for
instructors which covers the central core of materials will be produced. In the
Fall of 1988, several aspects of the experimental syllabus will be taught by the
instructors. Each participant will experiment with only a small part of the
curriculum. In this way several content areas and approaches can be tested,
while insuring that students are exposed to nearly all of the traditional
calculus. Penn State is cost-sharing over twenty-five percent of the project's
cost.
