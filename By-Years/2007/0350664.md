The growing use of labor and employment law in China provides an excellent
window on questions of legal mobilization. This project studies the legal
mobilization of Chinese workers using diverse research methods in order to
capture both the general state of legal knowledge, attitudes and practice among
China's working population and the micro-level processes and outcomes of the
labor dispute resolution system. A "knowledge, attitude, and practice" survey
regarding labor law will be conducted in five Chinese cities. This survey will
provide much needed information on the demographic characteristics of the
legally mobilized as well as provide opportunity for cross-regional comparisons.
A more focused study on the labor dispute resolution system will examine
patterns of dispute resolution in three cities. This research will combine case
analysis with in-depth interviewing of disputants. The project also informs
debates in the United States, including the connection between legal development
and democratization.
