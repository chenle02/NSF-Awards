The geological discovery of remarkable hot-water plumes, the hydrothermal
vents, in the sea floor along oceanic ridges, has been accompanied by remarkable
biological discoveries about the life forms surrounding those vents. In certain
locations in the Atlantic, swarms of a new kind of shrimp have been found that
lack normal eyes, and were presumed blind, but have a reflective patch which may
be a novel kind of eye. These shrimp seem to be the most active large
invertebrates known to live on the deep seafloor, and live where the only
illumination may be the dim far-red to infra-red from the extremely hot (350 deg
C) water jets from the vents. This study, part of a U.S./French collaboration
using deep-sea submersibles, will see whether the eyelike patch may be a
specially evolved visual organ that allows them to stay near to the vents where
they feed, but avoid the lethal temperature of the vent itself, in an
environment far too dim for normal vision. Techniques to be used will include
microscopy on the fine structure of the patch and its connections to the brain;
biochemistry on possible pigment or neurotransmitter molecules; and
electrophysiolgy on the light sensitivity. Results from this novel study will
have impact on both visual neuroscience and biological oceanography, and
possibly will define a new form of vision.
