9350003 Rutherford The American Association for the Advancement of Science
(AAAS) is continuing its program of systemic reform in the teaching and learning
of science, mathematics and technology. Phase I, which started in 1985 and ended
in 1989 with the publication of Science for All Americans (SFAA), described what
a scientifically literate person should know, particularly in science. In
addition to discipline specific content, cross-cutting themes and habits of mind
were described. Phase II is to provide an entirely new set of reform tools for
educators to use to redesign curricula and schools to implement SFAA. Six
school-based sites are to develop curriculum models based on inquiry,
explanation, design and issues which deliver the science of SFAA and to develop
blocks of curriculum (about 0.25 of a year long). Phase II is also to provide a
Framework for Curriculum Design to be used by curriculum designers, school
districts, test developers, teacher educators, describes how to target desired
learning outcomes in terms of inputs, constraints, options and costs in a
variety of approaches to implementing SFAA. The fourth part of Phase II is a
series of Blueprints which recommend changes that need to be made in order for
the curriculum and teaching reforms of Project 2061 to take hold and survive in
the school setting. These Blueprints include topics such as Teacher Education,
Assessment, Materials and Technology, Curriculum Connections, School
Organization, Parents and Community, Higher Education, Business and Industry,
Educational Research, Equity, Educational Policy, and Finance. Other aspects of
the project are funded by others. ***
