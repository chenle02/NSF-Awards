This project at The College of New Jersey (TCNJ) improves mentoring and student
support structures within the Departments of Computer Science, and Mathematics
and Statistics. Dissemination of these results both within TCNJ and in the
respective disciplines is leading to improved advising and mentoring practices
by other departments and institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project forms
the basis of a sustainable initiative to recruit, retain and graduate more
students in computer science and mathematics at TCNJ. All students in the
program engage in research, belong to a learning community, and are focused on
computational science. These experiences form a common theme for the students in
the program. Students are organized into project teams that work on research
problems as part of their coursework from the start of their college career. The
projects are structured to create a sustainable learning community that improves
students' self-efficacy. The project provides significant advising, mentoring,
and tutoring services that supplement those already provided by the college. The
project funds approximately 27 scholarships per year for computer science and
mathematics students at TCNJ.
