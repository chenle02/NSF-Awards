Recently developed epitaxial growth techniques are used to fabricate new
magnetic semiconductor heterostructures based on zinc-blend phases of the
mangenese chalcogenides MnTe and MnSe, and related alloys containing cadmium and
zinc. The magnetic dilution, and the number of epilayers present. The magnetic
interactions lead to new magnetic structures which are being investigated by
neutron diffraction, the primary experimental tool of this project. The effects
of strain on magnetic phase diagrams will be studied systematically in order to
determine the regions of stability of new phases of antiferromagnetic
heterostructures. The magnetostriction in the materials is of potential
technological significance.
