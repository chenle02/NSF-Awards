Three projects are planned, combining the numerical solution of partial
differential equations with bifurcation-theoretic analysis. First, a simplified
model of the Belousov-Zhabotinski reaction, designed for computational speed, is
to be studied. Second, a new numerical method has been developed for temporal
integration of large stiff systems. This method achieves stability without
matrix inversion by instead exponentiating a small (Krylov) matrix. The method
will be modified to solve the Navier-Stokes equations and its properties will be
analyzed theoretically. Third, an existing numerical code which solves the
Boussinesq equations of Rayleigh-Benard convection in a cylindrical geometry,
will be used to study the breaking of axisymmetry, the effects of rapid
rotation, and the validity of two-dimensional model equations for pattern
formation. Numerical solutions of partial differential equations are important
both in their own right and in applications to a wide variety of physical
science and engineering applications.
