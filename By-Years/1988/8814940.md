In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Subprogram of the
Physical Chemistry Program, Stell will study and develop theories using
statistical mechanical models. The emphasis will be on results that can be
obtained in analytic or quasi-analytic forms. Specific topics include (i)
dielectric and optical theory, (ii) transport theory, (iii) percolation and
gelation theory, (iv) development of predictive theories of n-particle
distribution functions, (v) theories of charge and density profiles in pores and
in fluids next to membrane and vesicle surfaces, (vi) microscopic models of
microemulsions, (vii) models of associating particles.
