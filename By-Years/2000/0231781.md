This research is intended to produce tools to assess potential regional effects
of global anthropogenic climate change on the structure of North American daily
hydrology in different seasons. The PIs will apply climate prediction
methodology to forecast the probabilities of hydrological weather extremes. A
new comprehensive statistical framework will be developed for the description of
daily precipitation and streamflow data. Using this framework, the PIs will
examine variability and predictability of daily hydrological extremes. They will
apply statistical methods designed for data with heavy-tailed distributions
(distributions with relatively large numbers of extreme events that can't be
accounted for by exponentially decaying tails of traditional Probability Density
Functions (PDFs). They will then examine the influence of climate forcing in
space and time on the shape of seasonal distributions of daily hydrology. The
parameters describing the PDF's shape will become predictands from which
statistical information, e.g., frequencies of extreme events, can be derived.

This research has broader impacts including graduate student education and
research results applied to the important societal issue of extreme hydrologic
events in the context of a changing climate.
