Abstract:

Politano, Michael "Theoretical Studies of Cataclysmic Variables" AST-0098742

Cataclysmic variable stars through their binary nature have long been recognized
as excellent astrophysical laboratories for studying the behavior of matter
under conditions not reproducible here on Earth. Examples include accretion
processes, thermonuclear runaways and the physics of degenerate matter. During
the period of this award, the PI will improve our understanding of the
characteristics of cataclysmic variables. Specifically, he is planning a
systematic study of the role of common envelope efficiency and its effect on key
features of the cataclysmic variable population. In particular, the formation of
cataclysmic binaries with one component being an ONeMg white dwarf will be
studied. Attention will also be paid to the formation of those with brown dwarf
secondary stars and their subsequent evolution. ***
