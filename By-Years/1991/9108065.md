With National Science Foundation support, Drs. James O'Connell and Karen Lupo
will study the anatomical distribution of meat and its nutritional value in a
variety of East African wild game species. Working in close collaboration with
the Kenyan government, they will be given access to the carcasses of ca. five
species of game culled by the Kenyan Wildlife Service. They will transport and
have the carcasses butchered in a traditional manner and then determine the
amounts of meat and marrow from different anatomical portions. Nutritional
analyses will also be conducted and on this basis the relative "value" of each
portion can be determined. The costs involved in processing can also be measured
and a cost/benefit ratio established. Animal bones which represent the remains
of meals are often recovered from prehistoric African sites and on this basis
archaeologists attempt to reconstruct prehistoric behavior patterns. Often
unexpected and non-random distributions of body parts are discovered at sites
and these can be difficult to explain. In an attempt to solve this apparent
puzzle, Dr. O'Connell and his colleagues have studied the Hadza, a present- day
group of East African hunters and gatherers and again the results are surprising
because they do not conform to a simple least effort model. However, studies
which involve controlled butchering have never been conducted on wild African
species and hopefully the utility information collected will shed new light on
this question. This research is important for several reasons. Because faunal
remains are recovered from many archaeological sites and constitute a major data
source, many archaeologists focus on the analysis of such material. The
information collected by Drs. O'Connell and Lupo will provide valuable data
which will be widely used in many archaeological contexts. The goal is to
understand human subsistence strategies and how these developed over time.
