The principal investigator will study construction of constant scalar curvature
Kaehler manifolds of complex dimension 2 by two different methods. The first of
these involves a generalized Gibbon-Hawking ansatz, while the second uses the
Banach space inverse function theorem applied to Kaehler potentials with point
singularities of conormal type. He will also study global deformations of
complete non-compact Riemannian manifolds with quaternionic holonomy. Lastly, he
will investigate the global structure of the universal curve for Riemann
surfaces with spin structure. In this project, the principal investigator will
analyze complex manifolds which relate to twistor and string theory. These
mathematical theories have been used to explain some of the behavior of
subatomic particles. Manifolds are mathematical objects which include regular
curves and surfaces as examples. Both of these examples are based on multiple
copies of the real numbers. In this study, manifolds which are based on copies
of the complex numbers, instead of the real numbers, will be used to analyze
several questions arising from physics.
