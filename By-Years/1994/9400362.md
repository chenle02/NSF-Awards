9400362 Eisenberger The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center
(MRSEC) at Princeton University supports interactive research in three major
groups addressing the synthesis and understanding of mesoscopically structured
complex materials with the ultimate goal of rational design of materials for
industrial applications. The group which is focused on electronic transport in
non- Fermi liquid materials combines expertise in theoretical physics and
synthesis of electronic materials with a new high magnetic field facility to
explore the properties of novel materials with restricted geometries and low-
dimensionality. The study of these materials is unified by common theoretical
concepts and the prediction of properties not observed in standard materials.
The group investigating organic thin films and quantum structures is exploring a
new class of engineering structures and materials based on the controlled
growth, at the monolayer level, of a wide range of semiconducting organic thin
films. Investigators in the group concerned with microstructured macromolecular
soft materials deal with materials formed from complex fluids. Soft materialq
with complex microstructures are formed by the spontaneous evolution of
structure in the liquid state; they are self-assembling. This group seeks a
unified understanding of the materials science of such materials. The MRSEC also
supports the development, operation and maintenance of shared experimental
facilities for materials research. It provides seed funding for exploratory
research. The center participates in an undergraduate materials science
certification program and in a summer research program for undergraduates. The
MRSEC is associated with an educational outreach program with emphasis on
attracting and retaining women and underrepresented minorities in materials
science and co-sponsors a materials science and engineering training program for
K-12 teachers. The MRSEC administers an industrial outreach and visitors
program. The MRSEC currently supports 20 faculty, 6 postdoctoral research
associates, 1 technical staff member, 22 graduate students, and a significant
number of undergraduates through their summer research program. The Princeton
MRSEC is directed by Professor Peter M. Eisenberger. ***
