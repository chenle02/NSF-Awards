Enterprise network operators must frequently change the design of their networks
to reflect new organizational needs (e.g., company mergers). Redesigning
enterprise networks is challenging given the need to change hundreds of
interdependent low-level configurations. Configuration errors can have
catastrophic consequences (e.g., large-scale network outages). The project is
investigating systematic frameworks to help operators redesign their networks to
meet desired high-level objectives. Optimization problems are formulated that
trade-off the benefits of a redesign task with the reconfiguration costs
involved. Algorithms for the redesign tasks are derived by exploring synergies
with theoretical work in the operations research community. The project is
devising hybrid methodologies for validating configuration changes that combine
static configuration analysis with information obtained from monitoring network
behavior. Novel techniques based on data-mining are being developed that can
capture configuration dependencies across network devices. The techniques are
being applied to important and unexplored problem domains such as migrating
security policies from enterprise data centers to a cloud computing model,
reorganizing routing designs on mergers, and service differentiation policies.
The research if successful will change how operators manage their networks,
leading to large cost-savings for IT organizations, and the creation of more
reliable and secure networks. The research will foster innovation by lowering
the risks in migration to new enterprise network architectures such as cloud
computing and clean-slate architectures. The PI is creating a network
configuration data repository available to academic researchers, introducing new
lecture material on enterprise management in the networking curriculum, and
participating in summer camps for K-12 students.
