9523304 Jones The project will design and develop an integrated sensor system
coupled with a compatible design tool that will enable real-time, interactive
assessment of the structural state of a complex mechanical or structural system.
The components of this diagnostics tool are: a Kalman-filter identification
model, an accelerometer-based sensor system and a generalized partially
observable Markov design process model. The broad applicability of the system
includes structural problems associated with extending the lifetimes of power
generating facilities; real-time monitoring and assessment of complex power
transmission and piping systems; and modeling and control of signal and control
of system instability. ***
