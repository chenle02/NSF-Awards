The objective of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project is to
study the capability of a new solid state joining process, termed friction bit
joining, to weld dissimilar combinations of aluminum, magnesium and steel
automotive sheets. The automotive industry and the US Government are
aggressively pursuing use of lightweight materials such as Mg alloys and Al
alloys in auto body structures for improved vehicle fuel efficiency. High-volume
production vehicles would require use of a variety of engineering materials,
ranging from ultra high-strength steels (UHSS), Al alloys, Mg alloys and others
to meet cost and performance objectives. The combination of lightweight
materials with widely acceptable structural materials such as UHSS presents a
number of technical challenges in automotive body-in-white assembly. One of them
is joining different materials to form an integrated structure component which
meets design and performance requirements. The current work will study the
welding process from a fundamental viewpoint, including the effect of process
conditions on metallurgical bond properties of dissimilar alloy joints. The
friction bit joining process has been shown to be capable of achieving high
levels of strength in dissimilar alloy joints of DP 980 steel and 5754 aluminum
alloys during a preliminary study. This combination of ultra high strength steel
and a soft aluminum alloy would be difficult or impossible to join using
conventional spot welding or even self piercing
riveting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this new process is shown to be successful in
bonding dissimilar metal alloys where strength levels are very different, it
will promote greater use of light metals in automotive and other transportation
structures, allowing for reduced weight and improved fuel efficiency.
