There are many highway bridges in the country which are inadequate or
deteriorating due to general obsolescence, weathering and corrosion effects,
excessive loadings, misalignments, and of sub-standard design features such as
narrow lanes, skewed to the roadway alignment and insufficient width of
emergency lanes. This special project will address itself to several items such
as: what can be done to save the highway bridges and transportation system; and
what policies should be adopted by local, state, and Federal agencies. The
results will be of interest to policy decisionmakers at local, state, and
Federal levels.
