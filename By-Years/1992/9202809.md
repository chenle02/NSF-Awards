The P.I. wishes to analyze the mineral phases of a set of cumulate gabbros and
ultramafics from DSDP Site 334 for major and trace elements with electron and
ion microprobe, respectively. Preliminary calculations suggest that liquids from
which these phases crystallized must have been unusually depleted in Na and Ti
but relatively high in Mg. Strangely, lavas of such compositions have never been
found at the Mid-oceanic-ridges. The proposed study will provide constraints on
the nature and origin of such liquids.
