This research follows advances developed under a prior NSF grant where new
techniques were formulated for the detection and characterization of earthquakes
with anomalously long duration. A new 10-year catalog of normal-mode excitation
events has been made that allows the systematic identification of slow
earthquakes on a global scale. This has led to the discovery of a new type of
earthquake which excites free oscillations but does not generate wave groups
observable on long-period or short- period seismograms, called "quiet
earthquakes." These unusually slow events may be precursory to fast ruptures, or
normal earthquakes. This research will more precisely define the slow ruptures
and investigate whether they are precursory to large damaging events and thus
provide a means of short-term earthquake prediction. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
