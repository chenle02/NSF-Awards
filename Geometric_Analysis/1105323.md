This project lies at the interface between Differential Geometry, General
Relativity, and Partial Differential Equations. One theme will be the study of
manifolds of positive curvature. Specifically the proposer plans to further his
study of manifolds of positive isotropic curvature (PIC) using Ricci flow and
minimal surface techniques. He also hopes to prove sphere theorems under
pointwise pinching conditions with pinching slightly below 1/4. In relativity he
plans to study the geometry of static matter solutions hoping to show that
matter bodies cannot be separated by convex sets in such solutions. He also
plans to study the general Penrose inequality; that is, the conjectured
inequality for black hole initial sets with nonzero second fundamental form. He
will also pursue a range of questions concerning minimal submanifolds satisfying
free boundary conditions and connections to eigenvalue problems. Finally he
plans to continue his study of minimal lagrangian and special lagrangian
submanifolds of Kahler-Einstein manifolds. He will attempt to prove a conjecture
concerning the invariance of the subgroup of the integral homology of a Calabi-
Yau manifold which is generated by minimal lagrangian cycles when one deforms
the ambient Calabi-Yau structure.

Understanding spaces in terms of their curvature properties is a fundamental
idea in mathematics and science. The laws of nature often provide information
about curvature properties, and from those we must deduce information about the
spaces. A prime example of this is General Relativity where the equations of
motion are described by curvature, and from those we must determine concrete
properties of the universe. This project deals with a range of questions of this
type such as the way in which black holes form from smooth initial data.
Furthermore, geometry is important in application areas such as imaging and
computer graphics. The research of this project will advance the core geometric
ideas which form the basis of such applications.
