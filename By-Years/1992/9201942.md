The overall aim of this research project is to define the molecular mechanisms
involved in iron-mediated regulation of gene expression in Escherichia coli,
using the complex genetic system encoding components responsible for the
biosynthesis (ent), transport (fep) and iron removal (fes) this 22 kb gene
cluster is now characterized; the six ent biosynthesis genes, fes five fep
transport genes, and three genes of unknown function are arranged as four
polycistronic and two monocistronic operons, the expression of which are
controlled by three bidirectional promoter operation regions that interact with
the repressor molecule, Fe(II)-Fur. The objectives of the current study are: (i)
to continue the molecular analysis of nucleotide sequences required for iron-
controlled expression of ent-fep region genes and the interaction of these
sequences with Fur and other regulatory factors; (ii) to continue examination of
the role of untranslated leader regions of some of the mRNAs in the ultimate
expression of these genes; and (iii) to investigate the regulation, localization
and potential function of the fepE gene product, a membrane protein of as yet
unknown function. In this last aim, we will pursue whether this protein, along
with the products of the two other uncharacterized ent region genes (P43 and
P15), function to control ent-fep gene expression in response to environmental
fluctuations. %%% These studies will provide a molecular model for iron-mediated
control of enterobactin gene expression as complex metabolic pathway requiring
coordination between biosynthetic and transport components. In addition, they
will provide a foundation for initiating a molecular investigation of the
complex metabolic and regulatory interrelationships between the iron (Fur)
region and other global stress response systems
