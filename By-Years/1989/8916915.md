A number of animal, plant and bacterial enzymes contain molybdenum. In all
cases it appears that the molybdenum is contained within a "molybdenum
cofactor," in a distinct structure which is essential for the enzyme's function.
The chemical structure of this cofactor has been highly conserved in different
organisms. From studies done on several species it is evident that groups of
genes mediate the biosynthesis or acquisition of the molybdenum cofactor. The
failure of certain master genes to function in genetic mutants can result in the
loss of all molybdenum enzyme activities, with drastic consequences for the
organisms bearing this defect. Dr. Finnerty's project focuses on an analysis of
an important gene for an enzyme containing molybdenum in the fruit fly
Drosophila. Drosophila is an organism about which there is a great deal of
genetic information available, and it therefore provides a highly favorable
model system for investigation of the manner in which molybdenum is housed in
enzymes that contain it. In addition to making use of genetic analyses, Dr.
Finnerty is carrying out biochemical analyses to provide a comprehensive
analysis of the structure and function of molybdenum cofactors in the Drosophila
system. Through investigation of this model system, information will be obtained
that will be of benefit to the understanding of enzymes bearing the molybdenum
cofactor in a variety of organisms.***//
