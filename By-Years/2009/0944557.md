Genome-enabled biology provides a foundation for understanding the genetic basis
of organism-environment interactions. . The research project links gene
expression, genome methylation, and metabolic rates to assess the mechanisms of
environmental adaptation (temperature) across multiple generations in a polar,
and closely related temperate, polychaete. By comparing these two species, the
research will assess how a polar environment shapes responses to environmental
stress. This work will produce: 1) a database of full transcriptome (gene
specific) profiling data for the polar polychaete cultured at two temperatures;
2) the contribution of genome methylation to the suppression of gene
transcription activities; 3) the linkage between shifts in mRNA pools and total
cellular activities (as ATP consumption via respiration); 4) an assessment of
the inheritance of patterns of gene expression and metabolic activities across
three generations; and 5) a simple demographic model of the polar polychaete
population dynamics under normal and 'global-warming' temperature scenarios.
Broader impacts include two outreach activities. The first is a mentoring
program, where African-American undergraduate students spend 1.5 years working
on a research project with a UD faculty member (2 summers plus their senior
academic year). The second is a children's display activity at UD?s School of
Marine Science "Coast Day".
