This project is concerned with the structure and classification of isotype
subgroups of simply presented abelian groups. The research is based largely on
the recent infinite combinatorial characterization of summands of simply
presented groups and the further exploitation of separability, equivalence
theorems and valuated structure on quotient groups. These new developments
provide a unified point of view for a broad assault on a variety of problems
that cut across the traditional divisions in the theory of abelian groups. This
project is concerned with the classification of infinite abelian groups. The
structure of finite abelian groups has been well understood for over a century.
Infinite abelian groups, however, have remained elusive. This investigator will
attack this problem from a new point of view.
