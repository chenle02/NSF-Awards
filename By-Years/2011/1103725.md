This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY
2011, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training
plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden
participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this
fellowship to Amanda Ensminger is "Individual variation in visual physiology and
foraging behavior of birds." The host institution for this fellowship is Purdue
University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Esteban Fernandez-Juricic.

The research plan centers on the relationship between individual variation in
visual physiology and foraging behavior in birds. Foraging involves a trade-off
between searching for food and watching for predators. Previous research has
found that variation in retinal characteristics among bird species is related to
both diet and habitat. However, little is known about retinal variation among
individuals within a species, even though intraspecific variation is key to
understanding the evolution of visual systems. This research quantifies the
degree and nature of individual variation in retinal physiology in birds and
directly tests hypotheses about how individual photoreceptor distribution is
related to differences among individuals in their foraging behavior and skills.
The findings explicitly link physiology and behavior in the context of foraging
and benefit broadly the fields of visual ecology, foraging theory, and animal
behavior.

Training objectives include learning techniques in avian visual physiology and
behavioral ecology. Broader impacts include mentoring undergraduates through the
host institution?s chapter of the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native
Americans in Science and visiting local schools to introduce young students to
behavioral ecology through hands-on activities.
