D2C2 (Dinosaurs Denver and Climate Change) is a Track 1 Proof-of-Concept
proposal that uses learning about dinosaurs and fossils as the hook for
underrepresented youth to learn about geology and climate change and to engage
them in green community-based projects. The proposed project provides the
resources for underserved youth to learn about geoscience by directly
experiencing it through Colorado's and Wyoming's natural resources, through
participation in six-week Saturday Summer Academies that incorporate both field-
and classroom-based experiences. STEM-based and community-based partners, which
include African American and Latino churches, will collaborate in informal
settings to provide African-American and Latina/o youth with place-based
pedagogy to advance public Earth science system (ESS) literacy. The project team
is applying place-based pedagogy to develop science and mathematics literacy and
to increase green space in underserved communities. Students engage in place-
based science by exploring historical data. Use of this critical pedagogy
enables students to engage in border-crossing between geoscience and green
energy conservation. Youth also use science process skills learned from a field-
based geology course to engage in green projects that will sustain local
communities and inform the public about climate change. This kind of engagement
allows students to contextualize community well-being using both historical and
contemporary geoscience knowledge. In this way, underrepresented minority
students also tap the cultural capital of their communities. The project is
focused on increasing public understanding of ESS and its relevance by (1)
improving the quality of informal geoscience education at the secondary level
(and beyond); (2) encouraging and facilitating the engagement of geoscientists
in efforts to strengthen STEM education; and (3) communicating the importance of
the geosciences to the public and increasing public literacy regarding ESS.
