This proposal partially funds a workshop on energy markets scheduled for Friday,
May 16, 2003, at Princeton University. The idea is to offer both a mini-
symposium on what went wrong in the recent horrible experience with energy
markets, including California's deregulation and collapse of Enron. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Financial institutions and markets are among the most rapidly growing
part of the service sector of the economy, and the associated modeling and
analysis activity, known collectively as "financial engineering" is a growing
area of research which is highly mathematical and well suited to the skills and
backgrounds of the operations research community. This workshop has the
potential to reveal major flaws in present thinking and opportunities for new
research. &lt;br/&gt;
