Burton Rodin will continue investigations into a newly developed computational
approach to the Riemann mapping theorem. This follows from the discovery of
connections between conformal mapping and circle packing. Such investigations
should lead to new insights into both areas and to new techniques in numerical
conformal mapping. In addition research will be carried out into other areas of
geometric function theory. This research will involve investigations into the
following areas: the relationship between the boundary behavior of the Riemann
mapping function and the geometry of the region; the application of Brownian
excursion laws in the study of conformal mapping; holomorphic and quasiconformal
families of Riemann mapping functions; harmonic measure estimates; the conformal
mapping of curvilinear polygons; extremal length and harmonic measure
relationships.
