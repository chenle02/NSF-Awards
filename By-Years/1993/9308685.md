The goals of this research is to utilize the Cro protein-operator system of
bacteriophage Lambda to develop an 15N nuclear magnetic resonance method for
studying DNA-protein interactions. 15N labeled A, T, C, and G nucleotide
derivatives which can be used in the normal phosphoramidite chemistry for
synthesizing oligomers of DNA will be prepared. Complementary double strand
17-mers containing one AT or one GC base pair enriched with 15N (>90%) will be
synthesized. 15N NMR resonances are very sensitive to hydrogen bonding. Thus,
when the protein binds to the DNA with formation of hydrogen bonds between the
N-atoms of the bases and the amino acid side chains, the resonances from
individual N atoms will undergo shifts. In this way, the specific atoms of the
bases in the DNA which are interacting with the protein will be mapped. The
method will be generalized to predict the nature of DNA/protein interactions
involving proteins of unknown structure. %%% DNA-protein interactions are
central to control of all aspects of the life of the cell. Nevertheless, short
of X-ray crystallography, contemporary biologists have few tools with which to
study the details of these important interactions. The work proposed involves
use of stable 15N isotope-substituted DNA molecules and nuclear magnetic
resonance to provide detailed information about the interactions between
proteins and DNA. Such studies may lead a rapid means for obtaining
unprecedentedly detailed information about such interactions.
