The Georgia Discrete Analysis Conference will be held on May 14-17, 2018, at the
University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia. The purpose of the meeting is to
exchange ideas related to the latest developments in discrete analysis with a
focus on those in arithmetic combinatorics. Special emphasis will be placed on
new or evolving directions for research. Arithmetic combinatorics, broadly
defined, is an area of research that deals with combinatorial structures
involving the basic operations of addition and multiplication and their
interactions. Though its problems are often purely combinatorial their solutions
often incorporate techniques from analysis, combinatorics, and number theory.
The meeting will be at an international level, with many world renowned
speakers. The organizers plan to invite 14 speakers (four of which will be early
career mathematicians) and at least 35 additional participants.

Topics to be cover at the Georgia Discrete Analysis Conference include:
pseudorandomness and its various manifestations in number theory and
combinatorics, Gowers' uniformity norms, recent developments related to Roth's
and Szemeredi's and the Green-Tao theorem, the sum-product phenomena and
incidence theorems. Many of these topics have witnessed a flurry of recent
activity.
