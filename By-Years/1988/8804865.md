This award provides funds to expand the computing and instrumentation
capabilities of the Biomedical Image Processing Laboratory at the University of
Minnesota Medical School to meet research needs in the area of
spectrofluorometry. The facility is dedicated to the use of digital image
processing and three-dimensional graphics in basic biological research. Tasks
for which the new equipment will be used include two-dimensional stereology and
image classification, two- and three-dimensional digitally enhanced imaging,
high speed video motion analysis, and optical sectioning microscopy. The types
of image analysis tools funded with this award are key to research at the
forefront of modern cell biology. The current revolution in light microscopy and
the vastly expanded ability of the electron microscope to provide serial
sections are among the most striking spinoffs of the development of digital
image reconstruction by astronomers and space scientists.
