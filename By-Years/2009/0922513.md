This award funds laboratory experiments on the determinants of delayed
settlements in tort ligation.

In the United States, tort cases often exhibit protracted delay between the time
of injury and settlement of a dispute. Parties to a dispute tend to agree on
settlement conditions only after engaging in lengthy legal procedures. Resources
spent on settlement negotiation are large and econonomically inefficient.

The research tests the popular hypothesis that differences in the kinds of
information available to the disputants results in delay. The experiments
examine two questions. First, does asymmetric information lead to lengthy
settlement delays? Second, what policies help mitigate settlement delay?

The experiments involve real-time negotiation between participants in a series
of mock lawsuits. The experimental design allows for estimation of important
treatment effects while controlling for individual differences and for learning
behavior.

With the social cost of the U.S. tort system estimated at $250 billion per year,
better understanding of why tort cases reach delayed settlements may have
substantial societal benefts. The results of this project will help us to
evaluate the effects of proposed reforms of the tort system.
