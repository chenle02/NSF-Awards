Teleseismic event recordings from regional seismic arrays in the western US
contain travel-time information can be used to image upper mantle velocity
structure beneath much of the western US. The seismic inversions and models of
other workers and results shown in this proposal show that the upper mantle is
strongly heterogeneous beneath each array investigated. These upper mantle
structures are thought to be fundamentally related to present-day tectonic
activity, yet the relationships are not well understood. The work proposed
offers an opportunity to vastly improve understanding of seismic structure
beneath the western US, and it should improve general understanding of the
dynamics of continental deformation.
