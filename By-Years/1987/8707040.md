Biologists have speculated for years that modern land plants must have evolved
from some group of aquatic green algae. Researchers like Dr. Linda Graham at the
University of Wisconsin have presented morphological and developmental evidence
that the four genera of charophyte algae, Chara, Nitella, Coleochaete, and
Chaetosphaeridium, are most similar to land plants and are likely the closest
living algal relatives of higher plants. In continuing studies of two of these
genera, Dr. Graham is investigating new featurs of DNA quantity in cell nuclei,
measuring cell size under varying environmental conditions, and testing for the
occurrence of specialized compounds (callose and sporopollenin) common in land
plants but rare to absent in most algae. Data from these studies will either
corroborate or refute the idea that charophytes are close to land plants, and
will also provide taxonomic characters aiding in the recognition of species
within the genera Coleochaete and Chaetosphaeridium.
