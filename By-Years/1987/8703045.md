The main objective of this proposal is to understand the biological and
biochemical basis of polyene antibiotic resistance and sensitivity. A genetic-
physiological framework will be established for the study of polyene-resistant
mutants and the analysis of polyene resistance and sensitivity through the study
of these mutants. The framework will be constructed by isolating and genetically
characterizing polyene-resistant mutants, analyzing the mutants for sterol
alterations by gas chromatographic and mass spectroscopic analysis, screening
the mutants for polyene-sterol binding and for the state of polyene- induced
permeability. Although most of the evidence suggests that polyene caused cell
death is the result of cell leakage, recent evidence suggests that the products
of polyene autoxidation may be responsible for polyene toxicity. In his analysis
of polyene-resistant mutants Dr. Katz has found a class of mutants that appear
to be deficient in cell-substratum adhesion, reduced in membrane sterol content
and increased in cellular peroxisomal activity. The relationship of these three
results to each other and to polyene resistance and sensitivity will be further
studied. Polyenes are widely used clinically important drugs whose mode of
action depends on their interaction with membrane sterol. Sterols are major
structural components of the plasma membrane whose function is largely unknown.
There is a growing body of literature that indicates that they may play an
active role in cellular regulation rather than only passively modulating
membrane fluidity. Dictyostelium discoideum with its extensive developmental
program which features such membrane processes as cell motility, adhesion and
phagocytosis will be used for these studies.
