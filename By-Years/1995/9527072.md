Abstract ATM-9527072 William A. Fingerhut and Peter M. Schmid Lyndon State
College UNIDATA: A Migration of Meteorological Data Reception from Satellite to
the Internet Using UNIDATA LDM Software. This funding shall move the meteorology
department from a data reception program, that relies on satellite
transmissions, to a program that relies upon the Internet for Meteorological
data. A UNIX-based server is necessary to receive data via the Internet. This
machine will run the UNIDATA software that will ingest and manage multiple data
streams.
