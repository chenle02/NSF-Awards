This National Science Foundation award funds Student Travel Fellowships for US
students attending ICDE 2017, the 2017 IEEE International Conference on Data
Engineering, the main goal of which is the sharing of scientific information and
knowledge among participants. The Student Fellowships helps cover the travel
costs for US students, making it possible for them to attend the conference and
interact with other members of the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ICDE
conference has a multi-faceted program that includes keynote addresses,
technical paper presentations, application track sessions, industry track
sessions, demonstrations, PhD symposium, tutorials, panels and poster sessions.
All these activities are opportunities for students to share their research work
and knowledge with researchers from both academia and industry.
