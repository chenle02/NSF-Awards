This research will test theories that explain why rates of violent crime vary
over time and space, including theories that emphasize economic conditions,
criminal justice practices, and changes in demography. Although considerable
criminological research, adopting either a cross-sectional or time-series
approach, has been conducted to evaluate the importance of such characteristics
in explaining violent crime, the understanding of these key factors remains
limited. The most important factors affecting variation in homicide rates over
time appear to differ from those affecting spatial variation. The principal
investigator will explore these disparities by combining spatial and temporal
information on homicide rates from 1970 to 1996 for all counties with a
population of at least 100,000. This research will provide a more precise gauge
for law enforcement agencies and the public in predicting future trends in
homicide levels and may suggest approaches to crime fighting.
