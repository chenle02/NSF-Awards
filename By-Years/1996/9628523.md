Paul Barbara is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical and experimental research directed
at understanding quantum chemical dynamics in solution. Using femtosecond pump-
probe optical spectroscopy as an experimental tool Barbara will study: 1)
electronically nonadiabatic transitions in symmetric and asymmetric metal-metal
intervalence compounds; 2) electronically nonadiabatic transitions in the one
and two photon ionization of aqueous iodide solution and the two photon
ionization of water; 3) vibrationally nonadiabatic transitions in the
photodissociation, recombination, and the vibrational relaxation of small
strongly solvated radicals with high frequency vibrations; and 4) the putative
long-range coherent electron transfer between metallointercalators in DNA.
Theoretical studies are also proposed of current quantum theoretical models for
electron transfer and vibrational relaxation. Since many commercially important
chemical reactions take place in polar solvents such as water, it is important
to understand the influence which such solvents have on the reaction dynamics. A
number of effects, such as solvent cage effects, vibrational relaxation and
quantum mechanical tunneling, which are not present in the gas phase completely
dominate condensed phase chemical reactions. It is important to develop reliable
theories for model chemical systems which can then be applied to improving the
efficiency of commercially important chemical reactions. The work which is being
performed by Barbara provides an important experimental basis for the
development of such theories.
