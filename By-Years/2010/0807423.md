Glasner&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0807423&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator considers
fluid and solid interfaces that&lt;br/&gt;have multiscale behavior,
spatiotemporal interaction and large&lt;br/&gt;scale organization. One component
of this project focuses on the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of gravitational and surface
tension induced free&lt;br/&gt;surface instabilities in viscous fluids, which
give rise to&lt;br/&gt;coherent structures like fluid droplets, ridges and jets.
&lt;br/&gt;Perturbative techniques and computational studies lead toward
a&lt;br/&gt;description of large-scale condensation and
geophysical&lt;br/&gt;processes. A second component of the project involves
dynamical&lt;br/&gt;models of material microstructures. Patterning in systems
with&lt;br/&gt;nonlocal interactions, such as block copolymer mixtures,
is&lt;br/&gt;studied from the point of view of dynamical
development,&lt;br/&gt;utilizing formal and numerical approximations, and
homogenization&lt;br/&gt;techniques that yield statistical descriptions. The
motion of&lt;br/&gt;grain boundaries in crystalline surface evolution and
pattern&lt;br/&gt;formation equations also is investigated, seeking to
characterize&lt;br/&gt;the singular structures that emerge both from energetic
and&lt;br/&gt;geometric perspectives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator
studies how fluid and solid interfaces move&lt;br/&gt;and interact in
complicated, large systems. Models and&lt;br/&gt;simulations are developed that
are used to explain laboratory&lt;br/&gt;observations and that have capabilities
to predict and control&lt;br/&gt;dynamics for design and manufacturing. Fluid
flows that are&lt;br/&gt;studied have applications ranging from industrial
coatings to&lt;br/&gt;geophysical morphology, such as cave formations. The
solid&lt;br/&gt;systems of interest include block copolymers,
"designer"&lt;br/&gt;materials that hold considerable promise for nano-
engineering. &lt;br/&gt;The project also includes educational aims that
expose&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates to modeling and computation and train
graduate&lt;br/&gt;students for scientific careers.
