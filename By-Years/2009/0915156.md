&lt;br/&gt;Threat detection (TD) means an assessment of the presence of harmful
agents, biological, chemical, or nuclear. The footprint (or signatures) of such
agents could be qualitative and verbal, and/or quantitative. These signatures
are generated by sensors which collectively form a networked system. The
architecture of such systems could be series, parallel, or hierarchical. A key
feature of such signatures is that they tend to be imprecise, incomplete, and
unreliable. Furthermore, the sensors could be co-operative or adversarial, the
latter due to sabotage and psychological ploys. The principal investigator and
his colleagues propose to articulate the mathematical underpinnings of the TD
scenario, in order to integrate signatures from a multitude of sensors in a
principled way. The goal is to express the presence of threats in terms of
numerical probabilities. This tantamounts to integrating signatures which are
filtered via distributed network structures, and are contaminated by
imprecision, camouflage, and parleying. As a research topic in probability and
statistics, the matter of integrating contaminated and camouflaged signatures is
new. Both Bayesian and classical methods, as well as a cunning combination of
the two, will be invoked. The crux of the work will entail developing meaningful
likelihood functions that capture the essence of the physical and psychological
issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current practice in intelligence and
national security is to express threat in verbal and qualitative terms like
possible, probable, likely, etc. Such expressions are not actionable. This
research will place the threat detection scenario in a probabilistic framework
so that decisive actions to mitigate threats can be taken. The work will have
broader impacts in civilian applications such as oil exploration, weather
prediction, medical diagnosis, and socio-cultural modeling.&lt;br/&gt;
