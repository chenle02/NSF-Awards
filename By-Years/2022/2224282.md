The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the potential
development of a possible solution for highway slope failure. Highway slope
failure can be a common issue nationwide and highway agencies can spend millions
of dollars on highway maintenance. The proposed technology may also assist in
improving the nation’s need to improve its road infrastructure grade ‘D’. The
proposed technology could save costs compared to the current solutions
available. While the primary beneficiary of this product will be the highway
agencies, the landfill industry will be a secondary beneficiary because the
proposed technology is produced from the recycling of plastic The potential use
of plastic in transportation infrastructure projects could reduce the amount of
plastic waste and may create an opportunity for the recycling industry to
develop a market for this product. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is
based on the possible development of a technology to use recycled plastic in
highway slope repair as a potentially innovative, low-cost, and sustainable
solution. The technology has been successfully implemented in several field
demonstration projects, and while the current solutions (i.e., soil nail, soil
anchor, micropile) can be effective, they may be time-consuming and expensive.
The proposed work could answer important questions regarding a pathway for the
future application and adoption of other alternative and sustainable materials
in transportation infrastructure projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
