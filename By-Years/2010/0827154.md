A Joint U.S. / Romanian NanoScience
Workshop&lt;br/&gt;0827154&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to the University of
Central Florida (UCF) will support a five-day targeted workshop to develop
future collaborations in fields of nanoscience between UCF and the Romanian
Center for Applied Research in Physics and Advanced TecHnologies (CARPATH)
center at Alexander John Cuza University in Iasi, Romania. This award will
support the participation of U.S. postdoctoral researchers and students as well
as faculty members.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The University of Central Florida's
(UCF) NanoScience Center faculty members are pursuing a group of projects which
all require computational modeling, and while UCF has strong experimental
abilities, it has limited computational resources. CARPATH, on the other hand,
has strong computational abilities, but limited experimental capabilities.
Therefore a Joint Romanian/U.S. NanoScience Workshop is proposed to explore the
utility of CARPATH's computational platform for modeling UCF's experimental
modeling challenges. This will be reviewed in a 5 day workshop covering a wide
array of topics such as organic thin film photovoltaic development, an
exploration of the transport properties of magnetic nanoparticles design,
predictive nanotoxicology, hysterisis with multiple control parameters, the high
frequency response of nanostructured systems, and multiscale simulations of
material properties. It is envisioned that this workshop will facilitate long
term collaborative interactions between CARPATH and UCF's NanoScience faculty
members and will extend the scope of their existing projects.
