This project is an experimental study of scientifically and technologically
important point defects in elemental and compound semiconductors using optical
detection of magnetic resonance and optical detection of electron-nuclear double
resonance. Some of the defects are produced by electron irradiation of Zinc-
Tellurium samples at low temperatures. Another part of the work deals with
metastable defects, such as DX and EL2 centers, in II-VI and III-V
semiconductors. Other materials being studied are fullerenes, MBE nitrogen-doped
Zinc-Selenium and porous silicon.
