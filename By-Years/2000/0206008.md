PI Pinsonneault&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has been extensive recent
observational and theoretical work on the angular&lt;br/&gt;momentum evolution
of low mass stars. The initial distribution of protostellar rotation rates can
provide clues about the star formation process and the interaction of T Tauri
stars with their circumstellar accretion disks. Rotation is intimately connected
with the generation of stellar magnetic fields, and the spindown of stars can be
used to study angular momentum loss from a magnetized stellar wind. Internal
transport of material and of angular momentum has several sources (hydrodynamic,
magnetic, and induced by gravity waves); this transport produces mixing that can
strongly modify the surface abundances of stars. The sheer variety of physical
effects associated with stellar rotation makes the subject complex. Fortunately,
there are numerous observational constraints on theoretical models of angular
momentum evolution, and recent work has established a theoretical framework for
interpreting these data. This study is a combined theoretical and observational
program on stellar rotation. The goals of this work are to improve the physics
in models of angular momentum evolution and to provide new calibrating data for
the models.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
