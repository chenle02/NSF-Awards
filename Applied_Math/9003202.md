The principal investigator will study various problems associated with the
numerical solution of differential equations that govern incompressible and
compressible flows of fluids. In particular, he will study vortex methods for
incompressible flows, the numerical capturing of oscillatory solutions of
gasdynamic equations, and the use of dispersive approximations in the solution
of compressible flow problems. Fluid flow problems in two and three space
dimensions are governed by complicated systems of nonlinear partial differential
equations. Often the only practical way to solve such systems is to use a
computer to generate approximate numerical solutions. But this is not all that
easy either. The principal investigator will use what is called a vortex method
to generate numerical solutions of the equations of incompressible and
compressible fluid flow. This basic method and the improvements on it made by
the principal investigator allow one to find accurate solutions in an efficient
manner.
