The objective of this research is the deployment and operation of three
stratospheric.tropospheric (ST) radars in the tropical Pacific to make new
measurements of convection, atmospheric waves, and turbulence. The radars will
be constructed using components of the larger MST radar originally constructed
at Poker Flat, Alaska. Additionally, three boundary layer profilers, recently
developed by the Aeronomy Laboratory, will be deployed to measure the field of
motion from the surface to near 10,000 feet.
