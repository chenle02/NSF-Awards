There is an urgent need to increase global crop production to meet the food,
fiber and bio-fuel demands of our growing population. The major focus of the
Keystone Symposia meeting on Plant Abiotic Stress and Sustainable Agriculture
will investigate how crops can be modified to enhance productivity in extreme
environments, such as the extremes in water availability and temperature,
salinity, nutrient deficiency and other factors associated with global climate
change. This grant supports the participation of graduate students at this
meeting.
