This award funds research in the economic theory of matching methods.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research develops new methods for analyzing two-sided
matching, whether it is organized via a decentralized market or a central
clearinghouse. The projects focus on college admissions as a possible
application, although the new theory is general and will apply to many other
contexts. The first project develops a canonical model of a decentralized
college admissions game, analyzes the strategic yield management decisions made
by colleges and universities, and evaluates the resulting equilibrium outcomes.
The second project uses data from Australia, where college admissions are
centralized in each state. The data analysis determines the effect of specific
features of this centralized process on the resulting assignment of students to
universities. The third project is again economic theory; the team seeks to
develop new and more general conditions that guarantee existence of stable
matching in an asymptotic sense; as applied to college admissions this would
mean a match that is stable as the economy grows in the number of students and
in the number of college places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this
project include new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different ways
of encouraging college access through changes in admissions processes.
