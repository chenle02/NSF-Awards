This project will research the production of materials, restriction enzymes and
competent cells that have a longer stabilization life than the materials which
now exist. These materials will not require packing in wet and dry ice that is
now necessary to implement their use in the science classroom. In addition, the
cost for shipping will be greatly reduced. Both the stability and cost factors
are significant barriers to the inclusion of biotechnology experiments in the
classroom. Dr. Nardone has worked with both teachers and scientists and so knows
the problems inherent in this experimentation.
