B. Patrick Sullivan of the University of Wyoming is supported by the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for research on synthesis of
linear oligomeric rhenium complexes, and investigation of their photoexcitation
and electron-transfer properties. Both diphosphines and cyano groups will be
used as bridging ligands, in order to favor directional electron or energy
transfer through restriction of conformational flexibility. New synthetic
procedures will be developed in order to build oligomeric rhenium complexes with
specific lengths, and having properties that will facilitate directional energy
and electron transfer. Studies of the dynamics of selected processes will also
be carried out to optimize efficiency of energy transfer down the oligomeric
chain. Later stages of the work will deal with rectification at semiconductor
(titania) interfaces, and use of Mn-based chromophores as surrogates for Re
complexes.

This research addresses factors that facilitate directional electron and energy
transport, an important problem with wide potential applicability. Substantial
preliminary results indicate that the proposed research has a good likelihood of
success. The results may well be important in development of practical methods
for solar energy collection. The proposed research will also provide excellent
training for students and post-doctoral associates.
