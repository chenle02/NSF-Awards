The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award
is to create methods for designing extremely affordable products aimed at
alleviating poverty in the developing world while simultaneously opening new
foreign markets to US companies. Surprisingly, this approach of financially
gaining from helping the poor to escape poverty is one of the most sustainable
paths to poverty alleviation. Products designed using the methods created under
this award foster self-sufficiency by increasing the earning power of those who
are living in extreme poverty. These income-generating products are made
affordable by their strategic modularity, which makes them progressively
expandable, thus facilitating incremental investment by the impoverished. The
research approach includes the creation of multidisciplinary decision-making
models for extreme affordability, product expandability, and decision
robustness. Deliverables include documented research results, and undergraduate
and graduate teaching modules made available via the World Wide
Web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research will result in the
discovery and articulation of fundamental principles of sustainable design for
the developing world. These principles, which enable affordable, low risk,
products that increase the earning power of people living in extreme poverty,
are the fundamental basis of the research and teaching modules resulting from
this work. If successful, the research will positively affect many people's
lives. For the impoverished, breakthroughs in affordability of income-generating
products lead to increased income, which in turn lowers sickness, improves
educational opportunities, improves local water supplies, and combats hunger.
For US companies searching for new and suitable foreign markets, the proposed
work provides needed design methods for creating viable products for those
markets.
