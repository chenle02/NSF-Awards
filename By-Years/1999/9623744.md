9623744 Slamovich Many applications will benefit from low temperature (&lt;
100(C) processing routes to ceramic materials. For example, dielectric ceramics
may be incorporated into microelectronics manufacturing processes without
degrading metallizations, and ceramics may be coprocessed with polymers for high
strength capacitors or abrasion resistant coatings. Hydrothermal processing is a
route to ceramics below 100(C, involving the formation of crystalline material
from reactants in an aqueous medium. This proposal is for an initial four year
period to investigate novel approaches to processing ceramic and polymer/ceramic
thin films based on low temperature hydrothermal processing. The research effort
seeks to develop routes to control film morphology via an understanding of
hydrothermal growth mechanisms. Hydrothermal processing will also be used to
fabricate polymer/ceramic composite films. %%% Career education goals are
centered around implementing Purdue's new NSF sponsored materials processing
curriculum. The goal of this Career Development Plan is to develop new routes
towards integrated materials processing, complementing the educational
objectives of Purdue's new Materials Science and Engineering curriculum. ***
