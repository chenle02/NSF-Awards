9626652 Greene The proposed research deals with Riemannian as well as Kahler
geometry. Orbifolds, spaces locally isometric to Riemannian manifolds quotiented
by finite groups of isometries, are to be investigated with a view towards
understanding the isometry groups of nonsingular Riemannian manifolds.
Estimation of numbers of topological types for Riemannian manifolds satisfying
certain geometric conditions will also be pursued. In Kahler geometry, the
investigator will study how curvature behavior at large distances controls the
overall complex structure of the space. This is the higher dimensional analog of
distinguishing between hyperbolic and parabolic Riemann surfaces. Much of this
project has to do with how the local geometry, i.e., the geometric structure in
small neighborhoods of each point, influences or even controls the global
geometry and topology of a space, meaning the overall shape and nature of the
space. This has a direct practical application in the construction of large-
scale curved steel structure such as ship hulls. The deformation of steel plates
by heat treatment into pre-specified curved shapes, for example, can be
understood using this approach.
