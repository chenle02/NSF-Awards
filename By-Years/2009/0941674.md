In the traditional view, the nervous system performs the computational "heavy
lifting" in an organism. This view neglects, however, the critical role of
biomaterials, passive mechanical physics, and other pre-neuronal or non-neuronal
systems. Given that neurons consume forty times more energy per unit mass than
structural materials such as bone, it is better, when possible, that biological
systems employ relatively inexpensive structural materials rather than relying
on more costly neuronal control. In this "bone-brain continuum" view, animal
intelligence and behavioral control systems can only be understood using
integrative modeling approaches that expose the computational roles of both
neural and non-neural substrates and their close coupling in behavioral output.
To this end, a group of researchers from Northwestern University, The Johns
Hopkins University, and Harvard University propose to create a unique high
fidelity neuromechanical model of a vertebrate. The effort is divided between
the development of a general purpose computational tool set for neuromechanics
research and application of these tools to an ideally suited model system,
weakly electric knifefish. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will lead to
breakthroughs in fundamental problems of how nervous systems work together with
biomechanics to generate adaptive behavior. The final goal of the research is to
construct an integrated neuromechanical model of a unique biological system -
weakly electric knifefish - that places biomechanics and neural control on equal
footing. Prior such neuromechanical models have used highly simplified models of
mechanics and highly abstracted neuronal control approaches. This research
advances the state of the art by incorporating high-fidelity mechanics with
neuronal mechanisms motivated by direct neurophysiological evidence. Ultimately,
this computational approach will help elucidate how animals distribute
computations between brain and bone.
