9622709 Donnelly This proposal contains three separate projects: nodal sets of
eigenfunctions for higher order elliptic operators; L2 cohomology of the Bergman
metric, and the Dirichlet problem at infinity for harmonic maps between rank one
symmetric spaces. For the nodal set project, the investigator proposes to find a
lower bound for its Hausdorff measure. For the L2 cohomology project, he intends
to generalize the vanishing theorem for strictly pseudoconvex domains to include
weakly pseudoconvex domains. For the Dirichlet problem, the investigator is
interested in providing a counterexample to existence of harmonic maps. The main
thrust of this project is the study of Laplacians on Riemannian manifolds. Given
a Riemannian manifold, that is, a curved space possessing a distance function,
its Laplacian determines the behavior of a very important class of functions
defined on the space, namely, harmonic functions. Harmonic functions arise in
many different contexts: in mathematics, they arise as pure and imaginary parts
of complex-analytic functions; in applications, they describe various heat and
wave phenomena.
