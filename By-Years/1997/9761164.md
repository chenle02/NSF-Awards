*** 9761164 West This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is
directed at developing a new technology for generating bio-active libraries of
compounds for high-throughput screening in drug discovery. This new synthesis
method is expected to create a diverse spectrum of large numbers of drug
candidate compounds - many with structures that are difficult or impossible to
obtain with other methods. The Phase I program will produce eight libraries of
compounds, where each library is created from reactants with structural
similarities to ligands for targeted receptors. The libraries generated will be
screened for binding to cannabinoid and x-opioid receptors. Phase I success will
be established if binding is demonstrated at a rate of at least one in 1000
screened compounds - an order of magnitude improvement over current 'hit rates"
achieved by combinatorial chemistry techniques. The proposed process has great
commercial potential as a tool for the discovery of new drugs. With the advent
of high-throughput screening techniques, there is a great demand in the
pharmaceutical industry for new compounds. If successful, this new process will
produce large numbers of an extremely diverse range of compounds. ***
