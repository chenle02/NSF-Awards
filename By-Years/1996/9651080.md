The project establishes data capturing facilities for the
Graphics/Visualization laboratory, specifically, a video digitizing system. The
equipment is being used to enhance the lab projects in undergraduate courses
related to graphics, image processing, and data visualization. The new lab
projects make use of two sources of real data, an ongoing three-dimensional
ultrasound visualization project with Carolinas Medical Center and an extensive
collection of the works of Aukram Burton (media artist and lecturer in
English/Communications, UNC Charlotte) currently existing as film, stills, and
video.
