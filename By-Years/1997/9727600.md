9727600 Yarger This project is a collaboration between faculty members from the
geosciences and curriculum and instruction to address pressing needs in science
education. The primary outcome of the project will be a model for improving
beginning science courses and preparing teachers of science. An introductory
meteorology course is targeted for this project. Student-directed, computer-
based simulations will be developed and integrated into the introductory
meterology course to facilitate the learning of difficult concepts. These
simulations will record student actions and replay those actions for later study
and discussion. For preservice teachers enrolled in meterology, a concurrent
companion course will be created to encourage reflection on and understanding of
the learning and teaching strategies that are productive in the simulated
environments. This course will be based on a constructivist philosophy of
learning and will make extensive use of the students actions recorded by the
simulations. This project contributes to an ongoing movement to change a large
lecture class to an environment where students can construct their own
understanding of science. It shifts the goals of the meterology course from the
learning of science content toward learning how to learn science. This shift
will be beneficial to all students, but it will be of special importance to
preservice teachers as an anchor for their subsequent education activities.
