9457923 Shull The primary objectives of this work are to relate polymer adhesion
to the molecular structure of the interface, and to quantify the interfacial
features which dominate many of the properties of polymer/metal composite
systems. Well characterized polymers synthesized by anionic polymerization will
be used as model systems. %%% ***
