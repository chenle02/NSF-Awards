ABSTRACT CTS-9413318 P.I.: Wasan, Darsh T. (Illinois Institute of Technology)
The project will support the travel of four distinguished foreign engineers and
scientists to come to the U.S. to participate in a symposium on thin liquid
films at the AICHE annual Meeting and to visit U.S. universities to give
seminars and to encourage collaboration.. Many of the key researchers in thin
liquid films are from outside the U.S. To assist U.S. workers in the field, the
project brings four of the eminent engineers and scientists in the field to the
U.S. All funds are used for these participant costs. The foreign visitors are
featured at a symposium of two sessions at the 1994 AICHE Annual Meeting at San
Francisco in November. The sessions are arranged and chaired by the P.I.'s, who
are leading U.S. researchers in the field of thin liquid films and the effects
of these films on the stability of foams and emulsions. The proper
characterization of this stability is a key factor in much pharmaceutical, food,
cosmetic, and other chemical processing. Visits of the foreign researchers to
U.S. universities are arranged as part of this project.
