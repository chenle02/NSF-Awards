This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project plans to use
digital microscopy to allow students seamless integration between digital image
collection, storage, analysis, and sharing over the Internet, combining features
of digital microscopy with the power of collaborative learning. Digital Blue
will foster development of students' virtual learning communities with shared
digital tools, uniformed microscopic techniques, and common goals to explore the
invisible world around them. Such explorations will be integrated with AAAS, NRC
and state education standards for Earth Science and Biology. By developing four
instructional units on the study of: (1) water, soil and minerals; (2)
microorganisms; (3) plant growth; and (4) invisible animal features, the project
will foster implementation of affordable, yet accurate digital microscopy into
science exploration in both formal classrooms and home settings. The project
will build an infrastructure allowing individual student and classroom
participation. The cornerstone of the infrastructure will be a web site with
tools to support the virtual learning community. The web site design includes
collaborative workspaces allowing a class to propose and launch an
investigation. Each project will be supported by the Tapestry database, allowing
easy uploading of an inlay of stored digital images supplemented with student
commentaries. The database allows the recognition of unique unusual observations
that pose a challenge questioning, motivating further investigations and
analysis, mimicking the investigative nature of real science.

In additional to the broader educational benefits widely recognized to accrue to
collaborative learning, this project has the potential to initiate a new realm
of innovation in educational technology; namely, web-enhanced devices.
