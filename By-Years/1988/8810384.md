Noise control for enclosed spaces continues to be a very important topic.
Traditional passive techniques are often not feasible because of the inherent
excessive weight penalty associated with the method. This is particularly true
for aircraft or spacecraft environments. Recently, active control methods have
received more attention and early results are promising. This project extends
this active control thrust. It investigates the fundamental problem of
controlling the noise within a cylindrical shell by applying control forces to
the shell wall in order to reduce particular vibration modes associated with
transmitting acoustical energy into the enclosed cavity.
