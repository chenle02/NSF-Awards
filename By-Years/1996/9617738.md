This project will determine the origin of microcrystalline carbonate in
stromatolites: is it precipitation resulting from bacterial metabolic activity,
or physical trapping of resuspended particles? Crusting and "soft" mats from
Exuma Cays, Bahamas, will be compared, with experimental intervention to
encourage or inhibit lithification. Analyses will include structure and
mineralogy of grains, structure of microbe community, mat physiology, and
biogeochemistry of stable isotopes and extracellular secretions.
