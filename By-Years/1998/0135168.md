The NSF, the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the China Seismological Bureau
(CSB) of the People's Republic of China are partners in a Protocol for
scientific and technical cooperation in earthquake studies. This Protocol was
initially signed in Beijing in 1980, and extended in 1984, 1990, 1995, and 2001.
The latest extension (through 2005) was signed on March 28, 2001 at a signing
ceremony hosted by the USGS in Reston, VA. This ceremony was the culmination of
an official visit to the US by a Chinese delegation from the Ministry of
Construction, CSB, and the Chinese Natural National Science Foundation which
visited several locations within the US.

The terms of the Protocol are that the receiving side pays whenever an official
delegation visits. Thus, when a Chinese delegation visits the US, NSF and the
USGS have agreed to split the costs of the delegation. This transfer of funds to
the USGS will cover NSF's share of the expenses for the Chinese delegation's
visit to the U.S. ***
