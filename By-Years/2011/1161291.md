Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville, a Hispanic Serving Institution of
approximately 5,300 students, is increasing the quantity, quality, and diversity
of students successfully earning engineering baccalaureate degrees by augmenting
progress from a prior STEP award. The project is being initiated in civil and
mechanical engineering departments and is expanding into the chemical and
environmental engineering departments. Specific objectives of this 5-year
project are: (i) infusing concepts of the design process across all four levels
of the engineering undergraduate curriculum; (ii) increasing first-year, second-
year, and third-year retention of engineering undergraduate students to 78%,
68%, and 62% respectively; and (iii) increasing the six-year engineering
undergraduate graduation rate from 44% to 54%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first
new endeavor is engaging students in design experiences throughout their
undergraduate academic careers. Freshman are experiencing the design process in
a fundamental and structured way that is then aligned vertically to experiences
in their sophomore and junior years. The university's annual engineering design
competition is expanding to include the work of lower division students. To
enhance student retention and persistence to graduation, the senior capstone
design experiences are linked to the university's engineering innovation
laboratory for access to authentic, real-world, industry projects.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second new endeavor is an innovative configuration of
cascaded peer-mentoring, wherein undergraduate seniors are mentoring juniors,
juniors are mentoring sophomores, and sophomores are mentoring freshmen. These
peer mentors, after being selected via a formal application process and
participating in a training workshop, are engaging with students around the
design projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, overseen by internal and
external advisory boards, is advancing knowledge of effective practices on
retention of Hispanic engineering students. Faculty are more deliberately
connecting undergraduate education and practice to relevant design experiences
linked to industry problems or concerns, with particular attention to those of
likely impact on the largely Hispanic public of the region and state of Texas.
The project is conducting a thorough assessment and is nationally disseminating
their practices and findings.
