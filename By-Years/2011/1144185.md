Remarkable progress in the understanding of the brain in recent years is due in
part to the increasing role that theory and computational methods are playing in
the design of experiments and interpretation of data. The annual Computational
and Systems Neuroscience (Cosyne) conference promotes this process by providing
an inclusive forum for the exchange of experimental and
theoretical/computational approaches to problems in systems neuroscience. This
purpose of this project is to broaden participation of women and other under-
represented groups at the Cosyne meeting. Travel awards and a variety of
outreach activities are planned for the 2012, 2013, and 2014 meetings.
