Boston University's Manufacturing Engineering Department is continuing a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates program which provides support for
undergraduates to participate in research in the area of modeling, analysis, and
control of engineering systems. The program emphasizes flexible manufacturing
systems, robotics, and process control. The Manufacturing Engineering Department
believes that research experiences provide excellent education opportunities for
undergraduates. By getting involved in research activities, undergraduates can
be better interactive with graduate students and faculty. They can also be
exposed to real problems and be more motivated.
