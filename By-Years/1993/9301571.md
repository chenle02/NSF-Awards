9301571 Raizen This program will investigate atom-field interactions with
trapped ions using a novel linear rf ion trap. This trap, combined with laser
cooling techniques, will allow high accuracy in spectroscopic studies of trapped
ions. The spectroscopy will be used to study a broad range of experiments in
fundamental physics including interference of the fluorescence from two atoms,
collective behavior of atoms in an optical cavity, and single and several atom
optical bistability. Possible extensions to conditional quantum measurements
will be considered. The long term goal of the proposed research is an
experimental study of single atom optical bistability.
