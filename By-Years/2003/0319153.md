This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project proposes to
develop an innovative approach to fluorescence microscopy that will provide high
spatial resolution and improved contrast. As demonstrated from previous work,
the proposed fluorescence microscope is unique because it provides simultaneous
measurement of lifetime decay profiles at multiple wavelengths. The addition of
simultaneous spectral and temporal resolution to the fluorescence microscope
will enhance their utility and allow the design of more sophisticated
fluorescence experiments for structural and functional imaging of cellular and
sub-cellular systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of the
product to be developed in this project will be as an instrumentation useful to
researchers across many areas of biological and medical sciences. Additional
medical applications such as endoscopic probes for the identification of tissue
types and abnormal tissue based on differences in fluorescence spectral and
lifetime properties are also envisioned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
