9314187 Edwards This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in stellar astronomy and astrophysics between research groups from Five Colleges
Incorporated, Amherst, Massachusetts, and the Astronomical Observatory in
Grenoble, France. Five Colleges Incorporated is a consortium of astronomy
departments of Smith, Amherst, Mount Holyoke, Hampshire College and the
University of Massachusetts. Suzan Edwards of Smith College and the Director of
the Grenoble Observatory, Claude Bertout, are the principal investigators and
team leaders. The objective of their research is to study the physical
relationship and the origin of solar winds and accretion disks that surround
very young stars. The U.S. investigators are observational astronomers and
assembled and analyzed a collection of data on T Tauri stars. Their research
will be complemented by the theoretical star formation group in Grenoble, who
will interpret the data. Solar winds appear to play vital role in star
formation. Their origin and characteristics will advance our understanding of
how new stars are created. ***
