9308339 Papadopoulos This research will address certain novel variational
formulations of boundary- and initial-value problems in contact mechanics, which
are amenable to discrete approximation by finite element methods. The context of
the analysis is set to encompass problems involving contacting bodies that may
undergo arbitrarily large motions and deformations. ***
