This research project develops ideas and designs that can be used to fingerprint
or authenticate computer hardware, to generate cryptographic keys, or form basis
of new security protocols, all leveraging the physical properties of the
computer hardware. Especially, the focus of this research is on commodity
memories found in today's computers, and the work advances fundamental
understanding of how the physical properties of memories can be used in computer
security. By focusing on hardware already present in commodity computing
devices, the ideas developed in this research can be readily deployed. Through
development of professional and educational activities, and interaction with
international colleagues, this project also supports dissemination of research
ideas to a broad audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To advance the hardware security
research field, this research project explores the cell decay effects in Dynamic
Random Access Memories (DRAMs) and applies them to the design of DRAM-based
Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs), as well as to development of new virtual
proofs of reality and Physical Cryptography primitives, all based on commodity
DRAMs. Through design of a manual refresh approach, this research shows how the
DRAM's properties can be measured even if DRAM is part of a commodity computer
system and actively used by software. Environmental impacts on DRAM are also
evaluated and understanding is developed of how the environment affects DRAM-
based security primitives. In addition, this research tackles challenges such as
theoretical and mathematical issues of developing error correction schemes for
use with DRAM PUFs, or practical issues of accelerating DRAM PUF readout time.
