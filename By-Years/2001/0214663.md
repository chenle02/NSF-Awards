This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop chitosan-derivatives through proprietary chemistries for use as
additives in oil and gas drilling fluids. For this specific application, it is
important to tailor the viscoelastic properties of the chitosan derivatives.
Since little is known about how polymer structure affects polymer properties, a
combinatorial approach will be used on this project to screen for the
viscoelastic properties of the derivatives. Specifically, a high throughput
mechanical screen will be adapted and examined, with the results from the screen
correlated with more extensive viscoelastic measurements.

The commercial application of this project will be in the additives market for
oil and gas exploration.
