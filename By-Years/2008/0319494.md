This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
feasibility of a gas analyzer based on microplasma emission. Current
technologies capable of identifying and quantifying gas partial pressures are
not well suited to operation in the 1 mTorr to 1 Torr pressure regime typically
used in semiconductor and other vacuum processing. The gas analyzer proposed
here would vastly improve the quality of process diagnostics and control, and
allow for cost effective real time control in a variety of industries. This
project will investigate scaling of microplasma sources to low pressures and
small dimensions as well as optical diagnostics of these novel plasma. A gas
analysis system capable of operation at &lt;10mTorr, &lt;ppm detection limit,
power consumption &lt;5 W, and occupying a volume of &lt;2000 cm3 will be
demonstrated. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The gas analyzer will immediately be
applied in semiconductor manufacturing where it will be used for wafer
qualification, system fingerprinting, process diagnostics and control, and as a
monitor of system emissions. Spin-offs into other industries which utilize
vacuum processing (data storage, industrial coating, etc) as well as into
scientific apparatus can be expected. &lt;br/&gt;
