Ferris State College will construct a solar telescope to use in introductory
astronomy courses. The components will be a heliostat, a dual projection system,
and an imaging system including a hydrogen-alpha filter and low-light television
camera. The telescope will be permanently mounted and used for a variety of
kinds of solar observations. These include observing sunspots and other solar
features, the solar spectra, solar rotation, and projection viewing of the moon
and bright planets. In this way students may make detailed observations of and
measurements on the nearest star. The solar telescope will enhance substantially
the experience of astronomy students.
