This project is making efforts to see a national replication/dissemination of
the New York Hall of Science's successful "Science Career Ladder", a career
access program targeted to women and minorities. The funds are being used to
develop materials including a videotape and manual for us by replication sites.
The initial replication is taking place at 25 science-technology centers and was
begun with a Conference. Together, the conference and materials are providing an
information and support system for replication of the Science Career Ladder at
other sites. The Science Career Ladder model recruits junior and senior high
school women and minorities as Explainers for the museum, and is motivating them
to become precollege teachers of science. It is a program aimed at enriching the
experience for the students when they go on to undergraduate schools and are
preparing to be teachers. The high school students gain experience and knowledge
through being trained as Explainers, and are then moved more deeply into the
workings of the museum, both exhibits and scientific research, as
undergraduates. The program is carried out in collaboration with five public
colleges in the New York metropolitan area.
