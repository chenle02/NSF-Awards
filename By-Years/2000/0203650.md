This award is for an 18 month deployment of 43 PASSCAL broad band seismometers
in Nicaragua and Costa Rica to seismically image the mantle "subduction factory"
of the Central American volcanic arc in the region. In addition to the PASSCAL
instruments, the PIs will also collaborate with Costa Rican and Nicaraguan
seismologists to use data from existing short period and broadband instruments.
The experiment will image the mantle wedge with receiver functions and other
converted waves, together with regional waveform inversions. Tomographic imaging
will be used to try to map the region of slab dewatering (and intermediate depth
earthquake generation), melt generation and melt migration in the mantle wedge.
Patterns of mantle flow will be interpreted from shear wave splitting data, and
crustal structure will be inferred from receiver functions. Overall, the idea is
to infer the workings of the subduction factory by combining seismic images of
the crust and mantle with the modeled interpretations of large observed
differences in magma composition along strike in the arc
volcanoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
