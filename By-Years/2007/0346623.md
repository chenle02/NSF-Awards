The focus of this research involves the development of methodology for use of
organozinc reagents as selective quinone alkylating agents. Mechanistic studies
will stress regiochemistry, chemoselectivity and the presence or absence of free
radical intermediates. The reagents will be used to synthesize mono- and
dialkylated naphthoquinones, pyranoquinone derivatives and alpha-substituted
quinone derivatives of esters. Undergraduate co-workers will form an important
part of the research effort.

With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Carl T. Wigal
in the Department of Chemistry at Lebanon Valley College. Professor Wigal will
focus his research efforts on developing methodology for the use of organozinc
reagents for the preparation of polysubstituted quinones that will serve as
precursors for the synthesis of complex molecules having biological
significance. There is potential for broader impact of the work for the
pharmaceutical industry and the project presents an excellent arena for the
training of undergraduate students.
