This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores reaction
cascades that lead to facile C-H bond functionalization. The focus is on
studying reaction cascades that are initiated by intra- or intermolecular
hydride shift events that result in the formation of an electrophile/nucleophile
pair. Subsequent combination of electrophile and nucleophile leads to the rapid
increase of molecular complexity without the generation of byproducts. The use
of catalytic approaches is an integral part of these investigations as a means
of lowering activation barriers and to allow for the discovery of yet unknown
rearrangements of broad applicability. An important goal is the development of
catalytic enantioselective variants of hydride shift
reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Daniel Seidel of the
Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Rutgers, The State University of
New Jersey. Professor Seidel's research efforts revolve around the development
of facile methods for organic synthesis with an emphasis on asymmetric
catalysis. Such chemistry will contribute to environmentally benign methods for
chemical synthesis. The successful development of the methodology will provide
rapid access to valuable compounds of relevance to the pharmaceutical and
agricultural industries. Furthermore, this project provides an ideal training
ground to prepare the next generation of researchers in the chemical sciences.
