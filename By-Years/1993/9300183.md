This award provides funds to the Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences at
Washington University to continue a successful REU Site. Each summer, about 36
undergraduates from diverse collegiate and ethnic backgrounds will spend 10
weeks engaged in developmental biology research at the University. Mentors will
be selected by the students from about 40 faculty members who have active, well-
funded research groups and who study developmental mechanisms in a wide range of
experimental systems. The emphasis will be on getting each student actively
engaged in increasingly independent research in one of these productive research
groups. However, to permit students to view their own research in a broader
context, the program will provide five types of supplemental activities: (i)
workshops dealing with important model organisms, methods and paradigms in
contemporary developmental biology research, (ii) faculty seminars designed
specifically for the students, (iii) participation in the existing Developmental
Biology Journal Club, (iv) a parallel journal club run by and for the students
themselves and (v) an end-of-summer research retreat at which all students will
present papers summarizing their research accomplishments. Opportunities for
frequent peer-group social interactions will also be provided.
