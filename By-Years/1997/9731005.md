9731005 Vogt Hormones control many changes in the nervous systems of humans and
other animals throughout life, yet relatively little is know regarding the
actual mechanisms by which hormones regulate nervous system development. Dr.
Vogt will examine how steroid hormones control the birth of sensory nerve cells
during the sexual maturation phase of adult development, using an insect
olfactory system as a model. The study system is well characterized, is
accessible to experimental analysis and manipulation, and has close parallels
with other animal models. A great deal is known about the genetics of sensory
nerve cell formation, but as yet little is known about the mechanisms of hormone
action on nerve cell formation. Dr. Vogt has previously shown that steroid
hormones present during development can control the timing and patterns of nerve
cell birth, as well as the expression of genes which themselves control sensory
neuron development. He will now identify specific mechanisms by which steroid
hormones control the birth of new nerve cells. The results from this project
will enrich our understanding of basic cell biological processes at work in
sensory development. Further, because of the use of an insect model, the project
will provide insight for the design of new strategies for insect control in
olfactory-based predation of crop plants and olfactory-based host seeking and
mate seeking behaviors.
