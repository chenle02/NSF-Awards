This project introduces over 156 undergraduates per year to automated inspection
techniques for quality control in flexible manufacturing. Students use a
coordinate measuring machine and a two camera vision system for precision
measurement; to set machine tools in machine tool holders; to conduct machine
tool capability studies; and to perform a 100% inspection of parts before and
after machining operations. This is significant for the Computer Integrated
Manufacturing Technology major at Western Kentucky because it provides the
student hands-on experience with automated inspection instrumentation prior to
entry into industry. This award is being matched by an equal amount from the
principal investigator's institution.
