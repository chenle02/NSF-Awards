Title: Symposium -- Frontiers in Biomagnetic Particles

INTELLECTUAL MERIT: It is proposed to conduct a three-day symposium on the
characterization and control of magnetic particles. They have a variety of uses
in therapeutic and diagnostic applications relevant to the Biomaterials program.
The funds will be used to support travel awards for graduate students,
postdoctorals students, and faculty, including those from underrepresented
groups. Magnetic carriers are unique nano-materials with a wide range of
biomedical, environmental, and technological impacts. This event will bring
scientists, engineers, medical professionals, and program managers together to
discuss this rapidly growing and highly interdisciplinary field. Magnetic
particles are an enabling technology for a wide variety of biomedical, chemical,
electronic, and functional materials research, because they provide a unique
handle to manipulate and sense nanostructures.

BROADER IMPACTS: Funding from NSF will be used to support financial assistance
to early-stage researchers who may otherwise be unable to attend this meeting.
Funding priority will be given to graduate students attending their first
national meeting, junior faculty giving an oral presentation, and researchers
belonging to underrepresented groups. The existence of potential funding for
student travel will be described in advertisements for the symposium to enhance
student interest. In addition, both organizers of this meeting are junior
faculty in the early stages of their careers. Because this field benefits
especially well from cross-fertilization of ideas from chemistry, biology,
physics, and engineering, the symposium will create a technical and social
environment in which participants from diverse disciplines can discuss trends in
research and form fruitful collaborations.
