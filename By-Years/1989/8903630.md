This work will apply transmission electron microscopy, analysis, and
diffraction to several problems of petrological, geochemical, and geophysical
importance. Rock-forming minerals can contain populations of submicroscopic
inclusions that contain trace and minor elements, which may be significant for
processes such as partial melting. It will be determined whether such inclusion
dissolve prior to melting and the kinetics of the dissolution process. In situ
studies of phase transformations in minerals will be continued. A combination of
TEM, SEM, and electron microprobe analysis will be used to examine in detail the
reactions and fluid flow regimes that occur during low-grade metamorphism of
shale in the central Swiss Alps. Mechanisms of weathering that produce the
detrital input for Abert Lake, an alkaline, saline lake in an arid environment,
will be determined. The mineralogical and chemical changes occurring in the
clays of the lake sediments during diagenesis will be analyzed. These changes
have been shown to control the geochemistry of the lake waters.
