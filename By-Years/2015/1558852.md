The Hawaiian Islands are the product of a volcanic hot spot in the middle of the
North Pacific. Hence every living thing on this isolated archipelago has origins
elsewhere. This project will investigate the origins of Hawaiian reef fishes,
which are important both as a food source and a cultural touchstone in native
Hawaiian communities. Two prominent hypotheses maintain that marine fish
originally arrived from the south (Line Islands and Johnston Atoll) or from the
west (Japan). To test these hypotheses, this research will augment existing
specimens from Hawaii with expeditions to Johnston Atoll (closest shallow
habitat to the south), the northern Line Islands (Palmyra), southern Line
Islands (Christmas Island), and Ryukyu Islands and Ogasawara Islands in Japan.
Advanced genetic techniques will be used to resolve the closest relatives to the
Hawaiian fish species and the pathways by which reef species colonize Hawaii and
help establish patterns of biodiversity. In cases where Hawaiian species are
closely related to widespread sister species, this project will detect hotspots
of genetic divergence. Because this research will reveal the sources of Hawaiian
marine biodiversity, results can be used to help define priorities for reef
protection. The project will support two graduate students and train at least
two more in all aspects of the project from rebreather diving, specimen
collection and curation, information management, and advanced genetic
techniques. There will be outreach efforts to schools through existing programs,
and expedition teams will include a videographer to provide footage for the
award-winning Voice of the Sea program, broadcast locally. Expeditions will also
include an outreach specialist to handle media reports and promote awareness and
concern for reefs in the communities surrounding study sites.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will sample a suite of 20 reef fishes at
locations to the south (Johnston and Line Islands) and west (Ogasawara and
Ryukyu Islands) of Hawaii to resolve the origins of Hawaiian biodiversity. The
investigators will employ both population genetics (shifts in genotype
frequencies) and phylogenetics (DNA sequence divergence) for more ancient
separations to test their hypotheses. Restriction-digest associated DNA
sequencing (RAD-seq) will be employed for the phylogeography, phylogenetics, and
population biology studies because it provides high coverage of homologous
portions of the genome from multiple individuals for comparatively low cost and
effort.
