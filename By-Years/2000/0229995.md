Minarik&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0229995&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mantle xenoliths and
ophiolites (preserved oceanic lithosphere) from eastern North America will be
studied with the purpose of constraining the evolution of mantle lithosphere
from the Archean through the Mesozoic Atlantic rifting. These two different
suites sample different mantle regions and will return complementary information
on the evolution of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle, and the convecting
athenospheric mantle which gives rise to oceanic lithosphere. The first goal of
this work is to characterize a set of mantle xenoliths found in lamprophyre
dikes and kimberlites in upstate New York, Vermont, and Quebec. These xenoliths
hold information about the evolution of the mantle under eastern North America
from the Archean to the Cretaceous.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The second goal will
be to determine the Re-Os systematics of chromites from tectonically emplaced
ophiolites spanning the length of the Appalachians. These ophiolites all
crystallized and were emplaced within a short period of time during the
Ordovician. This sample set will allow an evaluation of the heterogeneity of the
convecting mantle with respect to osmium isotopes, and of the possible role of
subducting slab-derived osmium during the formation of supra-subduction zone
ocean lithosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate student researchers will
perform much of the work outlined in this proposal as part of independent
research or senior thesis projects. The major contributions of this study will
be a better understanding of the processes of creation of lithosphere during
mountain-building events. &lt;br/&gt;
