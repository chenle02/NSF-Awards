The University of Texas Austin (UTA) requests incremental funding for shipboard
technician activities associated with the research vessel LONGHORN, a 103-foot
vessel. The LONGHORN is owned and operated by UTA. It is based at the UTA Marine
Science Institute in Port Aransas, TX. The ship and its crew will support NSF-
funded research in the Gulf of Mexico. The UTA technician will be responsible
for operating and repairing instruments while at sea, maintaining instruments
ashore and assisting with scientific operations as necessary before and after
cruises. ??
