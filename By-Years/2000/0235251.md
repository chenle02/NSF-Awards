Geminiviruses replicate their small DNA genomes in mature plant cells using host
DNA replication enzymes. Infected cells also replicate host chromosomal DNA but
do not undergo cell division. The uncoupling of DNA replication and cell
division - or endoreduplication - is a common developmental event in plants and
animals. The overall goal is to characterize a novel protein kinase that occurs
in endoreduplicating leaf cells and is induced by geminivirus infection. The
first aim is compare the properties of the kinase and second, closely related
protein to determine if one or both of them play a role in endoreduplication and
infection. The second aim is to determine the impact of altering kinase
expression on leaf development and viral infection. The third aim will identify
proteins that interact with the kinase and may be phosphorylation targets. The
research will increase understanding of the mechanisms that control plant
development and disease as well provide insight into basic eukayotic processes.
The research may lead to new strategies for altering plant growth, resulting
higher yields and shorter growing seasons, and new methods for controlling
geminivirus disease. The research will provide training in state-of-the-art
molecular, cellular and genomic technologies for scientists at all levels of
their education.
