Individuals who have an interdisciplinary outlook and a strong quantitative
background will be in high demand to meet the future scientific and
technological workforce needs. The purpose of this project is to increase the
number of successful graduates in the sciences and mathematics and to enhance
their level of quantitative skills through a program called Q-STEP. A
fundamental activity of the Q-STEP program is the creation of a community of
scholars in the quantitative sciences. This community of scholars provides a
supportive social network, increased chances for group study and problem-
solving, peer tutoring, and opportunities for early and consistent involvement
in undergraduate research. As part o this project, faculty are redesigning the
undergraduate mathematics and science courses so that they incorporate best
practices for effective instruction including experiential learning, group
exercises, and a consistent clear demonstration of the relevance of the various
disciplines to each other and to the real world. The impact of the project is
being rigorously assessed for student learning, motivation, and retention.
Project dissemination is occurring widely through the web and through various
national and regional venues.
