Abstract 9728027 Lederer An international symposium on "Mechanisms and Functions
of Local Calcium Signaling" will be held September, 1998 to disseminate latest
advances in this field. The meeting, which is the 52nd Annual Symposium of the
Society of General Physiologists, will focus on the mechanisms by which
localized calcium signals are generated within cells, and on the diverse
consequences of these signals for cell function. The latest findings on this
topic will be presented. Lectures by leaders in the field will cover aspects of
local calcium signaling in diverse systems including both excitable cells
(neurons, muscle, neuroendocrine) as well as non-excitable cells (lymphocytes,
oocytes). Poster sessions and six short talks devoted to late breaking results
are also included. The goal of this meeting is to bring together a diverse group
of researchers to discuss and compare the latest findings in the field of local
calcium signaling. It is anticipated that the conference will not only provide
the current state of knowledge, but will also play an important role in
identifying new directions for future research in this field.
