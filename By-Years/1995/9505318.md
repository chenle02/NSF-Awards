This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the Promotion of Science
Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Salvador G. Alvarez, Department of Chemistry,
University of California, Santa Cruz. This fellowship opportunity will enable
Dr. Alvarez to begin a collaborative research effort with Professor Isao
Shimizu, Department of Applied Chemistry, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan. The
investigators propose a new method for the convergent asymmetric synthesis of
1-alpha, 25-dihydroxy-vitamin-D3 via the synthesis of the CD-ring fragment. This
analogue of vitamin-D3 is an active steroid hormone and is a leading drug
candidate for treating osteoporosis, a common disease with older populations.
The proposed project provides a general synthesis of vitamin-D3 metabolites and
their analogues for the exploration of structure activity relationship studies.
This 12-month visit by Dr. Alvarez will provide him with a potential for future
collaborative activities between the United States and Japan. As a postdoctoral
fellow, Dr. Alvarez will have the opportunity to become familiar with novel
research methodologies and steroid chemistry at Waseda University while
contributing to the overall research effort. Therefore, this proposal fulfills
the objectives of the program in its exchange and transfer of scientific
knowledge through an international collaboration.
