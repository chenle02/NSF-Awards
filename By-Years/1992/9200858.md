The purpose is to develop a language and methodology for specifying the
requirements and design of concurrent distributed real-time systems, including
the monitored and controlled physical environment. A new, complete, and
executable notation, called communicating real-time state machines (CRSM), is
proposed as a basis. They are essentially state machines that communicate
synchronously over one-directional channels; in addition, CRSM has a novel and
small set of facilities for describing timing properties and for accessing real
time. The research consists of five related parts. The first is to define
further and implement the basic CRSM model. Another is to develop a structuring
scheme that permits the composition of machines and their parts into higher
level entities. A third is to design a methodology that combines the state-based
CRSM approach with an object-oriented model. A fourth part of the research is to
develop formal reasoning methods and tools, for proving and testing assertions
about specifications. Lastly, specification experiments will be performed on
some substantial applications.
