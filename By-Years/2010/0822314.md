SRI is developing a formative assessment intervention that integrates existing
classroom network technologies (GroupScribbles and Classroom Performance
Systems), interactive formative assessments, and contingent curriculum
activities to help teachers adjust instruction to improve middle school student
learning of selected Earth science concepts (the rock cycle, forces that shape
Earth's surface, and plate tectonics). To test the hypothesis that integrating
response system technology, assessment, and curriculum can improve K-12 science
teaching and learning, the project is developing and testing (1) pedagogical
routines for teachers to follow when using classroom network technologies, (2)
diagnostic questions for teachers to elicit student preconceptions, (3) decision
rules for teachers to use alternative learning activities that supplement an
existing geoscience curriculum, (4) training materials that prepare teachers to
enact the intervention, and (5) research- and classroom-based instruments that
measure changes in teacher instructional practice, student thinking, and student
achievement. The intervention is being tested in two urban school districts
located in two western states (Colorado and California) that have ethnically and
economically diverse student populations.
