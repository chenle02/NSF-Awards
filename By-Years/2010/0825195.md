Polymer clay nanocomposites appear poised to become an attractive new class of
engineering materials. Polyethylene is the most widely used polymer in
engineering products. Adding nanoclay to polyethylene can greatly enhance the
mechanical properties; however, the effect on the long-term performance is less
known. Polyethylene is susceptible to oxidation which is minimized by adding
antioxidants. Once antioxidants are completely consumed, oxidation degradation
begins and subsequently leads to material deterioration. The depletion mechanism
of antioxidants in polyethylene nanoclay composites will be assessed based on
thermo-oxidation in dry and wet environments. The non-oxidization behavior of
antioxidants in the nanocomposite will be characterized by identifying their
physical adsorption onto the surface of nanoclay as well as their hydrolysis
sensitivity. The diffusion of oxygen into the nanocomposite and reaction with
antioxidants will be determined and modeled to obtain the intrinsic oxidation
rate constant. The critical microscopic properties that could serve as
precursors for the onset of macroscopic property change will be established.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this project will have broader
impacts on engineering materials and will strengthen graduate and undergraduate
education. By employing chemistry and materials testing approaches, this project
will facilitate multidisciplinary collaboration and provide a platform for
graduate and undergraduate students to work together in materials science and
engineering disciplines. This project will also serve as a vehicle for
introducing innovative new materials to civil engineering students. The research
findings can be beneficial to many civil engineering sectors where polyethylene
products are used as essential components of the system.&lt;br/&gt;
