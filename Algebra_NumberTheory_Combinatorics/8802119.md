The research project supported concerns three aspects of invariant theory and
algebraic transformation groups. First, the principal investigator will show
that a reductive group action on complex n-dimensional space with suitable
conditions is linearizable. Second, recent work of the principal investigator in
the compact case will be extended to the general situation. Third, the
invariants of G(2) will be examined. The research supported is in the area of
invariant theory and algebraic groups. In general, invariant theory involves the
actions of linear algebraic groups on manifolds or linear spaces and the
determination of the mathematical invariants of the space under these group
actions.
