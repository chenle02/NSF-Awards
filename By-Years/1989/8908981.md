This project concerns the study of reciprocal diffusions, second order
stochastic differential equations and system of nonlinear conservation laws. The
Principal Investigator has recently developed a theory of second order,
reciprocal diffusion processes. This generalizes the well known first order
theory of Markov diffusion. First and second order are with respect to time
differences and differentiations. The Principal Investigator has shown that a
reciprocal diffusion process satisfies a stochastic differential equation of
second order appropriately defined. The density, mean momentum and mean momentum
flux satisfy a system of nonlinear conservation laws similar to those of fluid
mechanics. Applications of these ideas in stochastic integration, fluid
mechanics, stochastic optimal control, and quantum mechanics will be explored.
