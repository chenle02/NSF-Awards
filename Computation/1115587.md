A group led by the PI has successfully developed a software package, HOM4PS-2.0,
implementing the "polyhedral homotopy continuation" method for solving
polynomial systems. The solver leads existing software packages for solving
polynomial systems in speed by a large margin. The essence of the proposed
project is the further development in all aspects of the solver HOM4PS-2.0. In
particular, for the need of solving larger polynomial systems, a major aspect of
the project is the advanced development of the parallel version of the solver.
The landscape of computation hardware is quite different from even a decade ago.
Developments in new processor design and network technology have allowed
supercomputers and computer clusters to grow larger and faster than ever,
including new ideas such as cycle scavenging, grid computing, virtual
supercomputers, multiple cores, and GPUs (graphics processing units). The
proposed project will investigate and implement versions of HOM4PS-2.0 that take
optimum advantage of heterogeneous computing platforms, with special emphasis on
clusters, cloud computing, multicore and GPUs. In addition we plan to find ways
to implement highly serial parts of the original algorithm, such as mixed volume
computation and path-jumping detection on parallel architectures. The proposed
project intends to fully incorporate all the cutting-edge parallel computing
technologies in our solver for solving larger and larger polynomial systems.

The problem of solving polynomial systems arises very frequently in various
fields of science and engineering, such as, formula construction, geometric
intersection, inverse kinematics, robotics, computer vision and the computation
of equilibrium states of chemical reaction equations, etc. Science and
engineering problems pose an increasing demand for solving larger and larger
polynomial systems. To deal with such large systems, more computing resources
are needed to greatly enlarge the capability of our solver, HOM4PS-2.0. For this
purpose the parallelization of the original algorithms becomes inevitably
essential. Computational technology is experiencing a major sea change in which
one either rides the wave or goes under. To embrace this challenge, the core of
the project is to fully incorporate the cutting-edge parallel computing
technologies for solving larger and larger polynomial systems. The ultimate goal
is a more powerful suite of high-quality software package which will provide the
scientific community a reliable source for solving polynomial systems in
practice.
