9303924 Trimble The principal focus of this research is the development of
expert systems for instructional purposes. The investigator will draw on
previous work on knowledge acquisition in system dynamics (SD), an extensive
literature search, direct communication with other researchers at Morris Brown,
and participation in significant National and International Conferences.
Knowledge from over 30 SD experts has been captured through interviews, and a
Delhi exercise. The manipulation of this knowledge to develop a knowledge base
for an expert system is a key aspect of this research. Open issues regarding
protocol analysis will be addressed. This research will present a case for the
most effective protocol analysis techniques in this situation.
