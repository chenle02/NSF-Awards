In 1985, a major research effort in the eastern Mediterranean Basin began.
Since that time, a number of physical oceanographic observations have been made
by a number of countries participating in the research. This effort is to
synthesize the observations via several different numerical models. The PI's
have a heirarchy of models to address the general circulation of the
Mediterranean, the formation of the Levantine water mass, and the role of
mesoscale features in the region.
