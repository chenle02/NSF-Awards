Graduate student Warren Hauk, under the supervision of adviser Clifford Parks
at the University of North Carolina, is developing molecular datasets to address
fundamental phylogenetic problems surrounding the Ophioglossaceae, which is
generally regarded as the most primitive of extant fern families. DNA sequencing
of both a plastid and nuclear gene will be used to evaluate existing
morphological analyses. Preliminary analyses demonstrated amounts of sequence
divergence appropriate to address relationships not only among families and
genera but also to the level of cryptis species, which many species in
Botrychium subgenus Botrychium have been designated. Comparisons of plastid and
nuclear genes will permit evaluation of the hybrid origin of putative
allopolyploid species. Morphological and anatomical characters used in previous
phylogenetic studies will be reanalyzed and compared to (and possibly combined
with molecular trees.
