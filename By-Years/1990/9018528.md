The fellowship research and training will be carried out by Dr. Ann Bucklin in
the laboratory of Mitchell Sogin, Director of the Molecular Evolution Program at
the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole. Molecular techniques will be used
to sequence the mitochondrial ribosomal RNA genes of several oceanic planktonic
copepods. Sequencing will be done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplification of the genes, using conserved and newly-designed primers, and a
modification of the Sanger dideoxynucleotide sequencing method. Sequences of
both small (12S) and large (16S) subunit rRNA genes and their flanking regions
will be obtained. Intra- and interspecific variability in these sequences will
be quantified in order to evaluate their use as indicators of population genetic
and evolutionary phenomena. It is anticipated that mitochondrial rRNA genes will
prove to be useful indicators of population genetic structure and gene flow
patterns in oceanic copepods. Conserved regions of the rRNA genes may be useful
to examine phylogenetic relationships within copepod or other crustacean
families, and will provide interesting comparisons with similar studies using
genomic indicators.
