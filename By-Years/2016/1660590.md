Through funding support from a Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Capacity
Building grant, the "Building Capacity to Produce Culturally Competent STEM
Teachers" project will develop secondary teacher preparation programs in
physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics and interdisciplinary physical
sciences. Robust degree programs aimed at producing well-prepared high school
teachers in fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
are a national priority that underpin progress in science, the advancement of
national health initiatives, and overall national prosperity in an increasingly
technical economy. Placing successful STEM teachers in high-need school
districts and ensuring the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM
fields are essential. This Noyce project will address this critical need through
developing programs, curriculum, and pedagogies that incorporate effective,
research-based practices in STEM disciplinary fields and that include preservice
teacher training in cultural awareness and social justice.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because this project will be led by Texas Lutheran
University (TLU), a small Hispanic-serving liberal arts college, it will
establish the infrastructure to produce uniquely trained middle and high school
STEM teachers, prepared to serve in rural, high-need school districts in south
central Texas. New collaborations among faculty in science, mathematics and
education, coupled with expansion of education partnerships with south central
Texas high-need school districts will serve as a foundation for the project. As
a part of the project's efforts in developing the STEM teacher preparation
degree plans, collaborations will be established between TLU science,
mathematics and education departments.
