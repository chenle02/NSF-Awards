Long-term Research: Sulphur Diagenesis: Paleolimnological Implications This
award recommendation is made under the Program for Long and Medium-Term Research
at Foreign Centers of Excellence. The program is designed to enable young U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research abroad at research
institutions of proven excellence. Awards provide opportunities for the conduct
of joint research and the utilization of unique or complementary facilities,
expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries. The award will
support Dr. Noel Urban, University of Minnesota, for a fifteen-month research
visit with Dr. Kerry Kelts, Swiss Federal Institute for Water Resources and
Water Pollution Control, Swiss Technical Institute, Zurich, Switzerland. The
award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate, international
travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents allowance, if applicable, and a
flat administrative allowance of $250.00 for the U.S. home institution.
