The goals of the present project are designed to investigate the molecular
mechanism of regulation of the pathway of glutamate generation from gamma-
aminobutyrate (GABA) in Bacillus subtilis. The most interesting component of
this pathway is GabR, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)- and GABA-dependent
transcriptional activator that regulates expression of an operon that encodes
two enzymes of GABA utilization. GabR is a member of a novel family of unusual
proteins that apparently evolved by joining a DNA-binding domain to an
aminotransferase domain. Of particular interest is the requirement for PLP (an
essential catalytic cofactor of aminotransferases) and the apparent PLP-binding
site of GabR for transcriptional activation. The preliminary data indicate that,
in order to activate expression of the target genes, GabR performs (at least) a
partial aminotransferase reaction. The main goal of the project will be to show
that GabR activity as a transcriptional activator is modulated by GabR-catalyzed
transamination of its cofactor PLP, using GABA as an amino group donor. This
goal will be achieved by analyzing interactions between GabR and its
coactivators, by utilizing structural analogs of PLP and GABA, and by
characterization of mutant GabR proteins defective in transcription activation
or able to activate transcription constitutively. GabR properties as a specific
DNA-binding protein will be characterized. GabR will be the first member of this
protein family to be subjected to detailed biochemical and molecular analysis
and will provide clues to the mechanism of action of other GabR-like proteins.
Because the aminotransferase reaction requires an amino group-containing
substrate, the prediction is that all GabR-like proteins have such compounds as
their effectors.
