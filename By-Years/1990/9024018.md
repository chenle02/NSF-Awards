This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made to Dr. Marcia J.
Rieke of the Steward Observatory, University of Arizona. The NSF Faculty Award
for Women Scientists and Engineers recognizes the high quality of the awardee's
record in teaching and scholarship as well as the potential for continued
significant contributions to scientific research, the academic profession, and
the education of future scientists. A period of rapid technological growth in
infrared detectors for use in astronomy is allowing astronomers to address
problems that could only be dreamed about five years ago. Dr. Rieke will be
carrying out studies aimed at understanding the formation and evolution of
galaxies. This is now possible because of the availability of infrared (IR)
cameras which operate at sensitivity levels far beyond the simple photometry of
the past decade. The utility of studying high-redshift galaxies at infrared
wavelengths stems from the fact that the energy distribution of the
electromagnetic emissions from galaxies peaks in the infrared part of the
spectrum and hence galaxies appear brightest in the infrared at all redshifts.
The infrared emission is sensitive to the bulk of the stellar population. Early
infrared data on high redshift galaxies confirms expectations about the nature
of the stars in these galaxies which of necessity were selected mainly from
lists of radio galaxies. A new, more sensitive IR camera is being prepared for
use, and will allow many issues associated with high redshift galaxies to be
addressed. The long-standing question of whether radio galaxies are typical
elliptical galaxies and hence suitable for use in cosmological work will be the
primary study. Other research centering on understanding the nature of galaxies
observed in deep infrared surveys will be carried out.//
