This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will apply
silicon optical bench technology to manufacture lasers which are low-cost and
ultra-compact. Diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) lasers have yet to achieve mass-
market penetration because of costs associated with current manufacturing
techniques and laser designs. This Phase I addresses the fundamental laser
design necessary to allow batch processing and miniaturization. The research
will: demonstrate a miniaturized single frequency diode laser in a novel
configuration; demonstrate frequency-doubling of this laser into the blue using
passive optical locking;and demonstrate use of silicon optical bench technology
for mounting components used in these lasers. The work will involve implementing
frequency control of a laser diode using a miniaturized Fox-Smith
interferometer. Cavity components will be designed, fabricated, assembled; and
the laser performance will be characterized. This laser will be frequency-
doubled into the blue using a small potassium niobate insert in the cavity. In
parallel, design and processing of silicon wafers for mounting will be
investigated using photolithography and anisotropic etching. Low-cost blue
lasers will find important applications in the consumer optical data storage
market. WDM communications and cable TV represent large markets for 1.3 micron
lasers. Green versions will replace inefficient helium-neon lasers in laser
pointers and other applications. Lower volume markets exist in printed circuit
board inspection, instrumentation, and materials processing.
