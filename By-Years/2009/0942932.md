Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a two-course project-
based robotics curriculum at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville (TAMUK) with
the joint efforts of the Departments of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical
Engineering, and Computer Science. The content and stages of the new courses,
Robotics I and Robotics II, are aligned with the IEEE Region 5 student robotics
competition such that teaching of relevant material and building of a robot, as
required by the criteria set by IEEE Region 5, are carried out simultaneously.
Students in the robotics courses also engage in mentoring activities for South
Texas area high school students who participate in the annual TAMUK robotics
competition. The course is offered as an elective to any student enrolled at
TAMUK.
