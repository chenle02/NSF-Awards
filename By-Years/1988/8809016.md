This project involves basic research into the mathematical properties of
statistical procedures. Of special interest are questions of admissibility of
common parametric estimators. For example, the least squares estimator of a
regression parameter or of such a parameter after selection based on the data
will be studied. Also of interest are the conditional properties of such
estimators and related confidence procedures, non-parametric estimates of
density function, (nearly) distribution free confidence bands and tests for
multivariate distribution functions. This research in statistics focuses on the
mathematical properties of estimators. Insight derived from this research will
assist the development of statistical methodologies and improve the application
of statistics in many scientific fields.
