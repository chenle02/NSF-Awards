Suppose one wants to understand the similarities between two,
very&lt;br/&gt;large, unknown networks from an application domain, e.g.,
brain&lt;br/&gt;networks, gene expression networks, or protein networks. There
are two&lt;br/&gt;associated problems that are far from trivial: how to
quantify&lt;br/&gt;similarity, and how to detect it in a reasonable amount of
time,&lt;br/&gt;considering that the networks can have millions or billions
of&lt;br/&gt;connections. Researchers have used methods inspired by
combinatorics&lt;br/&gt;and network theory, but so far these methods have run
into many&lt;br/&gt;complexity-theoretic barriers and it is not clear whether
they can&lt;br/&gt;capture true functional similarities of
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A more recent approach is based on spectral graph
theory, which is the&lt;br/&gt;expertise of the investigator. In particular, the
approach taken here&lt;br/&gt;is an original application of graph Laplacians and
quantitative&lt;br/&gt;algorithms around real quadratic forms. There are
numerous natural and&lt;br/&gt;unexplored algorithmic and complexity-theoretic
questions in this area&lt;br/&gt;that the investigator will pursue. A
particularly interesting aspect&lt;br/&gt;of this proposal is how it is related
to the graph isomorphism&lt;br/&gt;problem, but deals with relaxations that
potentially enable&lt;br/&gt;circumventing this venerable barrier. The
investigator, with his&lt;br/&gt;established connections with biologists and
health scientists, will&lt;br/&gt;also apply his work toward more practical
software for network&lt;br/&gt;alignment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
