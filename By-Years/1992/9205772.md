This study proposes to extend work on processes and sources of continental
margin magmas, with particular reference to the central Andes (volcanic) and
Sierra Nevada (plutonic) provinces. Focussing on the inclusions will allow the
PIs to: 1) better constrain the compositions of magmatic and crustal components;
2) evaluate timescales of contamination by examining the length scales over
which isotopic equilibration of included material has occurred; 3) better
estimate the composition of the mantle source to continental margin magmas - in
particular whether the lithosphere or asthenosphere is the predominant source;
4) mass balance the contributions of crustal versus mantle-derived components to
evaluate the extent of intra-crustal recycling. As a result, a much better
understanding should be gained of the processes affecting magmatic composition
in continental-margin arcs.
