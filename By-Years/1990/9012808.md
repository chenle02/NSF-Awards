This research involves an experimental study of nonlinear optical waveguides
made from conjugated polymers. A punp-probe technique capable of picosecond time
resolution will be employed to measure the intensity-dependent refractive
indices of conjugated polymers such as p-phenylenevinylene (PPV) and its
derivatives, polythienylenevinylene, the poly (3-alkylthiophenes) etc. for which
waveguide quality thin films can now be fabricated. The technique can determine
both the magnitude and sign of the third order nonlinear susceptibility.
Determination of the sign is important in sorting out the different mechanisms.
