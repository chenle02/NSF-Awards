Growing energy demands and environmental concerns have significantly increased
the interest of academia, industry, and governments in the development of a
smart electric power grid. Security is one of the key aspects of power systems.
The objective of this research is to advance methods of vulnerability analysis
and to develop innovative responses to maintain the integrity of power grids
under complex attacks (both cyber attacks and physical failures). This research
will contribute to developing robust, secure, and reliable future smart grid
systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike many of the existing efforts that focuses
on abstract topological structure or load-based analysis, this project considers
both network topology and intrinsic power flow characteristics to understand
system behavior in complex power grid attacks. This includes single-node and
multiple-node vulnerability analysis, development of new risk-aware metrics,
spatial-temporal attacks with consideration of timing and location, and
multifaceted attacks augmented by link failures. Knowledge of power grid system
behavior under attack scenarios will allow us to develop new defense strategies.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As power and energy systems have become one of the key
technology and economic development focuses across the world, this project will
have far-reaching impacts at different levels. This includes enhancing national
power system security, providing technical support to government agencies and
policy-makers for the U.S. energy sustainability community, and student
education and workforce preparation in this field. The integrative educational
and outreach approaches will also provide a unique platform to encourage women
and minority students to the critical Electrical/Computer Engineering
disciplines.
