The objective of this project is to characterize the shifts in gene expression
that accompany the transition between vegetative and reproductive growth in >H.>
>niger>. The investigation will utilize low temperature and long photoperiod as
environmental stimuli to induce the transitions, and changes in mRNA and protein
populations of the apical meristem to monitor them. Cloned stage.specific cDNAs
will be sought, and used as probes for >in> >situ> localization of the
corresponding gene expression. >H.> >niger> is a good system for these studies,
as its vegetative. re4productive transition manifests an absolute requirement
for the temperature/photoperiod environmental cues. This research will increase
understanding of molecular genetic events intrinsic to the flowering process. As
a RUI project, it will expose undergraduates to rigorous molecular approaches to
biological research, and provide insights of relevance for career choices.
