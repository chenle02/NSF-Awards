This investigation expands prior work on the fulfillment of party pledges
(platforms) in the United Sates and United Kingdom. Prior work included a
comparison of pledge fulfillment under Reagan and Thatcher, and an analysis of
pledge fulfillment in the U.S on economic and social welfare policy from Carter
to Bush. The investigators collect data using various legislative reference
books, official budgets and statistics, secondary sources, and computer
databases. Most of the United Kingdom work is done with resources available in
the U.S., using secondary sources, bill texts, government publications and
statistics, and party information. The researchers also examine archived party
materials and conduct interviews with platform drafters and policy makers. The
study contributes much to debates about the performance of democratic
governments under various conditions. A consistent standard of performance--
pledge fulfillment--is applied to two countries over an extended time period of
time, facilitating valid comparisons between countries and time periods. The
dataset will be of value to numerous scholars and substantially enhances our
understanding of the topic.
