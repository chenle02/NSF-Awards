Abstract DBI 9750002 Ichiro Matsumura This action funds an NSF/Alfred P. Sloan
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997. These
fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, comparative,
computational, and/or experimental analyses of biological patterns and processes
at the molecular level within the framework of organismic evolutionary change
and adaptation. These studies also include the use of molecular data to address
broader evolutionary questions. Each fellowship supports a research and training
plan to be carried out in a sponsoring laboratory. The research and training
plan for this fellowship is entitled "Do enzymes evolve like antibodies?" and
investigates the role of surface loops in the adaptive evolution of substrate
specificity. This study tests the theory that the adaptive evolution of enzyme
substrate specificity, like antibody maturation, occurs largely in surface
loops. The evolutionary pathway between the betaglucuronidase and
betagalactosidase of Escherichia coli will be recapitulated by randomly mutating
selected beta-glucuronidase surface loops and screening for mutations that alter
specificity.
