The goal of this project is to develop new methods for representing and solving
decision problems. The main focus is on representation based on the framework of
valuation-based systems (VBS), a framework capable of representing uncertain
knowledge in many different domains including Bayesian probability theory,
Dempster-Shafer's theory of belief functions, Spohn's theory of epistemic
beliefs, and Zadeh-Dubois-Prade's possibility theory. Preliminary results show
that VBS representation is more expressive than both decision trees and
influence diagrams, and the solution method is more efficient. This project will
study the expressiveness of VBS representations and the computational efficiency
of the VBS solution method. While decision trees are based on the semantics of
possible scenarios and influence diagrams are based on the semantics of
conditional independence, VBS are based on the semantics of factorization. In
this project, the semantics of VBS will be extended to include conditional
independence. In addition, the project will begin the development of a coherent
decision calculus for belief functions, epistemic beliefs, and possibility
theory.
