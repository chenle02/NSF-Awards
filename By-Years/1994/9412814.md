The Organic Dynamics program will fund the research of Professor Tanko at
Virginia Polytechnic Institute to develop an unambiguous and simple experimental
method which can be used to assess the importance of single electron transfer
(SET) pathways in which nucleophiles react with carbonyl groups. Specific
substrates which undergo rapid irreversible rearrangement upon one-electron
reduction will be constructed and used as radical anion clocks to measure the
temporal behavior of events associated with SET in a selected group of organic
reactions. The significance of this research is that it addresses fundamental
issues of the reactivity of oganic compounds and will lead to a better
understanding of how radical anions can be exploited in synthetic organic
methodology. This research will design and use certain carbon compounds whose
architecture causes them to behave as a type of internal molecular clock which
can monitor the way electrons behave at the molecular level when certain organic
compounds react. Increased understanding about the timing of events at the
molecular level will have important consequences for the production of new drugs
and chemicals of commercial importance
