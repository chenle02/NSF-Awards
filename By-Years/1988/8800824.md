A number of fundamental questions about singularities of smooth mappings have
been answered by John Mather using ideas proposed by Rene Thom. This Thom-Mather
approach solves the problems by reducing them to infinitesimal problems which
can be solved algebraically. Unfortunately, this approach cannot be applied to
the analogous topological problems. James Damon has been developing a
topological analogue of the Thom-Mather approach. This has enabled him to obtain
answers to the topological questions in a number of circumstances. Likewise, he
has been applying results from singularity theory to obtain results about
solutions to nonlinear differential equations. He intends further to develop
ideas on topological equivalence in singularity theory, to investigate the use
of symbolic computations in addressing these questions, and to explore further
the applications of singularity theory to nonlinear differential equations.
