The Department of Statistics at The Ohio State University intends to purchase a
high-resolution color workstation and imaging system to be dedicated to the
support of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used in
several new and ongoing research projects, including in particular: 1) Graphical
Methods for High Dimensional Stochastic Dynamical Systems by L. Mark Berliner 2)
Dynamic Analysis of Hierarchical Bayes Models by Mario Peruggia and Thomas
Santer 3) Dynamic Graphical Predictions in Multistate Survival Models by John
Klein 4) Confidence Ellipsoids for Bioequivalence by Jason Hsu All Four projects
require the use of a high-resolution color graphics system with the ability to
make, display and record animated sequences and still images.
