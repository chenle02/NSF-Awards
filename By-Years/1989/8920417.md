The main purpose of this work is to study a direct effect of low levels of
visible light on mammalian cerebral cortical tissue. This project is based on
the original observation that light enhances release of a neurotransmitter
molecule (gamma- aminobutyric acid, GABA) from excised tissue. Since the levels
of light necessary for this response are estimated to penetrate through the top
of the head, light may affect mammalian brain tissue while it is still in the
body. The overall or long-term objective in the project is clarifying the
relevance of responses to light penetrating the body in the living state. More
immediately, the objectives are aimed at examining how light may have functional
effects by: 1) establishing first to what extent the most fundamental measure of
function, glucose metabolism, is affected by light in surface brain tissue, and
then 2) focusing on the photosensitive molecule(s) which will further delineate
what cellular processes/functions can be candidates for the physiological
consequences of light.
