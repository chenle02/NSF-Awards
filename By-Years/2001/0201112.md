This project will utilize laboratory plasma experiments to investigate plasma
instabilities that are likely to be of importance to magnetosphere-ionosphere
coupling at high latitudes. The experiments will be performed using the West
Virginia University's Q machine, which was specifically designed to generate
conditions that would be relevant to space plasmas. Three instability mechanisms
will be studied. The first mechanism derives the necessary free energy from the
electron current perpendicular to the magnetic field. The second mechanism
involves the filamentation of parallel currents, and the third mechanism centers
on the role of parallel velocity shears.
