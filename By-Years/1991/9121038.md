The contractor will carry out the 1992 Survey of Academic Research Facilities,
a sample survey of higher education institutions that collects data on the
status and condition of science and engineering research facilities. A "Quick
Response Survey" was conducted in 1986 followed by a more detailed full scale
facilities survey in 1988. A followup to the 1988 survey was conducted in 1990.
Tasks involved in the 1992 survey will include conduct of data collection
activities, tabulation of data results, provision of technical support as
required for the National Science Foundation's own analytical uses of the data,
and production of a final analytical report summarizing the results of the
study, for submission to Congress in September 1992. A second analytical report
on the biomedical sciences will be prepared for the National Institutes of
Health, co-sponsors of the study. The Authorization Act of 1985 (Public Law
99-159) directed NSF to "...design, establish, and maintain a data collection
and analysis capability in the Foundation for the purpose of identifying and
assessing research facilities needs of universities." This study, initiated in
response to the above mandate, provides quantitative and qualitative information
on the amount, cost, and condition of existing research facilities as well as
current and planned construction and repair/renovation activities, including the
sources of funding for these capital projects.
