The Nuclear and Particle Physics group at Norfolk State University (NSU) is
involved in experimentally exploring the basic interaction that keeps the
nucleus together, namely, the strong interaction. The group's research efforts
are focused in the study of the structure of the nucleon and of other sub-atomic
particles (hadrons). This research is carried out at the Thomas Jefferson
National Accelerator Facility, Virginia. Through this program NSU faculty and
students will be involved in experiments at the forefront of research in the
field, thereby strengthening the national participation of minorities in nuclear
and particle physics research.
