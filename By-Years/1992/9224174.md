The focus of this research is the rational development of nonracemic sulfur-
nitrogen reagents, including N-sulfonyloxaziridines, sulfenimines and primary
sulfonamides,for efficient preparation of enantiomerically pure compounds. Not
only will this provide the enantioselective synthesis of previously inaccessible
compounds but also a better understanding of the molecular recognition involved
with these reagents. Specifically, new N-sulfonyloxaziridine oxidants will be
used to prepare enantiopure sulfoxides, selenoxides, and sulfinimines. New
reagents derived from optically active primary sulfonamides,
N-sulfinylsulfonamides, N-chloro-N-sodiosulfonamides, and
(N-sulfonylimino)phenyliodinanes will be evaluated in the asymmetric synthesis
of aziridines and beta-amino alcohols. Site-specific fluorination will be
explored with new chiral N-fluorosulfonimides. %%% With this Renewal award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Franklin A. Davis of
the Department of Chemistry at Drexel University. Professor Davis will focus his
work on the rational development of nonracemic sulfur-nitrogen reagents for
efficient preparation of enantiomerically pure compounds. He also will explore
the site-specific fluorination of compounds using new chiral reagents.
