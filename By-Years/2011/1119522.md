This award will provide continued support for the Caltech shock wave laboratory
to enable the measurement of physical properties of silicate and metallic
liquids under conditions matching those in the deepest parts of the Earth. This
information is critical to interpreting geophysical observations of the lower
mantle and core in terms of composition, temperature, heat flow, and evolution
over time. It also allows speculative ideas about an early molten earth (i.e.,
primordial magma ocean) to be developed into detailed theories. Shock
compression is the only experimental method that can simultaneously measure
density, pressure, temperature, energy, and sound speed of liquids at such
extreme conditions. As part of this study, the team will undertake experimental
developments to achieve much higher initial pre-heating temperatures than were
previously possible, enabling the direct study of high-melting point liquid
compositions most relevant to the primordial magma ocean and lower mantle
petrology.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The experimental and science agenda includes:
1) building on advances in shock temperature measurement techniques to look at
temperatures of shocked silicate liquids, constraining their heat capacity at
lower mantle pressures and thereby completing our ability to describe their
equation of state in pressure-temperature-density-energy space; 2) furthering
the development of new methods to achieve much higher initial pre-heating
temperatures than were previously possible to enable the study of the equation
of state of ultramafic liquid compositions most relevant to the early magma
ocean and lower mantle petrology; and 3) initiating measurements of the sound
speeds and densities of liquid iron alloys along actual outer core temperature
profiles in order to make the well-defined observed gradient in sound speed with
depth in the outer core a new and critical constraint on outer core composition.
