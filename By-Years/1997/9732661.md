9732661 Wagner The University of North Dakota will establish a Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in its Physics department.
Undergraduate students will be recruited from the northwestern-plain states,
with a recruitment focus on tribal colleges and Native American students. The
students will be involved in physics research with emphasis in materials physics
and condensed matter physics. %%% The REU site, with a regional focus whereby
high quality undergraduates will be recruited from the northwestern-plain
states, and with an emphasis on Native American students, has potential impact
on underrepresented sectors of the undergraduate student population in physics.
