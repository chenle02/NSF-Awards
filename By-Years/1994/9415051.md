9415051 Tucker This Project examines the manufacture of preforms for liquid
composite molding. It focuses on thermoforming methods, where an initially flat
sheet is formed into a three-dimensional shape. The goals of the project are to
understand the mechanics of preforming, to predict whether or not any specific
part can be formed from any given random-fiber mat, to quantify the effects of
preform deformation on mold filling, and to incorporate these results into
computer-aided engineering software that will be useful to industry. This
project addresses a critical and expensive step in the manufacture of composite
materials. An improved forming theory will aid designers in recognizing
difficult-to-form geometric features in their parts and correct the problem
before the tooling is built. Designers will also be better able to identify
features that absolutely cannot be formed from available materials, and thereby
avoid development efforts that are doomed to failure. ***
