Stebbins will continue to study the structure and dynamics of disordering in
silicate liquids, glasses, and crystals using nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy. He has begun a number of studies to better understand disordering
in the interior of crystals as well. He plans to extend the ranges in
temperature and composition of the experiments, and to continue with theoretical
modeling. Stebbins is also entering into a new collaboration on the application
of new NMR techniques ("Double Rotation" and "Dynamic Angle Spinning") to
quadrupolar nuclei in solids. These may lead to a real breakthrough in our
understanding of the disordering process, particularly involving oxygen.
