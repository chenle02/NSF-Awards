This Small Business Innovation Phase I research concentrates on creating
overexpression technology for eukaryotic membrane proteins, a group of membrane
proteins that remain intractable yet are of significant medical importance. A
majority of membrane proteins are very difficult to obtain in significant
quantity, even at milligram scale, since their natural biosynthesis levels often
are very low and currently available protein expression methods are not
effective for membrane proteins. With the completion of several genome
sequencing projects, many large-scale efforts are under way to understand the
protein products.

The broader impacts of this research are significant in surface membrane
proteins for structure-based drug design and protein engineering, protein
therapeutics, and diagnostic devices. These efforts will provide new
understanding of membrane proteins as well as lead to new generations of
efficacious medicines for virtually all therapeutic areas including infectious
diseases, cancer, genetic diseases due to genetic defect in membrane proteins,
central nervous system diseases, cardiovascular system diseases, digestive
system diseases and many others.
