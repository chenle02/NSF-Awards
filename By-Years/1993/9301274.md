This research concerns the modeling and analysis of various free- boundary
problems related to phase transition. In particular, the general approach of
phase field model is applied to several basic problems: alloys, triple points,
and crystal growth. The goal is to gain insight into the freezing and melting
processes in alloys, and the mechanisms of crystal growth. The results of this
research will contribute to the objectives of the advanced materials processing
program.
