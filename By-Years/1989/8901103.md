They propose subpicosecond investigations of the lattice relaxation in certain
materials when electron-hole pairs are created by linear or nonlinear absorption
of light. Techniques to be used are ultrafast optical spectroscopy and short
pulse photoelectron spectroscopy. Problems to be investigated (7 in all) include
self-trapping of holes in silver halides and in SiO2.
