A wide range of problems in the design and analysis of efficient algorithm is
being investigated. The primary area of investigation is the design of efficient
approximation algorithms for NP-hard optimization problems. Although this area
has received much attention over the past two decades, there is still little
known in the way of unifying results. In an attempt to develop a theory of
worst-case analysis of approximation algorithms, this research seeks techniques
of design and analysis that are applicable to problems from many areas. Under
development are tools for explaining why certain problems are easily
approximable, whereas others are not. A second area under investigation is that
of algorithmic techniques for parallel computation for combinatorial problems.
Although efficient parallel algorithms now exist for an increasing number of
problems, there is still little appreciation of the appropriate algorithmic
primitives that will be useful for a variety of problems. Randomization has
proved to be a useful tool in many areas of algorithm design, particularly for
parallel and distributed computing. Investigations, are continuing in this area,
and in particular, in its applicability to worst-case analysis of approximation
algorithms. The PI has been judged to be an outstanding computer scientist by
the Presidential Young Investigator panel.
