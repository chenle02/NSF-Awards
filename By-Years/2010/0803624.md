The work to be carried out under this award will develop the needed
infrastructure and apply it to study realistic compact binary systems that can
give rise to gamma ray burst phenomena. To this end the required physics modules
will be incorporated in a new infrastructure framework able to exploit the new
generation of high performance computers. The implementations of this
infrastructure will allow study of the system in depth, with the goal of
predicting and interpreting aspects of observations of electromagnetic and
gravitationalÂ waves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work serves to advance
computational and numerical techniques for an exciting scientific problem, as
well as the creation and dissemination of advanced tools for distributed
computing. The research to be carried out has as its goal to give an
unprecedented description of possible (short) gamma ray burst systems and to
develop a new computational model to efficiently utilize petascale computing.
Finally, this study involves the training of postdoctoral researchers, graduate
students, and undergraduates.
