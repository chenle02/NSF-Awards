9414207 Robinson This award will provide partial support for a symposium
entitled "Computational Intelligence: Imitating Life." The meeting is under the
auspices of the IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence, an activity
of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Computational
Intelligence is an emerging field of inquiry that lies at the boundary between
engineering and science, between biology and computers, and between
observational models and theoretical assumptions. The meeting will bring
together international experts in discussions of the critical technologies and
issues relating to biologically, psychologically, and linguistically motivated
models that exhibit various facets of computational intelligence. The symposium
provides a unique forum for cross-fertilization between the areas of neural
networks, fuzzy logic, and evolutionary computing. Proceedings of the symposium
are to be published, thereby making results of the meeting available to a large
audience.
