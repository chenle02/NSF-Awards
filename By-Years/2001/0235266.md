This project will investigate how increased atmospheric CO2, warmer climatic
conditions, and changing soil moisture will influence ecosystem processes,
nutrient cycling and the carbon balance (net uptake or loss of CO2) in northern
peatlands at a research site in northern Minnesota. This is a collaborative
project between investigators at the University of Minnesota-Duluth (PI: J.
Pastor) and the University of Oregon (PI: S. Bridgham). This team will work
closely with Dr. Patrick Megonigal (Smithsonian Environment Research Center,
Edgewater MD) who has requested support from the US DOE Biological and
Environmental Research Program to construct and operate a FACE (Free-Air CO2
Enrichment) ring at the research site. This NSF-DOE will investigate processes
that control carbon storage and turnover in peatlands under current conditions
and under a projected doubling of atmospheric CO2 and warming of north temperate
and boreal peatlands. The results will be relevant to the issue of the long-term
sustainability of peatlands as carbon sinks. Additionally, this research will
provide opportunities for undergraduate researchers, graduate students and post
doctoral to participate in interdisciplinary global change research.
