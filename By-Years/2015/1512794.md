Implantable biophotonic devices are highly in demand for applications such as
in-vivo sensing, imaging, and optogenetic neural stimulation. The researchers
propose to design, fabricate, and characterize compact, flexible, and
biocompatible photonic structures built entirely from Parylene. They will
integrate such waveguides with switches and light sources to realize a fully
reconfigurable and integrated photonic platform.

An all-Parylene photonic platform has never been published. Such an innovation
would have immediate impact as Parylene is routinely used in ultra-flexible,
implantable systems. Biocompatible and flexible integrated photonic structures
are required that do not degrade, delaminate, or fall apart when used in chronic
applications. Recent advances in flexible photonics mostly rely on transferring
guided-wave devices to a flexible substrate to realize heterogeneous pseudo-
flexible photonic devices. Such implementations are vulnerable to degradation
and failure are only suitable for short-term diagnostic implants. The proposed
research introduces a new platform for realizing compact and flexible integrated
photonic devices leveraging an already well-developed biocompatible material
system used for encapsulating biodevices. This program includes a well-conceived
plan for outreach activities.
