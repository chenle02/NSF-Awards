In this project, the P.I.'s will carry out Large-Eddy-Simulations (LES) of the
interaction between surface waves and stress-driven flows in the near-surface
region of the ocean. Emphasis will be on Langmuir circulations and other
phenomena that are difficult to measure directly. Results will contribute to
parameterizing turbulence and mixing in the upper ocean, particularly for air-
sea interaction models.
