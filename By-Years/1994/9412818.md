9412818 Koonin This proposal will support a three year program of research in
theoretical nuclear physics at the W. K. Kellogg Radiation Laboratory of the
California Institute of Technology for the period of August 1, 1994 to July 31,
1996. The research proposed involves new continuing work on the description of
nuclei and other quantum many-body systems. The training of graduate and
undergraduate students and post-doctoral fellows is an integral part of the
proposed research. ***
