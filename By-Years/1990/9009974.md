Regional patterns of climate and environmental response in southwestern North
America during the pivotal millennia of the end of the Pleistocene epoch, and
the relations of that regional pattern to global climate change continue to be
nationally and internationally important research topics. The Sierra Nevadas of
eastern California are a major climatic and vegetational boundary today, but at
the end of the last ice age Great Basin-like vegetation coverered lower slopes
on both sides of the southern Sierra Nevada. In this project, the investigator
will collect, date, and examine lake-core chronologies from four lakes west of
the Sierra crest in eastern Calfornia in order to evaluate two competing
hypotheses that explain why the western Sierra was drier and the eastern Sierra
was wetter at the end of the last glacial period. The first hypothesis argues
that enhanced monsoonal activity was due to greater summer insolation and an
enhanced land-sea thermal contrast. The second alternative explains the northern
aridity and the southern moistness by a southward displacement of the winter jet
stream. The study will illuminate our understanding of the late Quaternary
vegetation history of arid North America and the climatic patterns that have
influenced it. This knowledge will increase our understanding of processes of
climatic and vegetation change and the ways the regional changes relate to
global changes.
