The objectives of this research project include the reprocessing of a high-
quality 3-D multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection data set collected across the
Costa Rica margin accretionary prism, and subsequent reinterpretation of the
prism's structure, geomorphology, and geohydrology. Advances in MCS data
processing techniques, and increasing interest in the internal structure of
accretionary prisms make this project of timely importance. In addition to
answering fundamental questions concerning the nature of structures within the
Costa Rica accretionary prism, the reprocessed seismic data will be used as
background information for future Ocean Drilling Project activities in the Costa
Rica margin area.
