Recent studies involving electron-flavor neutrinos have raised many interesting
questions. For example, is there electron-neutrino appearance at short baseline?
What is the magnitude of the missing mixing matrix parameter, associated with
the electron-flavor? And is there CP violation in the light neutrino sector,
which is explored through electron-neutrino appearance? These questions are
identified as top priority in advancing knowledge within the neutrino physics
field.

This award provides support for students and postdocs on a series of neutrino
experiments chosen to be phased in time: MiniBooNE, SciBooNE, Double Chooz,
MicroBooNE and DAEDALUS. These experiments are selected to have intellectual
coherence and to allow the students and postdocs in the group to experience all
stages of experimental work within their careers at MIT. MIT has a central role
in the MiniBooNE oscillation analysis and in developing associated
phenomenological models involving sterile neutrinos. The MiniBooNE results have
excited interest in next generation short-baseline experiments, including the
MicroBooNE experiment that will address the MiniBooNE event excesses with state-
of-the-art liquid argon technology. MIT is responsible for delivering the light
collection system on MicroBooNE and for R&D on the first lightguide-based
detection system for future large LAr detectors. The group plays a leading role
in the US-based analysis of the last neutrino mixing angle from the Double Chooz
data. MIT has specialized in monitoring on Double Chooz and this award provides
support for a novel directional neutron monitor, DCTPC, which will be
constructed in this grant period. DAEDALUS, with its multiple beams and single
detector, is an example of how the MIT group develops transformative ideas.

Broader Impacts: The PI is dedicated to expanding participation of women and
minorities in STEM, as well as improving STEM education and teacher development.
The group is involved in numerous projects to increase public scientific
literacy and gives many public talks, communicating the excitement of neutrino
physics.
