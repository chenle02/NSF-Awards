The enzyme adenylosuccinate synthetase obtained from E. coli is dimeric and
binds three substrates plus a metal ion. The chemical mechanism of the function
of the synthetase is approached from a number of points of view. Specific amino
acid residues involved in binding and catalytic processes are examined via
chemical and metagenesis approaches. These studies require considerable
spectroscopic effort to localize the observed effects. Chemical and
spectroscopic exchange studies will be performed to get at central questions of
the timing and order of binding and catalytic steps. Ongoing crystallograpic
studies of wild type and mutant enzyme as well as enzyme in the presence of
inhibitors will be continued. %%% Adenylosuccinate synthetase is involved in the
conversion of AMP from IMP. By virtue of its location at the beginning of a
metabolic pathway, this enzyme is subject to a number of controls of its
catalytic activity as part of the overall metabolic integration of the cell. The
proposed research explores the complex interactions which exist between the
enzyme and metabolites and inhibitors it binds. The proposed research will
identify the order and tightness of binding of effectors, substrates, and
products, will identify catalytically important structures in the enzyme, and
will identify and characterize intermediates occurring along the reaction
pathway. Studies of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, using X-ray
crystallography, will be continued.
