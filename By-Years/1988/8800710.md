The goal of this project is to reconstruct the evolutionary history of what may
be the world's most diverse family of birds: the blackbirds. The blackbird
family, or Icterinae, includes the familiar red-winged blackbirds, meadowlarks,
and orioles of North America, as well as many species native to Mexico and
Central and South America. The blackbirds range in size from the tiny orchard
oriole to the gigantic Montezuma oropendula, in mating systems from the strictly
monogamous melodious blackbird to the highly polygynous Mexican cacique, and in
color from the radiant orange of northern orioles to the velvet black of
mountain grackles. Our task is to compare the DNA of different species and
reconstruct the group's phylogeny, or family tree. Using this tree, we will try
to answer several important questions: Have the highly social lineages evolved
more rapidly than the solitary ones? The astonishingly rapid evolution of human
posture, brain size, and hand morphology may have resulted from intense
selection for novel adaptations triggered when individuals in social groups
learned new food-gathering techniques. Has this type of evolution occurred in
birds? In some Icterine lineages males (primarily) use elaborate displays and
songs and bright coloration to compete for mates and food. Have these
"conspicuous" groups speciated more rapidly than the more dully-colored,
"quieter" lineages? Perhaps an entirely new species could arise when a mutation
introduced a novel type of song or patch of color to use in acquiring or
defending resources. A molecular phylogeny of the Icterinae should produce a
wealth of insights into the evolutionary process.
