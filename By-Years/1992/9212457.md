An experimental technique for unsteady flow measurements will be further
developed. The technique involves the tagging through laser exitation of
molecules in a flow field, forming a line written in the flow. This line is then
interrogated during its susequent deformation by rapid laser pulses. The
technique can give statistical turbulence information without intruding
instruments within the flow. The writing of crossed lines or grids can give data
for vorticity and shear. Non-intrusive measurement techniques are important for
extracting flow details from highly transient flows, where instabilities and
turbulence are as yet insufficiently characterized for predictive modeling
purposes.
