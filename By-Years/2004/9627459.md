9627459 Doniach This grant further continues the support of this senior,
distinguished PI on the general problem of strongly correlated electrons.
Specific projects in the present grant include: Exact diagonalization of a t-J
model using a projector technique developed earlier by the PI, properties of a
superconductor-insulator transition utilizing a generalization of the Doniach-
Inui lagrangian incorporating both charge and spin fluctuations and effects of
dissipation and of high magnetic fields, and a dynamic mean field (the infinite
dimension limit) study of the Kondo insulators. %%% This grant explores several
novel ideas about the properties of Copper oxides in the range of doping where
they are no longer High Tc superconductors. This is done with the hope of
elucidating the microscopic properties of these special materials. In another
project the PI will study the Kondo insulators (materials which are metallic and
magnetic at high temperatures and nonmagnetic and insulating at low
temperatures) using some recently discovered mathematical techniques. ***
