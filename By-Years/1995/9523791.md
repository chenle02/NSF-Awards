The PI will combine the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite and radar data to
gain information on circulations and momentum sources/sinks in the mesosphere
and lower thermosphere (MLT). By properly combining radar and Wind Imaging
Interferometer measurements with High Resolution Doppler Imager winds, the PI
can determine the MLT transport circulation directly from global wind
observations. In addition, improved estimates of gravity-wave driving will allow
improved simulations of circulation systems in the MLT region and at
stratospheric levels. Finally, results from this research will be important for
estimations of mesospheric winds from thermal data.***
