A range of protective policies have been implemented in the governance of sport
based upon scientific and cultural understandings of biological-based
differences. These protective policies include eligibility regulations and
consensus statements on athletes’ health. They all depend upon social and
cultural understandings of protection, and who needs protection and why. This
project analyzes how protection is conceptualized across organizations,
policies, and practice. Project findings will translate beyond the sporting
realm to enhance our understanding of how science and society intersect to shape
dominant ways of knowing. This project will yield crucial insights into how
protective policies enact a range of measures to safeguard selected notions of
bodies through regulation, discipline, and/or exclusion. It will be of interest
to athletes, coaches, policy makers, and
administrators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focusing on the International Olympic
Committee’s (IOC) consensus statement on relative energy deficiency in sport, or
RED-S, as a case study, this project uses policy, bibliometric, and interview
data to answer two central research questions: (1) how do scientists,
policymakers, and other stakeholders involved with RED-S research and policy-
creation identify bodies as (not) needing protection? And (2) what types of
solutions to RED-S are proposed by scientists, policymakers, and other
stakeholders involved with RED-S research and policy-creation? Drawing on
theoretical insights from governmentality studies, the project contributes to
larger discussions about the significance of social and/or biological dimensions
in defining eligible bodies. This project produces further theoretical insights
for science and technology scholars into rationales and strategies of governance
that impact individuals, communities, and nations. Project findings will
encourage transdisciplinary dialogue about how athlete’s bodies are regulated
and policed, inside, and outside of sport, and inform future efforts to create
inclusive and empathetic protective policies for
athletes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
