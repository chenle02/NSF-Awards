Proposal ID: DMS-0204612&lt;br/&gt;PI: Trevor Hastie&lt;br/&gt;Title: Flexible
statistical modeling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
investigator and his students will study the popular support vector machines
from the viewpoint of the traditional logistic regression model (with
regularization). While the latter exhibits very similar generalization
performance to the SVM, it has several advantages: it estimates class
probabilities, and generalizes to multiclass problems seamlessly. This and
several other even simpler approaches will be developed for the classification
of gene expression arrays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will thus develop
useful models for making class predictions in a variety of high-dimensional
situations, in particular for gene expression arrays. While the science journals
abound with exotic statistical and computational algorithms for use in this
fashionable domain, this investigator and his colleagues firmly believe that
some very simple modifications of classical approaches perform as well or
better, and are easier to understand.&lt;br/&gt;
