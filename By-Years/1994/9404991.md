This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
Program, involves the study of several aspects of platinum group chemistry as
related to catalysis of organic reactions. Specific areas to be pursued include
1) further examination of the use of parahydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) as
an NMR probe of reaction mechanisms in hydrogenation reactions, 2) activation of
organic molecules by reaction with cationic and odd electron rhodium and iridium
species, and 3) reactions of rhodium and iridium complexes in water and as part
of dendrimeric structures; the former has implications for environmentally
friendly technologies whereas the latter may provide a means of substrate
discrimination and therefore selectivity. For the aqueous solution work, the
ligands to be used will impart water solubility to the metal complexes. The
majority of industrial manufacturing processes use some type of catalyst, which
serves to increase reactions rates and, therefore, increase throughput with
lower energy costs, and frequently to alter product selectivity. New catalysts
and improved catalytic processes require both exploratory studies of possible
new catalysts and the better mechanistic understanding of existing catalysts. In
addition, more environmentally acceptable processes may result if existing
catalytic systems that operate in organic solvents can be converted to aqueous
solution processes. This project has objectives in all three of these areas.
