This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will build on
previous work in compositional Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) for
autonomous vehicles to demonstrate a new capability for establishing safety and
reliability arguments satisfying both regulatory and certification requirements.
This compositional V&amp;V tool supports complex modular architectures and
reconfiguration, and encompasses both discrete and continuous dynamics,
permitting the explicit modeling of both control modes (including fault and
safing modes), and vehicle dynamics. An explicit model of uncertain outcomes and
uncontrollable events will be created and integrated into previous work using
semi-Markov decision processes which are a good fit for the requirements of this
application. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The value proposition of this project is to
enable many more Unmanned Autonomous Systems (UAS) to be granted permission to
operate in regulated environments. Commercial feasibility will established
through a collaboration with the Safety Security Rescue Research Center, an NSF
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC), and its industry
partners. The initial target markets for this work will be ground and aerial
UAS, to both the providers/manufacturers as a means to reduce costs and
development time and users as a means to utilize the UAS to their full mission
potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).
