This DDEP proposal seeks support for PhD candidate Stuart C. Willis for research
on species formation in Brazil. Mr. Willis will be working under the guidance of
both Dr. Guillermo Orti (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) and Dr. Izeni Pires
Farias (Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil). The PIs have a novel
perspective on species formation based on the growing recognition that
hybridization, that is the process of combining different varieties or species
of organisms to create a hybrid may lead to new species and thus applies to
animals and not just to plants and bacteria. They plan to test their theory on
species rich faunas such as the Neotropical freshwater fishes to classify and
study previously unidentified hybrid species. The discovery and cataloguing of
unique genetic lineages is particularly critical for setting sustainable
management and conservation priorities of fishes which are considered important
commercial food and recreational resources.
