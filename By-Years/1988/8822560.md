This award is for a cooperative agreement with SRI International. Under this
agreement SRI is funded to operate and coordinate the authorized use of the NSF-
owned Sondrestrom Radar Facility located in Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland. SRI
coordinates and provides logistic support, with the help of the U.S. Air Force,
for users who travel to Greenland. SRI also provides data reduced to geophysical
parameters to radar users, interested researchers, and the data base at NCAR. In
addition, SRI scientists use the radar to carry out an active research program
of their own.
