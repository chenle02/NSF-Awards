9602485 Feng This award supports cooperation between Feng Lin, Wayne State
University, and Lin Zhenghui, Shanghai Jiaotong University, on modeling and
testing software tools for mixed signal circuits. The project involves
development of a software tool for computer aided design and testing of mixed
signal circuits. The proposal is closely related to work funded under ECS
9315344. The project involves an important Institute at Shanghai Jiaotong
University, a top-notch technological university in China. The Institute for
VLSI (very large systems integration) has attracted significant funding from
domestic sources as well as from foreign multinationals. The Institute has
substantial resources committed to this joint project, which involves
complementary skills and facilities on both sides.
