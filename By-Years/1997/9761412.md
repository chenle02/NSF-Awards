This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
new technology for the rapid electronic sortation of aluminum, copper, brass,
and stainless steel and production of a nonferrous metal rich feedstock from
resource recovery plant ash. Fast new detectors and computer electronics can
identify nonferrous metals in millisecond time frames. This makes possible rapid
identification and separation of one type of metal from another. This new
technology is needed to sort the nonferrous metal feedstock from resource
recovery plant ash residue and from automobile shredders. Current methods use
hand sorting, eddy currents, and heavy media plants. Virtually no waste-to-
energy facilities presentlt recover nonferrous metals. Eddy current separators
depend on particle size and shape and do not work well on incinerated nonferrous
metals. Heavy media plants are capital intensive and cause environmental
problems. The new technology is expected to increase the recycling of valuable
metallic components, which are presently going to landfills. Nonferrous metals,
discarded in waste, amount to some two billion pounds/year. Applying the
technology only to the recovery and recycling of nonferrous metals from more
than 200 automobile shredders located throughout the USA would, by itself, have
a large commercial potential.
