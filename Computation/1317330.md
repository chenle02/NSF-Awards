The linear response eigenvalue problem, also known as the random phase
approximation eigenvalue problem, arises from computing excitation states
(energies) of physical systems. Such an eigenvalue problem is usually of large
scale -- the matrix dimensions for a molecule of reasonable size can easily get
up to tens of millions. It is considered much more difficult than the symmetric
eigenvalue problem because it is non-Hermitian in nature. But it has internal
symmetric structures in each of the submatrix blocks, which previously have been
largely unexploited. This project involves the development of new theory and
advanced computational methods through fully exploiting the internal symmetric
structures. A systematic study will be thoroughly conducted to uncover new
min/maximization principles. These principles should mirror those for the
symmetric eigenvalue problem, and will make it possible and guide the
investigator to transform some of existing and successful techniques for the
symmetric eigenvalue problem for use in the linear response eigenvalue problem
research, It is highly expected that new efficient algorithms that are capable
of computing several smallest positive eigenvalues simultaneously will emerge as
the result of this project. In addition to advancing research in the linear
response eigenvalue problem, the investigator will recruit and train graduate
students in computational mathematics and interdisciplinary studies.

The linear response eigenvalue problem is a major tool in computing energy
excitation states of electrons and molecules. This project will critically
advance current understanding and solution techniques for the eigenvalue problem
in the context of mathematical theory, computational methods, and software. With
the successful completion of the project, a significant contribution will be
made to the state-of-the-art physical excitation energy computations via random
phase approximations, a proven technique that is widely used in computational
quantum chemistry and physics.
