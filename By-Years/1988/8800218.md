The goal of this project is to test the relative importance of functional
versus aesthetic mate choice in the American goldfinch, and to investigate the
possibility of "runaway" evolutionary change from functional to aesthetic mate
choice. Two important topics will be investigated--the relationship between
preferred naturally-occurring traits and reproductive success in the field, and
the potential for aesthetic choice, as indicated by the mate preferences of
females. Laboratory experiments will be performed to assess the influences on
mate choice of naturally-varying traits, slight exaggerations of natural traits,
novel traits represented by "artificial" characteristics, and of natural traits.
Also to be assessed are the potentially important traits in a population of wild
goldfinches with known ages and reproductive histories. This research will test
important hypotheses of sexual selection and provide insight into the evolution
of species appearance in this and other monogamous bird species. The
institutional affiliation of the Fellow for the two year project duration is
with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; the field work will take
place at Guelph, Ontario, Canada.
