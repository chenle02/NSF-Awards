ABSTRACT CTS-9301287 Robert H. Page A new concept to utilize the non-steady
impinging jet from a self oscillating nozzle is proposed. Enhancing the surface
heat transfer due to a submerged jet impingement is to be studied theoretically
and experimentally. The concept centers around the potential of modifying
standard in-line jet nozzles such that they become self oscillating and have the
ability to force an oscillating boundary layer development on the impingement
surface. It is believed that this agitated surface boundary layer occurrence can
be exploited to increase the heat transfer from an impinging jet. The Infrared
Heat Transfer Jet Impingement Facility (HJIF) at Texas A&amp;M University will
be used for the experimental studies of the impingement. The objective will be
to obtain a better understanding of this non-steady phenomena in order that it
can be applied to this physical situation to improve the heat transfer as well
as to gain the necessary enlightenment about self oscillating or resonant flows,
such that the knowledge may have future use for additional surface boundary
layer interaction conditions involving mass transfer and chemical reactions.
