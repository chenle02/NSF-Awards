This proposed work concerns the development and maintenance of a shipboard
acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) program on board the RVIB Nathaniel B.
Palmer and the research vessel Laurence M. Gould, operated by the United States
Antarctic Program. The objective is to generate a quality-controlled data set on
upper ocean current velocities in a sparsely sampled and remote region, yet one
that plays an important role in the global ocean circulation. Further goals are
to develop the underway data collection program so that it can be maintained
with a minimum of personnel and resources, and that the observations become
publicly available in a timely manner. Long-term science objectives are to
measure the seasonal and interannual variability of upper ocean currents within
the Drake Passage, to combine this information with similar temperature
observations to study the variability in the heat exchange, and to characterize
the velocity structure in the Southern Ocean on a variety of time and space
scales.
