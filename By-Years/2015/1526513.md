In the modern data-centric era, one is constantly faced with the task of
extracting intelligent summaries out of diverse, complex data. This task is
becoming increasingly challenging as the data becomes more complex. Recent work
has demonstrated that topological ideas and concepts can be powerful in
extracting essential structures/features that are hidden in data. Although
existing topological methods are promising and powerful, they are limited when
analyzing data that is laced with complex maps (e.g, non-real valued functions)
and temporal components. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to broaden the
scope of topological techniques and methodologies for analyzing such complex
data. Specifically, the PIs will investigate novel methodologies and
computational issues to address key challenges caused by complexity in modern
data: the diverse properties/information associated with data, the dynamic/time-
varying behavior of data, and the sheer volume of the data. The project will
provide a theoretical understanding of a recently proposed framework, called
Mapper, and its extension to a multiscale formulation. It will explore the use
of persistence methodologies, including zigzag constructions, for understanding
the time-varying aspects of data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The geometric and
topological ideas behind this project will bring new perspectives to the
important field of computational data analysis. A successful algorithmic theory
for summarizing and characterizing complex and dynamic data with topological
techniques can provide a powerful tool for data exploration and analysis in
various fields of science and engineering. The educational impact of this
project is in a large synergy between mathematics and computer science motivated
by real applications. The findings from the project are planned to be part of
the course materials that the PIs develop. This project will train graduate
students who will develop skills in mathematics and theoretical computer
science, most notably in algorithms and topology, in writing efficient software,
and its application to analyzing data sets. The combination of such skills is
becoming increasingly essential in modern data science.
