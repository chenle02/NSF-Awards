The objective this Nona Talks conference is to bring together a panel of leaders
from academia and industry in the cross-disciplinary field of synthetic biology.
The specific goal is to discuss the feasibility and implementation of open
source software in synthetic biology; and to identify the needs for new enabling
tools that will advance this field in significant ways. The conference
organizers make every effort to bring together a balanced cadre of participants
in terms of gender, cultural and educational backgrounds. Junior researchers
from the field of computer science, bioinformatics, and synthetic biology and
engineering will contribute to the discussion:as well.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Nona Talks" is focused on community building, idea
generation, and education. The specific focus will be (1) to be proactive in
developing software resources that are properly managed, documented and curated.
(2) link to major synthetic biology conferences such as the Engineering,
Evolution &amp; Design (SEED) conference to be held in Chicago on July 18-21. As
such, Nona Talks is a venue designed to fill a gap between the practitioners and
the software engineers and computer scientists to brainstorm on how to
streamline the design-build-test-implementation cycle, which is an integral part
of academic and industrial Synthetic Biology applications.
