The work carried out at Yale during the last three years has resulted in a
number of neural network models for the identification and control of nonlinear
dynamical systems. It has also raised numerous theoretical and practical
questions concerning the prior information that will be needed to control the
plant adaptively, as well as to assure its robustness in more complex
environments. To address these question, it is proposed to investigate the
following four related areas: (i) Extension of the methods developed to the
control of nonlinear systems in the presence of bounded disturbances, and time-
varying parameters; development of multilevel controllers for fault tolerant
systems. (ii) New classes of plants for which stable adaptive algorithms can be
generated. (iii) Properties of multilayer neural networks and radial basis
function networks which are used as components in complex dynamical systems and
their impact on overall performance. (iv) Theoretical basis for all the
investigations carried out using results from nonlinear control theory.
