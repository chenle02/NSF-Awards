The Center for Informal Learning and Schools (CILS) is a five-year collaborative
effort between the Exploratorium in San Francisco, the University of California
at Santa Cruz, and King's College London. The purpose of the Center is to study
the intersection of informal science learning that takes place in museums and
science centers and formal learning that takes place in schools, and to prepare
leaders in informal science education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the efforts
of the center, new doctoral level leaders will be prepared who understand how
informal science learning takes place and how informal institutions can
contribute to science education reform. A Ph.D. program will be offered to 16
individuals at King's College London (two cohorts of eight) and a post-doctoral
program to six scientists interested in issues of learning and teaching in
informal settings. A doctoral program is planned at the University of California
at Santa Cruz for 24 students, 12 whose interests are primarily in education and
12 who come from the sciences. In addition to doctoral level training, there
will be a certification program for existing informal science professionals to
better enable them to support teachers, students and the general public. That
program will provide 160 informal science educators 120 hours of professional
development experiences, and an additional 24 informal science educators with a
master's degree in informal science education at UC Santa Cruz. A Bay Area
Institute will be developed to serve as a central focus for all CILS activities.
It will bring together researchers and practitioners; it will offer courses and
workshops for graduate students; and it will provide a central location for
reporting research findings and methodologies that focus on how informal
learning institutions can best contribute to science education
reform.&lt;br/&gt;
