Principal investigators and evaluators of grants funded by the NSF Advanced
Technological Education (ATE) program have identified a need for access to
valid, reliable, useful, and accessible, real-time evaluative data for decision
making in their projects and centers. However, limits on time, expertise, and
resources have meant that this need often remains unmet. This project conducts
webinars and other activities in preparation for holding a one day workshop to
solicit input to create an evaluation logic model, identify data priorities, and
identify criteria for development of tools to support formative
assessment/evaluation of ATE projects and centers. Participants in the workshop
process explore and document evaluation ideas, designs, and systems that can
enable all ATE projects and centers to make the most effective use of
evaluation. The project is guided by international experts in formative
evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Together with representative PIs, the project
leadership plans webinars on logic models and formative evaluation. The outcomes
are possible logic models to be refined by input from a larger group of PIs at
the workshop. Having PI input into developing the logic models ensures their
use. The outputs are posted on the Evalu-ate website and advertised in other
publications. The Advisory Panel members actively review project plans, web and
workshop plans, and outcomes. Feedback from the Advisory Panel and participants
groups is used to inform and guide the determination of product emphases and
judgments regarding the value of the project itself. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project provides models to change project and center evaluations from annual
summative evaluation to ongoing formative evaluations that provide practical and
timely information to guide the development of the project. The products should
be useful in other NSF program as well.
