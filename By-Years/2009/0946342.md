This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Early Concept Grants Exploratory
Research (EAGER) proposal seeks to achieve a substantial increase in knowledge
of the healthcare services aimed at improved sustainability decision-making. The
initial focus is on patterns of energy consumption. An energy analysis at the
level of granularity and for industry-wide diagnosis as proposed herein has
never been conducted in a healthcare setting. The life cycle approach to be used
will be made consistent with modern evidence-based guidelines used in medicine
today. The relationship between the decision to deliver a patient service and
energy will be described. To achieve this broader impact, we seek to understand
and tailor lci information needs for healthcare decision-making which is
advancing along practices of evidence-based guidelines (EBG), the practice of
evidence-based medicine at the organizational or institutional level. Validated
life cycle energy information heuristics for selected services in healthcare
will be posted on a Website for healthcare community education and
use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
