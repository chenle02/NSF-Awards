This project concerns several topics in algebraic geometry: (1) (with A. Buch)
to find formulas for degeneracy loci arising from several vector bundle maps in
terms of Chern classes of the bundles; this involves a combinatorial problem
generalizing the notion of Littlewood-Richardson numbers; (2) to understand
relations between such formulas and quantum cohomology; (3) (with J. Harris) to
understand why Schubert calculus (orintersection theory) on a given Grassmannian
is controlled by Schubert calculus on smaller Grassmannians, as it must be by
recent work of Klyachko, Knutson, and Tao; (4) (with R. MacPherson) to
investigate compactifications of spaces of curves along the lines that we have
done for sets of points; (5) to study toric varieties, especially as related to
quantum cohomology; (6) (with K. Behrend, D. Edidin, B. Fantechi, L. Goettsche,
and A. Kresch) to write an accessible introduction to the theory of stacks.

My main interest is in algebraic geometry, and neighboring areas in
representation theory, topology, and combinatorics. Many of the fundamental
spaces that arise in mathematics are very special algebraic varieties, most of
whose properties can be described by some finite (combinatorial) data. Important
examples of these are Schubert varieties, related to loci where matrices have
various ranks, and toric varieties, whose combinatorics involves convex
polytopes and lattice points. The mutual interplay between the geometry and the
combinatorics is beneficial to both. I am also interested in constructions of
moduli spaces, which are spaces of geometric objects. Deciding how to include
limiting objects, which amounts to compactifying these moduli spaces, is a
central theme in algebraic geometry.
