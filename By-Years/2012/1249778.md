The recycling of oceanic crust into the mantle through subduction is ultimately
responsible for the formation of the Earth's continental crust through arc
magmatism. The origin of these magmatic processes is thought to be the melting
of mantle rocks under volcanic arcs triggered by the release of fluids from the
subducting oceanic slab. The composition of the fluids ultimately responsible
for this magmatism is the subject of much research, including the study of the
metamorphic byproducts of subduction that are occasionally returned to the
surface. These garnet-bearing metamorphic rocks (eclogite) are the only samples
of material that have been subducted to great depth, but are available for
study. Although eclogite can preserve a record of fluids from subduction zones,
it is difficult to determine whether the fluid record preserved in these rocks
comes from deep in the subduction zone, or is a result of their exhumation. The
research funded by this grant will tie the record of fluids preserved in the
oxygen isotope composition of garnets that grew during subduction with the
pressure and temperature conditions recorded by the chemical composition of the
garnets, generating an integrated tectonic and fluid record for these
rocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemically zoned garnets and mineral inclusions
entrapped during their growth have been shown to preserve pressure and
temperature information from both the subduction of ocean crust and exhumation
of eclogite. Slow intragranular diffusion of oxygen in garnet suggests that
these garnets will preserve the &amp;#948;18O of fluids in equilibrium with the
garnet along these paths as well. New advances in ion microprobe technique now
allow the &amp;#948;18O of garnet to be measured in situ with high precision. By
integrating in situ &amp;#948;18O analysis of garnet with existing and new
quantitative prograde and retrograde P-T-fO2 information and texturally guided
geochronology, this study will generate the first detailed P-T-t-f paths for
eclogite and related rocks formed in subduction zones. These histories will
allow samples of eclogite to serve as probes into the tectonic and fluid
conditions of the fore-arc and subduction channel environment of fossil
subduction zones. The integrated nature of these data will tie information on
fluids directly to the tectonic evolution of these rocks, and allow them to be
used to test a number of hypotheses regarding the nature and timing of the fluid
record preserved by exhumed subduction-zone metamorphic rocks. Comparison of
data sets between rocks with sedimentary and igneous protoliths found in m√©lange
zones and in coherent fault bounded blocks will offer insight into the timing of
their juxtaposition, and will allow existing geochemical studies to be tied to a
common tectonic and thermal framework.
