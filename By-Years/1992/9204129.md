This project will develop and test methods by which existing domain knowledge
can be combined with large amounts of training data to yield high-performance
classification systems. The successful development of such methods would address
fundamental questions in machine learning and solve critical applications
problems in science and engineering. In particular, the methods will be
developed and tested in the domain of ecosystem modelling, where they may be
able to provide more reliable estimates of the effect of increased atmospheric
carbon dioxide (CO2) on the geographical distribution of plant ecosystems
(biomes). Two approaches will be investigated: (a) a theory-centered approach,
in which a partial theory of plant physiology is refined so that it can predict
biome distribution, and (b) a rule-centered approach in a standard machine
learning algorithm is applied to discover biome distribution rules. The rule-
centered approach will use the partial theory of plant physiology to suggest
relevant features and to rationalize the discovered rules. Both approaches will
entail the development of new learning methods including (a) constraint
reasoning techniques for the interpretation of data and the refinement of the
domain theory, (b) constructive induction techniques for defining candidate
features, and (c) rationalization techniques for ensuring the consistency of
discovered rules with the domain theory.//
