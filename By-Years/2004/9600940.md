9600940 Budil This project is directed towards characterizing the structural
features governing the primary light reaction in photosynthetic organisms using
novel high-field electron magnetic resonance methods. The excellent spectral
resolution at high field provides a new means of probing the structure of the
primary reactant radicals. Orientation selectivity at high frequency will be
exploited to carry out "g-magnetophotoselection" experiments that will relate
magnetic properties to the optical properties of the primary reactants. Where
possible, single crystal studies will be undertaken in order to correlate the
magnetic tensors of the reactants directly with the ground state structure of
the RC. Structural influences will also be investigated by a novel
"electrostatic mapping" approach in which nitroxide spin labels are introduced
at specific amino acid residues of the protein using site-directed mutagenesis.
The electric field sensitivity of high-frequency nitroxide spectra will enable
direct exploration of local electrostatics at selected sites in the reaction
center, providing significant new information about the protein microenvironment
that guides the primary photochemistry. %%% The broader research goal of this
project is to develop new magnetic resonance techniques for probing dynamic
macromolecular structures, with an immediate focus on the structure and function
of the photochemical reaction centers in photosynthetic organisms. High-
frequency electron magnetic resonance will be used to probe the microscopic
structure of the primary reactants and the surrounding protein, as well as the
photochemical reaction dynamics. The educational goals of this program will
integrate advanced physical concepts, with an emphasis on magnetic resonance
methods, into training in molecular biology. New opportunities will be created
for students to augment their cooperative education experience at Northeastern
University by engaging directly in the development of new biophysical
methodologies in collaboration with local entrepreneurial companies. ***
