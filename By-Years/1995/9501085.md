North Carolina State U. This CAREER award is made in the Organic Dynamics
Program in support of the research and teaching activities of Dr. David Schultz.
The research will focus on the design, synthesis, and characterization of
molecular magnetic materials based on tetraarylporphyrins. The porphyrin nucleus
will provide sites for attaching organic free radical groups as well as binding
sites for metals, allowing for the preparation of extended materials including
charge transfer complexes and coordination polymers through complexation with
multidentate ligands. Specifically, metal tetraarylporphyrin units with four
free radical substituents will be oxidized to give pentaradical systems which
can undergo high spin coupling. Characterization will be by EPR,
crystallographic structure determination and magnetometer measurements.
Magnetization measurements will be complemented by molecular modeling of
intramolecular spin-spin interactions. Dr. Schultz' teaching plan will focus on
the development of animation software for three dimensional visualization of
organic chemistry structures and reactions. A salient feature will be
incorporating the animations into the organic chemistry courses at North
Carolina State and making them available to the chemistry community via the
Mosaic World-Wide-Web. Metal porphyrin-based organic magnetic materials are of
inherent interest both for a fundamental understanding of the molecular basis of
magnetism and their possible application to magnetic coatings and composites and
radical probes in biological systems. The involvement of both graduate and
undergraduate students in the implementation of the research will have a
significant educational value.
