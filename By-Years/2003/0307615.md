The James Agee Film Project is requesting funds to produce a four-part series of
one-hour films on the environmental and social history of Appalachia.
"APPALACHIA: A History of Mountains and People" will be the first series of
films on the history of Appalachia and the first environmental history film ever
made about a region in the United States. The project will demonstrate the
dynamic interaction and inseparability of natural history and human history. By
interweaving the discoveries and insights from scientific disciplines, including
geology, ecology, biology and environmental science, with those of the
humanities, the series will explore how the mountains have shaped human cultures
and how people have shaped the mountains. "APPALACHIA: A History of Mountains
and People" is made for national broadcast on PBS and is being co-sponsored by
six Appalachian state PBS networks. The series is being produced in conjunction
with the upcoming "Encyclopedia of Appalachia." Outreach programs include
partnerships with many regional grassroots organizations, PBS stations and
educational institutions to extend the film into a wide range of rural
communities and schools. The Project Director/Writer of the series will be the
Academy Award nominated filmmaker Ross Spears. Jamie Ross is co-producer/writer;
Dr. George Constantz, the Science Writer/Content Director. Dr. Constantz is also
currently the principal science and ecology editor of The Encyclopedia of
Appalachia, which will be published in 2005. A distinguished group of scholars
and scientists will contribute to the project. Dr. Gary Henry, Director of the
Applied Research Center in Atlanta, will oversee the project evaluation.
