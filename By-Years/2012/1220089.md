The present project is focused on the impact of irregular geometry and internal
medium inhomogeneity on the behavior of solutions to fundamental boundary value
problems. Despite over two centuries of intensive research and a massive body of
results, today partial differential equations on domains are thoroughly
understood only when both the coefficients and the domain exhibit smoothness.
However, the dominance of irregularities in real life and numerous problems in
modern mathematics demand for an extension of the classical "smooth" theory.
Three major directions for this extension pursued by the PI are: (a) the study
of boundary problems with rough data on non-smooth domains; (b) the second-order
elliptic operators with non-smooth coefficients; (c) elliptic PDEs of higher
order. The scope of the proposed work incorporates a full range of sharp well-
posedness and regularity results, asymptotic formulas, introduction and analysis
of new measures, capacities and new function spaces, numerical experiment,
localization phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the ubiquitousness of
irregularities in nature and in man-made mechanisms, their understanding is
essential to science, engineering, industry, and to society in general. Indeed,
most classical models only provide a nice, smooth approximation of the objects
and processes. However, perfectly uniform smooth systems do not exist in nature,
and every real object inadvertently possesses singularities (a sharp edge of the
boundary, an abrupt change of the medium, a defect of the construction). They
often have a decisive effect on the occurring phenomena, but cannot be captured
in a smooth set-up (e.g., the fractal structure of lungs). The present project
combines the mathematical pursuit and a rigorous educational program towards the
general goal of advancing analysis of partial differential equation in non-
smooth media and preparing a diverse array of mathematicians working in related
areas. The latter objective will, in particular, be achieved through a novel
Workshop for Women in Analysis and PDE.
