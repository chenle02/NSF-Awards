The recent acquisition, at Edgewood College, of an atomic absorption
spectrometer allows students to perform experiments and undertake projects
involving trace metals in biological and environmental samples. In an
integrated, interdisciplinary course for non-science and teacher education
majors, students carry out projects involving the analysis of trace amounts of
heavy metal pollutants (lead uptake in plants and mercury in human hair). In
chemistry courses, students determine metal ions in biological fluids, and
pursue student-originated projects to investigate mercury contamination of water
supplies and fish in Wisconsin waterways. Non-science majors studying geoscience
gain an appreciation for atomic absorption spectroscopy as a powerful tool in
geochemistry and chemical oceanography by investigating trace inorganic
nutrients in natural waters and determining the trace metal chemistry of rock
and ore samples. This project helps to meet a need for instrumentation-based
laboratory experiences which excite the imagination of non-science majors and
improve the science education of our future teachers. About 75% of the students
directly impacted are women. Publication of experiments developed will extend
the impact of the project.
