CTS - 9601680 Raul F. Lobo U of Delaware ABSTRACT Investigators interested in a
broad range of advanced materials research including microporous inorganic
catalysts and adsorbents, complex transition metal oxides, superconductors,
semiconductor synthesis and characterization, photovoltaic cells and structural
organomettallic chemistry, will use the new X-ray diffraction system extensively
in their research. The instruments will be used primarily for the investigation
of powders and thin films. The diffractometer brings together expertise from a
variety of disciplines and will encourage and facilitate collaboration between
different research groups. This new instrument solves a serious research
infrastructure and educational limitation at the University of Delaware. ***
