9722498 Keeler This award will support travel and related expenses for Drs.
Kathleen Keeler, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, and Jane H. Block, University
of Colorado, Boulder, for a meeting with Drs. Guillermo Norrmann and Camilo
Quairn, Universidad del Nordeste, Corrientes, Argentina. The purpose of the
visit is to develop a joint research project to investigate the role of
intraspecific polyploidy in the evolutionary success of grasses, using
Andropogon as a model system. The consultation will allow the two teams to
exchange information on preliminary studies and to plan coordinated activities
and field trips to look at related species. The topic of the research is of
considerable interest to NSF because many plant species are polyploid and
because many species, especially the grasses, occur in polyploid complexes that
appear to be the result of autopolyploidy. The research will likely contribute
to advance the understanding of this important dimension of plant evolution. ***
