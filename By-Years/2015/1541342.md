Malone University is redesigning its cyberinfrastructure support of scientific
research, building a framework that can be utilized by similarly-sized
institutions. Malone is improving support of research through: ongoing
collaborative planning with campus researchers, information technology
personnel, and external partners; implementing an advanced network with
application-level network visibility to optimize researcher√≠s connections to
resources and better troubleshoot when issues arise; improving its connections
to peer institutions by configuring a Science DMZ, Internet2, and InCommon; and
by creating a pool of student-driven programming and technical resources for the
explicit purpose of supporting campus researchers.

Malone is systematically documenting and sharing this process; building a
collaboration framework that can be referenced and leveraged by other small
institutions who seek to support their own campus researchers. Expertise of
statewide ISP OARnet will be leveraged in all aspects of the project but
especially in the areas of the ScienceDMZ, Federated Identity (InCommon), and
Internet2.
