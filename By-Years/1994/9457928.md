9457928 Gelfand This NSF Young Investigator award is for condensed matter theory
including numerical studies of models for phenomena in which disorder and
quantum fluctuations play a crucial role (quantum Hall effect and quantum
antiferromagnetism) and for studies of fullerene solids. The teaching component
includes the development of a mathematical methods course including numerical
techniques. %%% ***
