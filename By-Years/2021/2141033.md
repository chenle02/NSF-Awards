In current devices, biometrics are processed in plaintext inside the hardware
security module. Plaintext processing of biometrics leads to master keys
residing unencrypted in the hardware security module for multiple consecutive
days. As devices add sensors, they are included in the hardware security module,
adding complexity and risk. Fuzzy extractors are a cryptographic primitive that
derives keys from biometrics. However, prior fuzzy extractors do not secure
known biometrics. This project builds a computationally secure fuzzy extractor
that secures all possible distributions. Such a universal fuzzy extractor is not
possible if one desires information theoretic security. Universal fuzzy
extractors can be built with general purpose obfuscation, but such constructions
cannot be implemented on commodity hardware and there are no constructions from
standard assumptions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds universal fuzzy
extractors and investigates required assumptions. These designs are based on
limited forms of functional encryption which can be built from standard
assumptions. In addition, this project expands the functionality of fuzzy
extractors to 1) support new noise models, 2) support updatable encryption
methods, and 3) withstand active attacks. This project expands an experimental
project-based cybersecurity laboratory to middle and high school students with a
focus on under-represented female and minority students. This educational
program stresses the outcome-focused interdisciplinary nature of cybersecurity.
Students completing these programs will be hired as research assistants and
mentors for future students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
