The principal investigator will continue his work on constrained variational
problems, while at Rice University, as part of a group project based at the
University of Minnesota (DMS-8718881). The specific problems to be addressed lie
in the areas of harmonic mappings, geometric measure theory, partial
differential equations, and mechanics. The principal investigator will study the
regularity and singularity of solutions of minimizing, stationary, and dynamic
problems. Constrained variational techniques will be used by the principal
investigator to solve problems arising from the study of liquid crystals.
Techniques for the solution of such problems date back to the eighteenth century
with the invention of Lagrange Multipliers. This technique can be used to find
the point on a surface which is farthest from a given point.
