9411480 McCaughan While Ti:LiNb03-based guided wave optics have produced the
most sophisticated integrated optic structures to date, present devices lack the
ability to produce or to amplify light. We propose to develop LiNbO3-based
guided wave optical amplifiers and lasers, incorporating Er3+ as the amplifying
medium and intersecting waveguides as a likely waveguide geometry. A new class
of integrated optic devices will result from the successful integration of
optical amplifiers and lasers with existing guided wave electro-optic elements.
These will include integrable amplifiers to offset losses inherent in integrated
optics, laser-modulator integration, tunable lasers for wavelength division
multiplexing, and pulsed light sources. In order to carry out this research
cost-sharing is provided to purchase a color-center laser. This instrument will
enable characterization of several key fluorescence and absorption measurements
over the wavelength range of 1450-1650nm. The laser will allow determination of
parameters such as Er3 diffusion profiles and optimum waveguide geometries of
diode pumping. In addition, it will permit extension of site-selective
spectroscopy to the infrared. ***
