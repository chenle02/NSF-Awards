9353451 Martin This three-year project, the Weatherwatch Leadership Network, is
designed to increase and improve the teaching of weather in selected Districts
in New York City. The target grade level is elementary/middle school. The
project emphasizes the development of teachers' capability to provide leadership
to their peers, develop appropriate curriculum materials and sue a newly
developed electronic linkage which will bring weather data, weather maps and
satellite cloud imagery directly into the classroom. WeatherWatch will provide
participants with a summer institute, academic year support through biweekly
workshops and on-site demonstrations, access to a designated-space electronic
bulletin board and opportunities to exchange and present local weather
information, curriculum materials and classroom projects through
telecommunications, inservice courses and dissemination conferences.
