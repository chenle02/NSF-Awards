This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site
at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, will host eight students over the
course of nine weeks to work collaboratively on group research projects in
applied mathematics, mathematical modeling and computational and data science,
applying theoretical models to physical and biological phenomena. Students will
acquire a wide range of computational skills by receiving training on numerical
methods and their coding. The program will provide students with invaluable
educational and research skills and experiences and better prepare them for
graduate programs and careers in STEM. One of the goals is to diversify the STEM
fields, with plans for more than 50% of participants coming from under-
represented minorities and under-represented groups in STEM. The program will
also provide mentoring to early-career faculty, allowing them to grow
professionally as effective mentors for undergraduate research themselves.
Students will disseminate research results by presenting at mathematics and
interdisciplinary conferences, publishing papers in journals, and by coding
computer software, which will be made freely available.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU program will provide undergraduate students with
vigorous, motivating, and above all quality collaborative research experience in
the areas of stochastic and deterministic partial differential equations and
numerical analysis with an emphasis on the computational aspects. Additionally,
students will develop and/or apply deep spatial learning algorithms to spatial
processes resulting from partial differential equations. As a first objective,
students will study and analyze novel and engaging topics such as the dynamics
of scattering waves and propagation of nonlinear waves in non-uniform media. As
a second objective, students will work on simulating spatial processes such as
the spread of diseases or emission of pollution, which are modeled using partial
differential equations with space-time white or color noise. Students will also
produce predictive models and compare their outcomes to actual models of spatial
processes. Understanding how to address each model computationally will have a
broad impact on the studentsâ€™ ability to tackle other mathematical models and be
competitive as applicants to graduate programs as well as in industry. Moreover,
students will be enriched academically with workshops in scientific writing,
presentation skills, and graduate school readiness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
