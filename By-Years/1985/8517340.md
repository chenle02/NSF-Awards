This research project will investigate the behavior of subsurface rock subjected
to dynamic loadings such as is generated by earthquakes or by explosions. The
focus will be on porous rocks, specifically sandstone and tuff, saturated with
fluid. Conditions of fracture, large displacement, and fluid transport will be
examined experimentally with varying confining pressure representing different
depths below the surface. This research has application in the area of
earthquakes hazard assessment and mitigation, as well as in the field of
excavation and rock comminution (breakage).
