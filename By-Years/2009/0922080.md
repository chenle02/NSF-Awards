This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Long-Term Research in
Environmental Biology project capitalizes on 35 years of existing data to
investigate how climate change is affecting the phenology (timing) and abundance
of flowering by nearly 100 species of alpine wildflowers. Researchers from
Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and New Hampshire will collaborate to continue this
long-term study in mountain meadows in Colorado. They propose to combine
insights from their historical data with new observations and experiments to
learn how environmental variables affect timing and abundance of flowering. In
addition to this community-level approach they will also track individual plants
to test whether the relationship between flowering phenology and snowmelt is
changing over time. They will record the phenology of pollinators such as bees,
butterflies, and hummingbirds, and will collaborate with other researchers
studying aquatic insects, burying beetles, birds, and mosquitoes to create an
unparalleled dataset showing the phenological relationships among taxonomic
groups and trophic levels and how they are shifting in a changing
climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will foster a new collaboration by
senior and junior personnel, support research assistants (including
undergraduates, graduate students, and a community college teacher) and
postdoctoral researchers, and continue what is becoming one of the longest,
continuous-running sets of phenological observations in North America. This work
will substantially improve our understanding of the long-term ecological and
evolutionary responses of populations and communities to climate change.
