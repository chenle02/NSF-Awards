9415948 Johnson This is an integrated geochemical and geophysical investigation
of the poorly-studied, 930 km-long portion of the Southeast Indian Ridge
straddling the Amsterdam-St. Paul hotspot platform. Hypotenses on the tectonics
of mid-ocean ridges and flow in the oceanic upper mantle, particularly the
interaction between hotspots and mid-ocean ridges, will be tested. There is also
an exploratory aspect of the project in the geochemical characterization of a
little known section of the ridge ***
