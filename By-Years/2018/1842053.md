The development of new deep-sea chemical sensors will enable an improved
understanding of ocean chemistry. The researchers will develop a new sensor to
measure methane within the ocean. This sensor will be designed to be deployable
on a range of underwater and surface vehicles. This sensor will provide the
oceanographic community with a new tool for measuring methane across a range of
environments from estuaries to the deep sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of
the project is to develop an oceanographic mid-infrared methane sensor capable
of measuring methane throughout the water column. There is a strong demand for
sensors to be sensitive enough to characterize water column levels of methane,
opening the door for improved understanding of methane dynamics across all ocean
environments. Field tests of this sensor will take place on a test cruise to
Guaymas Basin using a range of oceanographic platforms. This research project is
a partnership between academia and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
