The American Chemical Society METAL OXIDES Symposium on will be held in Boston,
MA, August 18-22, 2002. The goal of the conference is to facilitate
multidisciplinary interactions and information exchange within a broad spectrum
of researchers, to include CAREER grantees, post doctoral scholars and graduate
students working in priority areas of the broad field of metal oxide solid-state
chemistry. The NSF funds will be used to support the costs for invited speakers,
junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students to participate in the
symposium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Solid State Chemistry community continues
to have direct impact on technological areas that are crucial to advancing
society through the design, synthesis and application new materials. Examples
include metal oxide materials for oxide ferroelectrics, thin films for
electronics and electrooptic devices, oxide superconductors and oxides with
negative thermal expansion coefficients. Since these technical areas are of very
high priority to industry, students educated and trained in these
multidisciplinary areas involving solid-state chemistry compete very well in the
job market and go on to contribute in many significant ways to the global
economy.&lt;br/&gt;
