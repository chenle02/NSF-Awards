This project is to determine the extent of heterogeniety in upper-mantle oxygen
fugacity using a newly calibrated thermobarometric method. This will involve
measuring the compositions of coexisting olivine, orthopyroxene and spinel from
spinel lherzolites by microprobe and Mossbauer methods. Spinel lherzolite
xenoliths have been, and are being, collected from a number of different
geologic areas and tectonic environments in both continental and oceanic plates
- British Columbia, Japan, Massif Central of France, Southwestern Us., Eastern
Australia and Hawaii. Abyssal peridotites dredged from fracture zones in the
Atlantic and Indian Oceans will provide further coverage of oceanic lithosphere
and facilitate distinction between subcontinental and suboceanic mantle with
respect to oxygen fugacity. Analysis of samples from areas of recent subduction
(Japan, British Columbia) will provide tests of the hypothesis that the mantle
is becoming oxidized through the agency of subduction-derived fluids.
Preliminary Mossbauer measurements of garnet and garnet-spinel lherzolites
indicate that, at pressures above the spinel stability field, garnet contains
substantial amounts of ferric iron. The thermobarometric method will be extended
to the garnet field by determining Fe3-Al partitioning between coexisting spinel
and garnet.
