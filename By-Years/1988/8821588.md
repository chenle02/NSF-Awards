In this project within the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program, Dwight A. Sweigart of Brown University will investigate some reactions
of organometallic compounds with the specific goals of (1) developing new
synthetic routes to important organic molecules, (2) probing the detailed
mechanistic pathways for electrophile-nucleophile combinations so that
predictions of pi-hydrocarbon activation become possible, and (3) determining
the feasibility of examining these reactions electrochemically by using low
temperature voltammetric and steady-state ultramicroelectrode techniques. The
mechanistic studies are applicable to acid-base reactions in general and may
have theoretical consequences well beyond organometallic chemistry in the
possible discovery of an universal nucleophilic reactivity scale for such
reactions. Pioneering experimental and theoretical applications of
ultramicroelectrodes are proposed that should aid in making this methodology
available to all chemists. The reactions of electrophilic organometallic
complexes of manganese, iron, rhenium and tungsten containing coordinated pi-
hydrocarbons such as arenes, alkenes and alkynes will be examined. The primary
reaction is attack by nucleophiles (with carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus or
hydrogen donor atoms) at the activated pi-hydrocarbon to produce functionalized
molecules. The proposed study will provide general routes to disubstituted cis-
and trans-cyclohexadienes as well as novel endofunctionalized cyclohexadienyl
complexes.
