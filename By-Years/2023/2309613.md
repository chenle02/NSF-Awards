This award provides funding for research using data recorded by the ATLAS
detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The analyses carried out will
advance our understanding of the universe at the highest energies, and therefore
shortest distances, ever explored in a laboratory setting. Production and decay
properties of the Higgs Boson will be measured, which, according to our best
theoretical models, is responsible for all mass in the universe and which plays
a crucial role in the ultimate stability of the universe. The group will also
use the data to search for evidence of new physics associated with Higgs Boson
reactions which are not currently included in accepted theories. This work gives
undergraduate and graduate students an opportunity to participate in leading
edge scientific research and instrumentation development. The students and
postdocs to be supported by this project, through their own technical work and
research and their work with engineers and technicians, prepares them for
research in careers in academia, industry and other areas which require
technical skills.

This work will be performed using LHC Run 3 data in final states associated with
the standard model reactions pp→H→bb, pp→HH→bbττ and pp→H→μμ. The proposed
effort will search for the reaction pp → H → aa → bbμμ and also reactions with
lepton, neutrino and dijet final states. These searches could yield long sought
discoveries of Beyond the Standard Model physics. The last of these channels
will measure vector boson scattering processes associated with Higgs
interactions which are required to establish unitarity in the standard model.
The work will also carry out detector operations of the current detector and
upgrades for high luminosity for the tracking system and liquid Argon
calorimeter system.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
