The goal of this research is to study space bounded computations. Even though
space bounded computations are somewhat less difficult to analyze than time
bounded computations, little is known regarding the power of nondeterminism.
This research attempts to understand underlying combinatorics in space bounded
computations by looking at various restricted models of computation. The
DSPACE覺log n! =? NSPACE覺log n! problem is approached by considering different
models such as sublog space bounded machines, universal traversal sequence and
multihead two way finite state automaton. These restricted models of computation
raise interesting questions with direct consequence to DSPACE覺log n! =?
NSPACE覺log n! problem. This research concentrates on developing and using tools
like communication complexity to show lower bounds on space requirement in these
models with the hope of understanding the space bounded computations.
