9625887 Cargill This award is for the development of instrumentation for
quantitative strain measurements in crystalline solids with the goal of 10nm
lateral spatial resolution and 10-4 strain sensitivity, with concurrent
composition and microstructure mapping capabilities at this resolution. This
instrument will advance x-ray diffraction to the range of spatial resolution
usually associated with scanning or transmission electron microscopy. Nanoscale
x-ray diffraction will employ white beam synchrotron radiation collimated and
concentrated by a tapered glass capillary. Laue diffraction patterns from single
grains will be examined with a CCD-based area detector. Strains within single
grains will be determined from lattice parameter measurements using an Si(Li)
detector, with careful attention to stability of associated electronics and to
optimally fitting energy peaks in the detector output to determine x-ray photon
energies. %%% The capabilities to be provided by this instrument are critically
important in understanding the properties of nanofarbricated materials.
Understanding the optical properties of quantum well-based structures, the
mechanical properties of nanomachines, and the strength and toughness of
nanocomposites require quantitative measurements of strain on the nanometer
scale.
