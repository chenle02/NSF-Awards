9302050 Fritts The Hawaiian MF radar installed on Kauai, Hawaii in September
1990 will be used together with other airborne and ground-based systems to
address large- and small-scale dynamics and coupling processes, including
vertical propagation of and interactions among gravity wave and tidal motions,
variability of gravity waves in response to localized source regions, the
interactions and variability of large-scale tidal and two-day notions, and mean
and variable wave forcing of the equatorial middle atmosphere. Correlative
analyses with lidars and airglow instrumentation in Hawaii and aboard the NCAR
Electra will be useful in examining spatial and temporal variability of the
gravity wave field and vertical propagation and effects. Correlations with MF
and MEDAC radar systems across the equatorial Pacific and in Puerto Rico will
provide valuable data on the tidal and two-day wave motions and their
variability. ***
