This project will improve our capability for predicting how floating sea ice and
the ocean evolve in the Arctic Ocean. To do this, we will develop a computer
model for examining how ocean surface waves interact with sea ice and run
simulations to improve predictions of how the heat and salt move up and down in
the ocean. This new model will be shared for free, helping other scientists
carry out new research into these processes, and making it easier for students
to learn about the Arctic Ocean, its sea ice, and its changing behavior in a
warming world. The project will support several early-career scientists in their
training and research, including two students. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Floating
sea ice is an important part of the climate system as it reflects sunlight and
acts as a barrier that separates the ocean from the atmosphere. The presence of
sea ice is crucial in determining how warm the Arctic Ocean is and will become.
The ocean surface also moves up and down due to waves, which are one of the main
ways that the heat and salt of surface waters contact and mix with the deep
ocean. Wave-related mixing is important across the global ocean, but we do not
currently understand its impact in regions of sea ice. This is because sea ice
changes the waves and their movement, affecting how surface and deep waters mix.
This project addresses this uncertainty by identifying when and where wave-
related mixing is occurring in the Arctic, and by understanding how floating sea
ice impacts the strength of this mixing. We will use small-scale computer
modeling experiments, informed by observations, to create a new way to account
for this mixing in the global climate models used to predict Earthâ€™s future. As
part of this work, we will develop and publicly share a computer code that
simulates ocean mixing under various Arctic conditions, including both ice and
waves. This code will broadly aid Arctic oceanographers and will be used in
classes to train ocean modelers at Oregon State University and Brown University.
This project will support 5 people who are early in their scientific career,
ranging from an undergraduate student to two assistant
professors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
