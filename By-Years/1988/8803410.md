The Bermuda Biological Station will establish a program for shipboard technician
activities associated with the R/V WEATHERBIRD, an 85-foot research vessel that
is owned and operated by the Station. A significant portion of the ship's
operating schedule during 1988 is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.
The Shipboard Technician Program has two components: an at-sea component and an
ashore component. The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific
personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment; maintenance, repair, and
calibration of scientific instrumentation; instruction and supervision of deck
operations; and providing logistics assistance to on-coming and off-going
scientific parties. On shore activities include the maintenance, repair, and
calibration of shared use seagoing equipment and assisting scientific personnel
in preparing for field work on the vessel. NSF-sponsored shipboard technicians
have broad responsibilities for providing the coordination and assistance needed
for the successful completion of research projects at sea. The level of activity
and amount of support are closely related to the size and capability of the
vessel, and its scientific outfit and capability.
