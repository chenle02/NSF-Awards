The major objectives of the effort include the following: Comprehensive study of
the mechanisms of carriers' TM ions energy transfer due to carrier impact and
recombination in bulk and quantum confined structures. Design, fabrication, and
characterization of TM doped II-VI structures for electroluminescence and laser
studies. Comprehensive studies and optimization of lasing characteristics of
electrically pumped TM-doped II-VI structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
merit: For realization of electrically pumped lasers based on transition metal
(TM) doped II-VI structures two conditions should be satisfied: (i) sustainable
excitation of the host by electrical current; and (ii) effective energy transfer
from the host to the mid-IR lasing TM impurity. The feasibility of the first
condition is supported by development of II-VI LED sources with a lifetime
exceeding 10,000 hours. The second condition can be achieved either via carrier
impact energy transfer or via recombination processes. We envision that
understanding and optimization of the mechanisms of carrier TM ions energy
transfer will enable significant improvement in the efficiency of energy
transfer for carrier impact mechanisms, and especially for TM ions excitation
via recombination processes in bulk p-n junctions and in quantum confined
structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The workforce development
will involve (i) incorporation of findings into four courses taught to two
campuses of the University of Alabama System, (ii) graduate student training,
and (iii) undergraduate student research through REU site. In addition, the
innovative approaches to be investigated will lead to ground-breaking advances
for low-cost electrically pumped broadly tunable mid-IR laser sources which will
impact medical, environmental, scientific, and counter-terrorism applications.
