*** CMS 9629871 Mittler Following Hurricane Hugo, the Loma earthquake, Hurricane
Andrew, Hurricane Iniki, and the Northridge earthquake, some states undertook
significant disaster mitigation initiatives while others did not. This study
examines why and how several states decided to take on responsibilities for
seismic and hurricane safety. Fourteen case studies will be conducted in these
states involving the collection of detailed information from numerous sources
including key policy officials, commissions, agencies and state associations.
This study is especially timely because recently enacted and proposed natural
disaster mitigation laws have sought to create or improve the capacity of states
to develop mitigation policies and programs. In addition to its theoretical
contribution, one possible benefit of the study will be to shed light on how
states can improve their ability to transfer useful technologies initiated by
other states.***
