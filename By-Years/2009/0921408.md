Judges often "rehabilitate" jurors who express inability to be fair during voir
dire. The present research examines psychological mechanisms operating during
juror rehabilitation. Study 1 investigates the impact of two components of juror
rehabilitation (i.e., instruction on the law and elicitation of a public
commitment to forgo bias and follow the law) to determine whether the influence
of juror rehabilitation is due to informational or normative influences from the
judge. Specifically, we will assess whether rehabilitation results in verdicts
that are consistent with the evidence or verdicts that are biased toward
leniency (as removal of bias in our study would result in a more lenient
verdict) irrespective of the evidence. Biased and unbiased participants will be
questioned by a judge as part of a mock voir dire and then watch an insanity
trial. If rehabilitation has an informational influence on jurors, verdicts
should show sensitivity to variations in evidentiary support of an NGRI verdict.
Study 2 explores the hypothesis that rehabilitation for bias attributable to
prejudicial pretrial publicity (PTP) prompts jurors to engage in thought
suppression. As attempts at thought suppression may lead to hyperaccessibility
of the banned information, we predict the effect of PTP may be larger when
jurors are rehabilitated and cognitively busy. Study 2 also examines an
alternative to traditional rehabilitation that emphasizes concentration instead
of suppression. In addition to participation in a mock voir dire, jurors in
Study 2 will deliberate to a verdict.
