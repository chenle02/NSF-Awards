Dr. Andrei Tokmakoff has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Tokmakoff received his doctoral degree from Stanford University
under the supervision of Professor Michael Fayer. Dr. Tokmakoff will continue
research at the University of Chicago under the sponsorship of Professor Graham
Fleming. His postdoctoral research will target the study of solvent modes in
water, aqueous solutions, and other complex liquids. Femtosecond visible pulses
will be used to understand low frequency modes and structural evolution of
liquids with 5th and 7th order nonlinear Raman spectroscopy and linear Raman-
induced Kerr effect experiments. Theoretical advances will be made in the
description of high-order nonlinear experiments, particularly in the description
of the influence of orientational motion on coherence experiments. The research
will contribute to our understanding of the concepts and techniques of ultrafast
spectroscopy of condensed phase chemical systems. The Postdoctoral Research
Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural
program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph. D.s and
attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and
teaching.
