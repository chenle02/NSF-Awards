9723965 Cordon The long term objective of this research is to understand the
structure and function of the repetitive C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA
polymerase II. Our recent studies have shown that the CTD interacts with a novel
set of CTD-binding proteins (CBPs). These proteins are related to a set of
serine/arginine-rich proteins (SR proteins) that have been shown to be involved
in processing pre-mRNA. In addition to specific domains that interact with the
CTD, CBPs have conserved domains suggesting interations with other SR proteins
and with RNA. We have identified CBPs in mouse, rat, human, and yeast cells. The
objective of this research is to determine whether the CTD and the CTD-binding
protein Nrd1 play a role in pre-mRNA processing in the yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. Specifically we will examine yeast cells expressing mutant forms of
the CTD or of the CTD-binding protein Nrd1 for defects in pre-mRNA splicing, in
cleavage and polyadenylation, and in transcription elongation. We will also test
mammalian CBPs for their ability to complement a yeast NRD1 deletion mutation.
These functional studies are designed to test our general hypothesis that the
CTD links transcription and pre-mRNA processing in vivo. The construction of
genetic and biochemical tools to study post-initiation CTD function in yeast
will lay a foundation for more detailed mechanistic studies of both yeast and
mammalian CTD-binding proteins and their interaction with phosphorylated forms
of RNA polymerase II during transcription elongation. %%% The long term
