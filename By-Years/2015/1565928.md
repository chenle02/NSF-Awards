This project proposes a new paradigm to enhance computing efficiency --- Finite
State Machine (FSM)-centric approximate computing. Approximate computing has
shown promise for both reducing energy consumption and improving performance
across different applications, especially those in image processing, machine
learning and data analytics. To date, approximate computing has been
inapplicable to FSM modeling of computations, which has important applications
in domains that include biological science, cyber security, data compression,
software engineering and hardware design. Growing data volumes and limitations
on computer processing power constrain FSM?s efficiency. The establishment of
FSM-centric approximate computing will open the door to a new dimension of
efficiency optimization for software applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research will take advantage of the synergy between FSM computations and
approximate computing --- the inherent error tolerance capability within FSM
computations --- to develop a computing platform for exploring approximate FSM
computations. The key idea is a quantitative analysis of FSM reliability that
captures how errors generated by underlying approximate hardware propagate
through FSM transitions. Additionally, this research will also design and
implement two complementary approximation schemes --- one relies on the
"inexactness" of approximate hardware; the other provides pure software
approximation and runs on conventional exact hardware. Together these
approximation strategies will demonstrate the potential of FSM-centric
approximate computing in improving the efficiency of FSM applications.
