This project seeks to develop methods to quantify and improve the
generalizability of findings from STEM educational evaluation and research. A
central problem in educational evaluation is how to determine whether the
results of a well-designed experiment or quasi-experiment evaluating the effect
of a STEM educational intervention (e.g., curricula, instructional strategies,
professional development, or technologies) will apply to a different policy-
relevant population. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will build on
propensity score methods and a database of national covariates to create a
statistical approach that uses study samples to estimate parameters of the
distribution of treatment effects in an inference population. In short, this
method will make it possible to use results from one study to make statistical
claims in another population or place. This is something that cannot be done in
most cases using current methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the
mathematical derivation of new statistical methods, the project will develop a
public-use database containing NCES Common Core of Data and census data linked
to it as a resource for establishing covariate values for inference populations.
The method will be tested and validated by analyzing secondary data from 20
field studies supported by NSF and the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) of
the US Department of Education. The investigator will increase the field's
capacity to use the new methods by conducting training workshops at four
national educational conferences for other researchers.
