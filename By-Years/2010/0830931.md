Learning progressions provide a theoretical framework for developing curricula
and assessments that support student learning of big ideas in science over
multiple grades and grade bands. This project proposes a week-long workshop on
designing, developing and using assessments to study and validate learning
progressions. The workshop is aimed at early career researchers engaged in the
development and study of learning progressions in science.
