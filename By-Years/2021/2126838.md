The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project is to improve the health and quality of life for the 15-30 million
Americans suffering from celiac disease (CD) and other gluten-related disorders,
especially those with poor management of symptoms. Gluten-related disorders have
a combined global prevalence of 5â€“10% and have been increasing over the past
decade. Currently, the only effective treatment for these patients is adherence
to a strict gluten-free diet, which fails to relieve symptoms in all patients
and cannot prevent the severe gastrointestinal distress that follows accidental
exposure. This project will advance a therapeutic solution to prevent persistent
symptoms related to low-level or accidental gluten exposure. This will provide
protection for people with CD and non-celiac gluten sensitivity when traveling,
new patients adapting to a gluten-free diet, and individuals whose symptoms are
poorly controlled despite adherence to a gluten-free diet.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will leverage a novel bacteriophage-
based microbiome engineering platform to advance the development of a product to
provide protection from gastrointestinal distress stemming from gluten exposure.
To develop this therapeutic phage product, phages capable of infecting common
gut bacteria like E. coli will be identified and engineered for efficient
lysogenization. The phage or phage cocktail will be further engineered to
express therapeutic modalities/proteins and tested in both human organoids
derived from patients with CD and mouse models to demonstrate efficacy. The
proposed work will provide a foundation for future extension of the platform to
a wide range of microbiome-based applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
