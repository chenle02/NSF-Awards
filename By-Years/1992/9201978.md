The OH radical is central to the photochemistry of the troposphere, and
measures of its concentration furnish an extremely sensitive test of our
knowledge of the chemistry. Its detection, however, poses a considerable
challenge due to its very low concentration and possible interfering species. At
this time, there are several promising candidate methods, some ready for field
trials and others not yet developed. SRI International will organize and host a
workshop in early 1992 to assess current capabilities, discuss and thereby
improve the experimental approaches, and consider intercomparison test. HO2
detection is not so difficult as HO detection but is also challenging, and
discussion of its measurement using similar or variant methods will also be
included. The workshop participants will include atmospheric modelers,
researchers involved in field measurement and the associated technique
development, and experimentalists in chemical physics. A report will be written
describing the workshop discussions, conclusions, and recommendations.
