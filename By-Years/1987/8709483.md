This award provides support for the continuing activities of The Board on
Chemical Sciences and Technology (BCST) of the Commission on Physical Sciences,
Mathematics, and Resources. The Board is the principal vehicle of the National
Research Council for addressing issues specific to biochemistry, chemistry,
chemical engineering and related disciplines. Chaired by Drs. George M.
Whitesides and Leo J. Thomas, with 22 members broadly knowledgeable in
chemistry, chemical engineering, related sciences, and the administration of
research in academic, industrial, and government laboratories, the BCST has
organized and provided oversight to a number of important study committees.
These activities produce reports of considerable importance to the Foundation
and may be made available to the public without restrictions.
