9311876 Oyama This is a study of the reactions of ozone on transition-metal
oxides. Ozone decomposition on oxide catalysts is observed to determine the
effects of oxide-support and oxide-oxide interactions; kinetics measurements are
made for the most active systems. Adsorption/desorption properties of the oxides
are studied using temperature-programmed techniques; the mode of ozone
adsorption is studied using isotope scrambling. Dispersion, phase composition,
and surface intermediates in single-component and binary catalytic systems are
determined using X-ray diffraction and laser Raman spectroscopy. In situ
techniques such as the Hall effect, quartz-crystal microbalance, and surface
charge measurements are employed to show whether p-type oxides are more active
catalysts and whether the superoxide ion (02-) is a possible reaction
intermediate. Finally, the reactivities of ozmne/oxygen mixtures with ethanol or
propylene are observed. It is "common knowledge" that transition-metal oxides
can catalyze reactions and decomposition of ozone, but these systems have never
been studied systematically. This study has not only fundamental significance,
but also practical importance both in issues about the environmental fate of
ozone and in the development of technology to control ozone levels in
environmental or occupational settings. ***
