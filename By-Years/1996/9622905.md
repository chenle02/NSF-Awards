Gieseker DMS 96-22905 This awards supports the research of Professor D. Gieseker
to work on the algebraic geometry of difference equations. He hopes to apply
techniques of algebraic geometry to various nonlinear equations usually arising
from physics. In this proposal he intends to concentrate on the KP and Davey-
Stewartson equations. What he hopes to do is discretize the continuous linear
operator so that the associated linear problem admits isospectral deformations..
This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of
modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the point where it has, in the
past 10 years, solved problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, it
treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely
polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from
analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those fields.
Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics,
theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
