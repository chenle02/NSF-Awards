Dr. John H. Griffin has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Griffin's doctoral degree was from the California Institute of
Technology under the supervision of Professor Peter B. Dervan. Dr. Griffin
intends to continue research at the Harvard Medical School under the sponsorship
of Professor Christopher T. Walsh. Dr. Griffin's area of postdoctoral research
will be a mechanistic study of the blood-clotting mode of action of the membrane
bound enzyme, glutamyl gamma-carboxylase. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships
in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed
to broaden the knowledge and experience of new PhD's and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
