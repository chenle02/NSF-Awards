The 2014 International Conference on Mathematical Methods and Models in
Biosciences and Young Scientists School (BIOMATH 2014) will be hosted by the
Bulgarian Academy of Sciences during June 22-27, 2014 in Sofia, Bulgaria. The
BIOMATH 2014 conference focuses on the interplay between modeling, mathematical
analysis, and numerical simulation in epidemiology and cancer modeling, among
other mathematical biology fields. Mentoring and training of junior faculty and
advanced graduate students is a central part of the BIOMATH 2014 conference.
This award supports participation by US-based advanced graduate students, post-
doctoral fellows, and junior faculty without access to other grant support.
Priority will be given to the support of students and new doctorates from groups
underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.

There are many U.S. graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning
faculty working at the interface of mathematics and biology. The award will
enable such US-based researchers to attend the BIOMATH 2014 conference. The
BIOMATH 2014 conference will provide a unique opportunity for their
participation, an excellent educational experience, and mentoring and
interaction with some of the most active and leading researchers in mathematical
biology. The meeting will serve as a vehicle for enhancing and supporting their
career developments. It is expected that the conference will catalyze many
successful interdisciplinary collaborations between the BIOMATH participants
from the United States and Eastern Europe.
