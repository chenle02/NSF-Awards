This research focuses on the synthesis of syringolides and syringolide analogs,
compounds of a type known to trigger disease resistance in plants. These
synthetic molecules will be used to isolate and structurally characterize their
receptor proteins. The ultimate goal is the molecular cloning of the resistance
gene responsible for producing the receptor protein. The research has important
potential for developing new methods of crop protection. The educational plan
focuses on undergraduate course development. With this CAREER award, the
Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research and educational activities
of Dr. John L. Wood of the Department of Chemistry at Yale University. Professor
Wood will focus his research efforts on understanding microbial-plant signal
transduction as well as the biochemical events leading to the hypersensitive
response mechanism of plant defenses. The work has important potential for the
agricultural industry. Dr. Wood's educational plan focuses on course development
at the undergraduate level.
