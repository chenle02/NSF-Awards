This project studies fundamental combinatorial, geometric, and graph-theoretical
problems related to the design of wireless networks with directional antennas.
The goal is to maximize communication robustness and security while minimizing
power consumption and interference. The technical focus is on determining
theoretical and algorithmic relationships between antenna parameters
(orientation, range, angle), and the structure of the induced communication
graph (such as connectivity, fault tolerance, and spanning ratio).

This study will generate fresh approaches to geometric algorithms tuned to
directional antennas, which must necessarily push beyond known geometric
techniques. Building a bridge between theoretical computer science and the
burgeoning area of communication networks is a key for scientific advancement,
with a potential significant economical impact on the design of wireless
communication networks.

This project will involve collaborations with under-represented students, who
will be fully engaged in designing and testing the necessary simulation
software, and will explore conjectures both theoretically and through
simulations. This will provide a path for talented under-represented students to
enter the world of scientific research, who will then serve as role models for
the entire body of computer scientists. Theoretical results will be disseminated
broadly in conference publications and journal papers. Simulation software will
be made available to researchers and teachers worldwide.
