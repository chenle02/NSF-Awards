9411384 Danyluk Support is provided to enable three tribologists from the former
Soviet Union make research visits to Georgia Institute of Technology. There,
they will assist in further refinement of wear-sensing instrumentation, which is
being developed by the PI based on an original proposal by one of the visitors,
Dr. Zharin of Belarus. The visit will also serve to initiate additional
cooperative research activities between the US, Belarus, and the Ukraine. ***
