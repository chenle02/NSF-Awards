This research aims to determine the function and information content of
communication vocalizations of a large, omnivorous bat, the greater spear-nosed
bat. The rich vocal repertoire, unusual social system in which unrelated females
form long- lasting groups, and proclivity to forage in groups while producing
loud, audible calls make this bat ideally suited for study. Dr. Wilkinson's
research is designed to determine if vocal advertisement and group foraging
result in reciprocated or mutualistic benefits. To discriminate between these
alternatives, he will use infrared-sensitive video and computerized recording
equipment to conduct observations and playback experiments on individually
marked bats departing from cave roosts or foraging in groups during three months
of field work in Trinidad, West Indies. Acoustic analysis of bat vocalizations
recorded in the field from known individuals will be used to indicate the type
of information that could be contained in particular calls. Behavioral
experiments designed to measure the energetic benefits of group foraging and
information exchange, as well as the mechanism by which information is
transferred, will be conducted on captive bats at the National Zoo, Washington,
D.C., over a seven-month period. Reciprocal information exchange is common in
all human societies but is unknown for other vertebrates with the possible
exception of chimpanzees and dolphins. This research should, therefore, add to
our understanding of communication and cooperation in bats and provide insight
into the evolution of cooperative communication. In addition, because this bat
pollinates flowers and disperses seeds from a variety of tropical trees, an
improved understanding of its foraging behavior may provide valuable information
for conserving Latin American rain forests.
