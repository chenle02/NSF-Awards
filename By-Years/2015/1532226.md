This award will provide funds to acquire a compact Scanning Electron Microscope
(SEM) to support a new collaborative Geobiology Research Group, consisting of
current and new faculty in Biology and Geosciences. This group's mission is to
facilitate cross-disciplinary research, with the primary goal of training
undergraduate researchers. Geobiology is a rapidly-growing research area that
focuses on the interaction of microorganisms with their mineral environment, and
SEM is a critical tool to study both organisms and mineral analysis. The SEM to
be acquired is a new compact but full-featured, low-cost instrument that is well
suited as a cross-disciplinary microscope for a primarily-undergraduate
institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument will be used to characterize
both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, minerals produced by microbial
activity, and the geochemical and microstructural attributes of fossil
biosignatures and host rock lithology. Designed for simplicity and ease of
maintenance, this compact, research-grade SEM is ideal for an institution
focused on fostering independent undergraduate research projects to explore both
the current and past evolution of microbes and their environment.
