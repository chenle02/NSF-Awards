ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for
travel of young researchers (advanced graduate students, post doctoral
researchers and very new faculty) to attend the First International School and
Conference on Nanoscale/Molecular Mechanics to be held in Maui, Hawaii from May
12-17, 2002. The school will be held two days prior to the conference. A panel
of distingushed lecturers has been selected to make presentations. Many of the
pioneers in nanoscale mechanics will make presentations at the conference.
