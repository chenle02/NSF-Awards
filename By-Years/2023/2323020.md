Proteins are large, flexible macromolecules that perform a vast range of
functions within living organisms, small and large. Their functions span from
copying genetic material to providing structural integrity to cells and
organisms. Because of their size, flexibility, and biochemistry, proteins can
undergo structural changes that dictate their function, or sometimes cause
disease. The ability to understand and predict how the conditions that proteins
experience affect their structure and conformation, and in turn their
functioning in solution, is very important. This award will be used for the
development of predictive models for both fundamental science and industry,
including development of first-principle models and manufacturing of
pharmaceuticals. Microgravity makes it possible to study how protein solutions
flow without complications associated with the interaction of protein solutions
and solid walls. This project utilizes the microgravity environment of the
International Space Station, where surface tension becomes a dominant force;
this allows the study of protein solutions in the ring-sheared drop module, a
container-less biochemical reactor.

The purpose of this award is to gain deeper scientific understanding of protein
association, aggregation, and gelation in systems with high protein
concentration in the presence of free surfaces. The ring-sheared drop module
aboard the International Space Station was designed for studying flows in gas-
liquid systems, in which surface tension provides containment and shear is
conveyed primarily through the action of surface shear viscosity. The ring-
sheared drop is especially suitable for studying protein rheology as it
minimizes any wall-nucleation effects. This project targets multiple classes of
proteins, including globular, hormonal, and monoclonal antibody therapeutics.
The recent development of protein solution viscosity models from first
principles will be utilized as a foundation for mechanistic models including
coupling of interfacial and bulk stresses to predict the flow of protein
solutions. Variables captured by the model include the protein type (e.g.,
transport, hormone, or antibody), physical state (e.g. monomers, aggregates,
fibrils, or gels), and concentration. Predictions from these models will be
tested in the ring-sheared drop aboard the International Space Station.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
