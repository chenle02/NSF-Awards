Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The PI hypothesizes that bedforms found in the
Central and Joides troughs can be interpreted as having been formed by rapid
retreat, and possible collapse of an ice stream that occupied this area. To test
this hypothesis, the PI proposes to conduct a detailed marine geological and
geophysical survey of Central and Joides Troughs in the western Ross Sea. This
project will bridge gaps between the small and isolated areas previously
surveyed and will acquire a detailed sedimentological record of the retreating
grounding line. The PI will reconstruct the retreat history of the Central and
Joides troughs to century-scale resolution using radiocarbon dating methods and
by looking at geomorphic features that are formed at regular time intervals.
Existing multibeam, deep tow side-scan sonar, and core data will provide a
framework for this research. The western Ross Sea is an ideal study area to
investigate a single ice stream and the dynamics controlling its stability,
including interactions between both East and West Antarctic Ice Sheets.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This proposal includes a post-
doc, a graduate and two undergraduate students. The post-doc is involved with
teaching an in-service K-12 teacher development and training course at Rice
University for high-need teachers with a focus on curriculum enhancement. The
project fosters collaboration for the PI and students with researchers at
Louisiana State University and international colleagues at the Institute for
Paleobiology at the Polish Academy of Sciences. The results from this project
could lead to a better understanding of ice sheet and ice stream stability. This
project will yield implications for society's understanding of climate change,
as this work improves understanding of the behavior of ice sheets and their
links to global climate.
