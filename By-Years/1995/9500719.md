This award supports research in the field of arithmetic geometry. The
fundamental role played by height functions throughout arithmetic geometry is
well established. The new theory of canonical heights developed by Call and
Silverman has raised many interesting questions involving arithmetic geometry
and its relation to dynamics. The main goal of this project is to extend these
recent advances in the theory of canonical heights to study the dynamics of
polynomial and rational maps on projective space and to investigate the
arithmetic properties of surfaces and abelian varieties. This research belongs
to the general mathematical area of arithmetic geometry. This ultramodern
research area combines two of the oldest branches of mathematics: number theory
and geometry. The new insights arising out of this combination are producing
increasingly powerful tools to solve long-standing problems like Fermat's Last
Theorem, which have resisted the strongest efforts of over three centuries of
mathematicians. In addition, though arithmetic geometry is sometimes regarded as
among the purest of pure mathematics, it has also been developing insightful new
techniques leading to dramatic progress in such applied areas as error-
correcting codes and cryptography.
