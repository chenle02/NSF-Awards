This research will focus mainly on two areas. The first concerns congruences
for values of L-functions predicted by the theory of multiplicative Galois
structures. The second concerns the connections between Arakelov theory and
adelic capacity theory. Work will also continue on determining the smallest
arithmetic hyperbolic three manifold with a given number of cusps and to study
whether the minimal volume of all hyperbolic manifolds with a given number of
cusps is achieved by an arithmetic manifold. Finally, the connections between
Mahler measures, L-series and K-groups of rings of integers will be studied This
research will encompass broad areas of number theory and related areas. It will
move into areas of analysis, algebra and geometry. The connections between all
three areas will focused upon giving this research a particular appeal. Much of
great interest will come from three endeavors.
