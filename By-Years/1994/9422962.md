ABSTRACT CTS-9422962 It is proposed to experimentally investigate supermicron
particle aggregation and sedimentation in relatively idealized conditions, in
order to better understand the basic physical processes and provide a data base
for modeling. The specific objectives are to conduct flow visualization in a
laboratory system, analyze and model the fundamental parameters controlling
gravity induced aggregation, and characterize retarded coagulation and
subsequent aggregate morphology in quiescent environmental systems. The proposed
quiescent reactor apparatus allows for real time observation of gravity-driven
aggregation dynamics, with simultaneous measurements of particle/aggregate size,
velocity and shape. The effects of shear flow, Brownian diffusion,
sedimentation, aqueous chemistry, and particle surface characteristics on
aggregation will be investigated. The experimental results will be introduced in
a model applicable to natural and engineered systems. The project will improve
basic understanding of gravity-driven aggregation and sedimentation occurring in
natural surface- and ground water environments, including chemical cycling,
particulate dynamics, and contaminant redemption. ***
