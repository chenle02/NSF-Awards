The Mathematical Association of America is developing and implementing model
workshops at annual meetings of each of the 29 Sections of the Association. The
model workshops will contain three components: a contributed paper session or
panel discussion featuring individuals rewarded grants for activities in pre-
college and undergraduate mathematics programs; an overview presentation
highlighting designated NSF program initiatives; and a workshop on the
preparation and evaluation of proposals. The sessions will disseminate results
of projects supported by the Foundation and stimulate discussion about current
issues in pre-college and undergraduate mathematics education.
