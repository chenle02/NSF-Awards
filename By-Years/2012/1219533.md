The goal of this project is to document the typologically rare morphological,
syntactic and phonological patterns of the endangered Austronesian Language
Atayal, and to compare its structure to that of another endangered language from
the same family Saisiyat. The primary research objectives are: 1) to gain a
better understanding of how information structure - the topic-focus structuring
of the sentence - interacts with independent constraints on word order and with
prosody; 2) to understand some typologically exceptional processes of word
formation present in these languages. The languages investigated will provide us
with important information about the linguistic structure of words and
sentences, which helps us gain deeper understanding of cognitive processing.
Since these languages are likely to no longer be spoken in a few generations it
is important to document them now before they disappear, especially because
these languages have typologically rare phenomena that may be especially
informative to our understanding of linguistic structure. The project will
explore how prosodic cues mark information structure in Saisiyat, in a detailed
experimental setting that will 1) survey multiple native speakers, residing near
Hsinchu, Taiwan, for acceptability judgments of sentences in their language, and
2) document native speakers reading question-answer discourse using the
different word order(s). Saisiyat, an Subject-Verb-Object language, and Atayal,
a Verb-Subject-Object language, providing for a rich comparison of word order
possibilities and prosodic prominence. The research project will also
investigate rare processes of word-formation, where single consonants are
duplicated and combined to the word to indicate a grammatical function.
