This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is designed
to study the electronic energy levels of inorganic species using the methods of
ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy. The results of this research are of
interest to the scientific understanding of chemical bonding and also for the
design of laser systems based on the electronic transitions of doped inorganic
solid molecules. Two photon spectroscopy will be used to study important cases
of the energy levels of prototypical transition metal ions in specified solid
crystalline host lattices. The results of these studies will provide significant
new information on the excited electonic states of transition metal ions which
will be important for understanding their chemistry, photochemistry and
photophysical processes.
