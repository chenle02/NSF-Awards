Professor Squires will focus his research on the characterization of carbene and
carbyne intermediates. Flowing afterglow ion beam studies focusing on the
spectral and chemical characterization of these reactive intermediates will be
augmented by theoretical studies correlating structure-property relationships.
New methods for the preparation of unusual carbene and carbyne intermediates
will be developed, as well as a new flowing afterglow apparatus that will
provide higher resolution data. Educational activities include training
postdoctoral and graduate students in the synthesis of reactive intermediates,
and flowing afterglow techniques. With this award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research and educational
activities of Professor Robert Squires of the Department of Chemistry at Purdue
University. Professor Squires' research focuses on the synthesis and
characterization of reactive, electron-deficient organic intermediates. These
species, referred to as carbenes or carbynes depending on the extent of the
electron deficiency, are of fundamental interest because they are thought to be
involved in bioorganic chemistry, drug design, material science, and combustion
and interstellar chemistry. Professor Squires' educational activities include
the training of graduate and postdoctoral students in chemical synthesis of
reactive intermediates, and instrument design and construction.
