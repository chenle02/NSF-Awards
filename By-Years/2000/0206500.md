This grant provides partial support for an annual, two-week workshop held in
Kansas City, Missouri, which introduces precollege teachers to fundamentals of
weather observing, analysis, and forecasting, and equips them with modern
instructional material for use in their own courses and in peer-training
sessions at their home institutions. These workshops have been held for the past
decade by the American Meteorological Society in collaboration with the National
Weather Service. Typically, about 25 teachers participate, drawn from all parts
of the United States. The objective is to improve the effectiveness of teachers
in generating interest and understanding of science, technology, and mathematics
among precollege students. The program is designed to promote working relations
between teachers and scientists and to encourage the use in K-12 classrooms of
recent research findings and the Web-delivered world meteorological data stream.
This award supports the program for the five-year period beginning in 2002.
