Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0204297&lt;br/&gt;PI: M.
Genton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Robust Statistics For Correlated
Data&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on two main new ideas. First,
the concept of breakdown point is generalized to correlated observations by
defining the critical region of the badness measure implicitly rather than
explicitly, thus covering situations with both uncorrelated and correlated
observations. Secondly, a new method to robustify likelihoods is introduced that
can be applied in any situation where a parametric likelihood is available. This
new approach is intimately connected to measurement error models and reduces to
well-known contaminated normal likelihoods in location-scale independent,
identically distributed settings. This new approach will be used to robustify
many of the commonly used methods in spatial data
settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The applications of this research include real
data sources from environmental sciences, namely ozone concentrations and fine
particulate matter in the U.S. This work will have impact on both, theoretical
statisticians and practitioners of spatio-temporal statistics, and hence will
foster collaboration between academia and industry. It aims to provide more
reliable analyses of spatio-temporal data sets, and thus contribute to a better
understanding of physical processes governing atmospherically-transported
pollutants. In particular, it will provide more reliable evaluations of the
effectiveness of the legislated emission reductions mandated in the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990. Moreover, this project will support the teaching and
promotion of robust statistics and spatio-temporal statistics at North Carolina
State University.&lt;br/&gt;
