Bumblebees are perhaps the most important of all pollinators of plants in the
Arctic. Their ability to perform at low air temperature is based on their
remarkable ability to produce heat by shivering and to keep warm in order to
remain active. But shivering only affects the thoracic muscles that drive the
wings. The abdomen, which contains no heat-producing tissues, remains cold
unless heat is shunted to that area from the exercising flight muscles. In order
to reproduce and live in the Arctic, the bees must squeeze their entire life
cycle into a single, short summer. For them, time is temperature; to accelerate
egg production and development rates they must also keep the eggs warm. The
investigators plan to examine the hypothesis that Arctic bumblebee queens
"incubate" their eggs not only after they are laid, but also while they are
still developing in the abdomen. The energy cost of this heat production is
likely very high. But it must be met because of the time constraint. This
investigation will help determine the importance of temperature regulation in
the evolution of the unique life history of the bumblebee and will further
elucidate one of the many patterns of adaptation employed by animals in the
harsh, yet fragile Arctic environment.
