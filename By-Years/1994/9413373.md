A state-of-the-art multi-processor computer (CONVEX SPP-1000/16) would be
acquired with the Academic Research Infrastructure Program funds. The present
4-processor machine would be replaced with the CONVEX 16 processor machine. The
new machine would be utilized for problems ranging from basic and fundamental
problems to finite element modeling in materials processing and the design of
new materials using computer simulations. The research topics include the
modeling of extended lattice defects; modeling of the mechanics of interfaces,
plastic constitutive properties and fracture; modeling of complex materials such
as multimolecular assemblies, pure and doped fullerenes and metal-ammonia
systems; vibrational relaxation on surfaces and simulation of
semiconductor/water interfaces. The faculty associated with these research
projects have excellent links with industry. The research group has a Research
Partnership with the CONVEX Corporation. A state-of-the-art 16 parallel
processer computer will be employed in a wide range of materials problems
ranging from fundamental problems such as charge transport in complex materials
such as fullerenes and metal-ammonia solutions to paractical problems involving
the mechanics of interfaces, plastic constitutive properties and fracture and
the chemical stability of liquid-semiconductor interfaces.
