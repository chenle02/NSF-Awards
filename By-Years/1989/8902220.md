The goal of this research is to develop a statistical-mechanical theory of phase
transitions in ferroelectric random copolymers, and to apply this theory to the
copolymer of vinylidene fluoride with trifluoroethylene. This material is of
particular interest because it exhibits a reversible transition between
ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. The methods to be employed involve the
combination of the transfer-integral approach that has been successfully used to
study ferroelectric homopolymers and the Schmidt functional-equation method.
This latter technique was originally developed to treat the electronic density
of states in metallic alloys, but now shows promise as a powerful tool in the
study of polymers. The significance of the proposed research lies in the fact
that comparatively little detailed work has previously been performed on the
theory of crystalline polymers exhibiting both conformational and
configurational disorder. A successful outcome of this research project would
open the door to the theoretical study of a wide range of copolymeric materials.
