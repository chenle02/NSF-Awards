This doctoral dissertation project involves an examination of regime changes in
Latin America since the end of World War II. The question addressed is why the
nations of the region tend to change regimes in unison over a short period of
time. Previous literature has tended to examine these changes within isolated
periods, ignoring the rest of Latin American history. This project will test a
political theory (rather than an economic.deterministic one, which is the major
alternative in the literature) that can explain the entire time span. The
support will provide travel funds for the student to travel to, and in, Brazil
to conduct elite interviews and undertake library research.
