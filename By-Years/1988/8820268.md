This grant in the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research of Dr. Richard
Caldwell at the University of Texas at Dallas. Specifically, the structure,
lifetime and energetics of photochemically-generated reaction intermediates will
be explored both experimentally and by computational methods. A better
understanding of the behavior and properties of transient reaction intermediates
will provide a fundamental basis for their role in the outcomes of photochemical
processes. Alkene triplets and triplet biradicals will be photochemically
generated and studied by conventional organic mechanistic methods to determine
the reaction products and infer the identity of the intermediates; by laser
flash photolysis to determine transient lifetimes and intersystem crossing
rates; by time-resolved photoacoustical calorimetry to determine energies of
transients; and theoretically by CAS-MCSCF computations of spin-orbit coupling
in small model species. The combination of these methodologies will allow a
fundamental understanding of intersystem crossing as well as the energy surfaces
of these intermediates. Arylalkene triplets, Norrish II and other
1,4-biradicals, triplet state di-pi-methane biradicals and some unusual trans-
cyclohexenes and -cyclopentenes resulting from the alkene triplets, will be
studied.
