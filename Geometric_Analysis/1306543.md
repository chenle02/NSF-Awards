The main objective of this project is to support participants to attend the
special session "Advances in Symplectic Geometry and Topology" in the first
edition of the Mathematical Congress of the Americas, which will be held in
Guanajuato Mexico, August 5-9, 2013. The goal of the Congress is to highlight
the excellence of mathematical achievements in the Americas within the context
of the international arena, and foster collaborations amongst researchers,
students, institutions and mathematical societies in the Americas. Our
participants consist of established scholars, mid-career mathematicians as well
as PhD students. The aim of the session is to offer an opportunity for
interaction amongst researches in different stages of their careers, and to
discuss the current developments in the fields of Symplectic Geometry and
Topology. More information about the session is posted in
http://www.math.umb.edu/~eduardo/MCA2013/

Symplectic Geometry and Topology have become ubiquitous branches of Modern
Mathematics, and play a central role in several of the latest cutting-edge
problems of interest in Mathematics and Physics. Since its early origins in
classical Mechanics, Symplectic Geometry has undergone several revolutionary
transformations which have helped to systematically understand complex natural
phenomena, from dynamical systems to strings. This meeting will expose current
research in Symplectic Geometry and Topology to a broad audience in an
international arena. We expect to cultivate collaborations between multinational
institutions and researchers. We want to influence graduate students, postdocs
and junior scholars and give them access to the expertise of several established
researchers in the field.
