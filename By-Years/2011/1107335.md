Akylas&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1107335&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A theoretical investigation
is made of the propagation and interactions of nonlinear internal wave beams in
density-stratified fluids. These are fundamental time-harmonic disturbances that
derive from the non-isotropic nature of internal gravity-wave motion. Attention
is focused on the following specific problems: (i) the instability of wave beams
to short-scale subharmonic disturbances, a prominent mechanism of breakdown and
turbulence generation according to recent experimental and numerical studies;
(ii) three-dimensional reflections of nonlinear beams from a sloping boundary,
including the case of near-critical reflection, that occurs when the angle of
incidence to the horizontal nearly matches the boundary slope; (iii) three-
dimensional collisions of nonlinear beams and the associated scattering of
energy. These physical phenomena are tackled by formulating mathematical models
that are analyzed by asymptotic and numerical methods. The theoretical
predictions are compared against related laboratory experiments and field
observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Internal wave beams play an important part
in natural fluid bodies, like the oceans, lakes, and the atmosphere, where
density stratification is mainly caused by temperature variations; there are
numerous observations of internal wave beams in the atmosphere due to
thunderstorms, as well as in oceans due to the interaction of tidal currents
with the continental shelf and sea-floor topography. This project is motivated
by the need to understand and model quantitatively the mechanisms responsible
for the transfer of energy from tide-generated internal wave beams to deep-ocean
mixing, which in turn affects ocean circulation, climate change, pollutant
dispersal, and nutrient cycles. Moreover, the results of this study would be of
basic value in geophysical fluid dynamics and applied mathematics.
