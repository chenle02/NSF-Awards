This planning grant award is the first step toward the establishment of a
National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
I/UCRC at the College of Engineering at Arizona State University (ASU). The
focus of the proposed consortium is to develop a Telecommunication Circuits and
System Center through leadership that offers the vision, focus and direction for
the advancement of the next generation of telecommunication
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "Connection One: Telecommunications Circuits
and Systems Center" has established a foundation for ASU researchers and
industry partners that are committed to the advancement of integrated circuits
and systems for wireline and wireless communications. The focus of the Center
will be to simplify communication by identifying new circuits and system
technologies that will enable a "system on a chip" single communication
device.&lt;br/&gt;
