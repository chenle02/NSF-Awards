The Nebraska REU is an eight-week summer program for 10 undergraduate students,
most of whom will be from other institutions. The Department of Mathematics and
Statistics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln is a Ph.D. granting research
department that is regionally and nationally recognized for excellence in
teaching and promoting undergraduate research. The Nebraska REU draws on these
qualities to cultivate an environment that emphasizes interaction among its
students and among its students and the Department as the students develop their
research skills. In addition to research, there is an emphasis on developing
written and oral communication skills in mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Nebraska REU offers the opportunity for mathematically talented students to
carry out research in areas of applied mathematics, each under the mentoring
guidance of one or two applied mathematicians. Students will work in groups of
two to four with their faculty mentors and a first or second year graduate
student on either the same or closely related problems. With the help of their
mentors, they will write up their results in a form suitable for journal
publication; and, in most cases, will submit their results to a journal. All
groups will present their results in a conference setting during the last week
of the REU. Social activities are planned throughout the eight weeks. In
addition to the $2,600 stipend, on-campus room, board, and the student
recreation center are provided at no cost to the participant. The Department
will also provide students up to $400 toward the cost associated to presenting
their REU results at a national conference.&lt;br/&gt;
