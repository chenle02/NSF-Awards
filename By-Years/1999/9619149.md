With support from the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor James P. Ferris
studies the synthesis of ribonucleic acids on minerals. This work, carried out
in the Department of Chemistry at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, focuses on
clay mineral-mediated formation of phosphodiester linkages between
ribonucleotides. Suites of RNA oligomers containing random sequences of thirty
to fifty bases with a high proportion of 3',5'-phosphodiester linkages are
produced via RNA primer elongation on montmorillonite clay. These oligomers are
tested for catalytic activity in order to provide a laboratory demonstration of
the transition from prebiotic chemistry to catalytic activity as postulated by
the RNA world scenario for the origins of life. Clay-catalyzed synthesis of
homochiral RNAs from racemic nucleotides is also explored, helping to shed light
on the origins of chirality. Plausible activating groups for the synthesis of
RNA on mineral surfaces are chosen to represent those likely to have been
prevalent under primitive earth conditions, and inhibitor studies are carried
out in order to help direct the search for other minerals with comparable or
superior catalytic capabilities. Many unanswered questions remain about the
origins of life, beginning at the very basic chemical level of how the first
catalysts (materials which facilitate the reactions of other molecules) evolved.
Professor Ferris examines the role of clay minerals in catalyzing the formation
of molecules representing the possible precursors to life, focusing on the
synthesis of ribonucleic acids (RNA) which in turn may function as catalysts for
the synthesis of still more complex molecules. These studies also address the
fundamental question of how life's molecules acquired the unique structural
feature of chirality, wherein many biologically active molecules display a
three-dimensional structure distinct from that of their mirror image (just as a
right hand differs from a left hand).
