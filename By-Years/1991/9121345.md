This is a small grant for exploratory research. Experiments will be conducted in
order to determine the feasibility of an assay for eukaryotic transcription
termination based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The underlying concept
is that PCR should be able to detect vanishingly small quantities of a specific
nucleic acid in the presence of large excess of non-specific competitor. The
assay to be developed will be designed to detect the nascent RNAs that are the
products of transcription using PCR. The study involves a number of untested
assumptions and this award will test those assumptions. If successful, the
research will lead to a relatively simple and quick way to study eukaryotic
transcription termination.
