This grant supports research and development on "Hydra", a digital circuit
design system based on stream recursion equations. Hydra supplies a solid
mathematical foundation for circuit specification, derivation, simulation,
analysis and layout. In the SBIR Phase I research, an experimental prototype
compiler that translates a specification into an efficient simulation program
was built. This research addresses several problems. First, circuit analysis
algorithms are being used to produce parallel simulators both for MIMD and SIMD
architectures. Second, the functional language notation of the compiler is being
improved to incorporate visualization techniques, interactive graphics and
functional geometry. Finally, methods for incorporating Hydra into existing sets
of circuit design tools are being investigated. Phase I objectives were met
quite successfully. The problem, derivation of digital designs from functional
programs is important because of its promise to demonstrate how functional
programming ideas fare in real world IC design. The P.I. and his associates'
past work has been of high quality; they are well qualified to carry out the
proposed research.
