Narrative: Particles, processing and separation science and applications are an
integral part of biotechnology, medicine, and pharmaceuticals. The objective of
the symposium is to consider several important topics such as magnetics in
bioseparation and treatment of tumors, separation and control of viruses,
membrane filtration, flocculation of microorganisms, biological contamination
and its control, etc., at an informaive, creative and multidisciplinary forum.
The technical program will contain plenary lectures, invited and contributed
papers from research centers and laboratories of a number of leading academic,
commercial, and governmental organizations in biotechnology, medicine, and
pharmaceuticals. A workshop to identify the related emerging issues, further
research topics and new applications will also be held. Workshop proceedings
will be widely distributed. This award is being co-funded by the Biochemical and
Biomass Engineering Program.
