Theoretical research will be conducted on two major areas of non- equilibrium
physics: growth far from equilibrium and the modeling of chemical kinetics. Work
on growth far from equilibrium will include studies of diffusion limited
aggregation, reaction limited aggregation, and modeling of molecular beam
epitaxial growth. Studies of chemical reactions and catalysis will include
reaction limited heterocatalysis and fluctuation-dominated kinetics. %%%
Theoretical studies will be undertaken in the nonlinear science of the growth of
systems far from equilibrium, such as thin film growth, and of chemical kinetics
related to reactions and catalysis.
