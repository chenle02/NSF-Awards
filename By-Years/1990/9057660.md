In this PYI research program will concentrate on experimentally measuring the
properties of multiphase systems, interpreting these measurements for comparison
to current theoretical models and refining the models appropriately. The
experimental measurements will utilize magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic
resonance imaging is a spectroscopic technique for noninvasively and
nondestructively acquiring the spatial distribution of species concentrations,
velocities, diffusivities or temperatures within a sample. Specific areas of
study are: 1. Transport processes in porous media: Experiments are planned to
measure local volume averaged saturations and velocities in single-phase flow
and multiphase flow in porous media. The overall objective is to make a direct
comparison between measured and predicted fields in the absence of adjustable
parameters. 2. Structure and dynamics of particle sedimentation: A series of
model experiments is planned in which the sedimentation of various shaped and
sized particles will be examined. The goal is to obtain quantitative
microstructural data for suspensions having different volume fractions of
particles, from dilute through concentrated, and ascertaining the effect if the
suspending fluid properties.
