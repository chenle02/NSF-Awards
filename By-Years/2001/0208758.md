The demand for real-time data services has been increasing recently, as many
real-time applications are becoming sophisticated in their data needs. A real-
time database, a core component of many information services for real-time
applications, can be a main service bottleneck. Current databases are not time-
cognizant, are poor in supporting temporal consistency of real-time data and
real-time execution of transactions, and therefore they do not perform well in
these applications. To address this problem, a scheme for QoS management for
real-time data services is proposed that provides guarantees on transaction
timeliness and data freshness, which are considered two key performance metrics
for real-time data services. The fundamental premise motivating this research is
the need for real-time data service systems that are autonomous, data-intensive,
and operable in unpredictable environments. The novel idea of using feedback
control based QoS management to provide robust performance guarantees against
unpredictable workload, incomplete knowledge, and load disturbances will be
pursued. The scheme will be evaluated to validate the contributions using
simulation. Success of this research would benefit an ever increasing set of
applications, including several national critical infrastructures, that require
real-time data services. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
