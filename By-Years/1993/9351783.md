This project involves the development of a physical geography laboratory by
using computer equipment and environmental sensors. This is also being
accomplished in conjunction with course modifications to allow undergraduates
more involvement in empirical work. Curricular modification focuses on
introductory level courses in Physical Geography and Weather and Climate, making
them laboratory courses in which the exercises are computer dependent.
Meteorological sensors at a weather station also feed data directly to the lab
and the data sets are used to examine temporal variations in weather. It is
expected that the equipment acquired under this project will be used in other
advanced physical geography courses and that it will be available for students
in independent research projects.
