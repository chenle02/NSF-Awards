ROTA/DERKSEN, 9970165

The proposer plans to investigate problems in the areas of constructive
invariant theory, generalized quivers associated to reductive groups and
automorphisms of affine spaces. In the first case the proposer will refine his
algorithm for computing reductive group invariants; in the second, with Weyman,
apply quiver representations to reductive groups; in the last case look at
automorphisms of affine space over the complex numbers.

The theory of reductive groups aids in studying various symmetry properties of
space from an algebraic point of view. Applications are to be found in chemistry
and physics.
