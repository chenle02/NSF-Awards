This project is funded as a Phase I award under the 1988 Small Business
Innovation Research Program Solicitation. The purpose of this research is to
evaluate the costs and benefits of using a Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
approach to conduct fiscal impact studies. The GIS approach will be carefully
compared to six widely recognized non- geographic approaches, and, in addition,
a survey will be done to determine the availability of the key data ingredients
of the GIS approach. Because the use of such an approach allows consideration of
the complexities of local finance, the unique physical, historical and financial
policy variations among governmental units, it has the potential for yielding
more reliable results to be used as the basis for governmental decisionmaking
and sound financial planning.
