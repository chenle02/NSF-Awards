This dissertation research project will support a student of cultural
anthropology from Southern Methodist University in a field study of the informal
economy in Martinique, French West Indies. The project will document the
importance of informal sector income-producing activities by interviewing a
sample of households, in a poorer as well as a middle class neighborhood, about
the full range of their economic activities. In addition to conducting
participant observation in the neighborhoods, social networks and life histories
will be studied to put the information about informal sector activities into
context of the lives of the people. This research is important because the
informal economy is a significant part of all societies, yet by definition is
difficult to measure. Increased understanding of the informal economic
activities of families across the socio-economic spectrum can help planners
adjust policies to the actual situation in society, as opposed to the easily
measured situation.
