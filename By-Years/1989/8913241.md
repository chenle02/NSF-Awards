A radioactive tracer laboratory in the Department of Materials Science and
Engineering at Cornell University will be equipped and used for tracer diffusion
studies in ceramic materials. The laboratory equipment includes furnaces for
diffusion experiments under controlled atmospheres, equipment for specimen
preparation, and a counting apparatus. The radioactive tracer diffusion research
will emphasize cation diffusion in binary, ternary and quaternary oxides which
contain transition metal cations which have potential for device applications.//
