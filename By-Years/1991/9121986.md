During the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957-8 Professor Keeling of
Scripps Institution of Oceanography initiated a high precision atmospheric CO2
measurements program at Mauna Loa, Hawaii to study the biogeochemical carbon
cycle. This measurement program has been continued and expanded since that time.
In the early 1960's the data set available from this program demonstrated
conclusively that the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere was
increasing at a rate of approximately a third of one percent per year. This
increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide is caused primarily by the combustion of
fossil fuels. Since CO2 is a "greenhouse gas" it is expected that within a few
decades its increased atmospheric concentration will lead to climatic changes.
Among the central issues of the CO2 question is the reliability of predictions
of future concentrations. Such predictions require an understanding of the
biogeochemical carbon cycle. Presently, however, there are major uncertainties
about the CO2 gas exchange processes involving the oceans and terrestrial
biosphere. The goal of this research project is to gather the type of data which
can be used to obtain a more reliable estimate of the oceanic and biospheric
carbon dioxide sink and source strengths. In this research project emphasis will
be on the measurement of the carbon isotopic composition of CO2 in the
atmosphere and oceans as a function of space and time. Additionally, high
precision measurements of dissolved carbon dioxide will be made at key locations
in surface and subsurface ocean water. These, and supporting chemical
measurements, will be used to atmosphere by the combustion of fossil fuels.
