ABSTRACT Comprehensive studies of electron attachment to molecules of specific
interest to plasma processing will be performed. The presence and importance of
the large negative ion densities in processing is only recently recognized and
its possible roles are being actively investigated. Negative ions are very
reactive and may contribute to etching/deposition processes; in some cases they
have been shown to be the precursors for particulate formation in processing
discharges. The following studies will be undertaken: (i) electron attachment
studies on electronically-excited states of molecules relevant to plasma
processing e.g., CH4, CF4, SiH-, Cl2. (ii) measurement of electron attachment to
radicals resulting from the above molecules (iii) measurement of the electron
attachment to the above molecules in their ground electronic states including
vibrationally-excited states when consistent data are not available (iv) study
of the influence of rare gases on negative ion formation when rare gases are
mixed with the above gases under discharge conditions.
