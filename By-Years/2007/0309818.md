Computer Science (31) In recent years, computer and information security issues
have become increasingly significant for business, industry, and government,
leading to an immediate need for increased computer security education through
undergraduate level computer science curricula. This project meets this need
through four objectives: first, by developing a sophisticated heterogeneous
computer and information security laboratory; second, by adapting and developing
computer and information security curriculum (stand-alone courses in
computing/network security and applied cryptography, as well as individual and
separate course modules) to better train students in computer security; third,
by using this laboratory and curriculum as the foundation for a formal
application by UW-Eau Claire to become a Center for Academic Excellence in
Information Assurance Education, as certified by the National
Security&lt;br/&gt;Agency; and fourth, by accomplishing the three objectives
above by making optimal use of existing departmental, university, and private
resources. These objectives are accomplished at UW-Eau Claire through the
adaptation and further development of a laboratory model and curriculum
previously implemented at Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP). &lt;br/&gt;
