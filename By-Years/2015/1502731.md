Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and
training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including
applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring
scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Benjamin J. Fehrman
is "Stochastic Homogenization for Linear Parabolic Equations and Nonlinear
Viscous Hamilton-Jacobi Systems." The host institution for the fellowship is the
Max Planck Institute in Leipzig, Germany, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr.
Felix Otto.
