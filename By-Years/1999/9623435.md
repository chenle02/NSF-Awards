9623435 Byrnes This research program will develop a systematic methodology for
the design of feedback mechanisms for the robust control of nonlinear dynamical
systems, operating in a nonequilibrium environment. Nonlinear feedback laws
offer the potential to take advantage of genuinely nonlinear effects, for
example to track or to attenuate the effects of, limit cycles. The research will
involve developing criteria for the existence of limit cycles in nonlinear
feedback systems, based on a synthesis of methods drawn from algebraic and
differential topology and from dynamical systems theory, as well as the
development of techniques for feedback stabilization about limit cycles and more
general attractors. These techniques will be based on an extension of previous
work on zero dynamics for nonlinear systems to the nonequilibrium case. This
work will also include an extension of passive system theory to systems which
are not necessarily affine in the control variables. %%% Dynamical systems can
exhibit complexity for a variety of reasons; for example, complexity arises in
using microchip technologies to design devices for sensing, or controlling, the
position and speed in an airplane, an automobile, or a high-speed train.
Complexity can also arise in mathematical models of physical and industrial
systems because of the complex nature of the physical forces acting on a system.
An example of this phenomenon is windshear, caused by a microburst of air, which
can be experienced during take-off and landing of commercial aircraft. The
interaction of windshear forces with the forces required to achieve lift an
aircraft is quite complex, often producing nonintuitive reactions to pilot
induced forces. The purpose of this research is to determine ways to take
advantage of the potentially dramatic, though nonintuitive, effects caused by
the complex interactions of physical forces with physical systems. ***
