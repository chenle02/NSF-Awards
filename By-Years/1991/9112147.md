A line start disc centrifuge particle size analyzer and specular reflectance
cell to support research in ceramic engineering will be purchased. The specular
reflectance cell enhances the capabilities of the particle sizer by providing
critical optical data that corrects for light scattering effects. This equipment
will be used for several research projects that require rapid particle size
measurement of submicron powders, including in particular; research examining
the effects of the light scattering corrections on accuracy of the particle size
analyzer, development of ceramic particle size analysis procedures suitable for
this method of analysis, creation of a data-base for commercial and synthetic
ceramic powders and developing a fundamental understanding of how these
synthesis methods can be used to control particle size.
