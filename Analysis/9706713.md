Abstract Muhly Muhly will investigate a variety of problems in operator algebra
that may be divided into three groups covered by the headings: General Operator
Algebras, Groupoids, and Toeplitz and Related Operators. Under the first
heading, he will pursue 5 strategic problems dedicated to understanding the
structure of non-self-adjoint algebras. The focus will be on the categories of
Hilbert modules associated with operator algebras. Inspiration for this derives
from finite dimensional pure ring theory, but the key is to understand the
interplay between the algebra and the metrics involved. In Muhly's work,
groupoids provide concrete coordinates for representing operator algebras. The
projects under this rubric are natural continuations of his earlier efforts.
Most important among them, perhaps, is the problem of developing a good,
topological cohomology theory for groupoids. The problems on Toeplitz operators
that he proposes to investigate also derive naturally from his earlier work and
progress on them should help shed light on important new connections between
classical function theory/harmonic analysis and operator theory. Although in
many respects, the detailed aspects of the problems Muhly will investigate are
inspired by questions from core mathematics, their significance to applied
mathematics and the "real world" is substantial. Much of Muhly's work
contributes to the mathematical underpinning of control theory, H-infinity
control theory, in particular, which, in turn, is the theoretical framework on
which engineers base the design of aircraft, automobiles, robots, and other
devices that need to respond to external stimuli and to be controlled to perform
within specified guidelines. His work on groupoids and some of his work on
Toeplitz operators is closely connected to issues of stochastic control, i.e.,
control problems where there are random uncertainties involved and one tries to
steer a course that is best on the average. His work on operator algebras,
generally, c ontributes to the field of multivariable control theory and to non-
stationary control problems, i.e., problems where the control response is a
function of the time of the input. Such problems are of increasing importance in
the design of all types of devices, from acoustical filters, to digital
processors, and neural networks.
