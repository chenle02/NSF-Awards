Chemistry (12) This collaborative CCLI/A&amp;I project is integrating "twin"
Rigaku/MSC MiniFlex+ powder X-ray diffractometers into the chemistry curricula
at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) and the University of
Illinois at Springfield (UIS). X-ray diffraction (XRD) concepts are being
incorporated into laboratory experiments that engage students in active
learning. Modified courses include forensic science, general chemistry, organic
chemistry, instrumental analysis, and inorganic chemistry with the result that
approximately 1100 students each year are introduced to XRD techniques through
the project. PIs from both institutions are meeting periodically to exchange
ideas and resources and to bring students together to share experiences.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student learning objectives include excitement and
enthusiasm for science thinking, awareness of applications of scientific
thinking, 3-D manipulation of concepts, and improved quantitative reasoning,
problem solving, analysis, and synthesis. To address these objectives,
implemented experiments increase in sophistication as students progress through
the curriculum, and consist of all typical aspects of powder X ray diffraction
including peak matching, spacing calculation, symmetry and unit cells, complex
pattern matching, peak shape, theory, determining unit cell parameters, and
novel student research projects. Educational materials resulting from these
efforts are being broadly disseminated through the web-based Nanoscale Video Lab
Manual and Nanoworld Cineplex of Movies, http://mrsec.wisc.edu/nano.
