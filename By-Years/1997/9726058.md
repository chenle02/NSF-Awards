9726058 Rudnick This grant provides partial support of the costs of acquiring a
new high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (HR-ICP-MS)
equipped with a laser ablation microprobe. In addition to having higher
sensitivity and lower detection limits for many elements of interest to igneous
petrologists, magnetic sector instruments allow resolution of isobaric
interferences with some trace elements that are important to study of the
evolution of Earth's crust and mantle that are not resolvable with quadrupole
ICP-MS. Many of the studies that will be undertaken require the sensitivity of a
HR-ICP-MS and the capability of laser ablation for direct sampling of solid
geological materials (i.e. trace element analyses of olivine phenocrysts in
Archean komatiites and diamond inclusions and the determination of chalcophile
and siderophile element concentrations in MORB). Such research is of fundamental
importance to our understanding of the evolution of Earth's core, mantle and
crust. With the addition to the faculty of Dr. Daniel Schrag, a new dimension of
low temperature geochemistry as applied to paleoceanographic and
paleoclimatological research will be added to the traditional hard rock
geochemical studies of this group at Harvard. ***
