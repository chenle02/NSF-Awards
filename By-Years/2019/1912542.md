Observed states of macroscopic systems seldom exhibit obvious quantum
characteristics. This is usually attributed to the effects of decoherence; that
is, the influence of uncontrolled environmental variables which "average out"
the quantum strangeness. This project is the continuation of a long-term effort
to realize macroscopic quantum states using solitons (non-linear waves)
generated in Bose-Einstein condensates. When such a wave is scattered from a
potential barrier, it breaks into two; a high-frequency part that transcends the
barrier, and a low-frequency part that is reflected. The question to be studied
is whether, and under what conditions, the two components retain quantum
coherence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Macroscopic quantum coherence plays a special
role in modern physics. While being one of the most fundamental but untested
assumptions, it promises a multifold increase in sensitivity of quantum sensors.
This project is founded on a conjecture that large solitonic Schroedinger cats
can emerge within a seemingly mean-field friendly range of parameters, for a
large but limited number of atoms in a soliton. The conjecture will be
theoretically explored by graduate students using a variety of computational
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
