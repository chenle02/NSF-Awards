This grant explores quantitative approaches to the analysis of small regions
less than one nanometer in the scanning transmission electron microscope. In
this renewal of the research the investigators continue their quantitative
interpretation of microdiffraction data combined with recent advances in
scanning transmission electron microscope. Nanocrystals, layered materials, and
particle/network structures are subject to analysis by scanning transmission
electron microscope techniques. Improved instrumentation and techniques for
characterizing small particles and thin films should result as well as advancing
understanding of the nature of catalysts.
