Further study of neutron star binaries will be made using the recently developed
three spatial dimensional general relativistic computer model. In particular the
fate of the neutron stars, whether they form black holes or not (an equation of
state issue), how the neutron stars turn their increased binding energy into
thermal energy, the role of stellar spin, neutrino emission, the accompanying
magnetic field, will be investigated. The implications for the gravity wave
signal of the above processes which occur inside the neutron stars will be
estimated.
