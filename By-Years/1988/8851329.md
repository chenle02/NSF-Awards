This project permits undergraduate mechanical engineering students to carry on
experiments on a small-scale cogeneration system that is instrumented and
interfaced to a data acquisition system. Student experiments and projects
involve both thermodynamic and economic evaluation of cogeneration concepts.
They also learn about techniques of computer assisted data acquisition in a
laboratory environment. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the
grantee.
