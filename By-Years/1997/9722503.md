Hyperfine spectra will be observed in sequences of vibrational and rotational
states in small molecules, such as alkali hydrides, or hydroxides, using a high-
resolution molecular beam electric resonance spectrometer. These spectra will
provide improved values for hyperfine interaction constants, to be compared with
those obtained from theoretical calculations of electron wave functions.
Systematic variations of the interactions with isotopic substitution, and
between the different alkali halide molecules will be examined. Special emphasis
will be given to the rubidium salts for which experimental work has already
begun, and for which previous hyperfine studies are minimal. Extension of these
studies to molecules such as indium and gallium monohalides will be explored.
