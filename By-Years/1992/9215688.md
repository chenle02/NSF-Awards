The principle objective of this work is to characterize analytically the stress
and deformation fields accompanying crack growth in ductile single crystals and
deformation fields at interfaces joining a ductile material to a brittle one.
The analytical results will be checked with full-field numerical finite element
solutions, and also with experiments that correspond to the analyses. The aim is
to devise local descriptions, incorporating single crystal plasticity, as a
function of general remote loadings.
