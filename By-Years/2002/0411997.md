This is an exploratory research effort to establish a Space Weather Policy
specific curriculum on the graduate level. The policy structure of the National
Space Weather Program is researched and distilled, the syllabus is created, and
the class taught. The class is to be taught in the fall semester of 2004 at
George Mason University. The purpose of the project is to establish an
educational means of associating researchers in a broadly inter-disciplinary
national initiative with their policy guidance.
