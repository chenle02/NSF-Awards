Molecular oxygen in the atmosphere is linked to the carbon cycle by
photosynthesis and respiration, and can be used as a tracer for studying elusive
problems of carbon geochemistry. Oxygen is relatively insoluble in seawater. Its
atmospheric inventory, in contrast to the of carbon dioxide, is not buffered by
equilibrium with the oceans. Global carbon and oxygen fluxes are therefore
nearly quantitatively reflected in the changing atmospheric oxygen
concentration, and one can use the atmospheric oxygen content as an integrator
of seasonal and interannual fluxes of carbon and oxygen. The goal of this
research project is to, develop an isotope dilution - isotope ratio mass
spectrometry method and to evaluate its capability for measuring small changes
in the atmospheric oxygen. Together with the ongoing work of others this work
will also set the stage for more extensive future studies of the atmospheric
oxygen cycle and its implications for the oceanic carbon cycle and the total
rate of anthropogenic carbon dioxide production. Oxygen is also linked to the
carbon cycle by the combustion of fossil fuels and the global conversion of
biomass into carbon dioxide. There must be a gradual global decrease in the
atmospheric oxygen content which quantitatively reflects the total rate oxygen
consumption by these two processes. The consumption rate by fossil fuel burning
is well known. One can thus measure the long term anthropogenic oxygen decrease,
and calculate the biomass conversion rate by difference.
