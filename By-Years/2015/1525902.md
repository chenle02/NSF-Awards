Improvements in both computational power and the amount of memory in modern
computer architectures, have enabled new approaches to canonical machine
learning tasks. Specifically, these architectural advances have enabled
machines, which are capable of learning deep compositional representations of
massive data repositories. The rise of deep learning has ushered tremendous
advances in several fields, and, given the complexity of software repositories,
our hypothesis is that deep learning has the potential to usher new analytical
frameworks and methodologies for Software Engineering research as well
practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program addresses three main goals
by applying deep learning where conventional machine learning has been used
before. First is the design of new models based on deep architectures for
Software Engineering tasks. The project will develop deep software language
models for sequence analysis tasks and deep information retrieval models for
document analysis tasks. Second, the project will apply the internal
representations to practical problems in Software Engineering by instantiating
deep learning to support tasks such as code suggestion, improving software
lexicons, model-based testing, code search and clone detection. Third, the
project will conduct empirical evaluations designed to demonstrate ways of
modeling software artifacts that will inform entirely novel suites of learned
features that can be used from task to task. The move from traditional machine
learning to deep learning will improve results in many software analysis tasks
and in empirical Software Engineering research.
