Professor Lawrence F. Duffy and other members of the Chemistry Department at the
University of Alaska at Fairbanks are being supported to continue a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry and Biochemistry. For the
period 1991-93, eight undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer
actively engaged in a variety of research projects. Projects range from physical
chemistry to biological chemistry, and include projects in Raman spectroscopy,
atmospheric, environmental and analytical chemistry, chemical ecology, petroleum
and geochemistry, bio-organic chemistry and marine chemistry, as well as
chemical anthropology and molecular evolution. Many projects are related to
local Alaskan interests. The program includes a seminar series and a poster
symposium at the end of the summer.
