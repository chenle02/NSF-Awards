Equipment for gravity and magnetic surveying will be incorporated into
laboratory experiences in geophysics courses. By taking advantage of naturally
occurring changes in density and magnetic susceptibility in rocks, the
instruments provide information on the subsurface geologic structure. These
instruments will add to the information that can be obtained from a resistivity
meter and seismograph already on hand in the analysis of geological problems.
The equipment will also be used for demonstration and laboratory exercises in
upper and lower division courses, and will be used by students in independent
study an senior theses. These projects will focus on studies of Precambrian
rocks in Michigan's western upper peninsula; because of the paucity of rock
exposure in this area, geophysical techniques will be employed by all students
regardless of the primary emphasis of their study. The university will provide
50% matching funds.
