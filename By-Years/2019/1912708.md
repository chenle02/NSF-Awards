Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.
Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions
and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe and can
be used to test fundamental physics. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC)
observatory, located on the slopes of the Sierra Negra in Mexico, is a ground-
based facility designed with unique capabilities to observe very high energy
gamma-rays. This award supports scientists at the University of Maryland College
Park in their leadership roles in the operation of the observatory and in the
scientific analysis of the HAWC data. The group will continue activities to
optimize the sensitivity of the observatory and pursue scientific research on
transient gamma-ray sources and newly discovered very high energy sources. This
award will allow the group to continue and expand their outreach efforts, which
include outreach to the Hispanic-American community with bi-lingual products
related to HAWC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With its large instantaneous field of
view and continuous operations HAWC surveys two-thirds of the sky every day. The
University of Maryland group will continue their study of transient sources with
HAWC as part of a multi-messenger and multi-wavelength campaign. They will also
continue their work producing maps and conducting surveys to reveal new high
energy gamma-ray sources. In addition, they will continue to lead the effort to
exploit the novel water Cherenkov detection technique to improve the sensitivity
of HAWC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
