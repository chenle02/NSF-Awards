&lt;br/&gt;In this exploratory project, funded jointly by the Experimental
Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division and the Atomic, Molecular
and Optical Physics Program of the Physics Division, Parks will develop an
understanding of how best to apply fluctuation correlation spectroscopy (FCS)
techniques to measure biomolecule dynamics in the gas phase. The research will
concentrate on characterizing Coulomb interactions and the identification of
relationships between gas phase and solution phase measurements. To this end two
types of experiments will be performed. In the first type, the dynamics of a DNA
hairpin will be measured in the gas phase. The equilibrium constant and
opening/closing rates of conformational changes will be determined as a function
of temperature for different charge states. These experiments will quantify the
effects of Coulomb interactions in the absence of water shielding. In the second
type, the dynamics of a DNA hairpin will be measured as function of the
hydration level. These measurements will link the "physics" of the former
experiments with the "biology" as currently known from solution phase studies.
Both graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this
research.&lt;br/&gt;
