With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Youngstown State University will
acquire a Glove Box and Vacuum Line Systems for Materials Synthesis and
Characterization. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on
NS heterocyclic materials, organometallic crystal engineered materials,
alkanethiol monolayers, monolayer organometallic films, metallocenophanes,
organometallic nanoscale rigid-rod and star-shaped materials, and solid state
nitride/fluoride compounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research-grade glove boxes
enable researchers to handle air-sensitive materials. This equipment will enrich
the materials-related research program at Youngstown State University and also
provide hands-on experience for undergraduate and masters students in the
advanced inorganic chemistry and polymer science laboratory courses.
