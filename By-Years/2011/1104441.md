This collaborative project has the scientific objective of improving
understanding of detailed physical processes associated with sprites as well as
their potential impact on the mesosphere and the global electrostatic field.
This will be accomplished by optical observations (images and spectra) with high
spatial and temporal resolution. Summer field campaigns will be conducted on the
NSF sponsored HIAPER aircraft to follow up a successful 2009 sprite observations
campaign by the investigators. The observations will be analyzed and compared
with various sprite models. Furthermore, collaboration with participants at
Princeton University will involve laboratory streamer studies relevant to
sprites.
