Understanding the genetic basis of developmental processes is a fundamental
concern of modern biology. Research in systematic biology can provide important
new insights into development by elucidating the genetic basis of changes in
morphogenesis that occurred during the transformation of one species into
another. Because profound differences in morphology can arise over relatively
short periods of time, morphologically diverse organisms can remain
interfertile, and thus be amenable to combined genetic and developmental
analyses. One example of this phenomenon involves maize (Zea mays ssp.
parviglumis), which differ dramatically in adult morphology despite the fact
that they are fully interfertile. The proposed research will characterize the
genetic and developmental basis of the dramatic morphological differences
between maize and teosinte. This will be accomplished by the creation of near-
isogenic lines for the genes controlling the morphological differences between
these organisms. These near-isogenic lines will be essentially pure teosinte
except for single regions of the maize genome that have been introduced into
them. The near-isogenic lines will be analyzed to determine the effects of the
single regions of the maize genome on morphogenesis. Fine-mapping of regions of
the genome with dramatic effects on morphogenesis will be used to investigate
whether these regions contain single major loci or several linked loci, each
with individually small effects.
