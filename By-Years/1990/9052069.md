This interdisciplinary project will introduce a variety of laser experiments in
upper level chemistry and physics courses. Laser- based methods are at the heart
of modern studies of atomic and molecular phenomena, and experience in this area
is becoming an essential part of the education of undergraduate students in
physics and physical chemistry. This project has been preceded by a three- year
program which has included faculty development, construction of a scanning
pulsed dye laser system, and introduction of a new course on laser physics. The
project greatly improves Earlham's laboratory capabilities by providing a large
number of optical components, several important measuring instruments, and a
tunable diode laser subsystem. The equipment is being used in eleven experiments
covering topics in atomic and molecular physics, spectroscopy and laser optics.
It is also being used by junior and senior students in Independent Study
courses. The college will match the award with an equal amount of funds.//
