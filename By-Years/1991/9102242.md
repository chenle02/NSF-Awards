Dr. Andrea Cochran has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Cochran's doctoral degree was from the University of California
at Berkeley under the supervision of Professor Peter Schultz. Dr. Cochran
intends to continue research at the Whitehead Institute under the sponsorship of
Professor Peter Kim. Dr. Cochran's area of postdoctoral research will be protein
structure and folding. Longer term, she plans to study the molecular mechanism
of transmembrane signalling in proteins. Signal transduction is of central
importance in immunology and oncology. %%% The Postdoctoral Fellowships in
Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to
broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
