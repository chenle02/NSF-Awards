It has become apparent that microplates have been accreted to the western
continental margin of the United States at various times during the Mesozoic and
Tertiary. Recently, it has been proposed that the Peninsular Ranges terrane of
southern California did not accrete until sometime after 45 mybp, although the
adjacent Santa Lucia/Orocopia terrane was in place by 55 mybp. This model
requires a very different shape for the continent during the time of metamorphic
core complex and detachment faulting. This project will collect paleomagnetic
data from these terranes and stable North America to evaluate and test the model
for accretion. Results are important to a number of Tertiary tectonic features
of southern California.
