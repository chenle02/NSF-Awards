9501566 Lobkowicz Analysis continues on photon and neutral pion production by
hadrons. Data were obtained in exposures to pion and proton beams at Fermilab.
Direct photon yields will be compared with neutral pion yields in pion
interactions with protons and with neutrons. Further goals are comparison of
production by protons at 500 FeV and 800 GeV and their dependence on target
nuclear species using data obtained with Beryllium, Copper, Silicon as well as
Hydrogen targets. Two PhD these will be written on these analyses by graduate
students at the University of Rochester supported by this grant. ***
