This work will use the quantum kinetic equations in a Green's function
formalism to study the properties of nuclear matter under conditions relevant
for heavy-ion collisions at 100's MeV/nucleon. The work will not be restricted
to the quasi-particle approximation. The spreading widths of spectral functions
and the energy dependence of the mean field will be taken into account.
