The National Academy of Sciences' (NAS) National Research Council (NRC) will co-
sponsor a major public "Forum on Global Change and Our Common Future", together
with the Smithsonian Institution, the American Association for the Advancement
of Science (AAAS), and Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society. The Forum is
intended to communicate to the public a scientifically balanced view of the
changes which appear to be occurring in the global environment, what these
changes might mean for society, and what kinds of policies may be appropriate to
mitigate and/or to adapt to these changes. A group of sixteen nationally
recognized high school teachers will be selected to participate in the Forum.
The results will also be published following the Forum.
