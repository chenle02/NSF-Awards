Josef Dorfmeister will carry out research in three areas. These concern
homogeneous complex manifolds, isoparametric hypersurfaces in spheres and
nonlinear partial differential equations. Dorfmeister, in collaboration with
Nakajima and Neher has recently achieved remarkable results concerning
homogeneous Kahler manifolds and certain isoparametric triple systems. He will
continue to apply algebraic and functional analytic techniques to related
problems. In particular he will try to determine all Kahler structures on
manifolds which admit a transitive group of automorphisms. The second major
project will be to describe all Lie algebras which occur as infinitesimal
automorphisms of some homogeneous Kahler manifold. The final part of the program
concerns an investigation of the class of contractible, rational, homogeneous
domains in complex n-dimensional space.
