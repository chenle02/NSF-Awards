Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a technique at the forefront of
chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, and medicine. This project will
provide students at Rider College with a 90-MHz NMR for experiments in five
major laboratory courses and for undergraduate research projects. Students
majoring in chemistry, biochemistry, and biology will use the instrument,
beginning in the sophomore year. Experiments integrated into the chemistry
curriculum include investigations of strained polycyclic systems using carbon-13
NMR, application of NMR spectroscopy to studies of reaction kinetics, and
structure determination of organometallic compounds.
