The project will characterize the functional, taxonomic, biotic and abiotic
drivers of soil ecosystems in the Trans Antarctic Mountains (one of the most
remote and harsh terrestrial landscapes on the planet). The work will utilize
new high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing technologies to identify members of
the microbial communities and determine if the microbial community structures
are independent of local environmental heterogeneities. In addition the project
will determine if microbial diversity and function are correlated with time
since the last glacial maximum (LGM). The expected results will greatly
contribute to our knowledge regarding rates of microbial succession and help
define the some of the limits to life and life-maintaining processes on
Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will analyze genomes and RNA derived
from these genomes to describe the relationships between biodiversity and
ecosystem functioning from soils above and below LGM elevations and to correlate
these with the environmental drivers associated with their development during
the last ~18,000 years. The team will identify the taxonomic diversity and the
functional genetic composition within a broad suite of soil biota and examine
their patterns of assembly and distribution within the framework of their
geological legacies. The project will mentor participants from undergraduate
students to postdoctoral researchers and prepare them to effectively engage in
research to meet their career aspirations. The project will contribute to
ongoing public education efforts through relationships with K-12 teachers and
administrators- to include University-Public School partnerships. Less formal
activities include public lecture series and weblogs aimed at providing
information on Antarctic polar desert ecosystems to the general public. Targeted
classrooms near each PI's institution will participate in online, real-time
discussions about current topics in Antarctic ecosystems research.
