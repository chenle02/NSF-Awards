In recent years, the presence of several novel neuronal intermediate filament
species has been documented. Dr. Shea has shown that the "66kDa neuronal
intermediate filament," also known as alpha-internexin, is constitutively
expressed by NB2a/d1 cells, and displays a unique distribution within the
neuritic base and axon hillock during differentiation. Dr. Shea will modulate
this protein in cells at various stages of differentiation by two methods
already in use for the study of axonal cytoskeletal dynamics: 1) inhibiting the
translocation, assembly, and interaction of this neuronal intermediate filament
species with other cytoskeletal components, and 2) inhibiting the synthesis of
this protein by treating cells with antisense oligonucleotides. Cells will be
examined at hourly intervals by phase-contrast microscopy for alterations in
neurite outgrowth, neurite retraction, compromise of stability, and
immunocytochemistry for intracellular localization of the 66kDa neuronal
intermediate filament/alpha-internexin as well as other axonal cytoskeletal
antigens. These analyses will help determine whether or not NF-66 is required
for neurite outgrowth, continued elongation, or stabilization. Comparison of
results obtained following down-regulation of the 66kDa neuronal intermediate
filament/alpha-internexin with H-200 will provide information regarding the role
played by this novel neuronal intermediate filament species in axonal outgrowth
and maturation.
