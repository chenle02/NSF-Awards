(A) This project focuses on the design and analysis of efficient algorithms for
network and combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, the project
concentrates on (1) theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation of
algorithms and (2) algorithmic challenges that arise in applications such as
telecommunication networks and information management. Specifically at AT\&T,
development of new and enhanced communication and information services
necessitates algorithmic research and formulation of new models and problems.
(B) A principal component of the project is the design of fast algorithms for
fundamental network problems (such as shortest path flow computations, and
transitive closure). For large problem instances where a quadratic time exact
algorithm is infeasible, approximate linear time algorithms are investigated, by
considering these well known problems in new contexts. For example, availability
of multi-processor systems warrants development of parallel and distributed
algorithms, and large interactive databases necessitate the design of dynamic
and online algorithms. (C) This award enables the PI to visit the Department of
Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley for six months, so that
fruitful collaborations with faculty and graduate students can be initiated. In
particular, her activities include (3) the development and teaching of a
graduate course in network algorithms and combinatorial optimization, and (4) an
outreach program to women and other under represented groups. It is anticipated
that this university/industrial collaborative effort will be continued at both
Berkeley and AT\&T Laboratories.***
