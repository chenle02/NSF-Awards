9727362 Feng This grant provides partial support of the acquisition costs of an
X-ray attenuation-based particle size analyzer for the geology Department at
Dartmouth College. This device measures continuous particle size distribution in
samples by measuring the time varying attenuation of X-rays passing through
samples as particles fall under the force of gravity through a liquid medium.
The basic principle of the measurement relies on Stokes' Law of particle
settling; larger particles settle more rapidly (neglecting particle shape and
density variations) than smaller particles. The particle size analyzer will be
used for a variety of funded research projects both for grain size analysis and
as an alternative mineral separation technique. Studies of size- dependent
isotopic exchange between zeolite minerals and surrounding fluids, size-
dependent/surface area dependent silicate mineral weathering rates and
provenance studies of marine sediments will take advantage of the instruments
ability to rapidly measure continuous grain size distributions over a wide range
of silt and clay sized particles (100 microns-10 nm). Several researchers at
Dartmouth will make use of this equipment and will involve undergraduate
students in the analytical phases of their respective research programs. ***
