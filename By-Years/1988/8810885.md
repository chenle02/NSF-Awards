The many-body problem in quantum mechanics is known for its complexity. The
multiconfiguration Hartree-Fock (MCHF) method developed for bound state atomic
system performs well on systems that can be modeled as two-electron systems, but
as the number or electrons increases the computational task rapidly becomes out
of hand, and simplifying assumptions are introduced that decrease the level of
accuracy in the prediction of properties. The approach in the future to the
solution of such problems lies in the use of computer systems where many
processors are working concurrently on a given problem. The use of such systems
presents many problems - old programs cannot simply be transfered to such an
environment. New methods and new approaches need to be developed. The long-range
goal of this project is to develop parallel algorithms for atomic structure
calculations for computer architectures of the future. The first step in this
process is the revision of the numerical methods on which the MCHF calculations
are based from finite difference approximations to the expansion of functions in
terms of a spline basis. Symbol manipulation techniques will be explored to
perform the exact evaluation of needed integrals. A TOOLPACK system will be used
to assist in program transformations for different architectures.
