University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Vulnerability
Assessment of Grid Software Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Project
Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER)
proposal seeks to identify security vulnerabilities in software for Grid
environments. Proposed activities cover a range of research and development in
vulnerability identification and analysis. A new process called First Principles
based on Vulnerability Assessment (FPVA) will be pursued that includes a 4-level
scale to identify high-value assets and deriving threats based on their use. The
activities promise to produce algorithms, techniques, and tools used by software
developers and the grid community in identifying software vulnerabilities.
Assessment will be performed on two security systems used actively in grid
environments today. Finally, the work intends to help form the basis of a more
involved and longer term research and development effort in software
vulnerability assessment and safer coding practices. Intellectual merit of the
proposal lies in its potential contributions to fundamental approaches to
software vulnerability assessment, including a new process, new algorithms, new
tools, and formal characterizations of vulnerabilities. Broader impact is
characterized in the work?s potential to significantly improve security and
reliability of grid software used in environments supporting the entire NSF
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
