&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to conduct research on the design of output feedback
control of nonlinear systems.&lt;br/&gt;In the past several years, the principal
investigator's team has introduced and developed a new&lt;br/&gt;approach to
this problem that combines high-gain observers with saturation nonlinearities.
The&lt;br/&gt;approach proved useful in achieving fundamental progress in
semiglobal stabilization, sliding-mode&lt;br/&gt;control, servomechanisms, and
adaptive control. The earlier work has emphasized robustness
and&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic behavior, which quite often come at the expense of the
transient performance. The&lt;br/&gt;goal of this proposal is to develop new
tools for nonlinear design that ensure acceptable
transient&lt;br/&gt;performance, while ensuring robustness and a desired
asymptotic behavior. There are two main&lt;br/&gt;thrusts in the proposal. The
first one it to develop the tool of conditional integrators and
ser-&lt;br/&gt;vocompensators, which was recently introduced by the principal
investigator's team, to a much&lt;br/&gt;wider class of nonlinear systems and
design methods. The second one is to develop a logic-based&lt;br/&gt;switching
control strategy for a class of nonlinear systems, as an alternative to robust
and adaptive&lt;br/&gt;control, in order to improve performance in the face of
large model uncertainties.&lt;br/&gt;The class of nonlinear systems under
consideration arises in many applications such as mechan-&lt;br/&gt;ical
systems, aircraft control, and electric motor drives. Earlier results have been
applied to the&lt;br/&gt;control of induction motors and a mechanical system
known as the pendubot. It is planned to&lt;br/&gt;continue using these two
systems as testbeds for the new techniques.&lt;br/&gt;
