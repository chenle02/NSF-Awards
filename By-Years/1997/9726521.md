This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research aimed
at the development of methods to predict the constitutive behavior of nonlinear
composite materials. The collaboration involves Pedro Ponte Castaneda and John
Bassani of the University of Pennsylvania and the research group of Pierre
Suquet at the Mechanics and Acoustics Laboratory of the French National Center
for Scientific Research in Marseille, France. The investigators will focus their
research on self-consistent models of nonlinear composites and applications to
polycrystals. They will also investigate material behavior at the single-crystal
level, including elasto-viscoplasticity, multiple-slip hardening, and size-scale
efforts. The US researchers bring to this collaboration expertise in theoretical
work on nonlinear homogenization and crystal plasticity. This is complemented by
experimental facilities in Marseille and French expertise in numerical methods.
The project will advance understanding of nonlinear microscopic mechanisms
involved in deformation and fracture of materials, such as plastics and metals.
