This project deals with several aspects of the theory of weak solutions for
hyperbolic systems, and the mathematical theory of transport equations that
arise in kinetic theory of gases. Specific themes are: (i) To exploit the
interface between the theory of weak solutions for hyperbolic systems and the
theory of transport equations in the kinetic theory of gases, particularly with
regard to issues of propagation and cancellation of oscillations. (ii) To study
well-posedness and hydrodynamic limits for certain collisional kinetic models,
problems that are intimately connected to the thermomechanical issues arising in
the passage from microscopic to continuum theories. (iii) To exploit variational
techniques in the study of the structural properties for the equations of multi-
dimensional elastodynamics and viscoelasticity. (iv) To analyze various
instances of diffusion-sensitive dynamics, like the effect of small-viscosity on
the long-time evolution of hyperbolic systems and the notion of graph solutions
for diffusion sensitive systems.

The mathematical research on hyperbolic systems of conservation laws is to a
large extent motivated by the fundamental conservation laws in physics and
continuum mechanics. From its early stages, analytical and numerical methods in
this field have developed together, and analytical understanding contributes in
the design of high performance computational algorithms. In recent years there
has seen a very fruitful exchange between ideas in the theory of kinetic
equations and the theory of weak solutions for hyperbolic systems. At the core
of this exchange is the issue of deriving continuum theories from microscopic
models of kinetic theory of gases or statistical physics. This project will make
use of this exchange of ideas to develop mathematical techniques to better
understand the wide variety of important physical systems that are modeled by
conservation laws.
