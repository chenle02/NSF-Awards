9730568 Archer This project will use data and modeling to develop a quantified
description of the relationship between the diagenesis of redox-sensitive trace
metal (Fe, Mn, Mo, V, U, Re, Cd) and sediment oxidation state. Sediment solid-
phase and pore-water data will be generated for a suite of sediment cores from
the Chile margin that experience a range of oxidation states, and the data will
be used to assess a diagenetic model. The model will then be applied to a global
database of bottom-water oxygen, organic carbon flux and sedimentation rate to
determine authigenic fluxes of the metals. Key goals are (1) to develop a
quantitative capability to predict bottom-water oxygen levels and organic carbon
flux from sediment metal data and (2) to derive estimates of global metal fluxes
between sediments and bottom waters in the present and recent geologic past.
