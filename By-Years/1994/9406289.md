9406289 Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Georges Belfort ABSTRACT A foremost aim
of this research will be the development of a simple, inexpensive and generic
approach to immobilize affinity, reactive, or catalytic groups to synthetic
membranes. In this case, the work will involve construction and expression in E.
coli of a gene for unique fusion proteins consisting of a cellulose binding
domain region and a catalytic antibody-biosynthetic enzyme portion (CBDE2-43C9).
The cellulose binding domain permits attachment to cellulosic membranes while
the affinity or catalytic group tailors the membrane reactor for specific
applications. Membrane reactors are attractive because they can allow continuous
operation, enhance mass transfer, and facilitate product isolation. These
factors help to make processing more economical in the chemical and
biotechnology industries.
