This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the area
of chemistry. For three summers beginning in 1992, eight undergraduate students
will spend ten weeks engaged in research in the chemical sciences. Students in
the program will begin research during the summer after their sophomore year. A
key feature of the program is the provision for the student to spend the summer
after their junior year as a salaried research associate in the laboratory of an
industrial sponsor.
