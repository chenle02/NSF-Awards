9452032 Ahmed-Zaid The objective of this project is the development of a modular
design laboratory for senior-level undergraduate electrical engineering
students. This laboratory integrates physically-based devices and components
within a PC-based data acquisition and control environment. The new design
sections offer an integrated systems approach for the rapid development and
implementation of both hardware and software in a complete engineering design.
The educational goals of this laboratory are to teach the fundamentals of
electric machinery, power electronics and solid-state devices, electric drives,
motor control, and robotics, with reliability techniques incorporated in the
evaluation of alternative design solutions. The experiments are systems-oriented
and build on concepts such as stability, feedback, and analog/digital controller
design for various plants. Microprocessor control and modern instrumentation are
emphasized throughout for the performance evaluation of the designs in real-
world environments subject to modeling errors, disturbances, measurement noise,
and sensor and control system failures. Four initial design sections are built
around eight PC-based data acquisition and control (DAC) workstations. Each DAC
workstation consists of a 486/PC with specialized hardware/software and
dedicated test instruments (digitizing scope, signal analyzer, etc.). Each
system is equipped with an embedded high-performance digital signal processor
(DSP) board interfaced with a physical plant (electric machine, inverted
pendulum, robotic arm, etc.) via sensor I/O signals (encoder, Hall-effect
device, etc.) A DAC programming environment is used for the identification of
the system plant and the rapid design and implementation of prototype
controllers, both classical and advanced, in either a simulated or real-time
fashion.
