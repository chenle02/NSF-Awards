This project will investigate the evolutionary origin of bryozoans, a group of
aquatic animals with many species that form colonies by asexual reproduction.
Although association of bryozoans with molluscs, annelids, and other protostome
taxa is well supported, relationships among these groups is not. Data suggesting
that bryozoans diverged from a common ancestor before other members of the clade
Lophotrochozoa is, however, intriguing and warrants further investigation. The
present study will investigate Hox genes, which are important transcription
factors in early development. The DNA sequence of Hox genes, as well as their
arrangement within the genome, has been conserved over the course of animal
evolution, making them good candidates for understanding relationships between
widely divergent groups of animals. DNA sequencing and gene mapping will be
utilized to investigate the Hox genes of representatives from two major lineages
of bryozoans, cheilostomes and phylactolaemates. These data will be combined
with other information to infer the relationships between bryozoans and other
major lineages of animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of this study will
provide important information concerning the early evolution of animal
development and body plans. Additionally, the sequencing and mapping of bryozoan
Hox genes will provide a platform for future work on the origins of zooid
polymorphism in bryozoan colonies.&lt;br/&gt;
