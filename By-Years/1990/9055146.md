The Florida State University will initiate a six-week, residential, Young
Scholars project in mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry and
science communications for 54 students entering grades 11,12. Each student takes
a 1) math, 2) computer, and 3) elective (biochemistry, physics, or science
communications) course and completes an individual research project in
collaboration with a researcher at FSU. A video of the YSP experience with
particular emphasis on science ethics is produced by the science communication
students.
