This project will support an interactive workshop to facilitate generation of
innovative ideas to advance CubeSat-based science investigations of the geospace
environment. The CubeSat Ideas Lab workshop will bring together researchers from
the geospace and various engineering disciplines to form interdisciplinary teams
and develop innovative ideas for building cost-effective constellations or
swarms of 10-100 CubeSats. The workshop will also address approaches in
utilizing CubeSats for educating, training, and developing a cross-disciplinary
workforce.

CubeSats represent an increasing trend towards pursuing space-based research in
a multitude of disciplines, including Space Science, Astronomy, Earth Science,
and Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. This project will organize an Ideas
Lab to develop innovative ideas that have the potential to significantly advance
the state-of-the-art in CubeSat technology and science. The Ideas Lab process
has a proven track record of engaging scientists and stakeholders from across
disciplines in the creation of innovative scientific endeavors. This Ideas Lab
will bring together researchers from the geospace and various engineering
disciplines engaged in CubeSat research to form interdisciplinary teams with the
goal of developing innovative and transformative ideas that will eventually be
submitted as full proposals. The proposal concepts developed at this Ideas Lab
will address key challenges in building cost-effective constellations or swarms
of 10-100 CubeSats for geospace investigations. The Ideas Lab will support
integration of transformative ideas from several domains; from hardware to
software to applications. Design concepts developed in this Ideas Lab will also
address approaches in utilizing CubeSats for educating, training, and developing
a cross-disciplinary workforce.
