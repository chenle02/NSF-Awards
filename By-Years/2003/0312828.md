Algorithms that find good partitionings of highly unstructured and irregular
graphs are critical for developing efficient solutions of a wide range of
problems including parallel execution of mesh-based scientific simulations.
&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on developing new serial and parallel graph-
partitioning algorithms that can address the partitioning requirements of a
number of key high-performance scientific computations and can correctly model
the architectural characteristics of various emerging heterogeneous parallel
computing platforms. The specific research tasks for the project are: (i)
Development of partitioning algorithms for problem instances that lead to
dynamic constraints and objectives; (ii) development of partitioning algorithms
for contact/impact computations; and (iii) Development of architecture aware
graph partitioning algorithms. These algorithms will be tested and validated on
a wide range of problems obtained from academic, government, and industrial
sources and on a variety of parallel computing platforms.&lt;br/&gt;
