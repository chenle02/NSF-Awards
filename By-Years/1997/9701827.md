This award supports a two day conference in February 1997 entitled, "Capturing
Internet History". The purpose of the conference is to begin recording the
creation and development of the Internet through oral and written histories from
the people involved. A plan for recognizing and recording significant future
events also will result. MCI, Microsoft and NSF are contributing approximately
equally to the conference.
