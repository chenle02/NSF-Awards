The thrust of this collaborative project is to design, analyze and implement
efficient algorithms for several tiling, packing and covering problems with
rectangles in two or higher dimensions with applications in diverse areas such
as: VLSI, computer graphics, image processing, database design, data mining and
computational biology. Since computing exact solutions for almost all of these
problems is provably hard, the goal is to use diverse unifying techniques of
algorithm design such as local-ratio, multi-phase methods, and slice-and-dice
methods, and linear programming with nontrivial rounding and primal-dual schema.
They will develop novel data structures on grids for efficient approximation
algorithms for these problems.
