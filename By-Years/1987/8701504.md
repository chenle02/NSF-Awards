Salt balance is essential for the survival and functioning of all organisms.
The factors that control salt and water balance in freshwater mussels are under
investigation here. These organisms have a simple control system involving
nervous and local cellular control mechanisms. There is evidence that serotonin,
a common nervous system transmitter substance, stimulates sodium and calcium
transport. The gills in mussel are the principal sites of transport and will be
used in this study. The transport of nervous transmitters (including serotonin),
prostaglandins, and arachadonic metabolites will all be examined under various
conditions. The data obtained in this research will shed light on the cellular
mechanisms controlling sodium and calcium transport. This will enhance our
understanding of calcium transport, deposition, and mobilization as it relates
to overall salt and water balance.
