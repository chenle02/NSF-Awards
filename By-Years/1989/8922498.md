Particle counts and size analyses of organisms, sediments, and other materials
are an essential component of any aquatic research program. Funds are requested
to replace and upgrade, instrumentation in this area. The Great Lakes Research
Facility (GLRF) houses researchers, faculty, and students in the fields of
aquatic ecology, microbiology, fisheries, toxicology, biogeochemistry,
sedimentology, geology, and others. The equipment requested (an electronic
particle counter, a laser forward-scattering size detector and a video-
microscopy/image- analysis system) are vital to maintaining the graduate program
and the single and multiple-investigator research programs.
