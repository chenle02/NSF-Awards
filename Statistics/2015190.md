In modern data science, networks have emerged as one of the most important and
ubiquitous types of non-traditional data. Recently, data sets with a large
number of independent network-valued samples have become increasingly available.
In such data sets, a network serves as the basic data object, and they are
commonly seen in neuroscience, genetic studies, microbiome studies, and social
cognitive studies. Such types of data bring statistical challenges that cannot
be adequately addressed by existing tools. This project seeks to provide
foundational perspectives on the emerging inferential and computational
challenges in modeling a population and populations of networks. The theory and
methods developed here will allow us to characterize the network connectivity at
the population-level, and to monitor how the subject-level connectivity changes
as a function of subject characteristics. Quantifying such subject-level
differences has become central in studying the human brain, genetics, and
medicine in general. Motivated by applications in neuroscience, this research
will be beneficial for a variety of fields that study brain development, aging,
and disease diagnosis, progression and treatment. Integration of research and
education will be achieved through training undergraduate and graduate students,
and developing special topics graduate courses.

This project aims to develop a new network response model framework, in which
the networks are treated as responses and the network-level covariates as
predictors. The framework developed in this project, under appropriate
structural constraints, will preserve the intrinsic characteristics of networks,
ensure model identifiability, facilitate scalable computation, and allow valid
statistical inference. A variety of fundamental and critical computational and
inferential challenges will be addressed under this framework, including model
identifiability, efficient computation, quantifying computational and
statistical errors, and debiased inference. Additionally, the investigator will
develop two novel goodness-of-fit tests for a broad class of network models,
including those considered in this project. Further, the investigator will
investigate modeling with heterogeneity by developing a network mixed-effect
model, and a framework for model-based network clustering. Developments in both
directions are formulated to take into account the rich information from subject
covariates. The theory to be developed under asymptotic regimes allows the
network size, the number of network samples, and the model complexity (e.g.,
rank, sparsity, number of clusters) to increase at reasonable rates.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
