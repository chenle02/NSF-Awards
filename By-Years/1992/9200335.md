This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the field
of chemistry. For a three-year period beginning April 1992, eight (8)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks engaged in basic research under
the direction of the faculty members in the Chemistry Department. A focal point
of the proposed projects is the study of synthesis, structure, and dynamics at
the interface between inorganic, organic, and bio-organic chemistry. A special
seminar program will be included in which the students will be exposed to
special topics in modern chemical research and to careers in science. This
seminar program, together with participation in regular research group meeting,
will also give the students experience in reporting on their own research
progress and in acquiring a greater ability to communicate scientific
information. The underlying aim of the overall program is to give students
strong incentives for pursuing careers in the science field.
