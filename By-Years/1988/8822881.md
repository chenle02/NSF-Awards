In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo- metallic Chemistry
program, Karl M. Kadish of the University of Houston will investigate the
electron transfer reactivity and spectroscopic properties of a wide variety of
metalloporphyrins. Metallophorphyrins are model compounds for numerous metallo-
proteins and enzymes such as hemoglobin, chlorophyll and vitamin B-12 and their
study, especially redox behavior and electron transfer mechanisms, is important
for understanding the modes of action of these bioinorganic systems. A broad
based selection of monometallic, bimetallic and trimetallic metalloporphyrins
will be examined by the usual electrochemical methodologies as well as by UV-
visible, FTIR and ESR spectroelectrochemistry of the in situ products and/or
intermediates produced in each electrode reaction. Stable
electrooxidation/reduction products will be isolated and characterized by usual
methods. Special emphasis will be placed on metal-carbon and metal-metal bonded
metalloporphyrins as well as on metalloporphyrins in high and low oxidation
states and those with diatomic molecules as ligands. Water soluble porphyrins
will be investigated in aqueous and non-aqueous media as will be porphyrins in
micelles.
