The design of structurally fault-tolerant (FT) multiprocessors, which can
reconfigure around fault components to preserve interconnection structure, is an
important problem in computer architecture. While a number of design methods
have been proposed previously, they suffer from a lack of generality, and also
fail to address practical issues like low redundancy, efficient
reconfigurability and design scalability. In this project we are primarily
concerned with implementing a software package based on the node-covering and
automorphic methods for designing and simulating fault-tolerant systems,
extending both design methods to deal with link and switch failures, devising
techniques for very fast and distributed reconfiguration, developing principles
for more efficient realizations of our designs, and designing systems with high
average-case fault tolerance (and thus a high reliability-to-cost-ratio). We
also investigate how the node- covering formulation can be applied to
incorporate fault tolerance in uniprocessors, and in various types of logic
circuits, especially those that can be realized as iterative arrays of simpler
cells
