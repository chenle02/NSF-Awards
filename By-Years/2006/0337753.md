The investigators propose to develop computer software for scoring and analyzing
student task performances in science classes. The project is intended to create
ways for validating and scoring student science work accurately and for
supporting student self assessment in science. Current assessment scores do not
provide sufficient evidence about the impact of the curriculum on student
learning. The project would create statistical models for evaluating task
performance on how well goals for student learning are met. The general goal is
to understand how participation in performance assessments contributes to
student learning and to the improvement of general learning abilities. The
assumption of the investigators that measurement of student quality of work in
performance assessment must be valid and those current procedures are not yet in
place to assure the validity of scoring techniques.
