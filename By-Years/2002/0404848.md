This proposal concerns two topics in controlled surgery. The first is a
&lt;br/&gt;homotoy-theoretic approach to controlled surgery on Poincare spaces
of &lt;br/&gt;dimension 4 and greater. This provides input for a limit
construction &lt;br/&gt;of homology manifolds. The principal new conclusion
would be &lt;br/&gt;construction of exotic homology manifolds in dimension 4
(the &lt;br/&gt;Bryant-Ferry-Mio-Weinberger construction works in 6 and above)
and, via &lt;br/&gt;a known resolution theorem, a proof of the 4-dimensional
topological &lt;br/&gt;surgery conjecture. The second topic is a variation on
surgery groups &lt;br/&gt;making use of controlled K-theory. This should have
better formal &lt;br/&gt;properties, for instance should more often satisfy the
Farrell-Jones &lt;br/&gt;isomorphism
conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal concerns controlled
surgery on Poincare spaces. Poincare &lt;br/&gt;spaces have global homological
duality similar to that of manifolds. &lt;br/&gt;Given a map to a metric space
one can measure the "size" of the duality &lt;br/&gt;structure: how far one must
go to find dual cycles. Manifolds have &lt;br/&gt;duality with size 0 because
duality follows from the local structure. &lt;br/&gt;Poincare spaces generally
have no constraints, so the size is the &lt;br/&gt;diameter of the control
space. The key part of the proposal is a &lt;br/&gt;size-reducing process: given
a Poincare space with duality of size &lt;br/&gt;epsilon, find an equivalent
Poincare space with much smaller size &lt;br/&gt;control. The approach proposed
should work for spaces of dimension 4 &lt;br/&gt;and above. In this case it
would provide input to an elaborate but &lt;br/&gt;already established argument
to give a proof of the 4-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;topological surgery conjecture.
This conjecture is the major unresolved &lt;br/&gt;problem in topology in
dimension 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
