The objective of this research is to explore the feasibility of a vapor-jet-
ejector for use in a novel heat-pipe refrigerator. The refrigerator operates on
the vapor-compression principle using a vapor-jet ejector for compression and
capillary wicking for liquid inventory control and pumping. A major uncertainty
associated with the performance of this unique device is the operation of the
vapor- jet ejector at low absolute pressure. A vapor-jet ejector will be
constructed in a closed loop. The vapor mass flow rates will be quantified at
various pressure ratios. The results of this research are directly related to
the Coefficient of Performance of the refrigerator so that the feasibility of
the heat-pipe refrigerator will be established. This new device is a completely
passive refrigerator system which is extremely simple in physical structure. The
heat-pipe refrigerator should provide an inexpensive and reliable refrigerator
that can be driven by low-quality energy.
