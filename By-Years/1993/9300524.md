This project focuses on mathematical research in the area of special functions
and their applications to a multiplicity of scientific questions. Among the most
important special functions which arise in applications fall within the general
class of hypergeometric functions, which, for example, have recently found their
way into the theory of quantum groups. In addition to linear and linear
fractional transformations, some of these functions have quadratic or higher
transformations. Quadratic transformations have been studied for two centuries
and are reasonably well understood. Cubic transformations were first discovered
by Riemann over 125 years ago, yet they are not as well understood as comments
in the literature lead one to think, and while applications of them have been
limited, there are some recent very interesting ones which go back to work of
Ramanujan. These transformations will be analyzed. Efforts will be made to find
multivariable extensions. Special functions are fundamental building blocks used
in the approximation of complex functions, as solutions of differential
equations and in the representation of many important mathematical and physical
relationships. In addition to their recurrence in often unexpected ways
throughout science, they generally are easy to compute or approximate
numerically.
