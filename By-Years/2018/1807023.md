Due to the rapid development of information technologies and their applications
in many scientific fields, high dimensional time series (HDTS) are routinely
collected nowadays. The methods and theory developed for the inference of low
and fixed dimensional time series may not be applicable when the dimension is
comparable to or exceeds time series length, and there is an urgent need to
develop new statistical methods that can accommodate both high dimensionality
and temporal dependence. Statistical inference for HDTS is fundamentally
important and has many applications in disciplines ranging from climate science
to medical imaging and finance, among others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
aims to develop innovative theory and methodologies to address several important
inference problems in the analysis of HDTS. The research is built on the self-
normalized approach, which has found great success in dealing with low
dimensional problems. Its advance to the high dimensional context is challenging
both methodologically and theoretically, and it requires a new methodological
formulation and new theory. This project covers the inference of the mean,
covariance matrix, and auto-covariance matrix for HDTS, and the tests developed
can be used to detect change points, certain structure of the covariance matrix
and target dense alternative. On the theoretical front, the weak convergence of
sequential U-statistic based process will be investigated and is of independent
interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
