This award supports the Stochastic Networks Conference to be held June 20-24,
2016 at the University of California, San Diego. Information about the
conference is available through the conference website at

The 2016 Stochastic Networks Conference will provide a key forum for researchers
from different quantitative disciplines, including mathematics, probability,
operations research, computer science, electrical, mechanical and industrial
engineering, to come together to hear and discuss the latest research
developments related to stochastic networks. The program includes a broad
spectrum of leading researchers amongst the invited speakers, including some
speakers who are junior researchers, underrepresented minorities or women, as
well as senior researchers. Participant support will help early career
researchers, underrepresented minorities and women attend the conference to
discuss and present their work.

Stochastic networks is a multifaceted area of research concerned with the
modeling, stability, control, performance, approximation, and design of networks
which are subject to the effects of stochastic variability. Research in this
area is strongly motivated by applications in diverse domains of science and
engineering. Examples of application areas include telecommunications, computer
networks, high-tech manufacturing systems, service networks, social and
biological networks, and health care management. The study of stochastic
networks gives rise to challenging and subtle mathematical problems, whose
solution often requires an innovative combination of ideas and techniques from
several branches of mathematics. Many of the above aspects will be discussed at
the conference.
