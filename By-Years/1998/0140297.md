The Stanford gravitational wave detection group is working in direct support of
the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) project supported
by the NSF. The research aims to develop cutting edge technologies in the areas
of: high power lasers; low absorption materials for optics and mirror coatings;
high-power high-quantum-efficiency photo-detectors; advanced interferometer
configurations; adaptive-optics; active seismic isolation and feedback and
control systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LIGO observatory is being
commissioned and when operational should give us a glimpse of the range of
astronomical gravitational wave sources that may be detectable. Gravitational
wave sources such as interacting black holes, coalescing compact binary systems,
stellar collapses, pulsars and low-mass x-ray binaries are all possible
candidates for detection. Observing gravitational wave signals will
significantly enhance our understanding of the Universe and detectors of higher
performance are required to exploit the potential of gravitational wave
astronomy. The Stanford research program is directed towards developing the
technology essential to the operation of Advanced LIGO and future gravitational
wave detectors.&lt;br/&gt;
