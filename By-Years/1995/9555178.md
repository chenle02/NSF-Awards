The project is developing a course in computer intensive statistical methods,
with accompanying laboratories in Mathematica. Computer intensive statistical
methods have significantly changed the practice of statistics in recent years,
and need to be introduced in the undergraduate curriculum to bring the
mathematics curriculum more in line with the current practice of statistics. The
goals of the project are to develop an upper level undergraduate statistics
course (a) whose topics are of current interest in the statistical community and
are accessible to undergraduates, (b) which is problem-centered and uses real
data, and (c) which promotes realistic use of the computer in the determination
of problem solutions. The target audience for these innovations is students
majoring in the mathematical sciences. The project is producing a textbook, with
accompanying laboratories. These laboratories are designed so that they may also
be used as supplementary topics in other courses such as mathematical
statistics. The laboratories are also being made available electronically. ??
