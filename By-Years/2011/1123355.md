Chemistry (12) The "Online Chemistry: Problems, Concepts and Contexts" project
is creating a set of web-based instructional materials covering topics in
introductory chemistry that are difficult to teach and learn, including
stoichiometry, thermodynamics, kinetics, equilibrium, acid-base chemistry, and
solubility. Students currently spend a substantial amount of instructional time
solving quantitative problems on these topics. The online materials help to
maximize the learning benefits of this time by better coupling the problem
solving to chemical concepts and to the use of these concepts in modern science.
The instructional modules are grounded in both the broader instructional
principles of learning science and more specific results obtained from observing
students solving chemistry problems. In particular, the online materials
implement an instructional approach to equilibrium that initial results found to
more than double student performance on difficult problems and that lays a
powerful conceptual framework on which acid-base and other related topics build.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The molecular science covered in these materials is
becoming an increasingly important aspect of science and engineering. By
providing students with robust knowledge of chemical concepts, the modules
prepare students for careers across multiple STEM disciplines. The materials are
broadly disseminated through the web, conferences and publications. Because the
materials are developed in a manner that allows for easy modifications, even for
highly interactive components, both the original authors and the community as a
whole can use the information gleaned on how students learn to iteratively
improve the materials.
