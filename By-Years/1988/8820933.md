This work will complete the development of molecules which are designed to be
molecular precursors to ferromagnetic organic metals (FOM). The neutral donors
are expected to be trimethylene methanes and to retain this character once
incorporated into stacks in the solid state. Synthetic precursors to HTTM and
TDMT will also be diverted to prepare quinodimethanoid donors with a sulfur
periphery; the latter, in analogy to bisethylenedithio tetrathiafulvalene, are
expected to give rise to organic superocnductors. Studies on the physical
properties of new electron acceptors based on multi- tricyanovinyl substituted
benzenes will be continued and a trigonal, nonacyano-1,3,5-trivinylbenzene.
Syntheses of oxygen analogs of TTF and ET as well as a quinodimethanoid donor
are proposed in order to test if these lighter analogs will exhibit higher
superconductor transition temperatures in their salts with various anions. Once
prepared the solids will have their physical properties determined using the
latest developments in experimental condensed matter physics.
