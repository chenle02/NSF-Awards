The Navier-Stokes system of partial differential equations is widely used to
model fluid flows in physical applications. These equations have importance for
example in modeling emulsions, foams, and biological membranes. The goal of this
project is to computationally solve related equations that are posed on surfaces
instead of on flat domains or spaces. For example, membranes of cells can be
thought of as fluids that flow and deform, and the surface of such a cell can be
modeled using a surface Navier-Stokes system. Constructing accurate and
efficient numerical methods for such surface fluid problems involves overcoming
some challenges different from those encountered in the well-studied case of
fluids on flat domains. Various ways of solving these issues have been proposed
in recent years. The project will provide foundational theoretical backing for
one major class of such methods and give new insight into its practical
properties. The project provides training for graduate students through
involvement in the research.

Surface finite element methods (SFEM) have grown into an important practical
tool for simulations for physical models involving partial differential
equations posed on surfaces. Many finite element methods exist for solving
scalar elliptic problems on surfaces, but not much work has been done for
surface vector Laplace-type operators such as surface (Navier-)Stokes system for
modeling fluid flow on surfaces. The main goal of this project is to develop and
analyze new finite element algorithms for surface partial differential equations
involving the Stokes operator. The first part of the project will focus on
algorithms for the stationary (linear) Stokes problem. A new divergence-
conforming trace finite element method will be developed. This method will
provide a new tool for solving problems involving surface fluid models with
coupled bulk effects. In addition, further theoretical analysis will be carried
out for both this new algorithm and existing ones, with the focus being mostly
on geometric errors which arise in SFEM due to the approximation of the actual
surface on which the problem is posed by a discrete counterpart. Their behavior
is well understood for scalar elliptic problems, but not for vector Laplace-type
operators. Finally, algorithms will be developed and studied for time-dependent
Stokes and Navier-Stokes systems on prescribed and evolving surfaces.
