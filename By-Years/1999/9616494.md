Wiener 9616494 This research studies spousal homicide in nineteenth-century
England and its treatment by the general public and the courts. It will
construct the first comprehensive database of such homicides and their legal
disposition. It will use a variety of under-exploited sources including
newspaper accounts and confidential Home Office files to explore particularly
revealing cases in depth. The goal is to explain the increased prominence,
during the course of that century, of domestic homicide. Of particular concern
will be the increase in husbands killing wives. Explanatory hypotheses to be
tested focus on changes in national social development that increased the
frequency of homicide and a decrease in public tolerance for such behavior. The
use of qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate changes in violence
during that period promises to provide the missing historical perspective that
can inform explanations of the contemporary increase in spousal homicide. ***
