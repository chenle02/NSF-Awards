9308394 THILL The importance of constraints in spatial choice by individuals is
widely recognized in geography and related disciplines, but relatively little
attention has focused on the development of empirically verified models of
spatial choice that effectively incorporate constraints. A potentially fruitful
line of inquiry is the identification of destinations selected by travelers when
travel time and other constraints are imposed on the spatial decision-making
process. This project will examine the impacts of constraints on destination
choice through development and testing of models based on random-utility theory.
Tractable specifications of random-utility models that include the effects of
travel time and other constraints will be identified, with special attention
given to analysis of the effect of constraints on formation of the sets from
which travelers choose their destinations. The models developed in initial
phases of this project will be tested using detailed data on non-work travel
behavior taken at ten-year intervals over two decades in the Minneapolis-St.
Paul metropolitan area. This project will contribute to development of models of
destination choice that more realistically account for behavioral variations
among individuals, especially with respect to the role of constraints in the
selection of destinations. Through model development and empirical testing,
general knowledge of spatial decision making will be advanced. The results of
this research also will have practical advantages for transportation planning.
