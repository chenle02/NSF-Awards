Aviation safety is important now and will be for many years to come. Despite the
increasing use of autopilot and fly-by-wire flight management systems, nothing
can replace the skills of a well-trained pilot. There is, however, a small
collection of visual, vestibular, somatogravic, and proprioceptive illusions
that afflict pilots under particular flight dynamics and conditions. These
primarily originate from a mismatch among incoming sensory information sources
and the information entailed in producing and executing a pilot?s actions, i.e.
a failure in sensorimotor integration. Moreover, recent neuroscience findings
have demonstrated a fundamental role of neural oscillations across the cerebral
cortex in supporting sensorimotor integration. This project aims to investigate
the role of ongoing neural oscillations in sensorimotor integration and its
afflictions during an aviation simulation. This research will be conducted in
collaboration with Dr. Daniel Callan, a noted expert on aviation neuroscience,
at the Center for Information and Neural Networks (CiNET) in Osaka, Japan.

The approach of this project is to collect multimodal neuroimaging data: first,
using electroencephalography (EEG) while participants perform an aviation task
designed to elicit varying degrees of sensorimotor integration in a six degree-
of-freedom motion platform flight simulator; second, using
magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
during an equivalent task. We seek to understand sensorimotor integration in the
brain, as mediated by neural oscillatory dynamics, e.g. cross-frequency phase-
amplitude coupling, in order to inform the future design of brain-computer
interfaces and adaptive flight systems. Detecting these neural states in silico
and in situ will provide a proof-of-concept for a new form of human-system
interfacing, providing unprecedented situational awareness of the cognitive
state of pilot users, as well as potential spin-off technological interventions
for disorders of perceptual and motor regulation. This NSF EAPSI award is funded
in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.
