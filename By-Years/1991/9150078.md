The American Geological Institute is planning a major effort to develop geo-
sciences curriculum materials at the pre-college level, with the emphasis on
grades K-6. The project proposes a conference that will bring together key
players to help identify existing programs and materials related to the major
effort and to establish a clearing house/network to promote sharing of resources
and the effective use of new materials.
