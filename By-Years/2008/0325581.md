Early, reliable detection of outbreaks of disease, whether natural (e.g., West
Nile virus) or bioterrorist-induced (e.g., anthrax and smallpox), is a critical
problem today. It is important to detect outbreaks early in order to provide the
best possible medical response and treatment, as well as to improve the chances
of identifying the source. A primary goal of this project is to develop basic
new Bayesian probabilistic inference algorithms that monitor electronically
available healthcare data to achieve early, reliable detection of outbreaks. In
particular, inference will take place on Bayesian networks that model the links
between available data and possible causes of outbreaks. &lt;br/&gt;The
scientific challenge of monitoring for outbreaks within an entire population
create major computational challenges in building and applying Bayesian models
that are orders of magnitude larger than those developed previously. The project
will apply and extend state-of-the-art probabilistic inference methods to
achieve efficient inference. If inference indicates that an outbreak is likely,
an alert will be raised automatically. Appropriately, however, public health
officials are unlikely to blindly trust an outbreak alert, unless there is an
explanatory justification. Automated explanation of Bayesian inference is
therefore another key project goal. &lt;br/&gt;The scientific contributions of
this project will follow from developing, investigating, and evaluating new
modeling and algorithmic techniques that make Bayesian biosurveillance practical
for monitoring and diagnosing (in real time) the disease-outbreak status of an
entire population. In investigating these issues, this project is anticipated to
make both specific scientific contributions to computer science, statistics, and
public health, as well as broader contributions to public safety.
