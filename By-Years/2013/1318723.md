This study is the first to apply psychological theories about cognitive bias and
information seeking to jury selection in actual trials. It draws on archival
data to analyze how the discourse of jury selection skews evaluations of jurors'
fitness for service and contributes to racial disparities observed in earlier
research.

This study analyzes conversations among attorneys, judges, and potential jurors
in 12 capital murder cases from North Carolina. It does so using a method for
conversation analysis developed to analyze racial disparities in patient-doctor
interactions. This method provides a way to characterize in detail interactions
occurring in a conversation. Previous analysis of jury selection in capital
murder trials in North Carolina documented stark racial disparities. In
litigation based on this research, however, prosecutors responded that race
never enters their minds when picking a jury. Yet attorneys' preference for
jurors of a certain race may operate in ways far more subtle than conscious
bias. Psychological evidence suggests that people harbor stereotypes about which
demographic groups are more or less likely to convict and ultimately issue a
death sentence, and these operate as starting hypotheses that inform how
attorneys collect information during voir dire.

This study will contribute to the jury selection literature by clarifying the
voir dire process, and provide insight on the source of the avowedly
unintentional racial disparities that persist in jury selection. It will also
provide useful guidance to participants in the criminal justice system at all
levels--policymakers, legislators, judges, prosecutors, and defense counsel--as
they seek to eliminate the influence of race in this system. Finally, this
project will expose law students to these issues and make them more prepared to
use research accurately in court and to implement meaningful reforms.
