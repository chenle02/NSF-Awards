An equipment package will be assembled for field measurements of the
temperatures, moisture concentration, and heat flux through various insulation
layers used in home construction. The primary objective of the experiments will
be to validate a numerical model of the radiation/diffusion (mass and heat)
transport processes which occur under actual field conditions, including
day/night, winter/summer, high humidity, and contaminated surface operation.
Most existing data have been taken under steady-state, guarded hot plate
conditions, making extrapolation of models to high humidity and time-varying
environments tenuous. Numerical models of the energy lost through building walls
indicate that substantial savings can be obtained by properly choosing the
geometry and properties of the composite insulation materials, such as the
emissivity, density, and affinity of the materials for moisture. Research
equipment purchased through this grant is essential to provide a reliable data
base against which such models can be validated under actual field conditions.
