Doron Zeilberger proposes to continue to develop&lt;br/&gt;methodologies for
harnessing the great potential of&lt;br/&gt;Computer Algebra to do research in
Combinatorics and&lt;br/&gt;related areas, and design experiments for
(rigorous)&lt;br/&gt;computer-assisted and computer-generated
research.&lt;br/&gt;In particular he hopes to develop a new algorithmic
theory&lt;br/&gt;to be named `Symbolic Moment Calculus', that would
produce&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for computing, symbolically and automatically,
&lt;br/&gt;(statistical) moments of interesting combinatorial
quantities.&lt;br/&gt;He also plans to develop a general theory of recurrence
equations&lt;br/&gt;that would include both the `Dynamic Programming'
recurrences&lt;br/&gt;featuring the maximum, ubiquitous in Computational
Biology,&lt;br/&gt;and the mex operation, that occurs in the theory
of&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorial Games.&lt;br/&gt;He also proposes to continue
his&lt;br/&gt;efforts in `Artificial Combinatorics', and develop
algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for the discovery and rigorous proof of
&lt;br/&gt;enumeration schemes for counting permutation classes, and for
&lt;br/&gt;automatically deducing generating functions. Another&lt;br/&gt;line
of research concerns automatic determinant evaluations&lt;br/&gt;that has
potential applications in applied mathematics
and&lt;br/&gt;science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research should be symbiotic,
as it is&lt;br/&gt;expected that both the concrete results and &lt;br/&gt;the
underlying methodologies, would help computer algebra developers&lt;br/&gt;to
improve and enhance their systems. It is also hoped that&lt;br/&gt;this research
will contribute to the budding field of Experimental&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics, in
that it will help develop a research methodology for&lt;br/&gt;conducting
computer experiments that output rigorous &lt;br/&gt;(and interesting!)
mathematical theorems&lt;br/&gt;(and proofs), rather than just verifying and
formulating conjectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is in the field of
Combinatorics, whose usefulness&lt;br/&gt;to science and technology is well-
known. In particular, computer&lt;br/&gt;science is largely based on
combinatorics, as is electronic&lt;br/&gt;communication and the World Wide
Web.&lt;br/&gt;
