EAR-0447175&lt;br/&gt;Koppers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 40Ar/39Ar dating
technique has become one of the most widely used methods in the field of isotope
geochronology today. However, the increasing number of ages generated by the
40Ar/39Ar dating technique, more and more requires a consistency in the complex
calculation of these ages and their errors. ArArCALC
(http://earthref.org/tools/ararcalc.htm; Koppers, 2002) has been designed to
calculate 40Ar/39Ar ages within a single software program starting with basic
noble gas mass spectrometry data and ending with the simul-taneous calculation
and display of plateau, total fusion and isochron ages. It has been widely used
by re-searchers and students both in the United States and in international
laboratories since its online publication in 2001. This award will expand and
update the ArArCALC Freeware package to add new "Advanced Data Reduction"
capabilities that will be of great benefit to most 40Ar/39Ar geochronologists
today. Three sepa-rate updates are proposed over a two year period, in
particular, to ensure complete error propagation throughout all the age
calculation algorithms, to add new visualization tools allowing users to better
study their dating results, to provide a complete user-guide in PDF and HTML
that fully describes the functional-ity, algorithms and program philosophy, and
finally to ensure easy transfer of the age dating results into the Radio-Isotope
Geochronology (RiG) databases that are currently being developed under
http://earthref.org and CHRONOS. The impact of these software updates extends
well beyond the benefits to the 40Ar/39Ar geochronologists alone. The easy
dissemination of 40Ar/39Ar age dating results, stored in single ArArCALC data
files, allows for an increased and straightforward exchange of age calculation
results between different researchers, between different laboratories, and
between principal investigators, their students and scientists outside 40Ar/39Ar
geochronology. The fact that all calculation parameters are stored in each
ArArCALC age calculation file and that they can be viewed - and edited - at all
times, makes this software an excellent tool for teaching undergraduate and
graduate students the intrinsic details of 40Ar/39Ar geochronology.&lt;br/&gt;
