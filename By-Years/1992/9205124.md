This project covers the reduction of raw data from the radome type gust probe
systems and from the fast response temperature and humidity sensors installed on
the two NOAA WP3Ds for the TOGA/COARE field experiment. Previous experience with
these data sensors indicates that high quality turbulence data as well as data
for sensible and latent heat fluxes will be obtained. This research is important
because it serves as one of the studies of TOGA COARE that links convective
scale physical processes to the larger scales that impact climate variability in
an especially climate sensitive region of the world, the western Pacific Ocean,
the field site of TOGA COARE.
