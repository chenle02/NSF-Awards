The primary purpose of the PIPESTEMS project is to increase the number of
students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines
by: (1) building on programs focused on increasing retention and graduation; (2)
enhancing existing student support services to fit specific needs of STEM
scholars; and (3) offering learning enrichment activities such as science
seminars, field trips/site visits to partner universities and businesses, and
faculty mentoring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The primary aim of
the project is to expose students at the college's four campuses to the
PIPESTEMS opportunity as well as to an array of student support services and
activities available in support of the program. A unique combination of
activities are being offered that provide educational and research opportunities
for PIPESTEMS scholars in partnership with the University of Tulsa, University
of Oklahoma-Tulsa, Oklahoma State University, and OSU Center for Health
Sciences. This project complements and builds on an NSF supported biotechnology
program (0602744).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The activities from
this project are resulting in increased enrollment, retention, and degree
completion of STEM students, especially underrepresented and female populations.
There are intensive collaborations with existing student support services
departments at the college, similar student-focused programs such as Tulsa
Achieves Scholarship, Honors Scholars, and Achieving the Dream program student
cohorts, and higher education institutions and business partners who assist with
transfer and career placement upon degree completion.
