This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate a low-
rate fluid flow measurement technique for nuclear power plants that incorporates
several novel features that permit its use as a clamp-on measurement device
having minimal installation costs and complications. By utilizing waste heat on
piping lines and wireless data links, the flow sensor system avoids the
requirement for an extended wiring system that interconnects and powers the
instrumentation within the containment vessel. The proposed flow sensor should
significantly enhance nuclear power plant system safety by providing a robust,
self-contained, zero-maintenance, zero-power instrument for monitoring in-plant
piping systems. Accurate and reliable measurement of critical flow systems will
ensure piping thermal stresses remain below design limits, for safe continued
generation of electric power. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial impact of
this technology would be a new class of non-intrusive, self-powered flow and
temperature sensors, that could form the basis of the next-generation health
monitoring systems for nuclear power plants.&lt;br/&gt;
