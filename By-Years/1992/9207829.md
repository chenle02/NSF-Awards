Recent work by the PI and others has provided a new synthesis of description of
low-level complexity classes-sets of formal languages which can be recognized
under tight resource bounds in various models of computation. Complexity classes
originally based on uniform families of boolean circuits have been shown to have
equivalent definitions using finite monoids and first-order logic. This work
will apply this synthesis to the separation of low-level complexity classes
(especially classes based on threshold circuits), the study of uniformity of
circuit families, and the extension of the circuit model to new kinds of
computation.
