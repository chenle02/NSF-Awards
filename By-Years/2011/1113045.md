A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V
Marcus Langseth, a 235? Global seismic vessel with general oceanographic
capabilities operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University
as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research
fleet. The request includes nine items listed by
priority:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Teledyne RDI 75kHz ?Ocean Surveyor? ADCP
$119,053&lt;br/&gt;2) Applanix POS/MV V.4 Upgrade &amp; IMU Replacement $
92,174&lt;br/&gt;3) Uninterruptable Power Sources $ 56,109&lt;br/&gt;4) Two
SBE-45 TSGs $ 12,623&lt;br/&gt;5) Sonobuoy Electronics Package $
51,806&lt;br/&gt;6) SIPPICAN MK-21 Interface $ 8,339&lt;br/&gt;7) GEOMETRICS 882
Magnetometer $ 22,550&lt;br/&gt;8) EM-122 Water Column Logging License $
15,532&lt;br/&gt;9) Mammal Mitigation Gun $ 22,230&lt;br/&gt;
$400,416&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt; The principal impact of the
present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
