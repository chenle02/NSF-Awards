This project will convert the series of public use samples into a single
coherent form, facilitating the use of these data for the study of long-term
social change in American society. Large individual-level samples of the U.S.
census of population covering the census years 1880, 1900, 1910, 1940, 1950,
1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990 are currently available or in preparation. These data
have proven to be a valuable resource, since they allow researchers to make
analyses tailored to their specific research questions and to avoid the problems
and limitations associated with using the published census data for different
years. The availability of these census files has led to some research on the
nature of long-term social change in the United States. However, because the
data files were created at different times and by different investigators, they
have incompatible documentation and a wide variety of record layouts and coding
schemes. These differences inhibit the use of the data for the study of social
change. The preparation and documentation of an integrated Public Use Microdata
Series will provide a valuable data resource for the research community, and
will eventually contribute greatly to our understanding of the changes American
society has undergone since 1880.
