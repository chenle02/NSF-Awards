1353018&lt;br/&gt;Weiland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this EAGER proposal, they will
conduct initial experiments to study neural plasticity in both blind humans with
retinal implants and in animal models of retinal degeneration. They expect that
these initial experiments will establish the experimental techniques and data
analysis methods needed to conduct important, ground-breaking studies on the
basic neuroscience underlying sight restoration. The objectives are: 1: Assess
cortical representations of electrical retinal stimulations delivered via the
Argus II retinal prosthesis; 2: Assess cortical plasticity associated with
retinal prosthesis use; and 3: Measure neural plasticity in an animal model of
retinal degeneration using chronic stimulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful
completion of these objectives will demonstrate feasibility of a set of core
techniques that are foundational and transformative for advancing the
development of retinal prostheses and the understanding of cortical plasticity
in implant recipients.
