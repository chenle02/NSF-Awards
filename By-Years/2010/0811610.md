TITLE: Betters Tools for Software Understanding&lt;br/&gt;PI: Brad A. Myers,
Carnegie Mellon University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding software is a
prerequisite to taking any action to change it, and this remains expensive and
error-prone. Research with programmers in the field has identified significant
barriers to understanding. Lab and field studies of usability barriers in
understanding and using APIs will result in models of how developers understand
the design of the objects. These results will lead to new software tools for API
exploration and understanding. Work on enabling people to better understand and
fix bugs through new visualizations and interaction techniques will allow them
to ask "Why" and "Why Not" questions about their code, with the answer
visualizing the responsible code and dataflow. New tools will support
understanding code by others during reverse engineering activities, focusing on
how data and control can flow through large and complex programs. Using static
analysis techniques and a new "WhatTree" visualization will allow programmers to
investigate the update paths of their programs, while supporting the programmers
in collecting and keeping track of facts and hypotheses about how the program
operates. The results will improve programmer success and thus their overall
productivity.&lt;br/&gt;
