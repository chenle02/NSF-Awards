9410510 Ault The proposed research is in the Undergraduate Design Projects
Program category, and requests support for undergraduate and graduate student
engineers to provide prototype "custom designed" devices and software to aid
persons with disabilities. The primary goal of this thrust is to provide
meaningful design experience for the engineering student that will directly aid
a specific disabled individual. A formal program is in place at Worcester
Polytechnic Institute which will ensure satisfactory progress is attained on
these projects. A group of students and the investigators on the grant will work
with a number of collaborating agencies and individuals on these projects.
Twenty-eight projects are planned during the five year duration of this award,
and a written report on the completed projects will be submitted for an annual
publication. Once completed, each project will be given to the person for whom
it is designed. The hope is that this "real world" experience will give
engineering students a sense of purpose and pride, help engineering schools
serve the community, attract new students into engineering, and raise student
interest in graduate education. This type of undertaking is important since it
provides a meaningful experience for engineering students as part of their
undergraduate design requirements, and will also benefit a population where
customization is often needed for rehabilitation devices. ***
