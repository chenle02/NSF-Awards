This project is developing novel instructional materials for undergraduate
courses on semiconductor devices in electrical engineering. The material
includes a set of Excel spreadsheets incorporating Visual Basic macros, which
plot many internal device variables and constitute a real-time, virtual
laboratory for interactive experiments on the devices. The other component is
the accompanying in-depth exercises designed to provide structured interactive
engagement with the simulations and underlying course material. Effectiveness is
being evaluated by using these materials in one of two sections of a course with
the other serving as a control group. The assessment process is using a new
concept inventory on semiconductor devices, examination grades, and discussion
with student focus groups. The PI plans to disseminate assessment results from
the pilot project.
