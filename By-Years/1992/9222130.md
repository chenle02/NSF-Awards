The research to be carried out is based on radio spectroscopy of the gas in
galaxies and is aimed at extending the Tully-Fisher relationship to determine
the distance to galaxies, and to use this information to study the departures
from the Hubble flow around the rich cluster cores of superclusters. This will
enable one to determine the dynamics of cluster formation. Observations will
also be made of absorption of the 21-cm line through the Magellanic Clouds in
order to determine certain physical characteristics of the gas in these objects.
