9321274 Hites The objective of this award is to obtain more comprehensive
knowledge than is now available regarding the major sources of chlorinated
dibenzo-p-dioxin contaminants of air, water and soil. The global deposition of
these compounds that has been estimated to date from analyses of air, sediment
and soil is significantly higher than has been determined to be possible by
summation of discharges from known sources. The investigator plans on resolving
the disparity in this respect by global collection of samples of soil and
sediment, analysis of these samples and determination of their significance in
establishing a better mass balance than is now known regarding the disparity
between deposition from known sources and the presence of these compounds in
soil and sediments. Considerable effort is now being made to displace the use of
many useful chlorinated chemical compounds from use as a step toward removing or
reducing the presence of polychlorinated dibenzo-p- dioxins and dibenzofurans
from lakes, soils and vegetation. The expected result of this project is better
knowledge regarding the presence, dispersion and flux of these compounds as a
step toward determining the extent to which additional control over their
sources is necessary. This in turn is expected to provide the basis for any
improvements in processes for reducing or eliminating the emission of these
compounds into the atmosphere. ***
