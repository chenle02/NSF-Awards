L-infinity variational problems are problems where one seeks to find the
maximum (or minimum) of a functional that is an expression involving the
pointwise behavior of a function and its gradient. The study of such problems
has become very active recently and this project will support the study of a
number of important open questions in the area. A particular interest is the
relationship between minimizers of the variational problems and solutions of the
corresponding Aronsson equation. Other questions include the uniqueness and
regularity of solutions of the Aronsson equations and the characterization of
the principal eigenvalue of the infinity-Laplacian operator. These variational
problems are not only interesting mathematically but arise in a number of
different areas of applications. These include the determination of optimal
radiation treatments in chemotherapy, in image analysis and reconstruction and
in determining winning strategies in certain types of games. The results
obtained under this research will help describe the mathematical models of these
applications. This is a collaborative award with Dr Changyou Wang of the
University of Kentucky.
