This project initiates a collaborative effort between the Federal University of
ABC (UFABC), Santo Andre, Brazil and the University of Missouri, Columbia, USA,
in the area of peptide nanostructures as active materials and molecular
templates for organic electronics. The collaborator from Brazil is an expert in
the area of supramolecular chemistry, in particular, in the synthesis of peptide
and other bio-inspired functionalized nanostructures. The US investigator is
experienced in the area of fundamental optical and electrical studies of
organic/polymeric semiconductors. This international collaboration between
scientists having complementary expertise aims at the synthesis of new
functionalized peptide-based nanostructures (PNS) with conducting polymers (CP)
such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). These nanostructures may be utilized in
electronic devices such as field-effect transistors (FETs) to probe the
interface properties of peptide-based semiconductor/insulator (dielectric)
films. By combining optical spectroscopy with charge transport measurements, the
nature of charge transport including piezoelectric effects in PNS-CP based FETs
will be explored. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative work could be a
stepping stone for expanding the research effort into large-area bio-inspired
nanotechnology. The project will provide opportunities for educational and
outreach activities. A graduate student will work with graduate students from
Brazil, enhancing mobility and transferability of skills. The project will also
be integrated with existing community outreach activities at the University of
Missouri that involve innovative teaching and public policy initiatives.
