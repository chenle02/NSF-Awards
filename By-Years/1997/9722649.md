The Milagro experiment consists of a huge tank of water. High energy gamma rays
or photons produce bursts of light in the water which are detected. The
energies, rates and origins of these gamma rays give information on the
formation of galaxies. The experiment will also look for gamma rays associated
with the interactions between a black hole and its surroundings. This group is
responsible for the electronics which reads out the signals from the detector.
They are also building an enclosure to protect the detector against lightening
strikes.
