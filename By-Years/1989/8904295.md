PI's will study the distribution, stratigraphic correlation, chemistry and
paleotectonic setting of extensive Late Ordovician K-bentonite beds in the
eastern midcontinent. Work will focus on the central and southern Appalachians
where previous studies indicate the Rocklandian Deicke and Millbrig K-bentonites
are widespread. Establishing the correlation of these beds will define several
Ordovician chronostratigraphic surfaces extending from the Mississippi Valley
across the Michigan Basin and Cincinnati Arch and into the Appalachian Basin.
These beds will provide regional time lines for facies correlation from platform
carbonates and silliciclastics in the interior of the craton through ramp and
slope carbonate deposits to both deep-water and redbed facies of the eastern
Valley and Ridge. Chemical data will be evaluated according to current
petrotecotnic models to interpret the tectonic setting of the source volcanoes.
Results will be combined with lithostratigraphic and biostratigraphic
information to produce regional chronostratigraphic, isopach and isochemical
maps of the principal Ordovician K-bentonite beds in North America.
