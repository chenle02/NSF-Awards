The proposal requests funding for some of expenses to permit the PI to accept
Swiss financial assistance for the performance of experimental research at the
Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland. The research concerns solar powered
chemical reactors for the formation of nitrides from carbothermic reduction of
the corresponding oxide under a nitrogen atmosphere. Among candidate materials
of commercial importance are AIN, Si3N4, TaN, TiN, and ZrN. Reactions for the
formation of these compounds occur at high temperatures, hence require high
quality heat sources. Solar-powered reactions would lead to considerable energy
savings. As many of these processes will be studied as time allows.
