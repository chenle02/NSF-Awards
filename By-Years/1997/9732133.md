9732133&lt;br/&gt;Havey&lt;br/&gt;This work consists of a series of experimental
studies to determine both energy positions and transition matrix elements for
alkali atoms. Energy values will be determined from the locations of the
scattering resonances and matrix elements from the locations of the zeros in the
weak-field amplitude for scattering of light from the atoms. &lt;br/&gt;
