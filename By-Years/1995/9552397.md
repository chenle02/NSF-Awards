This project funds a new networked multimedia computer and audiovisual equipment
for use by undergraduates in order to link and reform the undergraduate
component in two independent language research labs. This new equipment involves
high-end satellite work stations with CD-ROM and multimedia capacities in each
lab, to be centralized in one new interdisciplinary Cognitive Studies
undergraduate research laboratory/computer room. The project assists labs in
developing innovative methods of involving undergraduates in hands-on scientific
(hypothesis-testing) lab experiences that they can integrate with the
theoretical study of linguistics. A larger number of undergraduates can be
integrated in a sustained research experience, providing a model formal
mechanism through the university's recently established Cognitive Studies
program for undergraduate interaction and sharing of resources across labs. In
addition, the project introduces and integrates a third research group, Adult
Second Language Acquisition. Several new courses are being planned on the basis
of the new lab improvement. Demonstration materials regarding language knowledge
and organization, including multimedia learning modules, available on-line, are
being developed and integrated in new and existing courses.
