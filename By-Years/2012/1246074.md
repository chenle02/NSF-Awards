The Principal Investigator (PI) will investigate the role played by Alfvén waves
in heating the solar chromosphere and corona, as well as in excitation of
atmospheric oscillations in these layers. To this end, he will pursue a
comprehensive study of the generation, propagation, and dissipation of Alfvén
waves in the solar chromosphere and corona. The PI will use numerical codes to
simulate linear and nonlinear Alfvén and Alfvén-like waves in the solar
atmosphere (specifically, transverse and torsional waves within solar magnetic
flux tubes) with multidimensional magnetic field geometries. The PI will test
these results against available observational data and will develop a
theoretical basis for interpretation of the future observations expected from
the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST) and the current observations from
the European GREGOR telescope. Through this investigation, the PI hopes to
identify the principal energy sources of the solar atmosphere and the basic
physical processes responsible for creating the heliosphere.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These research results will be widely disseminated through
the PI's project website, journal publications, and special sessions at major
science conferences. The PI will enhance graduate and undergraduate education by
directly involving undergraduate and PhD graduate students in this project, and
by incorporating this research into existing graduate and undergraduate courses
in astrophysics and solar physics. The PI will create demonstrations featuring
science results from this effort for a new planetarium located on the campus of
the University of Texas at Arlington, reaching out to thousands of K-12 students
and large public groups who visit the campus planetarium each year. In addition,
all of the PI's computer codes, demonstrations, and preprints will be made
available at the project website for other interested researchers and educators
to download.
