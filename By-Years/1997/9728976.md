This grant provides funds for research on Yuma, the language of the Quechan
Indians. The project has two parts: (i) the translation and analysis of Yuma
texts collected by A.M. Halpern in the 1970s, and (ii) the compilation of a
dictionary of Yuma, which will involve supplementing an existing 3476-item
database with data from Halpern's texts and with field work by the Principal
Investigator. One result of this project will be a volume of texts with
translations and analysis. This will be a useful database for the study of Yuma
syntax and discourse, as well as an invaluable addition to the library of
recorded Quechan literature. Another result of the project will be a dictionary
of Yuma. This dictionary will fill a longstanding gap in the Yuman linguistic
literature; it will also provide data for comparative purposes and, since it
will represent the speech of three generations of speakers during a century of
upheaval, it will provide a database for the study of language change.
