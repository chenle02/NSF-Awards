Polypeptides will be synthesized as "fuzzy rods" and "star rods". Fuzzy rods
have a stiff backbone but many flexible sidechains. They are the largest, most
rigid materials known to form liquid crystals in solution and upon heating. This
plus a narrow size distribution makes them ideally suited to establish the flow
characteristics of molten rods, which is one objective. The versatile sidechain
chemistry can also lead to completely new materials. For example, crosslinking
of the liquid crystals will yield covalent fuzzy rod networks, leading to
oriented polymeric aerogels. Star rods made by attaching several fuzzy rods to a
central core exhibit unusual structures in both solution and melt. They are not
really rigid, but the arms are nearly so. More uniform arm distribution is a
major objective of the research. Star rods will elucidate important features of
polymer solutions, such as the approach to semidilute conditions in rods. They
will also contribute to the understanding of molten rods. This almost completely
ignored macromolecular architecture may also facilitate production of molecular
level composites, nonlinear optical materials, biaxially oriented films, and
perhaps micromotors, materials with automatic temperature compensation, or
optical switches.
