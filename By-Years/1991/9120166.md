Theory of Magnetic Materials - The goal of this project is to investigate the
energy levels, wave functions, and derived properties of electrons in solids
from two points of view. Density functional theory is the basis for most current
calculations of the electronic structure of solids from a single-particle point
of view. Development of improved computational techniques is proposed, which are
then to be applied to a range of systems of special interest, including
transition metals and high-Tc superconductors. The alternate viewpoint concerns
systems in which the electron-electron interaction is strong, so that the
single- electron picture is inadequate for description of the electronic
behavior. This project proposes to find and interpret exact solutions of the
many-body problem on finite clusters, and subsequently generalize these result
to larger systems. %%% The electronic structure of solids determines virtually
all of their physical properties. This proposal seeks to extend our ability to
calculate and describe this structure in two ways. The most commonly used
technique for determining electronic structure will be improved to allow their
application to systems which are currently intractable. Secondly, a class of
materials which are very resistent to any conventional description (called
"strongly correlated") will be treated by finding the structure of very; small
clusters of these very difficult materials, and using these cluster results as a
basis for determining the properties of the corresponding bulk materials.
