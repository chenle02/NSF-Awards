The disposal of household garbage entails both resource and environmental costs,
but most residents in the United States still pay no fee per bag for garbage
collection. A few communities around the country now charge a price per bag, but
not enough is known to estimate household demand for the collection and
recycling of garbage as function of price, household income, and demographic
variable. The purpose of this project is to collect the necessary data to
estimate statistically the household demand for garbage collection and
recycling. A new data set will be assembled from almost 200 cities covering a
three year period. This research will allow municipal officials to more
accurately predict the change in demand for disposal services that would result
from a change in the price per bag charged for garbage collection.
