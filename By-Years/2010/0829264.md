The ability to explore the material behavior on the nanoscale is of primary
importance to future miniaturization research (i.e. the design and fabrication
of micro- and nano-scale devices). In fact, a common thread linking many
important application areas is the need to quantitatively characterize material
behavior on the nanoscale (e.g. multi-layer films for engineering applications,
engineered biomaterials, and studies of cell membrane mechanics). The objective
of the proposed research is to study inherent measurement nonlinearities that
often cause research scientist to misinterpret the results of dynamic
nanoindentation tests. Broadly speaking, the proposed efforts examine some of
the most prevalent problems that confound current measurement data in an effort
to provide nonlinear corrections that will greatly improve the reported
measurement results.
