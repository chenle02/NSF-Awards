Award Number: 9453606 Five colleges of the City University of New York
(Brooklyn College, College of Staten Island, City College, Hunter College and
Lehman College) together with New York University, are part of the New York
Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation; formed to restructure the
preparation of prospective teachers of grades K to 12. The Collaborative goal is
to increase the number of college graduates entering science and mathematics
teaching at all academic levels, and better equip them for teaching these
subject areas to New York's culturally, ethnically, economically and
linguistically diverse population. New links are being created: on the college
campus, between education and liberal arts faculties, and among the various
science and mathematics faculties; in each borough, between colleges and school
districts; in the university community, among various colleges; and city-wide,
between all participants and local science-rich institutions and museums. The
Collaborative is engaged in six interrelated clusters of activities, including:
1) developing new approaches to teaching and assessing science and mathematics
in college courses, so that prospective teachers themselves experience learning
in ways envisioned by national reform efforts, and become familiar with
exemplary curriculum resources; 2) establishing a new program for middle school
teachers; 3) developing new training materials with special emphasis on design
of curriculum units which reflect collaboration among faculty of varied
disciplines and school teachers, and that utilize the urban context; 4)
providing student support and career development, including follow-up of first
year teachers and internships in settings such as college tutoring centers,
school classrooms, and local science museums; 5) recruiting promising students
into teaching; and 6) developing exemplary field sites for student teachers.
