0216348&lt;br/&gt;Mandayam&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks support for
the acquisition of a portable, large-scale visualization system in order to
improve the state-of-the art in nondestructive evaluation (NDE) processes. In
particular, the project will employ virtual reality technology
for:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(a) Defect characterization of NDE
signals&lt;br/&gt;(b) Virtual prototyping of NDE
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves a collaborative effort among
the following constituencies:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(a) Faculty and
technicians&lt;br/&gt;(b) Undergraduate and graduate students&lt;br/&gt;(c)
Industrial affiliates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the project is to create
procedures for rapid deployment of VR&lt;br/&gt;technology in the NDE industry.
This research project supports and enhances existing collaborative research
activity at Rowan University's NDE laboratory and a local NDE research &amp;
development company.&lt;br/&gt;
