The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
implementation of a disruptive technology that can transform the landscape of
energy storage. This project aims to combine millions of copper wire used to
transport electricity with energy storage technologies that are typically
expensive, large, or heavy. This approach has many value generating applications
in the aerospace, automotive, energy, defense, and IT industries. In the event
of a power shortage in a data center or server room, websites or cloud services
are at risk of going offline. By combining energy storage with copper wires,
this project would ensure that these services stay online during a shortage and
will maximize space in server rooms by removing backup batteries enabling the
companies to offer more services. This same technology could cut the weight
soldiers carry during military operations, reduce the cost of energy, improve
the output of electric vehicles or wind turbines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
I-Corps project will further develop a cable-based-supercapacitor (CSC)
technology. The CSC will simultaneously store and transport electricity. This is
accomplished by a novel method of growing high aspect ratio nano-whiskers on the
surface of copper cable/fibers which greatly increases the surface area. This
increase in surface area provides highly enhanced energy storage capability to
the CSC. A proof-of-concept device has demonstrated the CSC's function and
durability in potential commercial applications.
