The National Academy of Sciences convened a national convocation (conference)
for May 10-12 entitled Reinventing Schools: The Technology Is Now. This
convocation had the intended purpose of focusing national attention on two
areas: the impact of information technologies on children and the ways in which
schools need to change to remain vital in the lives of children. This meeting
was a first step in building public awareness among parents, educators, policy
makers, and other stake holders that change is necessary. Participants in the
convocation included 700 attendees drawn from students, educators and
educational reformers, elected officials, technology experts, business and
management experts, and popular personalities such as science fiction writers
and explorers. The outcomes of the conference included proceedings and a
multimedia CD-ROM which are being distributed to sponsors and others including
5000 educational reform leader, teachers, professional societies, government
officials, vendors, businesses, scientists, parents and students. The cost for
this convocation is shared by the National Research Council (40%), federal
agencies (40%), and computer companies and foundations (20%).
