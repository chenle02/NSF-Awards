This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at Indiana University,
Bloomington to help introduce computer-aided instruction into their curriculum
which should provide the physical setting required for an intellectual advance
in their teaching. Three projects will be completed which are aimed at
increasing the effectiveness of teaching biology to undergraduates. These three
projects are aimed at three different levels: introductory courses for non-
majors, intermediate level courses for majors, and advanced courses for majors.
In the advanced courses for majors, computer-aided data acquisition and analysis
will be introduced into the laboratory. The other two levels represent a
significant departure from the standard methods for biology teaching. In the
presentation of material any science course, one is constrained to describe the
material in a sequential manner, first one topic, then the next. Textbooks are
also constrained to this linear presentation. However, the material that is
discussed is interrelated, such that earlier and later portions of the course,
and indeed, of the curriculum, are interwoven. It is a major hurdle for students
to grasp the connections; yet, it is these connections which help students gain
a real understanding of the body of scientific knowledge. In order to help
students see these connections, the biology department will introduce into their
courses a computer lab, in which students will have access to a non-sequentially
linked information base constructed in the hypertext environment of Hypercard
for the Macintosh. Access to this system will provide students with the facility
to explore the relationships of various lecture and laboratory topics, and there
by illuminate the connections. It is believed that this will surmount one of the
major difficulties in understanding biological material. The grantee institution
is matching this NSF award with funds from non-Federal sources.
