The University of South Alabama in consortium with Vanderbilt University and
the University of Alabama, Birmingham, will work with the 11 regional inservice
centers to integrate the use of hypermedia into the education of preservice
teachers. The regional inservice centers are associated with the teacher
education institutions in the state. Vanderbilt University will be responsible
for initial faculty orientation and training in the use of hypermedia and
interactive videodisc technology to provide a context for the integration of
mathematics content and pedagogy in the education of elementary school
mathematics teachers. The purposes of the project are to develop a prototypical
model of interactive laser videodisc instruction for mathematics teacher
education, to disseminate this model and sample material, and to determine the
effectiveness of the use of interactive laser videodisc instruction in the
mathematics education curriculum of eleven of Alabama teacher education
programs. Of particular interest is the diversity of the student populations in
the sample the will be part of the intensive study of the effects of the use of
the technology. Two historically black institutions are in the group and one is
included in the intensive sample. The videodiscs that will the basis for the
intervention were produced by a team at Vanderbilt University with a prior NSF
grant, Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice... This project will have
state wide impact and will be a model of collaboration between universities and
schools within a state. At the same time, the project will allow a large scale
evaluation of the Vanderbilt materials. The project will have impact on both the
faculty of the eleven institution and on the perservice teachers that are in the
programs at the universities. There will be 50 faculty and 1,100 preservice
teachers involved in the project. In addition, the regional center will work
with experienced teachers in each region to assess the use of such technology in
teacher enhancement. The number of experienced teachers reached will be
approximately 165, 15 per site. Each regional center has responsibility for
state sponsored teacher enhancement activities. This gives a natural opportunity
to expand the use of the materials.
