9401074 Adams Adams will continue his work on the representation theory of real
reductive Lie groups, with particular focus on the representation correspondence
arising from real reductive dual pairs, generalizing recent work on complex
groups and the dual pairs (O(p,q),Sp(2n,R) with p+q=2n+1. He will also
investigate questions arising in connection with Arthur's conjectures. The
theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie,
has been one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the
mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the
representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact up on mathematics
itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon the oretical
physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics. ***
