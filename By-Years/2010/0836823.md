Shape analysis is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Object recognition
requires comparison of two shapes and determination of similarity. The challenge
is that an object?s shape may vary due to articulations, non-rigid deformations,
or natural variations between different instances of objects from the same
class. It is important to understand how to represent shape, how to match shape
allowing for deformation, and how to learn the types of variations that can
occur for a particular class of objec5ts. The PI has a number of new approaches
to shape matching and has been applying them to the construction of devices for
plant species identification. The system can be used to monitor distribution or
discover new species. Shape analysis has a wide range of additional
applications, from military ones to medical ones. The PI will use the funds to
develop new collaborations in statistical models of shape.
