Arabidopsis thaliana is a weed, a member of the mustard family. In contrast to
other plants which have been characterized at the molecular level, Arabidopsis
has a small genome, very little repetitive DNA, primarily single copy genes and
a relatively short life cycle. Thus, for a plant, it is ideally suited for
genetic and molecular studies. Two independent projects are proposed here, both
aimed toward an understanding of the genetic processes of the flowering plant
Arabidopsis thaliana. The first project involves development and use of a
genetic selection for trans-acting regulatory mutations that reduce or eliminate
expression from one or both of two different embryo-specific gene promoters.
When such mutations are obtained they will be studied both at the genetic and
molecular level. The second project is the study of a series of Arabidopsis
mutations that cause homeotic transformations of floral organs. These studies
involve the genetic characterization of mutations that are already known,
isolation of new mutations, and molecular cloning of one or more of the genes
responsible for these mutations. The goal of the first project is to understand
the mechanism of tissue specific gene expression and the second to understand
pattern formation in morphogenesis at a molecular level. Plants offer unique
advantages for understanding the genetically imprinted program of development
which leads to a mature organism but such studies cannot be done in most plants
because of genome complexity and size. Arabidopsis as are experimental system
offers the advantages of plants without the disadvantages. The successful
completion of these projects by Dr. Meyerowitz and his associates could not only
produce significant information but provide an experimental system equalled only
by Drosophila melanograster for the exploration of developmental genetics.
