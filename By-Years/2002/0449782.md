This is a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project. The PI will develop
a unified understanding of how convective and meso-scale processes feedback on
larger time and space scales in the tropics and subtropics. She will show how
horizontal and vertical variations in diabatic heating associated with
precipitating systems in the subtropics interact with the large-scale
circulation. The central hypothesis is that the role of precipitating systems in
the large-scale circulation is dependent on the convective activity and degree
of baroclinicity of the environment, but that regardless of classification,
precipitating systems in aggregate play an active role in the large-scale
circulation of the subtropics. Long-term measurements of storms and storm
structure are essential to better understand the upscale feedbacks of
precipitating systems. Radar measurements will be taken during the course of the
project. The educational objective of this project is to use observational
research to enhance the learning experience of undergraduate students, who
directly participate in it. Graduate students will participate in the research.
