9627895 Marone The PIs propose to study the frictional properties of simulated
faults under the temperatures, pressures, and fluid conditions that exist within
the nucleation region of large earthquakes. This experimental program will focus
on the rate at which faults strengthen with time, the physical and chemical
processes that cause fault healing and lithification in fault gouge, and the
rate/state friction constitutive properties under hydrothermal conditions. The
experiments will be conducted at pressures, temperatures and fluid conditions
simulating the upper 10 to 15 km of the earth's crust. ***
