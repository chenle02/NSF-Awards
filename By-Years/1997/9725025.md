9725025 Tully During this planning grant, the Film Arts Foundation will draft a
script and develop prototype examples of animation for a one-hour television
program that will provide viewers with insight into the large-scale organization
of the Universe. These materials will be developed and tested in collaboration
with advisors. The program will present, in a manner accessible to the lay
public, the work that the PI, Brent Tully, and other astronomers have done on
mapping the universe and will present current knowledge about the formation of
this structure. The principals in the planning phase will be Brent Tully,
scientific director; Thomas Lucas, producer/director; Jonathan Grupper, writer;
and Edward Shaya, computer animator. They will work with a twelve-member
advisory committee of astronomers working at research universities, informal
educators from four major planetaria, and science educators.
