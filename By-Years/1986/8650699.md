In this joint project of the Chemical and Civil Engineering Departments at West
Virginia Institute of Technology, a high performance liquid chromatograph is
being used by undergraduates to perform experiments in Bioengineering,
Biotechnology and Sanitary Engineering. Students are gaining experience with
state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation in the increasingly important
interdisciplinary areas involving the biological sciences and engineering.
