The objective of this collaborative US-Turkish pilot research project is to
investigate the use of Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) obtained from
demolition waste as a substitute for natural aggregate (NA) for the production
of new concrete. The topic has been studied for many decades; however, very
little progress has been made toward the widespread use of RCA in good-quality
concrete for new structures. The research team is uniquely qualified to conduct
the bilateral cooperative research and consists of experts in Recycled Concrete
Construction Materials at CUNY City College (CCNY) and Structural Engineering at
Istanbul Technical University (ITU). Experimental facilities needed to study
materials at the micro-scale are at CCNY while facilities for full-scale macro-
scale structural testing are at ITU.

This project brings together researchers from the US and Turkey and will include
reciprocal visits by the two US and two Turkish PIs to each other's laboratories
as well as a three month graduate student exchange during the 12 month project.
This close working environment will expose individuals in both teams to very
different cultural and scientific environments and foster closer relations
between US and Turkish researchers. CCNY is a Minority Serving Institution (and
Hispanic Serving Institution) and the exposure of STEM students at CCNY to
researchers from Turkey and vice versa will be immensely valuable to promoting
cultural understanding in two of the world's greatest cities. Also both New York
City and Istanbul have unique urban infrastructure construction markets. Working
with recycled concrete aggregate producers and manufacturers of structural
concrete (Ready Mix companies or batching facilities at construction sites) in
these two markets will provide a unique opportunity to develop solutions across
a wide spectrum of real-life conditions and constraints.
