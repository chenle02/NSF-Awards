This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In general, it is possible to form
a question by 'moving' a wh-phrase like "who‚Äù or "which boy" out of a seemingly
arbitrary number of clauses, as in "Who did Allie say that Amy saw?", "Who did
Alicia hear that Allie said that Amy saw?", and so on. In these questions, "who"
is the logical object of "saw" yet appears at the beginning of the sentence.
However, there are certain syntactic environments, commonly called 'islands,' in
which question formation is not possible. A question like "Who did the book by
delight everyone?"--whose intended meaning is 'who is the person such that the
book by that person delighted everyone'--sounds unnatural to speakers of
English, suggesting that it is not a possible question despite having a
reasonable meaning. Some linguists have claimed that these constraints disappear
when the offending structure is elided, such as in a sentence like "Amy said
that the book by someone delighted everyone, but I don't remember who". Such
sentences sound a bit more natural to speakers of English, but their status
isn't entirely clear. This dissertation project will advance linguistic theory
by using recent experimental techniques to ascertain whether such sentences are
grammatical. In advancing the field, this project will also support education
and diversity by training an undergraduate research assistant in these
experimental techniques, scientific thinking, and statistical
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using behavioral methods, this doctoral
dissertation project probes the link between speakers' reported judgments and
their sensitivity to structure in questions with and without ellipsis. The goal
is to determine whether the same principles apply to dependencies involving
ellipsis as those that do not, with the longer term goal of identifying the
computational principles governing syntactic locality. More generally, the
project addresses the consequences of mismatches between reported acceptability
and subliminal sensitivity to structure in acceptability
judgments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
