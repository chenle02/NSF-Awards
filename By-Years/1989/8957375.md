The achievements and the promise in research of Professor Greg W. Anderson of
the University of Minnesota have been recognized in a Presidential Young
Investigator award. This award will further support the work that Dr. Anderson
has been con- ducting in number theory and the arithmetic aspects of positive-
characteristic algebraic geometry, especially the theory of Drinfeld modules.
This research is in the mathematical area of the algebraic geometry of positive
characteristic. Although the field of algebraic geometry originated with notions
of continuously varying geometric structures like lines and planes, in this
context the discrete takes over, and methods akin to those from the theory of
whole numbers are most useful. Reciprocally, the algebraic geometry of positive
characteristic is now having great influence on the Theory of Numbers, and is
finding application in Computer Science and Coding Theory.
