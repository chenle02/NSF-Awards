9509057 KOEPFLER RUI: The Role of Oyster Reefs in the Structure and Function of
Tidal Creeks Oyster reefs are present in great abundance in small tidal creek
ecosystems of the coastal southeastern United States. Oyster reefs may strongly
regulate the biological communities and the physical and chemical
characteristics of these ecosystems. This project uses a multidisciplinary,
integrated field and laboratory design to study the role of oyster reefs in
tidal creeks. A rigorous statistical design is employed to determine biological
and physical effects. This study investigates the consequences of the removal of
oyster reefs, a process that has occurred on a larger scale by human influences
in many areas of the world.
