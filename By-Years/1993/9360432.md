9360432 Harrison This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
seeks to do the research necessary to bring into existence a computer-assisted
learning (CAL) tool to supplement classroom focus on the relationship of
variable manipulation to outcome, thus making engineering problems and solutions
"come alive." Specifically, utilizing the opportunity presented by the
availability of hypertext and multimedia technologies, GRADE Corporation
proposes to research and develop (1) a set of databases of Applied Mechanics
problems, their solutions, and related attributes; (2) a design for a user
interface which will exploit the "special attributes" of the databases; and (3)
specifications for using the databases in a client or server mode. The research
will examine the feasibility of using a database of problems and solutions with
special attributes and classications to make a highly reusable computer-assisted
learning (CAL) module that is efficient and appealing to students. The research
represents an attempt to stimulate the entry of nontraditional students into
engineering by assimilating vast engineering problems and solutions resources
into one readily accessible knowledge base; at the same time, it invokes a
concept applicable to any student and to other subject areas with problem
solving objectives. ***
