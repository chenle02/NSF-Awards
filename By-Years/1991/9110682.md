When a falling liquid film flows from one horizontal tube to another below it,
its mode (droplets, jets, or a sheet) has a significant impact on the
hydrodynamics and heat transfer. There is no complete model or empirical basis
for predicting the falling-film mode, its transitions, or effects. The proposed
research is directed at understanding which physical parameters govern the mode
and its transitions, quantifying the coupling between mode and heat transfer,
and providing a complete basis for predicting mode behavior. In this
experimental program, a liquid film falls between two heated or cooled specimen
tubes in a thermally controlled environment. Measurements of film location,
thickness, and velocity, along with measurements of the surrounding vapor
temperature, pressure, velocity, and heat transfer, characterize the falling
film and its influence. Experiments are conducted with different working media,
tube diameters and spacings, and in quiescent and forced flows, with varying
heat fluxes, liquid mass flow rates, and thermodynamic conditions. Candidate
parameters are examined for their influence on transitions and hysteresis.
Coupling between the mode and heat transfer are studied, to develop a basis for
evaluating the mode and its effects.
