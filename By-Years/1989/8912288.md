In order to produce high performance and highly reliable electronic equipment,
electronics must be designed to withstand vibrational and thermal.mechanical
stresses, space radiation effects, and must be producible, reliable,
maintainable and cost effective. Thus, electronic equipment design tools must
incorporate electrical, mechanical, reliability, maintainability and logistic
engineering requirements. This requires that not only the tools for analysis and
prediction be in place, but that there are also system level design tools to
integrate the analytical and computational techniques of design with
optimization and decision support tools, all in a concurrent engineering
software environment. System level design tools will increase the productivity
and efficiency of engineers, an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Computer Aided Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) at the University of Maryland.
The Center's research theme is to promote interdisciplinary basic study in the
application and implications of advanced technologies in the engineering design
of electronic equipment. Research activities are built around four inter.
related thrust application areas: design for the life cycle, decision tools and
artificial intelligence, modeling and analyses, and measurement science. Six
industry members and one government laboratory have already joined the Center
providing $350,000 support. The University of Maryland had agreed to forego its
overhead charges (approximately $200,000 per year). In addition, there are
adequate computers, laboratory space and instruments for the proposed research
at the university. The Program Manager recommends that the University of
Maryland be awarded $50,000 each year for five (5) years for the initiation of
the CALCE Center. An additional $50,000 is being transferred this year from the
Naval Microelectronics Facility at China Lake (California) via a Military
Interdepartmental Purchase Request. Finally, $5,000 is being awarded to support
a women undergraduate research assistant. The total award for the first year is
$105,000. Near the end of each 12.month period, the Program Manager and/or
Director of the Engineering Centers Division will review of the progress of the
Center on a number of renewal criteria, including the following: (1) extent to
which university/industry interaction and collaboration is developing; (2)
extent to which the support base for the center is expanding; (3) extent to
which a robust research program is developing. If review is satisfactory, the
Program Manager will recommend support of the next period of this continuing
grant. //
