Thirty undergraduate physics faculty from the southwestern section of the
country are receiving intensive training in the application of microcomputers to
undergraduate physics laboratories. The workshop is being conducted by experts
from the university, which has an extensive program to modernize their
laboratories by equipping them with microcomputers to simplify the collection of
data and permit more advanced phenomena to be investigated. The participants are
being selected from two and four-year colleges from the region with preference
given to those from institutions servicing significant numbers of Hispanic and
native American students. During the week the participants are listening to
experts discuss and demonstrate equipment and experiments which have improved
the quality of physics laboratories. In the afternoons, the participants are
using the equipment discussed under the direction of the same experts. The
workshop is introducing the undergraduate faculty to the concept of
microcomputer based laboratories and to the data processing concepts that make
this innovation possible. They are becoming familiar with the operation of the
equipment and it is expected that they and their students are becoming better
prepared to apply microcomputers to the study of physics.
