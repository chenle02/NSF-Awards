ABSTRACT

PIs Geronimo and Woerdeman will continue their investigations into factorization
and extension problems. In particular we hope to develop a constructive proof of
the celebrated Ferguson-Lacey extension theorem and build on it using the
results we have recently obtained on the spectral factorization of positive two
variable trigonometric polynomials. We plan to investigate in more detail fast
algorithms for computing the structured matrices that arise from the two
variable trigonometric moment problem as well as study the orthogonal
polynomials that arise in this case. The PIs also plan to continue their
individual investigation into the important problems arising from quantum
computing and the asymptotics of solutions to 2nd order difference equations.

The types of structured matrices under study here arise in many problems of
practical interest such as two variable auto-regressive models and two variable
filtering. The PIs will try to recruit more undergraduate and graduate students
to help in these problems as well as give courses and lectures at conferences to
increase the impact of their efforts. In order to make the intellectual merit of
the proposal apparent the PIs will continue to publish their results in well
respected journals, and also disseminate them via the PIs' homepages, preprint
servers such as arXiv, software sharing websites, etc.
