In this research a probabilistic model or family of models is assumed and
various properties of these models are investigated. Much of the work is
concerned with comparisons or orderings of the models and the statistical
implications of these orderings. Also the problem of how to choose or specify
models is also examined. In particular, problems in tail heaviness, maximal
ancillarity and weak completeness are studied. Also tail behavior and modality
of ratios as well as ordered families of distributions are investigated.
