The traditional calculus course has been broadly criticized for emphasizing
algorithmic computations and techniques at the expense of conceptual
understanding, for an absence of realistic problems, and for decreasing student
interest in mathematics. To actively engage students in doing mathematics and
using modern computational tools, a calculus sequence with an integrated
laboratory component is being developed. The laboratory uses existing
mathematical software tools (Derive) and MS-DOS systems. Such software is
sufficiently powerful, easy to use, and affordable. Use of these mathematical
tools in the precalculus and calculus sections is increasing interest and
improving student performance.
