Model simulations of shallow cumulus clouds in the lower atmosphere demonstrate
the sensitivity of predictions of future states to the representation of these
clouds in the initial state of the atmosphere. Numerical schemes to handle these
clouds in weather and climate models have been in existence for many years, yet
new techniques continue to build upon and improve these schemes. This research
will use a mathematical tool, called Transilient Matrices, to better
characterize these clouds in the model's representation of the lower atmosphere
and in turn improve forecasts of future weather and climate states based on
these clouds. These improvements will in turn benefit society through an
improved understanding of the sensitivity of weather and climate models to the
characterization of shallow cumulus clouds in the lower atmosphere.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research seeks to test hypotheses for the
amount of cloud cover associated with shallow cumulus. One such hypothesis
relates the amount of cloud cover to the rate of cloud detrainment by a
timescale that depends on cloud size and eddy diffusivity; this scale differs
from the typical scale used in climate models by two orders of magnitude. The
expression for timescale will be tested and refined using a well established
mathematical tool known as the Transilient Matrix (TM) to output from large-eddy
simulation (LES) and observations from cloud radar. Since differences in shallow
cumulus cloud cover among various Global Climate Models (GCMs) have been
identified as major contributions to uncertainty in climate projections, this
research has the potential of improving forecasts of future climate.
