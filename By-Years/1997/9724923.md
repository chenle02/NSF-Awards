9724923 Incera This Americas Program award will fund travel and related expenses
for Dr. Vivian Incera, and Dr. Efrain Ferrer of the State University of New York
at the Fredonia campus, for a short-term visit to Mexico to plan a research
collaboration in theoretical physics with Dr. Carlos Villareal and Dr. Manuel
Torres of the Instituto de Fisica of the National Autonomous University of
Mexico (UNAM). They also plan to visit Dr. Ricardo Capovilla of the Center for
Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute (CINVESTAV)
and Dr. Jose Luis Lucio, of the Universidad de Guanajuato, two additional well-
known centers for theoretical physics in Mexico. In the past year, several areas
of common interest and complementary strengths have been identified with these
groups through electronic and telephone contacts, but it is necessary now to
discuss the details of the research problems to be studied, as well as the
strategies to be followed. The completion of this visit is likely to lead to a
long-term research collaboration with various strong groups in Mexico. ***.
