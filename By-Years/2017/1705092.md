Computing is increasingly constrained by energy both at the low end in portable
devices like cell phones and at the high end in large-scale data centers.
Therefore, reducing the energy expended in computation is one of the most
important problems facing Computer Science today. By taking computational
shortcuts such as not executing certain portions of the program or executing
them with lower accuracy, it is possible in many applications, for instance
video processing, to reduce energy requirements without substantially affecting
the quality of the output. The goal of the Capri project is to build a system
that can optimize the energy consumption of a program in these ways while
guaranteeing that the output quality stays within some bound specified by the
programmer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two major problems that must be
solved: (i) building models to characterize the output quality and energy
behavior of a program, and (ii) using these models to solve a constrained
optimization problem to determine how approximation can be used. Capri will use
state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to build program models for output
quality and energy behavior, and will employ modern non-linear optimization
algorithms to solve the constrained optimization problem. The project will
produce scalable open-loop and closed-loop control systems for optimizing
applications for energy efficiency. The project includes presenting tutorials on
information-efficient computing at conferences like Principles and Practice of
Parallel Programming (PPoPP) and High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA),
and incorporate this material into classes and make it publicly available. All
data and outputs produced by the Capri project will be made available at this
