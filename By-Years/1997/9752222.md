First semester computer science (CSI) courses are taught today using the same
instructional model as was used twenty years ago - standup lectures continue to
be the only contact between instructors and students and the primary method for
delivering instruction. Lectures limit interaction and set a lock-step pace for
the entire class. Because of the large enrollments in CSl courses, students
receive little graded feedback about their progress and many fall far behind
without realizing it. Student performance and interest drops due to their
inability to get individual problems addressed, a lack of nurturing, and a lack
of motivation. Lectures are filled with basic instruction, which allows little
time for highlighting the interesting research and exciting applications that
bring students to the CS program in the first place. We propose to address these
problems by adding a significant courseware component to CS1. Our objective is
to create a new learning environment with increased interaction, higher student
performance, greater flexibility and more feedback. We can also increase access
to CS1 instruction for non-CS majors and high school students. We have developed
a courseware package called ALECS, which consists of hypertext, graphics, voice
annotations, animations, exercises, case studies, and closed labs. We have used
ALECS to make dramatic changes in the structure of CS1. In this project, we will
extend ALECS to better support our new learning environment, add tracking and
reporting features to help us assess ALECS' impact on learning, and make it
easier for other university and high schools to adapt ALECS to their own needs.
We have already begun partnerships with several high schools. High school
teachers have been using ALECS in their classrooms and for their own training.
