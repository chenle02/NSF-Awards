The purpose of this conference is to provide a forum for an exchange of ideas
in the Division of Design and Manufacturing Systems. The conference ensures that
the individual researchers are informed about the present ongoing activities of
their colleagues. Thus, an elimination of duplication of their efforts may be
achieved and a degree of cooperation may result. An overall improvement of
efficiency of the Division would be expected. In addition, the conference
program organization allows for ample time to discuss manufacturing research in
detail with the collective research community at the meeting, with feedback and
input from the National Science Foundation. Finally, personal contacts with the
researchers in the Division should contribute to clarifying many current
problems in their work. Principal Investigators attending the conference usually
gain a one to two year lead on the information disseminated; this is the usual
time frame for materials presented at the conference to be published in journals
and other literature.
