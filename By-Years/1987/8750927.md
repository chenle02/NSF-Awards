This project is continuing and expanding an effort, begun several years ago, to
provide maintenance and repair service for chemical instrumentation at
undergraduate institutions in the southeast. The service is provided by trained
electronic personnel working from a mobile van outfitted as an electronics shop,
and includes repair, maintenance, calibration, and consultative instruction
among the offerings available. In the history of operation to date, 84
undergraduate institutions in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South
Carolina and Tennessee have been involved and over 3000 instruments have been
serviced and calibrated. It is anticipated that 50 colleges and universities and
over 5000 students will be affected each year by this project. Institutions
served include a number of colleges for minorities and women.
