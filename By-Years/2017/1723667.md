The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to treat an
enormous healthcare danger, infections caused by drug resistance bacteria. The
serious threat of drug resistant bacteria, including E. coli, MRSA and K.
pneumonia, jeopardizes the health and wellbeing on a global population.
Achievement of this development as well as commercializing the product will
provide an effective way of delivering therapeutics to multidrug resistant
bacteria infections, improving the life quality of patients worldwide. Global
healthcare will be greatly improved, benefiting society and saving lives of many
patients who currently suffer from drug resistant bacteria.

This I-Corps project will produce an effective antibacterial drug delivery
platform to combat multidrug resistant bacterial infections. Although numerous
antimicrobial drugs have been developed with therapeutic efficacy, inefficient
delivery is a significant issue due to the antibiotic resistance. An innovative
nanomedicine approach is created to encapsulate current antimicrobial drugs in
targeted nanoparticles to efficiently delivery drugs and combat the antibiotic
resistance. This advanced technology will not only improve healthcare, but also
enhance scientific and technological understanding of nanoparticle drug delivery
systems in treating antibiotic resistance bacteria infections. This drug
delivery system has great potential to advance knowledge as it may be altered to
treat many other illnesses if successful.
