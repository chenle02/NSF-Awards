Collections of thunderstorms known as mesoscale convective systems (MCS) are of
scientific interest for a variety of reasons. MCSs are a major source of
rainfall and severe weather (including lightening). In addition, they are
believed to be important to the vertical redistribution of atmospheric heating
which is important to global dynamics. Using numerical models and observational
data from already completed field programs, the Principal Investigator will
continue his research on MCSs. This includes the general dynamical/microphysical
MCS structures, the relationship between MCS structures and lightening and the
nature of the convective and mesoscale motions which impact the heat budget of
these systems and the local environment.
