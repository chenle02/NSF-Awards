Although concrete structures are subject to large numbers of load applications
during the design lives, often involving stress reversals, and concrete is known
to deteriorate both in strength and stiffness under such repeated load
applications, relatively little is known about its fatigue behavior, especially
about the damage accumulation in the low-cycle fatigue range. It is proposed to
perform a comprehensive experimental test program to fill this gap in knowledge,
by measuring the energy dissipation capacity of concrete with and without fibre
reinforcement under uni-and biaxial stress cycles. The results of this
experimental study will constitute a data base that will permit the development
of damage prediction tools and low-cycle fatigue analysis of concrete members
subjected to arbitrary load histories. The proposed research contains also an
analytical component with the objective of developing a theory to simulate
damage accumulation in concrete and to predict the fatigue life for variable-
amplitude load histories. As the Palmgren-Miner hypothesis of linear damage
accumulation is known to apply neither to metal structures nor to concrete, the
experimental data to be obtained shall serve as a basis to construct a more
accurate damage prediction model with which the remaining life of concrete
material can be determined.
