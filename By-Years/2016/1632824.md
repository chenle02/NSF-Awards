Non-technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses the food-
energy-water nexus for agriculture in the collaborating jurisdictions (PR and
SC). Experimental and computation methods will be combined to better understand
biomass deconstruction, the use of lignin for soil improvement, and to develop
separation technologies for water treatment. The anticipated outcomes will lead
to more sustainable agricultural practices, improved energy efficiency and soil
and water quality. A comprehensive suite of education and outreach activities
will provide training for K-12 teachers, research experiences for undergraduate
and graduate students, and mentoring for early career faculty. These programs
will recruit underrepresented minorities and women and broaden their
participation in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will support complementary, collaborative research between the
University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez (UPR) and the University of South Carolina
Columbia (USC) to address fundamental issues in biomass deconstruction,
catalysis, lignin, and membranes separation technology for engineering improved
agricultural sustainability. UPR will perform bottom-up design of nanostructured
catalysts for targeted transformation of biomass waste into value added
chemicals as well as the study of soil amendment using lignin. USC will focus on
the development of advanced composites and membranes to remove contaminants of
emerging concern from irrigation water.
