Nonlinear nonautonomous differential equations have attracted the attention of
many mathematicians and mathematical scientists. The description and modeling of
physical phenomena frequently involve such equations. Progress has not been easy
but topological and variational methods have been relatively successful in
yielding existence and multiplicity information regarding boundary value
problems and periodic solutions. However, progress has been much slower in our
understanding of the dynamics of such systems. Many classes of these problems
have a rather sparse literature, perhaps due to the fact that the topological
degree and variational methods usually yield little or no information on
dynamics. The proposed research will develop a unified approach to these
difficulties through the application of homotopy index theory and analytical
methods to parameter dependent skew product flows associated with the
nonautonomous differential equations,as well as topological degree, semigroup
methods, and monotone iterative techniques. Continuation methods for asymptotic
stability, existence of bounded solutions and other dynamical questions will be
developed.
