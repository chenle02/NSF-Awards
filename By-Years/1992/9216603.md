This award supports a continuing series of conferences focusing on research in
the area of several complex variables. The first meeting was held in 1979 and
has met twice every year since except when there were major meetings serving the
same purpose. Seven universities share the responsibilities of hosting the
meetings. They all have strong research traditions in several complex variables.
The meetings usually run one or two days. Emphasis is placed on supporting local
graduate students and speakers from outside the midwest region. They will
receive a major share of the funds. A small reserve will be maintained for
regional faculty who cannot provide for their own transportation or other
expenses.
