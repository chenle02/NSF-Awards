Washington State University (WSU) is the receipt of funds from the ARI Program
to replace obsolescent growth chambers for plant science research. Environmental
Growth chambers are critical components of the basic infrastructure of modern
plant biology research. As faculty expand their experimental studies,
environmental parameters must be controlled to regulate atmospheric gas levels
while investigating the effect of global atmospheric changes on plant growth,
and to produce and maintain transgenic plants while studying the mechanisms of
gene regulation. Current growth chambers are 20 years old and are experiencing
intolerable levels of mechanical and electrical failures, severely impairing the
research and training mission of the Botany Department. It is essential that
faculty and student investigators have access to modern plant growth chambers
equipped with high light intensities, humidity control, gas exchange
capabilities, and on-line computer monitoring. This award, in addition to
funding from the Murdock Charitable Trust and WSU, will be used to establish an
Environmental Plant Growth Laboratory, a high priority research initiative. The
integrated Laboratory will consist of a number of different plant growth
chambers creating an overall facility with the maximum level of flexibility for
current and future research needs. Being of sufficient size and diversity will
enable investigators to address national and international issues of plant
biology over the next two decades. Thus, this project will positively impact the
research infrastructure and training mission of WSU well into the next century.
