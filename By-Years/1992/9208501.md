This grant supports the research of Professor J. Hsia to work on problems in
number theory. Professor Hsia will continue to work on the arithmetic of
integral quadratic forms. In particular, he will work on the representation
theory of positive definite quadratic forms. He also intends to continue his
study of an Iwasawa type theory for spinor genera. This is research in the field
of number theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such
as the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest
fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely aesthetic
reasons. However, within the last half century, it has become an essential tool
in developing new algorithms for computer science and new error correcting codes
for electronics.
