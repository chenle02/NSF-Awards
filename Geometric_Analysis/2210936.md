On September 2-5, 2022, Stanford University will host a conference on recent
advances in geometric analysis, with the title `Geometric Applications of
Microlocal Analysis'. This conference will feature some of the most renowned
researchers in the interplay between geometry and partial differential equations
who will present the state of the art of the various topics covered. The
potential benefits for young researchers and researchers in nearby fields will
be central; it is expected that these researchers will discover important
techniques and perspectives. The project will support the transportation and
accommodation of speakers and participants to the conference, with emphasis on
graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty from American
universities.

Within the general field of geometric analysis, the conference will focus on
microlocal analysis, gauge theory, conformal invariants, analysis on non-compact
manifolds including the study of index theory and de Rham cohomologies as well
as wave propagation, and the study of geometric flows. These topics are chosen
because of many recent advances and numerous open frontiers, and because in
spite of many connections between them, there is sufficient distance between
these topics that collaborative projects, benefiting from different points of
view, are particularly fruitful. A key goal of the conference is to show young
researchers, such as graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior
faculty, the variety of areas in which microlocal analysis is a useful tool,
with the expectation that they might be able to start collaborative projects in
these areas. The organizers will also strive to ensure the diversity of the
participants to the maximum extent possible. The web page of the conference is

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
