Funds are awarded for support for the 26th Annual Meeting of the Northwest
Regional Developmental Biology Conference to be held Thursday through Saturday
May 6 - May 8, 1993, in the conference facilities at the University of British
Columbia, Vancouver B.C. The main theme for the conference will be transition
between developmental states. This theme will be introduced by the opening
plenary lecturer (Gerold Schubiger) and expanded upon by the symposium speakers
(George Sprague, Ry Meeks-Wagner, William Harris, and Barbara Wakamoto).
Presentations by participants will be scheduled for a poster session or one of
four platform sessions. Emphasis is on graduate student attendance and
participation, including awards for the best student platform and poster
presentations. Attendance in the range of 100-150 is expected. The award will be
used exclusively to lower the cost of room and board for the estimated 55-75
graduate students expected to attend the conference.
