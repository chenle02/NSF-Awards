Navajo Community College has proposed a comprehensive program aimed at
increasing the participation of Native Americans in science which includes (a)
the use of Navajo or other Indian scientists and engineers as career and
personal role models for youths, (b) summer teacher workshops, (c) comprehensive
evaluation, and (d) a leadership role for the college in disseminating the
fruits of its work to other native American colleges. Of particular interest in
the project is the active involvement of Indian scientists from the Lawrence
Livermore and the Los Alamos National Laboratories. In the final two years of
the project, outreach and dissemination efforts will include invitational
conferences for the contiguous reservation areas (year 3) and for all like
colleges (year 4). In the course of negotiations the project evolved from a two
(2) year effort to one that spans four (4) years. The Foundation is providing
approximately 47% of total project costs.
