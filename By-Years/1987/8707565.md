The identification and mapping of fluid infiltration pathways is absolutely
central to understanding the dewatering of regional metamorphic terranes.
Research will be conducted in the Rio Mora uplift, northern New Mexico, an area
that affords outcrops of rocks of widely varying permeabilities and,
correspondingly, different responses to fluid infiltration. The topographic and
structural relief of the area, 900-3500 m., will be utilized to map infiltration
pathways in three dimensions. Fluid migration pathways will be monitored using a
multi- disciplinary methodology: (1) the composition of coexisting ilmenite,
rutile (or magnetite), and graphite will be determined to track changing fluid
compositions during metamorphism; and (2) oxygen isotope analyses of minerals
will be used to trace fluid sources. Dynamics of the infiltration process will
be examined by using mineral inclusions in porphyroblasts to follow changes in
composition of metamorphic fluids. Results of the research should contribute to
understanding mechanisms that control the permeabilities of metamorphic rocks
and to developing a three-dimensional pattern of fluid infiltration pathways.
