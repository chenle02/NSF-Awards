The principal investigator will continue his work in probability theory in the
area of empirical processes. Essential to his quantile-uniform empirical
distribution function approach is the study of the large sample properties of
the uniform empirical process and their relationship through the probability
integral transformation to those of arbitrary real valued random variables. He
will consider problems on the studies of limit results for sums of intermediate
extreme values and records, functional laws of the iterated logarithm for
increment processes and a notion of generalized quantiles. The principal
investigator will continue his work in probability theory in the area of
empirical processes. Empirical processes theory has largely been concerned with
uniform analogues of the classical limit theorems for sums of independent random
variables, which is the foundations of mathematical statistics. The investigator
will continue to develope an approach he developed to study limit theorems for
intermediate extreme values.
