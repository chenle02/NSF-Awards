Abstract - Anantharam The purpose of this research is to develop schemes to
design communication networks and computer networks to minimize the rate of
occurrence of catastrophic events such as buffer overflow or the occurrence of
large delays. The researchers will study three avenues to determine the rate of
occurrence of such events, all of which are based on very recent ideas and
appear very promising. Two of these are simulation based methodologies and one
is analytical. The first approach is a simulation based methodology combining
ideas from the large deviations theory with the "importance sampling technique"
of simulating rare events. The second approach is a simulation based methodology
called perturbation analysis which is a recently proposed scheme to speed up the
estimation of the derivatives of performance measures with respect to
parameters. The third approach is based on a heuristic idea for giving good
analytical approximations for the time to occurrence of rare events in Markov
chains which is currently being actively developed by researchers in probability
theory, the so called "Poisson clumping heuristic".
