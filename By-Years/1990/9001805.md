This is a proposal to study mathematical models of physical phenomena arising
in the flow of compressible and turbulent gases. In particular, the principal
investigator will use analytical and numerical tools to investigate the
instability of solutions of nonlinear systems of hyperbolic equations in three
dimensions, the evolution of vortex filaments, the derivation of macroscopic
transport quantities from turbulent flows using techniques of homogenization
theory, and the properties of weak solutions of systems of equations from fluid
dynamics and plasma physics. Various types of physical phenomena involve flows
containing vortices. Everyday examples of vortices are tornadoes or the bath
water as it goes down the drain. Mathematicians study the properties of such
vortex motions by constructing simplified sets of equations that have "vortex-
like" solutions and then using analytical and numerical methods to predict how
these solutions evolve in time. The principal investigator will examine models
of vortex flows that arise in aerodynamics and plasma physics.
