The investigator proposes to study a number of interrelated topics having to do
with representation theory and harmonic analysis for reductive groups over local
fields. There are four general topics, some of which are divided up further. The
first topic concerns a strange new formula involving characters of discrete
series representations of real groups in the Hermitian symmetric case, a formula
that will no doubt be needed in order to compare the Lefschetz formula with the
Arthur-Selberg trace formula. The second topic concerns transfer factors in
various settings: inner forms, Shimura varieties, descent for twisted transfer
factors. The third topic concerns bad reduction of Shimura varieties. Currently
this has lower priority but that could change in the course of the next three
years. The fourth topic consists of five distinct but related questions about
orbital integrals for reductive groups over non-archimedean local fields.

In less technical language the investigator proposes to study a number of topics
that belong to the theory of automorphic forms, a beautiful area of mathematics
with ties to all three main branches of mathematics: algebra, analysis and
geometry. The last several decades have been exciting times for workers in this
area, one of the highlights being the essential use of automorphic forms in
Wiles's spectacular proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. The coming decades promise
many further exciting developments, and the investigator hopes to contribute to
these directly, by solving some of the questions raised in the proposal, as well
as indirectly, by helping to train young workers in this technically demanding
field.
