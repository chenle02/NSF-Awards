9505725 Bars String theory has been proposed as a unifying theory of all
interactions including gravity, and therefore as a synthesis in our
understanding of all forces. Work in string theory in the past decade has led to
significant physical insights and the development of many new techniques and
insights in mathematics. The proposed conference is the seventh in series of
international conferences on string theory which have been held almost annually.
It is likely to lead to significant advances as all the major figures in the
field will come together. The conference is being hosted this year by the
University of Southern California. ***
