The proposed work intends to clarify several important problems in condensed
matter physics. They include the dynamic and static magnetic properties of
surface adatoms at fractional through multimonolayer levels; the mechanism(s)
responsible for high temperature superconductivity, in particular the nature of
the two-dimensional antiferromagnetism of the type evidenced in the copper oxide
high Tc superconductors; the search for new high Tc superconductors; and the
nature of strong localization in one- and two-dimensional electromagnetic
systems. The research will utilize the techniques of electron spin resonance,
direct dc magnetization, weak localization, and atomic scanning and force
microscopy for application to these problems.
