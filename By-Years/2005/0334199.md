"Technology-Enhanced Learning in Science (TELS)" is designed to undertake large-
scale, collaborative applied research based on technology-enhanced, standards-
based curricula materials. The Accelerator's research projects utilize software
tools and simulations embedded in online curriculum-based activities that are
designed to teach central topics in introductory science through student inquiry
and collaboration. The curricula are being tested in numerous schools that serve
diverse student populations using sophisticated online assessment strategies.
Graduate student research studies involve nationwide collaboration with experts
in various aspects of their research, utilize a sophisticated technology
infrastructure to gather data from large numbers of students anywhere, and
incorporate advanced software technologies. This effort will guide educators and
policymakers in the implementation decisions being made daily about technology.

The products include useful research results for educational professionals,
valuable research experience for graduate students, free proven technology-based
materials, and professional development grounded in theory and built on
articulated design principles and a curriculum framework. "The Education
Accelerator" uses a collaborative style of research borrowed from the sciences
that is essential to progress toward the full use of technology in education.
This approach could well provide a model for other research centers. TELS
provides graduate training for 20 PhD students and 100 Certificate students. It
also provides professional development for 1,000 pre-service students and 500
teachers engaged in Center workshops and on-line courses.

Partners include the University of California at Berkeley, the Concord
Consortium, Arizona State University, Berkeley Public Schools, Boston
University, Cambridge Public Schools, Mills College, Mount Diablo Public
Schools, Norfolk State University, North Carolina Central University,
Pennsylvania State University, the Technion Institute of Technology, Tempe
Public Schools and Maynard Public Schools.
