Drs. Ianna and Fredrick, at the University of Virgina, will continue their
observational program to determine the distances (parallaxes), the absolute
magnitudes, and the proper motions of a select sample of relatively nearby
stars. The project has components based in both the Northern and the Southern
Hemispheres with observations obtained from telescopes located in Virginia and
in Australia. Data which are obtained from very precise measurements of the
positions, the motions, and the brightnesses of nearby stars form the basis for
the cosmic distance scale used by astronomers. The long term astrometry program
conducted by Drs. Ianna and Fredrick provides an essential contribution to this
fundamental data base.
