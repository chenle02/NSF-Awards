Under the leadership of St. Louis Community College at Florissant Valley (SLCC-
FV), the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR), and the St. Louis Area Tech-Prep
Consortium of 28 school districts partner for this project. The project focuses
on the development of a 3-D Solid Modeling (Unigraphics) course, professional
development for secondary school teachers, student enrichment and outreach
activities for high school students, and adaptation and implementation of South
Carolina ATE Gateway to Technology program.

Through the legislative and former governor's leadership and financial support
from the state of Missouri, St. Louis Community College at Florissant Valley has
already been involved in an extensive upgrade of its facilities and programs. In
the last three years the state of Missouri has awarded over $1.5 million to the
college to enhance its laboratory facilities for manufacturing related programs,
and has appropriated $2.1 million to expand the physical facilities. Scope of
the project includes developing one course at the associate's level in a
manufacturing related topic, organizing workshops and training sessions in
manufacturing related topics for high school teachers and students, and
implementing Gateway to Technology (developmental) program to improve
preparedness of SLCC-FV students for engineering and engineering technology
programs.
