This research is concerned with the connections between combinatorial group
theory and the theory of automata and formal languages. The principal
investigator will show that many combinatorial properties of groups, such as
having an automatic structure or a rational growth function, can be
characterized in terms of the corresponding Cayley group possessing a regular
spanning tree with certain additional properties. Formal language theory is the
theory of subsets of free monoids which are determined by certain kinds of
machines. This research is concerned with the interactions of formal language
theory and group theory. This work is important both in group theory and in
theoretical computer science.
