Paleolakes in closed basins are sensitive indicators of past climatic
variations. The chronology of the fluctuations in the level of a particular lake
can provide evidence of changes in local climate, while basin-wide variations
reveals past changes in the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere. One
hypothesis resulting from lake studies states that latitudinal shifts in the jet
stream and associated surface weather systems, resulting from decay of the
continental ice sheet, affected the timing of high stands of closed basin lakes
during the late Pleistocene. This project will develop lake-level chronologies
during a critical interval of the late Quaternary period for three basins in
eastern Oregon. These chronologies will be used to test hypotheses concerning
atmospheric circulation controls of regional climatic change. Chronologies will
be determined from radiocarbon dates on samples collected from shoreline
sediments. A physically based evaporation model and a water balance model will
be used to estimate the range of climatic conditions consistent with a specific
lake level. The resulting climate scenarios will be employed in a test of the
hypothesis that high lake stands were governed by the mean seasonal positions of
the jet stream over the western United States. This research will contribute to
the regional geomorphology of a region in need of additional study, and it will
further our understanding of the mechanisms that control regional climate
changes, and thus the responses of hydrological systems.
