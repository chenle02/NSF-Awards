This project is concerned with three topics in commutative algebra. The
principal investigator will study the theory of tight closures of ideals, the
theory of algebraic linkage, and the behavior of the Hilbert function of
m-primary ideals especially as it relates to the study of symbolic powers of
prime ideals and the integral closures of ideals. This award supports the study
of questions in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. This is a rapidly
developing area which impacts many areas of mathematics.
