This award will facilitate cooperation in chemistry between Professor John H.
Frederick of the University of Nevada, Reno, and the high resolution
spectroscopy group headed by Professor Keitaro Yoshihara at the Institute for
Molecular Science, Okazaki for a period of two years. The scientists will
undertake a detailed study of the photoisomerization dynamics of stilbene and
the spectroscopic analysis of cis-stilbene analogs. This system is a prototype
for many naturally occurring photoisomerization reactions, including those
associated with photosynthesis and vision. These processes typically involve
large molecules with many electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom and are
therefore very difficult to treat theoretically. To eliminate some of these
difficulties, the scientists will employ a two-fold approach: (1) focusing only
on a few of the low frequency vibrations that are pivotal in the isomerization
reactions of cis-stilbene, and (2) first studying simpler systems that display
activity in the same types of low frequency vibrations as cis-stilbene, but
which do not undergo an isomerization reaction. The goal of this collaborative
project, which involves the close interplay of experiment and theory, is to
clarify the details of the fundamental isomerization process and add insight
into the photochemical processes occurring in a variety of environments,
including biological systems (vision and photosynthesis), surface coatings, and
conductive polymers. The study of cis-trans isomerization is very important not
only because this reaction is the most fundamental chemical reaction, but also
because of its important role in photosynthesis (bacteriorhodospin) as well as
in photoreception (vision, etc.).
