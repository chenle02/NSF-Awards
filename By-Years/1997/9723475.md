Abstract An next-generation molecular graphics data representation, associated
molecular scene repository, and collaborative visualization software tools are
proposed. Collectively we refer to these components as a Molecular Interactive
Collaborative Environment (MICE). More specifically, MICE consists of: Molecular
Scene Description Language (MSDL) which uses an extension to the well
established International Union of Crystallography STAR/CIF format to fully
describe the molecular scene. Molecular Scene Gallery which collects scenes
described in MSDL and which can be queried with respect to features of the
molecular scene, and not just text-based descriptions of the molecule. Molecular
Scene Collaborative Software part of which has already been prototyped and which
allows one user to manipulate the molecular scene while other remote users look
on. Any of the remote users can take control via a console that synchronizes
user access. The molecular scene can also invoke an external application
viewable to all users participating in the collaboration.
