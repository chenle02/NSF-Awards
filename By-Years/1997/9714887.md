9714887 Oldow In circumstances where the convergence vector between two plates
is oblique to the suture, deformation is partitioned into arc-parallel (strike-
slip) and arc normal (thrust) components. The parameters controlling this
partitioning are not well known, and several models exist. This research in the
Aleutian arc takes advantage of a curved suture between plate where the vector
varies smoothly from near O (orthogonal) to near 90o (pure strike-slip) to
address some of the possible parameters. If the coupling between upper and lower
plates remains constant, increasing arc-parallel extension in the upper plate
with increasing obliquity should be observed. However, no arc-parallel extension
need occur if coupling decreases with increasing obliquity. This project will
employ GPS technology to determine translations of the islands along the
Aleutian arc and structural analysis to determine operative slip and deformation
response. Results should document partitioning of strain with increasing
obliquity, identify operative slip mechanisms and allow testing of several
hypotheses about partitioning in situation where convergent vectors are oblique
to plate margins.
