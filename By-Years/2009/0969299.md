In this project the most basic atomic fragmentation processes will be studied.
By monitoring the motion of all fragments produced in the reaction complete
information about the atomic system will be obtained. These studies directly
address one of the most fundamentally important, and yet unsolved problems in
Physics, the so-called few-body problem. Its essence is that any system with
more than two mutually interacting particles cannot be described analytically by
theory even when the initial conditions and the forces acting within the system
are precisely known. Therefore, detailed experimental data on the most basic
systems are crucially important to guide theoretical efforts in finding numeric
solutions. This work addresses systems of 3 to 5 active particles and
stringently tests theoretical models which numerically treat few-body
interactions. Understanding such simple systems is a prerequisite for describing
more complex systems on a fundamental level.

Advancing our understanding of the few-body problem, and then making the
transition from few to many particles, has far-reaching ramifications in almost
all areas of modern research. For example, modeling chemical or biological
processes requires simulating interactions involving many particles.
Understanding such reactions has major impacts on developing new chemical
compounds and on future medical applications like e.g. new cancer therapy
methods. Interactions with or within e.g. clusters, plasmas, solids, and Bose-
Einstein condensates also involve a large number of particles. For such complex
systems theoretical models developed for basic 3 to 5 particle systems can serve
as a base to provide a more detailed description. As a last example, theoretical
few-body models developed for atomic systems can be applied to elementary
particle reactions and thereby help to advance our understanding of the
underlying nuclear forces in such systems, which at present is still rather
incomplete.
