9418676 Manchester In July 1996, the Fifth International Organization of
Palaeobotany Conference (IOPC-5) will convene in Santa Barbara, California to
address the theme of floristic evolution and biogeographic interchange through
geologic time. The objectives of IOPC-5 are to: 1) encourage scientific and
professional interaction among paleobotanists from different parts of the world
studying a range of geologic times and systematic groups; 2) provide improved
opportunities for the participation of students (particularly women and U.S.
minorities) in a major international and national meeting; and 3) gain an
improved understanding of the global history of plant evolution through
comparison of data summarized from all continents for different geologic time
intervals. Support is requested to help attain these goals by: covering the
travel costs for two participants in each of eight primary symposia and
subsidizing registration costs for students, women, and U.S. minorities.
