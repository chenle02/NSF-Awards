This project will conduct a workshop of leading natural hazards and disaster
researchers to address the creation of a National Hazard Vulnerability and
Resiliency Observatory Network. The focus of this observatory network will be
vulnerability and resiliency as they relate to natural and technological hazards
and disasters, not deliberate or willful acts of terrorism.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a need for concerted
research efforts to reduce our nation's vulnerabilities to natural disasters and
to enhance resiliency. This workshop will take the initial steps toward the
development a national framework for interdisciplinary comparative research on
natural hazard vulnerability and resiliency that should be undertaken through a
national observatory network. This framework will identify the core research
themes and more specific research questions related to hazard vulnerability and
resiliency. The workshop will also identify critical data that should be
collected and organized in order to enhance and facilitate research efforts for
understanding and monitoring vulnerability and resiliency. The overall structure
of the observatory network and location of research sites will also be
addressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
