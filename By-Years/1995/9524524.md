Rivers play a critical role in global systems because they transfer materials
regionally and from land to the sea. The investigators developed a model for the
Amazon river that describes and predicts river interactions with terrestrial and
coastal systems. The model incorporates both large- and small-scale information
in a unified database (e.g. satellite imaging to biochemical parameters). In the
present research, the investigators will extend the model to the rivers of the
Pacific rim. Rivers of the Pacific rim were chosen because of their complex, but
under appreciated role in global biogeochemical cycles. The central question is:
How do these poorly- understood rivers obtain, modify and transport their
biogeochemical composition? To address the question, the PIs will 1) assemble an
international team of investigators, 2) collect, analyze and disseminate samples
and information for several Pacific rim rivers, and 3) develop a heuristic model
of the operation and importance of these rivers.
