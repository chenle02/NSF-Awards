The Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science (DIMACS)
will host a conference on the Challenges of Identifying Integer Sequences,
October 9-10, 2014 at Rutgers University in Piscataway, NJ.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will honor the contributions to the
mathematical sciences of the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS)
featuring renowned researchers reporting on the latest developments and open
conjectures attributed to the OEIS. Conference discussions will highlight the
role the database has served in assisting with developing conjectures in number
theory, algorithmic and enumerative combinatorics, combinatorial number theory,
bifurcative and other nonlinear sequences, sphere packing, and many other
mathematical fields as well as the tools necessary for identifying those
conjectures. The conference will bring these topics to a large audience, with
the express goal of making the ideas accessible to a diverse audience of
researchers and students. For more information on the conference, please visit
