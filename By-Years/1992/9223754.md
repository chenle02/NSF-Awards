Description: This project supports living expenses for a scientist from India
to participate in research at the laboratory of Dr. Bruce Geller at Oregon State
University. The Indian scientist, Dr. S.K. Babu of the Department of Dairy
Bacteriology, College of Dairy Science, Udaipur, India, is to study the
molecular mechanism of bacteriophage infections of lactic acid bacteria
Lactococcus lactis. This species of bacteria is required to make many varieties
of cheese, including the most common variety in the U.S. Dr. Babu will clone and
sequence spontaneously-occuring mutants in the gene required for bacteriophage
infection. He will make copies of the mutant genes by polymerase chain reaction.
Total chromosomal DNA from each of the spontaneous mutants in this gene will
serve as the hybridization template for the polymerase chain reaction. Scope:
This project helps a U.S. scientist who is carrying on work of significant
relevance to the U.S. industry, through participation of a qualified young
Indian scientist. It also helps the Indian scientist by his involvement in a
multifaceted research program and learning new techniques that he can implement
later in his home institute.
