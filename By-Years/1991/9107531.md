The principal investigator, together with his collaborator Marc Yor, will
continue his present lines of research into stochastic processes, particularly
Brownian motion and related processes. Attention will be focussed on problems
amenable to treatment using the tools of martingale calculus, local time and
excursion theory. Particular subjects for study are the following: interval
partitions associated with a subordinator, multiple points of Brownian motion in
dimensions 2 and 3, Tsirelson's equations in discrete time, non-canonical
decompositions of Brownian motion, the Ciesielski-Taylor identities in law,
multivariate Cauchy variables and affine decompositions of a stable variable of
index (1/2), intertwinings of Markov processes, and characterization of the
Brownian filtration. The principal investigator, together with his collaborator
Marc Yor, will continue his present lines of research into stochastic processes,
particularly Brownian motion and related processes. Attention will be focussed
on problems amenable to treatment using the tools of martingale calculus, local
time and excursion theory. Stochastic processes represent an important area of
research in probability theory.
