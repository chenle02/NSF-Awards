This project concentrates on the development, analysis, and implementation of
algorithms for computing the distributions of the eigenvalues (and functions
thereof) of the classical random matrix ensembles -- Wishart, Jacobi, and
Laguerre. The focus is on achieving high practical efficiency by exploiting the
combinatorial and algebraic properties of multivariate orthogonal polynomials as
well as utilizing structured matrix computations and dynamic programming
techniques.

This research will provide new efficient tools for using multivariate
statistical techniques in practice. Such techniques are critical in many areas
and applications, including bioinformatics, genomics (population
classification), wireless communications (network capacity optimization), and
military applications (automatic target classification).
