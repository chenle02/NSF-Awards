9322517 Gruner The objective of this US-Hungary research project, between Dr.
George Gruner of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and Dr. A.
Janossy of the Hungarian Central Research Institute for Physics, is to examine
the low temperature properties of charge density waves and conduct structural
and electronic paramagnetic resonance studies on doped fullerine compounds.
Specifically, two aspects of density wave dynamics will be explored: 1) the dc
transport under nonlinear ac excitation, and 2) the novel low temperature
dynamical behavior. Samples for the joint research will be prepared at UCLA and
characterized there by dc resistivity and magnetic susceptibility. Electron
paramagnetic resonance and magnetic field dependent transport measurements will
be carried out in Hungary. Results are expected to contribute to our fundamental
knowledge of the properties of low dimensional solids. This project in materials
research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence. ***
