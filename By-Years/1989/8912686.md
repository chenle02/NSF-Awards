The proposed work intends to explore a recently discovered phenomenon called
motional binding in confined, quasi two- dimensional electron systems and also
to study two-dimensional impurity bands in the metallic limit. The studies will
be performed on InAs accumulation and inversion layers. Motional binding plays a
role in the self-consistent screening potential and has been observed in
Shubnikov-de Haas studies. The motional binding effect is not only important in
accumulation layers for narrow-gap semiconductors, but may also be important for
use in quantum-well devices. Impurity band studies in two-dimensional InAs
allows the metallic limit to be approached more closely, where magnetic
freezeout is readily achieved.
