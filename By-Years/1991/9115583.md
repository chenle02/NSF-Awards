Recently, impressions of what may be soft-bodied animals have been discovered
in USNM collections from the Belt Supergroup in Glacier National Park. Existing
material is too scanty and poorly preserved to convincingly document that the
markings are of metazoan origin. Exploratory field work will be conducted in the
area from which the museum collections were made, in hopes of finding more
definitive specimens of these possible metazoans. If the specimens do indeed
represent metazoans, the age of the oldest known animals would be extended from
about 700 to 1400 million years.
