9727111 Burges This grant provides partial support for the costs of developing
an electronic device for monitoring the temporal progression of scour depth in
gravel stream beds. Ten devices utilizing a magnetic switch system to record the
passage of a sequence of indicator practice golf balls will eventually be built
and field tested. Scour data will be recorded on a memory chip and downloaded in
the field for future analysis. The instruments will be designed to have a useful
life of a least six months. No comparable device currently exists with which to
record the temporal progression of scour in gravel stream beds during storm
events and this design is both clever and simple enough to have a high
probability of being functional. A successful scour depth monitor will have
practical application to problems in civil engineering, sedimentology and
fisheries science. Scour data are particularly important for the engineering
design of bridges and to prediction of salmonid larval recruitment in gravel
stream beds of the western U.S. ***
