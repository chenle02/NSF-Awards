High salt in plant growth media causes ion imbalance and hyperosmotic stress. As
a consequence of these primary effects, secondary stresses such as oxidative
damage often occur. Plant responses to salt stress are very complex, and
understanding of salt tolerance mechanisms remains a formidable challenge in
agriculture as well as in basic plant biology. Halophytes are naturally salt
tolerant plants that have evolved efficient salt tolerance mechanisms. The
proposed research aims to dissect salt tolerance mechanisms in halophytes by
using the genetically tractable halophilic plant, saltcress (Thellungiella
halophila). Several orthologs of Arabidopsis genes involved in salt tolerance
will be cloned from saltcress. The cloned genes will be knocked out in saltcress
by using the technology of RNA interference. Saltcress mutants thus constructed
can be evaluated phenotypically in salt tolerance assays. The proposed studies
will help understand how halophytes tolerate salt stress.
