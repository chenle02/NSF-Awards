When people communicate, they systematically employ a diverse set of nonverbal
cues, and highlight the intended interpretation of their utterances. In face-to-
face conversation, expressive movements of the brows and head are particularly
pervasive. This project studies these facial conversational signals from the
dual perspectives of human communication and computer animation, with the goal
of realizing them effectively in spoken dialogue interfaces modeled on face-to-
face conversation. The research strategy is to categorize and document facial
conversational signals, to model their meaning and interpretation, to implement
computational systems that generate and animate these signals, and to evaluate
the contribution these systems can make to users' understanding of
agents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This specific project fits into a broader program
that uses animated agents to enhance the flexibility and accessibility of
interfaces, by improving the robustness of dialogue systems, increasing
communication bandwidth between users and computers, and supporting more
collaborative styles of interaction. The results of this project, including new
software, data and training materials, promise to lower the barriers to entry to
this research area, and add to its momentum.&lt;br/&gt;
