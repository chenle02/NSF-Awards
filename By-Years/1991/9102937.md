Abrasive Flow Machining is a finishing process utilized in several vital
industrial segments, for finish-machining of manufactured components. This work
will develop, as a first phase, the qualitative and quantitative relationships
between process parameters such as media viscosity, extrusion pressure, flow
volume and number of cycles. This will be accomplished through experimental work
and stochastic modelling, since the process is random in nature. Based on the
established relationships, an off- line optimization scheme will be developed
and tested. An on-line monitoring and computer based control system will be
implemented to improve the performance and efficiency of the process. In the
area of Abrasive Flow Machining, the United States stills holds a lead both in
technology and applications. This work will assist in maintaining this lead
while strengthening the technological base of the domestic industry. Through
improvements in process efficiency and process capability, this work will also
broaden the application base of this technique, with economic benefits to a wide
spectrum of manufacturing industries.
