Sensys Instruments Corp. will develop innovative acoustic sensor and model-based
multivariable control technology to measure and control wafer temperature and
film thickness in Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) processes, a key technology
used in semiconductor device wafer fabrication. There are currently no
commercially available sensors that can provide real-time measurements of wafer
temperature and thickness in PVD processes. This project will create an
integrated package of sensor hardware, signal processing software and control
software, adapted for PVD equipment.
