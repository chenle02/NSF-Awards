This research is developing a new approach to manufacturing test of VLSI chips.
Digital signals are treated as analog waveforms, so that logic events at
internal nodes can be understood. To do this, rise-fall and glitching
characteristics of output signals are being studied using time and frequency
domain analog signal analysis techniques. Using this approach: 1. failure
methods are being determined; 2. test generation algorithms for stuck-at faults
in combinational and sequential circuits are being investigated; 3. methods to
detect marginal chips are being explored; 4. very rapid wave pipelined testing
is being developed. A signal waveform analysis system is being designed.
