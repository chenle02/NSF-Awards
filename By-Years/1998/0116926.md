This is an SGER to do an exploratory study to assess the effects of
student/faculty collaboration through a variety of quantitative and qualitative
measures designed to determine the extent to which these interactions affect
students' learning, critical thinking skills, career choices, and persistence.
As an exploratory study, the goal is to identify characteristics that predict
which students are most likely to benefit from an undergraduate research
experience. The study will also examine different models of undergraduate
research used by faculty and determine whether some approaches are more
effective than others. Finally, the study will examine factors influencing
students' decisions of whether or not to take part in a research opportunity,
with special attention aimed at uncovering hindrances that may prevent members
of underrepresented groups from participating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
