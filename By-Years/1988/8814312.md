Ceramic triboelements are increasingly being used to solve tribological problems
under severe service conditions. The performance varies significantly, depending
strongly on operating conditions and on material, and is currently not clearly
predictable from first principles. This study will attempt to remedy this
problem and develop a quantitative relationship between wear behavior, operating
conditions, and material properties and microstructure. The wear mechanisms and
wear performance of a number of ceramic materials under dry sliding conditions
will be determined by wear measurements and high-resolution microscopy of the
worn surface and the subsurface material. The wear behavior will be correlated
with commonly measured micro-mechanical properties, such as micro-hardness and
indentation fracture toughness, and with microstructure.
