This project will develop and test a chlorophyll florescence sensor for
ecological studies. The investigators will measure chlorophyll florescence in
the oxygen A band, where atmospheric oxygen spectrally excludes incident
sunlight. A cell containing low pressure oxygen will be used as a narrow band
filter to absorb chlorophyll florescence photons at the A band line centers, and
later re-emit them for detection. This non-invasive technology has potentially
wide commercial use in agriculture and surveys of stressed vegetation.
