The investigators will determine the energy distribution of test particles
accelerated in various magnetic field reconnection geometries. This will be
achieved by integrating the particle equations of motion in specified analytic
and numerical solutions of the magnetohydrodynamic equations. From these
detailed computations, scaling laws for solar energetic particle (SEP) events
will be derived, and subsequently compared with observations from the High
Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (HESSI) satellite. The major goal of this
effort is to develop a testable model capable of explaining how and why
different reconnection configurations produce different acceleration regimes,
ranging from prompt electron acceleration to gamma-ray energies to proton
acceleration to GeV energies in large gradual flares. This work promises to
provide critical new insight on to SEP events, which are a prominent component
of Space Weather.
