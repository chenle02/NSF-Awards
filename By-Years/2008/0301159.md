This grant supports the continuation of the Core Project Office of the
International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project, an element of the
International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP). As in past years, the IGAC
CPO is funded jointly by NSF, NASA, NOAA, and DOE. &lt;br/&gt;IGAC seeks to
provide an international framework for planning and implementing essential
scientific activities in atmospheric-biospheric chemistry, particularly when
they require human, technological, or monetary resources beyond the capacity of
single nations. IGAC also seeks to serve as a vehicle for coordination of
various U.S. national programs with relevant national and regional programs
elsewhere to focus attention and resources on key problems in atmospheric-
biospheric chemistry at regional and global scales. The functions of the IGAC
Core Project Office (CPO) include: (1) administrative support for the project
leadership, (2) scientific development of the project, (3) communicating
information about the project and its scientific results to the broader
scientific and other client communities. &lt;br/&gt;
