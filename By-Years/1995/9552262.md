Morristown, TN 378136899 ILI - IP Mathematics Title: Mathematics Computer
Laboratory Through this project, a networked computer lab dedicated to college
level mathematics courses is being established. The courses include Calculus I,
II, and III and Differential Equations. The first 3 of these courses are 5
semester hours. Differential Equations is likely to change from 3 semester hours
to 4 to incorporate more linear algebra in response to changes at transfer
institutions. Graphing calculators have replaced computers on projects. They
have enabled students explore functional behavior, visualize, and program
numerical techniques. In Differential Equations, students draw by hand a
direction fields and trajectories in the x,y-phase plane for a differential
equation of the form dx/dt = f(x,y), but they will explore a number of
differential equations of this form using MacMath. In Calculus III, three-
dimensional graphing using Theorist will enable students to visualize vectors
and analytic geometry in space as well as partial derivatives. Calculus I and II
projects will focus on mathematical modeling.
