This NSF award by the Chemical and Biological Separations program supports work
by Professor Juan Santiago at Stanford University to develop highly efficient
sea and brackish water desalination (ion removal) devices. Currently, the US
faces simultaneous population growth and a decline in freshwater resources, so
that desalination will become increasingly important towards realizing
sustainable water management. However, current desalination methods suffer from
high energy and/or infrastructure costs. In an effort to develop new methods
which reduce these costs, Santiago's group is researching ion concentration
shock waves created by concentration polarization. Concentration polarization
arises when an electric field is applied across specialized membranes called ion
exchange membranes. This concentration polarization describes the creation of a
region of enriched ion concentration on one side of the membrane, and the
associated creation of a region of depleted (desalinated) ion concentration on
the opposite side of the membrane. The waves of interest are sharp, moving
interfaces which bound growing regions of ion enrichment and depletion. The
Santiago group will focus on performing controlled experiments and developing
models of key phenomena, which will be utilized to develop highly efficient
devices. The group will develop prototype desalination devices which generate
small, test-amounts of desalinated water. The group will engage undergraduate
students and incorporate material from this research into engineering curriculum
courses.
