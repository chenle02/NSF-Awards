This project will provide travel funds for locating a suitable base of operation
for the Asian summer monsoon Chemical and Climate Impact Project (ACCLIP) field
campaign. This field campaign suggests to use the NSF/NCAR research aircraft
Gulfstream V and the NASA WB-57 to characterize the Asian Summer Monsoon's (ASM)
impact on global chemistry and climate. ACCLIP is planned to take place during
July-August of 2020 with aircraft based in Japan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal
of ACCLIP is to measure the unique chemical composition, water vapor, and
aerosol content in air processed in the ASM anticyclone from a base in the
western Pacific in order to evaluate its global impact on atmospheric chemistry
and radiation. The ASM anticyclone has been shown to contain an enhanced aerosol
layer at the upper troposphere - lower stratosphere (UTLS) level - the Asian
Tropopause Aerosol Layer (ATAL). The coupling of the ATAL to the UTLS dynamical
system through deep monsoon convection in the NH summer season has the potential
to generate significant chemical and climate impacts. Potentially large black
carbon (BC) enhancements in the ATAL also may affect dynamic processes in the
region by generating in situ heating, potentially reducing
precipitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
