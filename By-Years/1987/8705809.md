This project will continue geochemical studies of lavas of known relative age
from several Hawaiian volcanoes, the eastern active zone of Iceland, and a
miocene basaltic plateau in eastern China. A major objective is to understand
the origin and evolution of interplate lavas because "hot-spot" volcanism is the
major type of volcanism which is not an obvious result of plate tectonics.
Moreover, in each of these areas there is a transition from tholeiitic to
alkalic compositions and a specific objective is to determine the cause of these
transitions in different tectonic settings. In Hawaii it is planned also to
identify and interpret geochemical variations within and between tholeiitic
shields. This is an important objective because previous results show clearly
that the plume component is most evident in the shield tholeiites, but little
information exists about the temporal evolution of these shields. The approach
will be to constrain the mineralogy and composition of source components from
study of the lavas and where present, the peridotite xenoliths. Field
relationships, major and trace element analysis of whole rocks and minerals, and
isotopic analyses (Sr, Nd, Pb) will all be used. Models will then be developed
using more complex melt segregation concepts.
