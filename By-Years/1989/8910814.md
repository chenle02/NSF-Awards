This Research Initiation Award is aimed at developing better techniques for
obtaining finite degree of freedom nonlinear models of flexible structures.
Overall, the project has three phases: experiments; signal analysis; and
modeling. The modeling phase of the project represents an application of the
theory or chaotic vibrations to the problem of nonlinear modeling.
