Loftin&lt;br/&gt;0117140&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This US-Brazil award will support
a planning visit by Dr. Loftin of Old Dominion University to travel to
Concepcion, Chile, in order to plan a collaborative research project with
Arquitecto Emillo Armstrong Delpin. The topic of this research is the
development of a prototype computing/interactive display system for a Virtual
Interactive Science Museum. The system would be made available to students via
the Education 2000 Internet Enlaces project of the Ministry of Education in
Chile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studying the development and impact of the museum on
Chilean children in public schools should offer insights on culturally and
linguistically relevant pedagogies for informal education. Other likely benefits
are the diffusion of results for use in U.S. public schools and museums,
culturally and linguistically relevant pedagogies for U.S. Latino populations,
drivers for research in the computer and information sciences and engineering,
and advances in learning science and technologies. One compelling indirect
benefit of the collaboration is the development of new strategies for
international collaboration regarding the intersection of technology - and
education-related topics.&lt;br/&gt;
