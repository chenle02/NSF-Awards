9423452 Judd Graduate student Gerald Guala, under the guidance of Prof. Walter
Judd of the University of Florida, is studying the taxonomy, phylogeny, and
ecology of two genera of grasses found in savanna regions of South America and
Africa. He is combining technologies from two modern analytical approaches:
cladistic analysis of characters to infer likely evolutionary relationships
among the species; and computer- based geographic information system (GIS)
analyses to map soil and climate measurements for individual populations onto
the cladograms of taxa. Comparisons between the two genera, Agenium in South
America and Homozeugos in Africa, are designed to reveal whether similar
climatic patterns are correlated with the sequence of speciation (cladogenetic
or splitting) events in the two groups of savanna grasses. The study is a
pioneering application of GIS methodology to the analysis of phylogenetic
patterns in two grass genera, occupying similar habitats in South America and
Africa. ***
