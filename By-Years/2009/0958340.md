This project is supporting and extending the PlanetLab research testbed.
PlanetLab is a 1000-node overlay network spanning 500 sites and 40+ countries
world-wide. It is used to evaluate new network services (e.g., peer-to-peer
networks, content distribution, scalable object location services, and adaptive
routing overlays), as well as to observe Internet activity (e.g., network
topology, routing dynamics, path latency and bandwidth, and failures
properties). In supporting PlanetLab, this project is focused on enabling the
research community to add diversity and scale to the set of available computing
and communication resources. The project is also extending PlanetLab with
improved instrumentation. Our approach is to leverage the data collection and
analysis facilities currently used to operate PlanetLab to provide more value to
PlanetLab users. There are two aspects to this. First, the project is making the
raw data collected by all tools available for public download. Of course data
can have multiple uses, and it seems likely that the same data used for
operations may be of research value to the community. Second, the project is
extending the instrumentation and related toolset to help users answer the kinds
of questions they face when developing a widely distributed network service: "Is
there something wrong with my service? If so, what is the cause, and how do I
fix it?'' Having already made the investment to build a set of efficient data
collection facilities and powerful analysis tools, the goal of the project is to
see them solve as many problems as possible.
