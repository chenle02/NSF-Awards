This award supports continuation of the Enhancing Diversity in Graduate
Education (EDGE) program. The proportion of women, especially underrepresented
minority women, in the mathematical sciences declines at each successive
academic level. In response to this problem, the EDGE Program is designed (1) to
increase the number of women PhDs in the mathematical sciences, especially those
from underrepresented groups; and (2) to place more women in visible leadership
roles in the mathematics community. The EDGE Program seeks to achieve these
goals by providing a comprehensive mentoring program that supports the academic
development and research activities of women in mathematics. The proposed
activities target women in four different groups: new PhD students, advanced PhD
students, postdocs, and junior faculty. Along with an annual summer session,
EDGE supports an annual conference, travel for research collaborations, travel
to present research, and other open-ended mentoring activities for each targeted
participant group.

This project aims to impact the mathematics community by increasing the number
of women, particularly from minority groups, who succeed in graduate programs in
the mathematical sciences; who assume leadership roles in academia, industry,
and government; and who ultimately diversify the mathematical community and
provide a sustainable increase in the pool of available "home-grown" talent.
Increased diversity in the mathematics community will ultimately strengthen U.S.
competitiveness in mathematics and science and allow people from all backgrounds
and cultures to thrive, advance, and contribute to the profession. Reducing the
gender and racial disparities among faculty in the mathematical sciences will
facilitate national efforts to increase the diversity of students enrolled in
undergraduate and graduate programs in mathematics.
