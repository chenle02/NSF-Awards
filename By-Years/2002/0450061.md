For the 17th consecutive year we are organizing the InternationalWorkshop on
Languages and Compilers for Parallel Computing. This workshop covers all aspects
of languages, compiler techniques, run-time environments, and architectures for
parallel and high-performance computing. Since 1988, the annual LCPC workshops
have provided a forum for leading researchers and practitioners to present their
latest work and to exchange ideas about future directions. The papers published
in the proceedings of the workshop have been widely cited over the years and
many of them have represented the _rst public presentation of innovative ideas.
The participation is truly international with speakers from the US, Japan and
Europe. While the workshop covers many topics, the emphasis has always been
software, e.g., compilers, languages, run-time systems, performance evaluation
for parallel systems. One of the most important aspects of this workshop is its
informal setting which allows a frank exchange of new, previously unpublished
ideas. Moreover, LCPC has also been an occasion for graduate students to meet
more senior researchers in this informal setting.
