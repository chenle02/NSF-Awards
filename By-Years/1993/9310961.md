9310961 GARDNER The U.S. JGOFS Arabian Sea Process Study affords an opportunity
to study the role of particles aggregates in oceanic biochemistry. Drs. Gardner,
Walsh, and Richardson will study the distribution, transformations, and
characteristics of particulates and aggregates in the Arabian Sea during and
between the annual monsoons in an effort to understand the relation between
environmental conditions and particles/aggregates dynamics. Production,
destruction, interconversion, and sedimentation of particulates of various sizes
are important processes in oceanic biogeochemistry and will be studied on
spatial (vertical and horizontal) and temporal (diel to seasonal) scales. This
study will contribute to our understanding of the relationship between particles
and aggregates of particles in the water column, and in combination with other
physical, chemical, and biological measurements will improve our understanding
of oceanic biogeochemical cycling.
