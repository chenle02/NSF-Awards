The Physics Faculty of Gustavus Adolphus College will develop a new junior-level
course, Experimental Modern Physics Laboratory. This course will become the
capstone laboratory in the sequence of introductory and intermediate classical
physics and electronics laboratory courses, required of all majors. The
principal goal of the new course is to provide majors with direct experience
investigating important microscopic physical phenomena at an advanced
undergraduate level using modern instrumentation and data acquisition equipment.
The focus of this project is the implementation of new and modernized
experiments in nuclear and condensed matter physics and modern optics. The
principal units to be developed are: a gamma-ray spectroscopy facility; an
alpha-particle spectroscopy facility; a condensed matter (including low
temperature) facility; and a set of modern optics experiments. In addition, four
IBM PC-XT computers will be used to control experiments and to collect and
analyse data.
