This action funds Deborah Ann Sunter of the University of California, Berkeley
to conduct a research project, entitled "Economic and environmental comparison
of residential combined heat and power systems in Japan," during the summer of
2012 at the University of Kitakyushu in Kitakyushu, Japan. The host scientist is
Professor Weijun Gao.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is an analysis of the economic
and environmental potentials of solar thermal micro combined heat and power
(CHP) systems for the residential sector in Japan. Despite the significant
economic merit of both the gas engine and fuel cell micro CHP residential
systems when introduced in Japanese homes, the environmental potential for both
systems was found to be disappointingly low. This research investigates uses of
micro CHP systems using renewable energy sources, in this case solar thermanl
energy, to more dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
