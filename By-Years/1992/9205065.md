Continental basins resulting from extension are complex, being influenced by
the style of normal faulting, reactivation of older features and local climatic
conditions. This project will examine in some detail the depositional and
structural evolution of the Great Salt Late Basin at the eastern edge of the
Basin and Range Province. The work will integrate seismic, stratigraphic and
paleoecologic data with three-dimensional basin depositional modeling in order
to produce a detailed interpretation of how this basin developed through the
Neogene. Results will add to the understanding of the interaction of tectonics,
climate and deposition in a continental extensional environment.
