This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). Topology is an area of mathematics with applications to
many fields, from the knotting of proteins and DNA to the structure of our
universe. This project concerns the topology of three- and four-dimensional
spaces, or manifolds, as well as the knotted objects they contain. To classify
manifolds, one studies relationships between them; one such relationship is that
of a branched cover. The PI will develop combinatorial and computational tools
to study branched covers of three- and four-dimensional manifolds. Using these
tools to make cutting-edge problems in the field accessible, the PI will design
subprojects for undergraduate and post-baccalaureate students with a wide
variety of mathematical backgrounds and professional goals. The educational
component of this project expands and supports the PI?s current work in programs
increasing access for women and underrepresented groups in the mathematical
sciences, and addresses COVID impacts on the mathematical pipeline by providing
support for students whose studies were disrupted. Crucial to this is the PI?s
continued leadership role in the Center for Women in Mathematics Post-
Baccalaureate Program at Smith College, as well as organization of conferences
for undergraduate student researchers. These activities broaden participation in
the field by preparing students for graduate study in the mathematical sciences.
The project explores the geography and botany problems for branched covers of
three- and four-manifolds, particularly when equipped with additional geometric
structure. The geography problem asks which manifolds arise as branched covers
of a given manifold, subject to constraints on the degree of the cover or
complexity of the branching set; the botany problem asks for a classification of
branched covering maps between a given pair of manifolds. A key strategy is the
development of combinatorial and diagrammatic methods for computing invariants
of knots and surfaces derived from branched covers of three- and four-manifolds,
respectively. Applications will include resolution of open problems in several
active areas of the field, including trisections of four-manifolds, knot
concordance, and contact topology.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
