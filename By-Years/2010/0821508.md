With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program (MRI), Krishna
Kumar and colleagues David L. Kaplan, David H. Lee, Elena V. Rybak-Akimova and
David R. Walt from Tufts University will acquire a two channel 500 MHz NMR
spectrometer with pulsed field gradients for use by multiple investigators
spanning three departments and two schools on the Medford campus of the
University. The NMR spectrometer will enable research by a diverse group of
researchers in the chemical and biological sciences ranging from
characterization of organometallic/protein complexes and cellulose polymers, to
the analysis of non-natural fluorinated peptides and post-translational
modifications of proteins that direct supramolecular self-
assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic
organic/inorganic chemistry and biochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;
