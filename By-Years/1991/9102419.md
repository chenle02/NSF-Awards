The goal of this project is the development of new miniature radio frequency
coils that will extend the application of NMR microscopy to smaller fields of
view than have previously been studied. We propose to develop new coils with
diameters as small as 10 um, which would be two orders of magnitude smaller than
those presently used. At these dimensions, traditional circuit models used to
characterize the interaction between the coil and the sample are inadequate.
Therefore, we propose to conduct a more complete theoretical analysis and
experimental validation of coil performance. This evaluation will include 1)
design and fabrication of new coil configurations, 2) electrical
characterization of coil parameters (resistance, inductance, quality factor),
and 3) verification of coil performance (signal- to-noise, image resolution) at
300 MHz. The results of this study will be new microdomain coils with enhanced
sensitivity for small imaging volumes and improved signal-to-noise.
