This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the Univrsity of California at Los Angeles acquire an
entire new integrated single crystal x-ray diffractometer and structure analysis
system, with rotating anode generator. Among the areas of chemical research that
will be enhanced by the acquisition are the following: 1. Host Molecules That
Complex and Catalyze 2. Borane Cluster Chemistry 3. Porphyrin Sponges:
Programmable Lattice Clathrates %%% Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the
most powerful analytical method for structure determination of solids. In
synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and organometallic chemistry, single
crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable tool to characterize molecular
structure. The information gained from the knowledge of the intermolecular
composition and structure helps to develop new reactions of potentially general
interest in catalysis or organic synthesis.
