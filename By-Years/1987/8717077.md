The investigator requests support for a final year of analysis of data from the
Coastal Ocean Dynamics Experiment (CODE). Funds will be included for a PhD
student in the last stage of completing his dissertation. Particular focus will
be on a study of the generation of eddy heat fluxes by cooling/warming processes
due to upwelling, and a study of instabilities leading to eddies on the
continental shelf. A third investigation will involve a study of processes
governing the evolution of the vorticity field on the continental shelf and
slope.
