Proposal Number: CTS-0217746&lt;br/&gt;Institution: U Chicago&lt;br/&gt;PI Name:
B. Lin&lt;br/&gt;Title: Diffusion, interactions and structural properties of
colloidal suspensions in one-dimensional
channels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project
is on the dynamical behavior of colloidal particles suspended in liquid confined
within a narrow channel. This arrangement provides an experimental setup to
investigate the particle transport characteristics in one-dimensional pores. It
is shown that the presence of nearby walls affects the drag on a translating
particle where interactions among particles produce non-Fickian transport within
a pore. The experiments are designed to investigate the characteristics of one-
dimensional diffusion, difficult to analyze theoretically in this complicated
geometry and in realistic applications. The goal is to obtain new information
about transport in confined geometry not anticipated from existing theories. The
proposed project will shed light on the size of the particles (relative to the
channel dimensions) for transport to be described by a one-dimensional diffusion
model.&lt;br/&gt;
