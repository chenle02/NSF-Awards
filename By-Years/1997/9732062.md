9732062 Antonio Arroyo University of Florida REU: Undergraduate Research
Experience in Design and Construction of Autonomous Robots and Machine Learning
This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports eleven
students per year in programs carried out during the summers and academic years,
for three years. The students will work on projects involving the design and
construction of autonomous robots and machine learning. After building their own
robot, the students will study, develop, and test machine learning algorithms by
implementing them in their own enhanced autonomous agent. Student participants
are recruited from institutions throughout the Southeast and Southwest with
particular effort directed at students from several of the HBCUs in the area.
REU participants will be able to maintain a web page on the project web site for
a period of two years on which to post new developments on their platforms,
after the actual REU session is over.
