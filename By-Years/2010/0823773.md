This project will support the travel of 40 US scientists and engineers to
participate in 14th World Conference in Earthquake Engineering to be held in
Beijing in China in October 12-17, 2008. This is a major forum, held every four
years, providing excellent opportunity for the exchange of scientific
information and ideas in area of earthquake engineering. The project will
provide the US researchers an opportunity to present technical papers for
dissemination of their research results, to interact with international
researchers who are working in the area of earthquake engineering, and to
participate in the post?conference technical event. With the recent occurrence
of a devastating earthquake in Chengdu area, there are likely be several
presentations in this conference about the effect of this earthquake, and this
project will also provide excellent opportunity to the US scientists to
participate in these discussions and learn from the most recent field
observations.
