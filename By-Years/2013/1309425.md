Gut microbes and the evolution of mutualism and diet in lycaenid
butterflies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most lycaenid butterflies engage in specialized
associations with ants, and while the majority of these ant-lycaenid
interactions are considered mutualistic, many are parasitic in which
caterpillars feed on ant regurgitations, ant-tended insects, or directly on ant
brood. Despite the incredible diversity of diets, life histories, and
interspecific associations among lycaenid butterflies, the evolution of diet and
resulting transitions from mutualism to parasitism within this group are not
well understood. This research investigates the taxonomic, functional and
evolutionary dimensions of the gut bacterial associations of lycaenid
butterflies in order to explore the possibility that gut microbes are implicated
in the evolution of parasitic lifestyles and carnivorous diets in this group.
This is the first study of the role of symbiotic gut microbes in determining
their hosts' associations with free-living organisms, including evolutionary
shifts from mutualism to parasitism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the guidance of
Dr. Naomi Pierce at Harvard University and Dr. Martin Kaltenpoth at the Max
Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, this project addresses several training
goals. Specific aims include the Fellow receiving training in functional
genomics methods, developing strong teaching skills, and gaining experience
applying genomics techniques to ecological and evolutionary questions.
Additionally, the Fellow will remain active in outreach activities aimed at
increasing opportunities and advancement of underrepresented students in the
greater Boston area and beyond. This research will provide novel insights into
the biology of insect-microbe associations, with potential applications to human
health, conservation, and pest management.
