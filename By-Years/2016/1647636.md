The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a novel approach to evaluate the
reliability of IC chips and electronic devices. Forced by the shrinking size and
miniaturization of electronic component and devices, products are being designed
with little margin regarding reliability and performance, and the reliability
issue has been a great challenge. Reliability must be evaluated to estimate its
real field life span, and weak link must be assessed to identify the potential
failure risk. This novel approach could indicate the potential design risk
through enhanced measurement input for full field deformation and provide better
understanding of the interaction of different materials due to coefficient of
thermal expansion miss match at elevated temperature. This innovation will
provide detailed information to identify potential failure risk and improve
design, and therefore reduce immature failure of electronic component and
devices, creating a strong value proposition for our customers.

The proposed project will develop a measurement approach to achieve simultaneous
measurements of warpage, coefficient of thermal expansion and strain on
semiconductor devises. Warpage and coefficient of thermal expansion measurement
above glass transition temperature are poorly measured due to the glassy state
of materials. This project will develop an approach for accurate measurement
using a novel image correlation technology through different media with changing
indexes of refraction. This is a critical step for measurement of IC chip
warpage and coefficient of thermal expansion through a glass viewing window at
elevated temperatures. Experiments are proposed to validate the methodology in
the application of high temperature warpage and material coefficient of thermal
expansion measurement. The goal of this project is to improve warpage
measurement resolution by 5 times, and solve material coefficient of thermal
expansion measurement issue above glass transition, and realize warpage,
coefficient of thermal expansion and strain measurement at the same time.
