9314316 Lahren Within the Sierra Nevada batholith, the Mojave-Snow Lake faults
is a right-lateral shear zone with a proposed 400 km displacement of Early
Cretaceous age. However the northward continuation of the fault is not known in
detail, but may involve oroclinal bending and slip partitioning. This
continuation will investigate selected areas in an attempt to find distinctive
geological features to define the location of the Mojave-Snow lake fault and
evaluate the importance of oroclinal folding. Results will be applicable to
regional reconstructions of the southwest and may help develop general models of
slip partitioning in magmatic arcs.
