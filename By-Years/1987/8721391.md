The Geomagnetic Reversal Time Scale is now one of the most useful and firmly
established components of chronostratigraphic correlation, at least for times
younger than mid-Jurassic. Over the past 10 years, significant extensions of
this have been made to earlier times by studying the magnetostratigraphy of
well- dated, fossiliferous strata in multiply-overlapping sections. We propose
to extend our existing studies over the next 3 years to the Precambrian-
Cambrian, Cambrian-Ordovician, Ordovician- Silurian, and the Silurian-Devonian.
Although a long-range goal of these efforts is to determine whether or not it is
possible to establish a zone-by-zone magnetostratigraphy for the entire
Paleozoic, the period boundaries are logical places to start due to the
intensive efforts of biostratigraphers searching for global boundary stratotype
sections. These boundaries often correspond to times of great evolutionary
diversification and/or extinction, and results from the proposed work could find
immediate application in measuring the isochrony of extinction and proposed
global climatic events, as well as verifying the utility of carbon-isotopic
stratigraphy.
