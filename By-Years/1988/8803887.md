This grant is for an Research Experiences For Undergraduates site for 4
students at Moravian College during the summer. The project will offer the
undergraduates an opportunity for mathematical study and research by providing
them a graduate school type experience. The Principal Investigator will
supervise a seminar throughout the entire eight weeks of the program. Initially
the seminar will introduce necessary background material, and gradually the
students will become actively involved in the seminar, giving talks on outside
readings as well as doing their own research. The student research projects have
been chosen so that they are accessible to undergraduates. The main focus of the
project is in the area of explicit reciprocity laws in algebraic number theory.
Each student's research topic will relate to this central problem but focus on a
particular aspect which may be chosen from one of the following: finite fields,
polynomials and algebraic functions in one variable over finite fields,
reciprocity maps, and explicit factorization of certain polynomials.
