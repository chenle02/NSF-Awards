The project will fund five partnerships as part of the Lowell Observatory
Navajo-Hopi Astronomy Outreach program in the 2018-19 school year. The program,
which is in its 23rd year, is beginning a collaboration with 4th-7th grade
teachers in the Kayenta Unified School District, located in the Navajo Nation of
northern Arizona. Teachers are paired with an astronomer/educator from Lowell
Observatory who regularly visits the observatory. Star parties are held in
partnership with tribal educators who present traditional knowledge, and
students visit Lowell Observatory as a culminating experience.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The curriculum uses Project Based Learning, which
education research has shown to be particularly effective with Native children.
Topics for the new units are aligned with state, national, and Navajo tribal
standards. Curriculum units will be developed, tested, and evaluated, and
successful units will be made available free to educators. Navajo and Hopi
elders and educators will be involved in this process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
