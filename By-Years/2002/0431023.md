We propose to work on several areas of theory. The first concerns game

theoretic/economic questions. The second concerns several questions about

polynomials: zero testing, MOD complexity, and learning.



The proposed research will examine a variety of open problems from

these areas. Some of the open problems are classic and well known;

others are new. The mix between known problems that are often

difficult and new problems is important. Both types of problems will,

we believe, advance our understanding of these important questions.



The first questions concern mainly non-cooperative games as well as

fair division problems. These problems have often been studied for

years, but only recently have researchers looked closely at their

computational complexity. It seems clear that the interface between

game theory and economic problems with complexity theory has

tremendous potential.



The second questions concern mainly classic problems from the

foundations of complexity theory. They include the power of polynomial

under various complexity restrictions and certain learning

problems. The problems are important for two reasons. They are

important for their own sake. Further, their solution or even partial

solution is likely to yield new insights and potentially new

techniques. These could then be used to further our understanding of

other problems in other parts of theory.



Intellectual Merit: Games and economic problems are extremely

challenging. This is especially true for non-zero sum games. Their

complex structure raises many important fundamental questions. We

expect to learn a great deal from the study of these important

problems. This is also true for the more classic questions concerning

polynomials. The questions of testing, mod behavior, and learning are

difficult problems. Some have been challenging open problems for

decades. We believe that any progress on these problems will require

us to use old methods in new ways and to invent new methods.



Broader Impact: The impact of the proposed research into games

and economic problems is clear. Progress on the computational aspects

of economic problems has a clear impact on society. As commerce

becomes more digital, it is clear that any better understanding of games

and economic problems will have impact on a very broad community.



The work on polynomials also will have a broad impact. Some of the

most fundamental theory questions would be effected by progress on any

of the proposed research. The impact would be far beyond the theory

community that studies these questions. It could effect other fields

like: cryptography, learning theory, and fundamental parts of

mathematics.
