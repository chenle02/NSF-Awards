This award provides support to purchase an optical table with an assortment of
accessories to provide accurate vision measurements, a laser scanning system
with computer interface to serve as the structured light source, and a computer
graphics terminal which supports Structural Design Research Corporation's
software to serve as the Computer-Aided Design part description. The integration
of this equipment into an unified computer-aided inspection system will greatly
enhance an existing NSF project.
