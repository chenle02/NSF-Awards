This workshop addresses high-performance input/output architectures, which is a
critical computer-system architectural challenge of the next decade. The focus
is on identifying the input/output bottlenecks and potential methods for
overcoming them. The workshop places a special emphasis on disk array
organizations as the vehicle through which high performance is achieved. The
workshop brings together, for the first time, experts from across the whole
spectrum of technologies needed for high-performance input/output. This include
representatives from disk device, array, and controller vendors, as well as
mainframe and supercomputer architects, and producers of high speed networks and
operating systems. Improvement in input/output is essential as the computational
speed of computers grows. Due to a lack of breakthrough in input/output
technologies, parallelism in input/output is the logical solution to the
problem. This workshop addresses this challenge in matching the input/output
rate through parallel processing and the computational speeds of high-
performance workstations and supercoputers that will appear in the 1990's.
Support is highly recommended.
