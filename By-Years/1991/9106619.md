It is proposed an experimental study on the electrostatic atomization of
aerosols with controlled size distribution in the range between 0.05 to several
microns. The objective is to determine the conditions required for
monodispersity, establish the scaling law for particle change and mass, and
identify the fundamental mechanisms. It is expected that a representative set of
experimental data will be obtained in an unexplored region of electrostatic
spraying. Physical insights and possible concepts for the development of the
electrospray technology are targeted. The results from this project may be of
use in analytical chemistry, cluster physics, materials processing and
electronics fabrication.
