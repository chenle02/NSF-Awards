Object-oriented software development has emerged from research labs to have
signficant effect on computer science. Undergraduate students exposed to object-
oriented concepts have a richer set of design models to use than do those
acquainted only with functional decomposition techniques. The program is
teaching these concepts to select undergraduate faculty, thus increasing the
number of students who benefit from exposure to object-oriented principles. The
primary teaching method is hands-on experimentation with Smalltalk/V, an
excellent vehicle for exploratory programming. Projects are being supplemented
with discussions on wider issues, such as object-oriented analysis and design,
other object-oriented languages, and issues in teaching these concepts to
undergraduates. Participants take Smalltalk/V back to their home institutions
both for use in a larger project, and as an aid to spreading knowledge about
object-oriented techniques to their colleagues. A spring follow-up session
provides an opportunity for the group to discuss their projects, as well as
their experiences with using this material in their classes.
