This project promotes active real-world student experience in designing
experiments, selection of data acquisition equipment, as well as data collection
and analysis. Specifically, the project will purchase data acquisition boards (A
to D) and laptop computers. This portable hardware can then be interfaced with
currently available sensors and other data acquisition equipment to permit data
acquisition in the field. This extension into field experiments will enhance the
students' learning and provide a much more challenging and enjoyable experience
by allowing experiments which are of greater sophistication and complexity than
those which can be performed within the current laboratory facility.
