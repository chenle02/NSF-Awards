Proposal: DMS-9970151 Principal Investigator: Alexei G. Poltoratski

Abstract: Poltoratski's research will focus on a variety of questions related to
the boundary behavior of Cauchy-Stieltjes integrals. The project consists of
three parts. The first part concentrates on problems in complex function theory.
Specifically, the PI plans to study the interaction between singular and
nonsingular components of Cauchy integrals. The second part of the project is
devoted to applications in quantum dynamics and Anderson localization, some of
the most interesting areas involving mathematical models of modern solid state
physics. The objective of the third part of the project is to complement the
well-developed theory of contractive operators in Hilbert spaces with a deeper
understanding of the structure of so-called almost unitary operators.

Complex function theory is one of the most classical parts of modern
mathematics, yet at the same time is one of its most rapidly expanding and
developing fields. The present stage of its development features many promising
new applications to various areas of mathematics and physics. Among the
cornerstones of complex function theory is the integral formula named after the
famous French mathematician Augustin Cauchy. The importance of this formula lies
in the fact that most analytic functions of one complex variable can be defined
as or represented by Cauchy integrals. Poltoratski plans to study various
properties of functions defined via Cauchy integrals near the boundaries of
their domains, where the precise behavior of such functions is subtle and
difficult to comprehend. The results will then be applied to several other
central topics in mathematics, as well as to quantum dynamics. The application
to quantum dynamics will deal with mathematical models of wave propagation. A
conjecture made by the Nobel laureate P. Anderson about the behavior of waves in
disordered media has made this an area of intensive research activity in recent
years. Despite this flurry of activity, wave propagation in disordered media is
not completely understood, especially in spacial dimensions greater than one.
New information about this phenomenon could be highly relevant to a host of
problems in physics and engineering.
