They will study solid surfaces and thin metal films using LEED, AES, XPS, and
angle, energy- and spin-resolved photoemission with the objectives being the
determination of atomic arrangements and electronic properties. The three stated
objectives in the research are 1) the eptaxial growth and quantitative
characterization of metastable phases of the elements; 2) the characterization
of the phenomena of relaxation and reconstruction of cystalsurfaces including a
systematic study of silicon (111) surfaces and their reaction with group III and
V elements; the development of a new computer program for the calculation of
LEED intensities for the investigation of complex surface phases that are too
complicated for studies with presently available programs.
