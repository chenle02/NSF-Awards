The AI and Robotics research communities have benefitted from collaborations
over the past several decades. However, the recent acceleration in the
development of new algorithmic techniques in both fields and new hardware in
robotics provide many opportunities for high-impact collaborations. The PIs are
requesting funds to take advantage of this opportunity by holding the first of
what is expected to be a series of meetings to encourage collaboration between
these two communities. The first meeting will be held at the most important AI
conference, AAAI-2015, in Austin TX. There will be events that bring some of the
most accomplished researchers from Robotics to AAAI and also events that will be
exciting school children and undergraduate students.
