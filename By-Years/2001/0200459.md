A four day workshop in Algebraic Geometry is planned, focusing on the training
of graduate students and junior faculty. The format will emphasize participants
working together in small groups led by mentors. The workshop is designed to
engage students and junior faculty in related areas of algebraic geometry
focusing on stacks and perhaps including computational algebraic geometry. The
working groups will organize around problems and topics within these subfields.
Senior faculty will give plenary lectures to set the general direction. The
expected composition of the workshop is approximately 60 graduate students, 15
junior faculty, and 8 senior faculty.

Algebraic geometry is the study of the relationship between algebraic properties
of polynomial equations and the geometry of their solution sets. During the past
century, algebraic geometry has been applied repeatedly to a wide range of areas
of study in pure algebra and pure geometry. More recently applications have
emerged in theoretical physics, cryptography, and engineering. The workshop is
designed to complement other forms of training received by junior algebraic
geometers, providing them the experience of actively doing research with their
peers and mentors.
