Information is passed from cell to cell in the brain by functional contacts
called synapses. The rate, pattern and precise timing of those signals represent
aspects of coding by the nerve cell that brings information to the synaptic
junction, and so is called the pre-synaptic neuron. The transmission to the
post-synaptic neuron then determines the pattern of activity of that neuron in
turn. The synaptic transmission is not perfect, but has some factor of
reliability, so that a sequence of pre-synaptic nerve impulses turnq into some
sequence of post-synaptic responses that may not be identical. This project
utilizes a preparation of an isolated slice of brain tissue from the visual
cortex, as a model system where individual neurons can be visualized under the
microscope while electrophysiologically recording their signals. Recordings are
made simultaneously from connected pairs of neurons, identified by injected
fluorescent tracers. Results will give estimates of the reliability of this
important stage of visual cortical processing, and will be important to the
current controversy about bursting and oscillating activity in areas of the
cortex. These studies will have an impact not only on visual neuroscience, but
also on general aspects of synaptic function, computational neuroscience, our
understanding of cortical organization and perception, and even on understanding
mechanisms of learning.
