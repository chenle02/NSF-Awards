This U.S.-Mexico award will support a research workshop on the topic of
numerical transport theory. The workshop, which will take place in College
Station, Texas September 1992, is being organized by Professors Paul Nelson and
Professor G. D. Allen, both of Texas A&amp;M University, and Professor Jean
Pierre Hennart of the Instituto de Investigaciones en Matematicas Aplicadas of
the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM). The primary purpose of the
workshop is to provide a venue in which experts in the field of numerical
transport theory can identify joint scientific priorities and potential research
partnerships within currently ongoing research and even lay preliminary long-
term plans for joint research projects. A significant feature of this workshop
will be the inclusion of graduate students from the U.S. and Mexico.
