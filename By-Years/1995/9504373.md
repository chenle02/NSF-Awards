9504373 Storm As a result of the worldwide emphasis in Solid State Chemistry the
first European Solid State Chemistry Gordon Conference will be held in Irsee,
Germany, 24-29 September 1995. Research scientists from six European countries,
Japan and the United States will present the broad international research effort
in Solid State Chemistry. %%% Interest in Solid State Chemistry has grown
dramatically in recent years, owing in part to the recognition of the
technological importance and scientific challenges in the study of new
materials. In the United States the advent of the Advanced Materials Processing
Program (AMPP) as a national thrust in the synthesis and processing of new
materials recognizes the important role of Solid State Chemistry in research on
materials. Owing to the interdisciplinary nature of solid state research, other
scientists are entering the field, including inorganic molecular chemists and
solid-state physicists, further intensifying the study of new solids, the
development of new ways to prepare them, and the application of appropriate
characterization methods. ***
