In this project, 15 RAFOS (SOFARS spelled backwards) floats will be deployed in
about 5 different Mediterranean Water eddies (Meddies) as they are discovered
during the French Semaphore Experiment in the vicinity of the Azores Front. The
trajectories and life histories of these 5 Meddies will be observed to learn
more about their typical translation characteristics, life expectancy, and mode
of propagation. The Semaphore Experiment has a major observational component in
1993 during which extensive Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) and Expendable
Bathythermograph (XBT) surveys will be made in the region 31.5- 36.ON,
20.5-26.OW, where a large number of historical Meddy observations were made.
these CTD and XBT casts will be used to identify the salinity and temperature
anomalies of the Meddies and will be instrumental in the design of the
deployment strategy for the floats. The long-range objectives of this study are
to understand how Mediterranean Water disperses into the North Atlantic and,
specifically, to understand the role of Meddies in the maintenance of the
Mediterranean salt tongue.//
