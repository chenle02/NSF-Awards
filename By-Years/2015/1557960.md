The Emory Department of Mathematics and Computer Science REU Site will provide
research experiences for undergraduates interested in arithmetic geometry,
combinatorics, and number theory. Organized by Ken Ono (with assistance from
rotating colleagues), the program plans to train 8-10 undergraduates annually in
the summers of 2016, 2017, and 2018. The participants will be chosen after a
nationwide search. Recruitment will target participants from underrepresented
groups as well as participants from institutions that do not offer similar STEM
research activities for undergraduates. The REU program will enable
undergraduate students to enjoy an enhanced learning experience, including
research projects and seminars. The overall goal of the Emory REU in Arithmetic
Geometry and Number Theory is to attract talented undergraduate students to
careers in the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research problems
will be accessible and cutting edge, and they will be related to analytic number
theory, elliptic curves, Galois representations, modular forms, partitions, and
quantum modular forms. These fields have implications to real world problems
involving internet security, modeling in physics and other physical sciences.
