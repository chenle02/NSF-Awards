Taboo tradeoffs have been identified in the context of a variety of
environmental and health risk policies that involve emotional, moral, or ethical
issues that are fundamentally difficult to resolve or think about. At the
extreme, people asked for their opinions in these settings may resist making
tradeoffs, for example by refusing to answer or by stating extreme values for
questions that require a balancing of costs and benefits, because a norm that is
protected or regarded as sacred is perceived as being violated. The expression
of such taboo or protected values raises the questions of how and whether it is
proper, in both a professional (analytical) and an ethical sense, to seek to
elicit certain difficult tradeoffs because people may consider they are being
asked to violate or transgress an absolute standard or rule that they have
established. This proposal uses a mixture of theory-based and experiment-based
research to examine the logic and treatment of such highly charged values. The
proposed research is designed to distinguish between the expression of tradeoffs
that truly are taboo and expressed tradeoffs that are, instead, possible to
elicit but difficult, for example because they are cognitively complex (in the
sense of involving multiple and/or disparate dimensions) or evoke a strong moral
and emotional response or encourage anticipatory regret and worry in the event
that something goes awry. The research builds on the work of the psychologists
Philip Tetlock (focusing on value conflicts and taboo tradeoffs), Jonathan Baron
(focusing on protected values), and their colleagues, proposing a three-part
investigation of (a) reasons for the apparent existence of a taboo on making
tradeoffs, (b) techniques that might usefully and appropriately be employed for
eliciting tradeoffs in such settings, and (c) factors that decision makers might
use in determining whether and how to construct and assess tradeoffs and their
implications. Benefits of the proposed two-year research effort include a more
comprehensive understanding of the concept of taboo or protected values and the
provision of additional guidance to public decision makers regarding methods for
displaying or inquiring about tradeoffs in such a way as to facilitate
responsible thought and deliberation. If successful, the end result will be
better access for citizens who seek to provide input to controversial policy
debates, more informed public decisions, and the adoption of policy alternatives
that more clearly reflect and advance citizens' underlying values.
