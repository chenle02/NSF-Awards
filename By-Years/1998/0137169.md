The physics governing the many paths of the Kuroshio will be investigated using
dynamical systems analysis of barotropic and baroclinic quasigeostrophic model
solutions. The dynamical systems tools will be used to determine the qualitative
nature of model simulations of the Kuroshio's path off the coast of Japan. A
baroclinic quasigeostrophic regional model and its adjoint will be used
comparatively with existing solutions from previous model studies. It is
expected that the bifurcation diagram will be similar between the barotropic and
baroclinic systems but that the solutions will exhibit significant baroclinic
effects. The adjoint of the baroclinic quasigeostrophic model will be used to
investigate the sensitivity of the model to different types of perturbations and
to determine the influence of assimilation of observations on the model
predictions in each different small and large meander case. The data
assimilation study will also help determine which observations predict the
transition from one state to another. In addition, this portion of the study
will help discriminate between the adequacies of different physics in different
models for representing the natural variability of the system. This study will
lead to a better understanding of the Kuroshio system off Japan, the different
physical mechanisms that generate bimodality of the Kuroshio, and it has the
potential to yield guidance towards the critical set of observations that
capture the behavior of the system.
