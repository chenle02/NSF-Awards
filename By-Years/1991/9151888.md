This project is upgrading the Physics of Music Laboratory at the University of
Rochester. To this end, the course is being changed from a 3-credit preceptorial
to a 4-credit course with full laboratory. The course is open to all students,
but 20 are selected based on their music interest and their enthusiasm for
understanding the underlying physics. With the increased laboratory emphasis,
more sophisticated individual experiments (as opposed to demonstrations) are
required. In addition, hard copy of the experimental results is stressed. so
that subsequent detailed analysis can take place. Through this project
appropriate scientific equipment is being added to the existing demonstration
equipment in the Music Lab.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from
non-federal sources.
