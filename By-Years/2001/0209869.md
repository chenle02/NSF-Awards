Mississippi State University (MSU), an NSA Center of Excellence in Information
Assurance Education (COE/IAE), will work with Jackson State University (JSU) and
the University of Kansas (KU) though a collaborative and cooperative effort to
increase these two institutions capacity in information assurance and to
strengthen the COE/IAE program at MSU. The faculty from all three institutions
will work to develop an IA curriculum at JSU and KU with an expectation that
both schools will apply for COE/IAE status during academic year
2004-2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These collaboration efforts are intended to be
beneficial to all three parties in not only developing an IA program at two
universities that currently do not have one but also in strengthening the
program at MSU by broadening its research effort, increasing minority
representation in its PhD program, and by enhancing its instructional course
content. MSU will additionally expand its IA offerings by involving the College
of Business and the College of Arts and Sciences in our research. This proposal
initiates an innovative programs that will promote student research and
publication in this area.
