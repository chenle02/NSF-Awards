This study has two main goals: 1) Determination of the age of Hf-depletions in
peridotites. A systematic study of western US peridotites is the focus of the
proposed peridotite study which will further constrain the existence through
time of this Hf depleted component. 2) Estimation of the degree and depth of
melting using the combined Nd and Hf-isotope systematics. Initial results show
that melt parameters vary consistently with major element variations. This study
will further examine the relationships between the isotopic melt parameters and
the major element variations. It will be shown that Hf and Nd isotopes can thus
be used to distinguish between models for melt generation and magma extraction.
