Wireless networks play a key role in national critical information
infrastructure. Mainly due to lack of a protected physical boundary, wireless
communications are inherently less secure than its wired counterpart. Privacy
has been ranked as the top security concern of wireless users. Inadequate
privacy protection can result in significant network information retrieval that
enables the adversaries to perform destructive denial-of-service (DoS) attacks,
or even paralyze the entire wireless networks. While confidentiality of the
message can be ensured through content encryption, it is much more challenging
to provide privacy service for wireless networks. In fact, privacy is one of the
most notable challenges looming on the horizon that threatens successful
deployment of WSN. &lt;br/&gt;In this research, we propose to design efficient
cryptographic algorithms and network security protocols that can achieve
privacy-preserving communications for both MANET and WSN. More specifically, we
plan to: (i) Develop efficient cryptographic algorithms that can achieve
unconditional privacy-preserving communications even in the presence of local
eavesdropper while reconciling communication accountability; (ii) Develop
efficient anonymous authentication schemes and protocols for secure user access
control and anonymous routing in MANET and WSN. That is, while each user is
being authenticated, the user's real identity and location will remain secret
for adversaries. (iii) Establish a scientific foundation for theoretical
characterization and quantitative measurement of privacy in secure network
communications. &lt;br/&gt;Our research is expected to have a significant impact
on personal privacy, national critical information security as well as homeland
security.&lt;br/&gt;
