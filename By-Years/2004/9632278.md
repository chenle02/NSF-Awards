The focus of this research is the development of chiral carbosilanes as
synthetic intermediates and the use of the methodology for the convergent,
enantioselective synthesis of the C1-C9 segment of doliculide. Research devoted
to the development of Si-based chiral Lewis acid catalysts will also be
conducted. With this proposal, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Amir H. Hoveyda of the Department of Chemistry at Boston
College. Professor Hoveyda will focus his work on developing new synthetic
methods, based upon the chemistry of silicon. The usefulness of the new
reactions will be demonstrated by application to the synthesis of a portion of
doliculide, a molecule which exhibits important biological properties.
