Computer systems contain software which is becoming increasingly complex.
Complex software often includes many configurable parameters or knobs that can
be adjusted to adjust performance and energy consumption. As an example, a
smartphone's settings include many on/off features and "sliders" one can adjust;
but trying all the possible combinations to improve performance and reduce
battery consumption is very time consuming. This project aims to optimize
computer systems by (1) automatically exploring many parameter combinations and
(2) helping humans see visual indications of how these parameters work and
better understand complex systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will: (1)
develop techniques to optimize storage systems, because they are the slowest
part of any computer; (2) combine features from existing optimization and
machine learning techniques; (3) improve the search for optimal settings by
deciding when to stop and restart searching as well as considering the cost of
changing system settings; (4) develop human driven visual techniques to explore
extremely large sets of option combinations to better understand them and
further direct the optimization process; and (5) evaluate all these techniques
on real world storage systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer storage systems are
so complex that no human can fully optimize them, particularly when
circumstances change. This project will help automate the optimization of
storage systems, improving their performance and energy use; advance the state
of the art in hybrid optimization and machine learning techniques; develop and
release interactive visualization systems that let humans understand, view, and
direct a search process to promising directions; train and educate graduate and
undergraduate students; and produce results that are applicable to other
computer system optimization problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's
artifacts such as software, source code, data sets, and results are part of a
system called "Spectra". These artifacts will be made public through the project
Website: https://www.filesystems.org/spectra. Results will be disseminated in
peer-reviewed publications and on arxiv.org. The data will be maintained for at
least ten years following the end of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
