Award: DMS 1710500, Principal Investigator: Bin Guo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Einstein equations from gravitational theory have a geometric interpretation
that picks out a preferred metric to determine lengths and angles on a space.
The determination of conditions for solvability of those equations has seen
recent progress and continues to pose important open problems in geometry. The
projects to be carried out include approaches to those problems through
geometric flows that deform the metric on a space in a direction that might lead
to a canonical metric, or, alternatively, might develop a singularity that
blocks progress toward such a metric.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of these
projects will study the formation of long-time and short-time singularities from
Kaehler-Ricci flow which are closely related to the analytic minimal model
program proposed by Song and Tian. The conical Kaehler-Einstein equations have
been very successful for Fano manifolds, and these projects will investigate the
existence and properties of conical canonical Kaehler metrics in algebraic
varieties and explore their applications in solving open problems in algebraic
geometry. Another line of work will study coupled systems of parabolic type
which originated from general relativity in physics. The solutions to the
coupled systems will yield Einstein vacuum metrics and shed light on the
structure of the underlying space.
