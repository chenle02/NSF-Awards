9311355 This is a project to investigate the state of the art of manufacturing
design in industry in the United States. It complements earlier studies on
design activities in Japan and Europe which are highly regarded by the
manufacturing research and development community. This is a timely effort as it
impacts critical issues of manufacturing and economic competitiveness. Further,
it will help to form the basis from which the FCCSET Advanced Manufacturing
Technology (AMT) program can build.
