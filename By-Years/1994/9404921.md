This project continues work on the development of XSB system. XSB is a system
that integrates logic programming, deductive databases and nonmonotonic
reasoning. It uses SLG resolution, a tabled evaluation strategy, to combine
Prolog's SLD and deductive databases's bottom up evaluation in a computationally
effective way. Current benchmarks show that the XSB system is significantly
faster than more traditional approaches to deductive database query evaluation,
and shows promise of being very efficient for certain types of nonmonotonic
reasoning. In the current project, the XSB implementation will be improved by;
(1) improving the underlying WAM-based engine to make it more efficient, and (2)
developing program transformation techniques to permit XSB programs to be
optimized at the source level.
