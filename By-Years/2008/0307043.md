Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-0307043&lt;br/&gt;Deckert/Allegheny
College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The kinetics of model surface reactions relevant to
the adsorption of protein molecules at surfaces are examined in this RUI
research project. With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, Professor Deckert and her undergraduate co-workers at Allegheny College
examine the kinetics and mechanisms of the adsorption of substituted thiol and
amine molecules at self assembled monolayer thin films. Using surface enhanced
Raman spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy, and
microbalance measurements, the kinetics of a series of probe reactions are
measured. Information from these measurements is then used to develop mechanisms
for these adsorption processes. The results of this work are useful for the
design of biosensor surfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many strategies have been
developed for the attachment of protein molecules to functionalized surfaces.
The kinetics of these attachment processes, and their mechanisms, are not well
understood. Professor Deckert examines model surface adsorption reactions that
mimic the protein adsorption process in order to develop a fuller understanding
of these attachment processes. Undergraduate researchers are involved in all
aspects of this research. &lt;br/&gt;
