0960148&lt;br/&gt;Backman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed instrument will allow cellular imaging
at the nanoscale with resolution and sensitivity that are much higher than what
is currently possible with optical microscopy. The instrument will combine the
state-of-the-art confocal microscope and a partial wave spectroscopy module. The
instrument will allow quantification of cellular nanoscale architecture with
sensitivity up to a few nanometers, molecular as well as structural imaging in
nearly real time. The instrument will work with live as well as fixed cells.
&lt;br/&gt;The instrumentation takes advantage of a novel optical technology,
single-cell partial-wave spectroscopic microscopy. The instrument will provide
information about cell nanoarchitecture and its relationship to molecular
events, which has not been possible to obtain before. The proposed microscope
will be a unique device that will open new directions for basic science as well
as translational research including cell biology, bioengineering and development
of novel diagnostic devices, nanotechnology, fundamental electromagnetics,
tissue engineering, and macromolecular biophysics.
