Large-scale computational problems assume increasing significance in the attempt
to obtain accurate models for electron devices. The increasing need of
supercomputing in device modeling is caused in part by the miniaturization
(submicron very large scale integration) and sophistication (the use of lattice
matched III-V compounds in optoelectronics) of electron devices. The
computational methods are numerous, including ensemble Monte Carlo simulations
based on highly sophisticated solid state theory and two-dimensional and three-
dimensional device models which take into account transient phenomena such as
ballistic (overshoot) transport. A workshop is being organized and conducted;
the participants and organizers will discuss and define the most important areas
of electron-device modeling which can profit significantly from the use of
supercomputers.
