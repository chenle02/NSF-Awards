This 4-week Summer School Workshop, the third in a series devoted to
comparisons of marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, focuses on
structured population models. Structured models explicitly link the biology of
individual to the dynamics of populations. The course will cover all three main
mathematical approaches to structured models: matrix population models, partial
differential equation models, and delay differential equation models. Structured
models have a crucial role to play in two important problems that cut across
marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. One is the response of
populations to global climate change, and the other is the difference between
marine populations and terrestrial populations. This course is designed to
examine in which way individual responses in different environments are
translated into population dynamics.
