The objective of this project is to improve the process by which equipment and
processes are designed for removing water from sludges. This will involve the
development of computer based simulation models of full-scale dewatering
facilities that will enable cost- effective design and the ability to identify
operational conditions to maximize dewatering efficiency. Theoretical approaches
will include modeling the physics of the belt filter press which involves
gravity sedimentation, cake filtration in a laterally unconfined domain
incorporating the effect of secondary consolidation or creep, cake removal
mechanisms, and belt washing efficiency. The integrated model of the belt filter
press is expected to be driven by laboratory derived relationships of sludge
porosity as functions of effective stress and permeability. These relationships
will be determined by examining specific resistance and compression-
permeability cell data. The model will be tested with data from a scale model
filter press using a reproducible suspension of kaolin. Further model testing
will be accomplished using the city of Portland's full-scale belt filter presses
to analyze the model's ability to predict dewatering characteristics of an
anaerobically digested sludge. Results of this project are expected to be used
in improvements of current practice in designing systems for dewatering sludges,
processing and management of which are approximately half the cost of wastewater
treatment.
