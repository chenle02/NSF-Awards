The origin of the Antarctic radiolarian fauna and the extent to which climate
has influenced their evolution will be investigated. To do this, the PI will
extend previous investigations to high southern latitudes to detect Cenozoic
high-latitude lineages. Also, she will investigate and document the evolutionary
processes, conduct high-resolution morphometric studies on radiolarian lineages,
and construct an integrated high-low latitude taxonomy and biostratigraphy.
