The dimensional scaling approach used successfully in elementary particle
theory is applied to problems in atomic physics. Applications already made to
bound state problems suggest that the method, like other perturbation theories,
has some potential as a quantitative tool in atomic physics. The applications
anticipated here are to problems involving the doubly excited states of He.
These states are autoionizing and the work would be the first such application
of the 1/D expansion to the continuum problem. The method has the advantage that
it treats collective motion of the particles much more easily than other
approaches. This is important for an accurate description of the excited states
of He.
