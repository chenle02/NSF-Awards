9618017 Key In this project the PI will oversee the collection of about 400
water samples to be analyzed for radiocarbon (C-14, C-13) on two meridional
sections in the western North Atlantic as an ancillary contribution to the World
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). Two hydrographic sections, along 52 deg W
and 65 deg W, to be conducted as part of the WOCE Atlantic Circulation and
Climate Experiment (ACCE), offer an opportunity to sample several stations for
the third time since the inadvertent injection of C- 14 into the ocean during
A-bomb testing. Previous sampling was done during GEOSECS (GEochemical Ocean
SECtionS) and the Transient Tracer Observations (TTO) program. Recent
discoveries have suggested more definitive ways to use these measurements to
constrain circulation models.
