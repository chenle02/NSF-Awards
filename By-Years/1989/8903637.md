This renewal award in the Organic Dynamics Program is in support of the research
of Dr. Tad Koch at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The research will
focus on captodative radicals which are stabilized through the combined effect
of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups. This effect should be
maximum with amino and carboxy substituents. The research will explore further
the 2-oxomorpholinyl free radical whose substituents are in a rigid ring which
maximizes the electronic interaction. These free radicals exist in equilibrium
with their dimers in solution and function as mild one-electron reducing agents
in a wide variety of solvents including water. Depending upon the placement of
alkyl groups, the radicals reduce stoichiometrically molecular oxygen to
hydrogen peroxide or form isolable peroxides. The long range goal of the
research is the design, preparation and use of captodative radicals. The
specific objectives are the design, synthesis and characterization of new
2-oxomorpholinyl radicals and diradicals which will either bind oxygen
reversibly, form useful peroxides or serve as crosslinking agents for
macromolecular structures. The thermal and photochemical reactivity of the
resulting peroxides will be established. The redox activity and captodative
stabilization of 2-oxomorpholinyl radicals as a function of structure and medium
will be determined. New structures with enhanced redox activity will be designed
and synthesized.
