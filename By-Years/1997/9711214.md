The effect of polymer adsorbtion on model colloid particles will be
investigated using total internal reflection microscopy (TIRM) to detect
particle dynamic interactions and small-angle light scattering (SALS) to
determine the flocculation rate. Comparison between the predictions based on the
two measurements will be made, and fundamental aspects concerning interparticle
forces will be obtained. TIRM was previously developed by the author. The TIRM
measurements in dynamic conditions will be compared to those performed with the
atomic force microscope (ATM) in equilibrium conditions. If successful, the
research will improve fundamental understanding of the van der Waals and
dispersion forces, with immediate application to evaluation of colloidal
stability and production of colloidal particles coated with polymeric
macromolecules.
