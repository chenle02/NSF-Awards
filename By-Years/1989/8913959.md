A focal plane polarimeter will be constructed for use by the William &amp; Mary
College Intermediate Energy Nuclear Physics Group at the MIT/Bates linear
accelerator facility. Specifically, the polarimeter will be used in the "100
Spectrometer (OHIPS)" for measurement of recoil proton polarization following
electron scattering. Reaction matrix elements corresponding to interference
effects will be opened to study for the first time. The first measurement will
be a new determination of the magnetic structure function of the proton. This
will provide a test of the reaction mechanism through which the neutron charge
form factor will be determined. Many other experiments are planned for this new
facility.
