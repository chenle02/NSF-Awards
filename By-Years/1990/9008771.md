The possibility of climatic warming in high-latitude zones has fueled growing
concern about prospects for widespread melting of permafrost across large areas
of the Arctic. The dynamics by which permafrost melts are not fully understood,
however. Longstanding views that held conductive heat transfer as the primary
mechanism have been challenged by new theories that hold that nonconductive heat
transfer also plays an important role in the freezing and thawing of permafrost.
This project will assess the degree to which each of these mechanisms and other
possible processes affects permafrost dynamics in a variety of settings in
central Alaska. Measurements of a variety of different soil, snow and ice,
temperature, and moisture conditions will be collected at a set of paired
permafrost and non-permafrost sites. These data will be used to analyze
relationships among these different variables and to test different models of
heat transfer within permafrost. This project will provide valuable new data on
conditions within and immediately above the soil in permafrost and non-
permafrost regions, and it will provide an effective test of competing
hypotheses regarding heat transfer mechanisms that affect the stability of
permafrost. In addition to contributing to new insights about permafrost
dynamics, this project also will make methodological contributions by testing
the efficacy of new instruments in harsh environments.
