This award provides support for the move of a living collection of Ambystoma
mexicanum, commonly called the axlotyl, from Indiana University (IU) to the
University of Kentucky (UKY). The award will also support continued operation of
the collection once the move is completed in the summer of 2005. The collection,
originally established many decades ago at IU, is a historically significant
resource that provides animals used actively and widely in biological research.
The recent and ongoing development of genome resources for the axolotl and other
closely related species is expected to foster continued interest in Ambystoma as
a powerful nonmammalian vertebrate model system. Most notably, axolotls are
studied because they are unique among vertebrates in being able to perfectly
regenerate numerous body parts. These include the spinal cord, limbs, jaw, and
tail, all of which can be regenerated at any point during embryonic, larval, and
adult life. Relocation of the collection to the UKY will consolidate the living
stock resource with genome and bioinformatics resources currently being
developed for the Ambystoma research community. The collection will not only
continue to enable traditional research areas where the axolotl is the best
vertebrate model system, it will also continue to take an active role in
facilitating use of the organism in K-12 education and public outreach efforts.
