As intelligent systems continue to become more autonomous, it is important to
imbue such systems with the types of social and moral norms that are deeply
ingrained in human cognition and behavior. Failing to abide by these norms
typically causes social reactions from humans, from blame and reprimands, in
simple cases, all the way to full-fledged legal consequences. Given the
fundamental social expectations humans have of each other, it is very likely
that they will extend and apply those to artificial agents as well. Hence,
intelligent autonomous systems will need to be endowed with computational
mechanisms that ensure their ethical behavior.

This project will develop explicit norm representations and planning algorithms
for norm-conforming behavior that will address shortcomings of previous
approaches, enabling explicit, temporally complex norm representations in
stochastic worlds that allow for systematic handling of norm conflicts in ways
that maximize the norms an agent can obey at any moment in time. In particular,
explicit norm specifications will allow for generalization across unobserved
states. In addition, it is important for systems interacting with humans to make
decisions that are transparent. To that end, the approach will enable the
generation of justifications in cases where an autonomous system is forced to
violate some norms because not all can be satisfied simultaneously. The approach
and algorithms developed will be demonstrated on a fully autonomous cleaning
robot with predefined norms in different scenarios, where conflicting norms are
applicable and the robot must determine which norms to follow and which to
suspend.
