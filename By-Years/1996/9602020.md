The project draws on a range of resources from archival materials to material
culture in order to raise larger social questions about the relationship of
consumers to technology. It argues that travelers need to understand the
historical development of transportation space in order to more effectively
intervene in the design and use of contemporary technologies. More specifically,
this project examines the cultural construction of transportation space,
focusing on auto touring and the creation of mobile space. The thesis argues
that tourists and tinkers (non-professional inventors) re-designed the
automobile to fit their own needs rather than accepting the ideologies of
mobility, technology, and gender sold by designers, manufacturers, and
advertisers. The work presents users/travelers as active participants in
industrial and mechanical design and examines modification of the car by
travelers as a form of opposition to technological authority.
