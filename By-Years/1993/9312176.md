9312176 Acrivos This three-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in
solid state chemistry between Juana Acrivos of San Jose State University and
W.Y. Liang of the Interdisciplinary Research Center in Superconductivity,
Cambridge University. The objective of their research is to determine how
electronic properties of a layer solid are controlled by intercalation.
Intercalation compounds are formed by insertion of various elements. These
compounds are used in the synthesis of LDS (low dimensional solid) conductors
and superconductors, materials for high duty batteries, catalysts, and solid
lubricants. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in the
preparation of LDS and intercalated compounds and the evaluation of their
properties through magnetic resonance techniques (NMR), diffraction techniques
and optical spectroscopy. This is complemented by the British Center's
considerable expertise in high temperature superconductivity and synthesis of
new superconductors. In this effort, the Center will supply and characterize
crystals for intercalation. The project will advance our understanding of
intercalation, an increasingly important, efficient and novel method for
synthesizing new superconductors. ***
