CTS-9416921 Cramer RPI The performance of non-linear gradient and displacement
chromatography techniques for the separation of proteins will be evaluated and
optimized. At present, the optimization of protein purification by
chromatography is mainly empirical. A multicomponent equilibrium model has been
recently developed for non-linear ion-exchange chromatography. Based on a steric
mass transport (SMA) approach, this model has good predictive capabilities. A
systematic evaluation of gradient and displacement chromatography will be
performed using the SMA approach. Representative classes of model protein
separation problems will be defined. Experiments will be conducted with
appropriate combinations of proteins, stationary phase materials and pH
conditions. Tests will be conducted with novel displacing agents, including some
unusual low MW compounds, which are inexpensive and non-toxic. The resolution
and merits of gradient and displacement chromatography will be compared. The
productivity of these techniques will be analyzed and optimized using numerical
techniques. The development of efficient ion-exchange chromatographic techniques
for process scale purification has the potential of a significant impact on
bioprocessing technology.
