9505035 Sheaff This grant provides partial support for U.S. and Eastern European
participation in the 1995 International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA)
School on Instrumentation in Elementary Particle Physics which will take place
at the Jozef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana, Slovenia, during July 3-17, 1995.
The U.S. organizer, Dr. Marleigh Sheaff of the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
will work with Dr. Peter Krizan of the Jozef Stefan Institute to prepare a
workshop agenda that includes lecture courses on state-of-the-art
instrumentation techniques in experimental elementary particle physics. These
lectures will be augmented by six laboratory courses designed to demonstrate the
material presented. Participants will include advanced graduate level students
and recent PHD researchers largely from the United States, Eastern Europe, and
Western Europe. However, representatives from the Americas, China, India and
Taiwan will also attend. The overall goal of this activity is to foster new
links among the up-coming generation of world physicists in an area that
increasingly requires international cooperation. ***
