The goal of this project is to introduce inquiry-based and problem solving
approaches into microscopy laboratories, which have traditionally been
descriptive in nature. This is accomplished by using MacIntosh IIci workstations
as part of an image analysis system in a network configuration to capture, store
and share microscopy images from living and preserved materials. Students in
courses such as Developmental Biology and Microanatomy are able to collect,
store, and share for later analysis and/or presentation, images captured from
their microscopes, and present the processed images as three dimensional
reconstructions or animations.
