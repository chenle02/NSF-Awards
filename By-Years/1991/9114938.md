Dr. Peter Connors is the Reserve Manager of the Bodega Marine Laboratory, which
is operated by the University of California at Davis and is a part of the
University of California Reserve System. Dr. Connors proposes construction of a
research greenhouse, to be dedicated to research on terrestrial plants and
plant/insect interactions of the coastal terrace. Two small temporary
greenhouses have been used by visiting investigators but the projected needs
will soon saturate the space available. In addition, a recently hired faculty
member has an active research program that requires greenhouse space. The
greenhouse planned for the Bodega Marine Laboratory is a creative expansion of
the Lab's research impact. The greenhouse will attract an increasing number of
visiting scientists and students, and will broaden the range of natural
phenomena studied at the Lab. The resulting studies of coastal plants and their
associated insects will provide important new insights into the ecology and
management of the ocean margin zone.
