The Center for the Study of Mathematics Curriculum at the University of Missouri
is organizing and hosting a series of three week-long conferences for advanced
doctoral students and recent doctoral graduates in mathematics education. The
conference activities draw upon the summer research workshops organized by most
of the Centers for Learning and Teaching, which were funded by the National
Science Foundation, and the Project NeXT seminar organized by the Mathematical
Association of America for assistant professors in mathematics. The conferences
are held in conjunction with the Park City Mathematics Institutes (PCMI) in Park
City, UT. The PCMI is organized and managed by the Institute for Advanced Study
and each summer hosts research mathematicians, mathematics doctoral students,
mathematics undergraduates, and mathematics teachers. The conferences are
supported by and would involve students and graduates from all the mathematics
CLTs; recent doctoral graduates from other universities are also recurited to
participate.
