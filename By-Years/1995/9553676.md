The project is a collaborative effort by six technical institutes, a public
land grant university, a state department of technical and adult education, and
industry representatives to develop applications for multimedia and distance
learning technologies in Electronics Engineering Technology associate degree
programs in Georgia. Forty-eight technology faculty will be trained in
multimedia applications. A Curriculum Development Team of technology faculty,
industry representatives, and instructional technology specialists will create
multimedia applications for four technical, math and physics courses in the
electronics eneineering technology program. Project objectives target curriculum
materials development, faculty enhancement, student access through distance
education, and industry involvement. Teaching/learning problems addressed by the
project include diverse academic preparation, background and learning styles of
students at technical institutes; the impracticality of time and placebound
instructional delivery for adult students, the fast-changing technology and
knowledge base in engineering technology fields, and faculty need to diversify
teaching approaches and uses of instructional technologies available in Georgia.
