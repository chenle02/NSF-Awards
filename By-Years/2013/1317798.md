Project Overview &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose to develop a normative
framework for policies of cyber warfare. They plan to conduct an investigation
into cyber warfare practices and to evaluate the extent to which current cyber
warfare conforms to basic war ethics principles underlying the Hague and Geneva
conventions including discrimination, attribution, proportionality, and
deception. For these purposes, they are partnering with the Consortium for
Emerging Technologies, Military Operations, and National Security
(CETMONS).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The
US is clearly worried about cyber attacks; other nations could inflict serious
damage to military capabilities, as well as strike physical targets and
infrastructure, with more anonymity and without placing their soldiers at risk.
In response to these prospects, the US is developing a thoughtful plan to
operate with greater safety and security in cyberspace. However, cyber warfare
also poses great challenges to just war theory, the basis for international laws
of armed conflict. This project fills an important need by investigating
tensions with the basic principles of war, helping to determine the
permissibility and policies of cyber warfare. It will provide a concise set of
normative principles that could also serve to safeguard cyberspace, which is
increasingly essential to modern life. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The results of this project will include a comprehensive
report on cyber warfare ethics, a university-level ethics course, and an edited
volume that would serve as a text for such a course. This report will identify
specific options for a coherent cyber war ethics in clear language useful for
policymakers. The PIs plan to solicit input and disseminate their research
through public workshops, one at the beginning and another at the end of the
project, as well as conference and classroom talks throughout.
