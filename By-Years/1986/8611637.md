The controlled release of macromolecules from a porous polymer carrier is an
example of diffusion through a porous medium; a complete understanding of the
behavior of these systems in not available. A microstructural approach to the
problem will be taken with the goal of elucidating the underlying physical
mechanisms which determine the rate of transport in the porous network. The
research involves a system for acquiring detailed microstructural data on the
porous polymer devices. A detailed understanding permits the formulation of
physically realistic models of the porous network; it will also provide a method
for testing preliminary hypotheses. Release studies are also conducted for
examining the kinetics of macromolecular release from the polymer devices. The
major thrust of the project is exploratory experimentation on the physical
mechanisms.
