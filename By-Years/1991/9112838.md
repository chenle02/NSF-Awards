Funds are requested for a three year Russian translation project to be organized
by the international circumpolar journal Arctic Anthropology. There is an urgent
need to disseminate the scholarship of Soviet anthropologists working in the
Euraisna Arctic and Subarctic. Since only a few Soviet scholars are sufficienty
fluent to write for English language journals, important important research
contributions are off-limits to all but a few Russian-reading North American
scholars. This project hopes to provide systematic coverage of Soviet
scholarship, publishing 5-6 papers in each volume over a three year period.
