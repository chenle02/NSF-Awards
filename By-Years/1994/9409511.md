9409511 Smith The Brookings Institution and the American Enterprises Institute
will jointly conduct a one day conference entitled "Returns to Investment in
Research " which will re-visit and examine the quantitative and qualitative
social and economic benefits to society from investment in research. This
conference will serve to assess the state of knowledge in this area as well as
to achieve an in-depth interactive discussion between academic experts and
policy leaders of the contributions of science to society. Six papers will be
commissioned and published as a result of the conference. These papers will
address key elements of the conference discussion--the impact of research and
development on economic growth/productivity, with emphasis on the role of
academic research and the results of the quantitative analysis undertaken over
the past 20 years.
