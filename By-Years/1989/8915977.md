This project is a study of sediment transport on the antarctic continental
margin in the vicinity of floating glacier tongues and restrictive fjord
environments. It is concerned with determining the importance of mid-water and
deep cold water tongues in the transport processes, and whether precise links
can be established between the observed glacial-climatic regime and the
resulting depositional record. The depositional record will be reconstructed
from a coring program and from high resolution seismic reflection profiles. The
expected (from earlier studies) thick holocene sections with pronounced internal
changes in texture and composition, will be analyzed for their implications with
respect to the responses of antarctic fjord glacier systems to holocene climate
changes. The field work will be carried out in the Antarctic Peninsula. This
research activity is submitted under the Research at Undergraduate Institutions
(RUI) program. It will prepare students for professional careers and for
graduate study through their direct involvement in the field program and in the
laboratory analyses of the core samples. The activities will also provide a
source of topics for senior theses and for laboratory projects.
