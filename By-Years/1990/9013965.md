The purpose of this research project is to attack the issues of programming and
performance evaluation of multiprocessor systems. This is done by a systematic
selection of several representative problems in the numerical as well as the
non-numerical domain and their implementation on a machine based on Inmos
Transputers. Comparison with off-the-shelf multiprocessors (e.g. Sequent and
Alliant) will be undertaken. The work will proceed with theoretical efforts in
developing highly programmable user environments as well as experimental work in
assessing the validity of the functional parallel programming approach.
