NON-TECHNICAL: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to the University of California,
San Diego is to explore an extremely innovative strategy for rapid and effective
removal of endotoxins from the bloodstream and to investigate the fundamental
principles of such a new detoxification approach. Endotoxin is an important
pathogenic trigger of sepsis, a life-threatening complication imposing a
significant healthcare burden. Emerging evidence suggests that effective
endotoxin removal is critical for successful sepsis management, which however
remains an unmet clinical need. In this project, a biomaterials-based
nanostructure, consisting of safe polymers and macrophage membranes, is proposed
to function as a toxin decoy to absorb a wide range of different endotoxins and
thus minimize their with the target cells. As an integral part of this proposed
project, the education components will be carefully carried out to contribute to
the continual growth of biomaterials science and engineering. Particular efforts
will be put on training a new generation of collaborative and skilled
researchers and educators in the field of biomaterials and
nanomedicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this award is to develop and
investigate a novel macrophage membrane-coated nanoparticle (denoted MØ-NP)
platform for endotoxin neutralization. The approach taken will be to utilize an
innovative and robust top-down strategy to transfer the entire cellular membrane
of macrophage cells onto the surface of synthetic nanoparticles. A nanoparticle
thus modified is expected to preserve the surface antigens and exhibit similar
functionalities as its source cells. In this particular project, the MØ-NP is
expected to inherit the macrophage's capabilities for binding endotoxins. To
achieve the primary goal, three specific research tasks will be pursued in the
proposed project: (i) prepare and characterize MØ-NPs; (ii) study endotoxin-
binding capabilities of MØ-NPs; and (iii) investigate endotoxin neutralization
by MØ-NPs in vitro. Further, through this project the PI will train a team of
interdisciplinary and multi-level collaborative young investigators, provide
minority students with stimulating research experience, and enhance scientific
education among K-12 students and community at large.
