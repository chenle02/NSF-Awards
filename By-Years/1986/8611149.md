This effort will investigate the feasibility of a methodology to allocate
functions to people and/or machines in manufacturing systems based upon the
requirements of the tasks to be performed and the capability of each system. The
methodology will involve a taxonomy of task characteristics and a taxonomy of
characteristics of hyman and machine systems that are used to perform those
tasks. The effort involves a cross-disciplinary approach in that it will
integrate the technical state-of-the-art in flexible manufacturing systems with
task analysis methods from the field of human factors engineering. The goal of
the effort is to integrate the literatures from these two technicl areas and
establish the feasibility of a methodology to match functional requirements with
human and/or robotic capabilities.
