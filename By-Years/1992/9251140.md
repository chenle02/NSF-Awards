This project provides a tabletop ultracentrifuge to be used in two laboratory
courses (Cell and Molecular Biology, and Introduction to Science Techniques)
which form the core of a recently revised curricula in biology and biochemistry.
The courses are designed to provide students with a foundation in the
theoretical basis of research techniques and to demonstrate that a variety of
research methods are integrated during the conduct of a scientific
investigation. This instrument will also facilitate departmental projects
involving students in independent research. Additionally, college workshops for
advanced high school students and secondary school teachers, as well as non-
major science offerings, will use this equipment.
