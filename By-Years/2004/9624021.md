9624021 Anlage The objectives are: to understand the basic nature of the
superconductor (SC) proximity effect, use this understanding to engineer
qualitatively new SC materials, and study the physics of cuprate Scs through
their microwave surface impedance (MSI). Both low-Tc and high-Tc SC materials,
in both thin-film and bulk form, will be prepared and characterized. The MSI
will be measured by two resonance techniques developed by the group. The
research should lead to our deeper understanding of low-Tc superconductivity,
the symmetry of the ground-state wavefunction of cuprate Scs, the influence of
fluctuations on the physical properties of cuprates, and a clarification of the
physical properties of the rogue electron-doped cuprate SC, as well as some
novel applications of superconductors. %%% Superconductivity is one of the many
intriguing phenomena that have come to light as scientists have explored the
realm of very low temperatures.And one of the most astonishing features has been
the "proximity effect" whereby a superconductor can sometimes induce
superconductivity in a nearby normal material. In this program, we shall conduct
experiments designed to deepen our understanding of this effect and of
superconductivity in general, and to engineer qualitatively new superconducting
materials. ***
