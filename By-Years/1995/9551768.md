The university is developing a set of microcomputer-based laboratory modules and
establishing an undergraduate laboratory for teaching operating systems and
data-communications concepts. The laboratory consists of 11 IBM-compatible
microcomputers that provide rapidly reconfigurable platforms for experimental
topologies. A collection of laboratory exercises gives students hands-on
experience with operating systems, data communications, and networks. In these
exercises students develop a better understanding of the hardware and software
used in computer systems.
