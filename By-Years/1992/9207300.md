This US-Hungary research project between Dr. Gerald D. Fasman of Brandeis
University and Dr. Miklos Hollosi of the Institute of Organic Chemistry,
Budapest, Hungary involves synthesis and study of the conformation of
glycopeptides. The researchers will synthesize model compounds in both classes;
N- and O-glycosidic model B- turn tetrapeptides. Once prepared, the researchers
will investigate the conformation of these model compounds by physical-
biochemical techniques, including circular dichroisim, nuclear magnetic
resonance and infra-red spectroscopy. They will use conformational energy
calculations by the MMPMI (1985) to assist in conformational assignments. The
roles of glycoproteins have been shown to play important roles in biological
processes, however, little research has been carried out on the role of
conformation in the various biological fluctuations. Results should improve our
understanding of the role that carbohydrates play in glycoprotein function and
conformation. This project in biochemistry fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas
of strong mutual interest and competence.
