ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;23 July 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1216789&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences&lt;br/&gt;PI:
N. Bates&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: R. Harelstad&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal
requests one Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) item for the R/V
ATLANTIC EXPLORER operated by the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS);
namely a new main aft deck crane. This award represents Year 1 of a multi-year
project. This item will improve safety and greatly enhance the vessel?s science
support capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The R/V ATLANTIC
EXPLORER supports federally funded scientific research throughout the Atlantic
basin to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment. The vessel also
conducts the routine servicing of the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS)
moorings. During operations, graduate and undergraduate students are routinely
exposed to seagoing oceanography through real-time satellite connectivity from
ship to shore, and open house events. The ATLANTIC EXPLORER is scheduled to
complete 170 NSF sponsored days in 2012.
