Traditionally, the ear region is the preeminent source of comparative
morphological information for evolutionary studies on mammals. It also presents
one of the most oft cited examples of evolutionary change in Biology textbooks:
the evolution of the three middle-ear bones (ossicles) of mammals from the lower
jaws of more primitive forms. Despite its preeminence, knowledge of the ear
region remains incomplete. During recent years, remarkable fossil finds have
dramatically increased what is known of the ear and its ossicles in extinct
mammals and raised questions about previous views on the evolution of this
region and of mammals in general. To fully evaluate these fossils and new
evolutionary questions, it is necessary to increase comparative knowledge of the
ear in modern mammals, both in numbers and in level of detail. This research
gathers comparative information on the embryology of the ear region in modern
mammals to evaluate the evolution of this complex system and its role in the
evolutionary history of mammals.
