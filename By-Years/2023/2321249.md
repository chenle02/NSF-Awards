This award supports conferences in the Atlanta Lecture Series in Graph Theory
and Combinatorics, to be held at Georgia Institute of Technology and Georgia
State University, with the first conference at Georgia State University on
November 4-5, 2023. Combinatorics and graph theory have undergone significant
developments in the past few decades. The proposed conferences will feature the
latest research developments and trends in the areas of structural graph theory,
extremal graph theory, and probabilistic combinatorics. Each conference features
two one-hour lectures by a distinguished researcher, four one-hour lectures by
established researchers mainly from the southeast region, and four 30-minute
talks by early-career researchers and graduate students. The meetings will
provide opportunities for interactions among researchers of all career stages
including students, especially those from underrepresented groups, to engage
with experts in a variety of fields in mathematics. Additional information
concerning financial support and the conference schedule is maintained on the
lecture series website: https://math.gsu.edu/gchen/als_XXVII.html

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
