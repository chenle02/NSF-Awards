Hurricane Sandy was an extreme storm with a historic impact on the northeastern
U.S. The proposed work will lead to a better understanding of this event by
placing it in the context of the regional paleohurricane record. To compare
Hurricane Sandy with past storm events, the project will conduct numerical surge
and wave modeling, as well as textural analyses of Sandy-related and paleo-
overwash deposits. This work will leverage previous surge modeling and paleo-
overwash studies by the PIs in order to develop a more comprehensive
paleohurricane record for the New York/New Jersey/Connecticut area. In addition,
the project will compare Hurricane Sandy with modeled synthetic storm scenarios
to evaluate the likelihood of Sandy-like events under current and future climate
conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will help to determine the
frequency and probability of severe storms in a heavily populated coastal region
of the U.S. Two undergraduate students and two post-doctoral researchers will be
involved. The PIs will continue ongoing engagement with managers and policy
makers.
