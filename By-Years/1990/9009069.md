Calcium entry leads to the release of neurotransmitters in nerve terminals.
Malfunctions in this fundamental process can result in neurological and
neuromuscular diseases. Despite vigorous research, the actual mechanism whereby
calcium entry regulates transmitter release is poorly understood. This
conference will focus on nerve terminals; concentrating on the biophysical and
pharmacological properties of nerve terminal calcium channels, the entry and
distribution of calcium ions after the nerve impulse, the physiology of calcium-
dependent transmitter release, and the mechanism by which calcium triggers
secretory vesicle fusion. In addition, new experimental techniques will be
highlighted. The conference will assemble some of the best investigators working
in the area to discuss the current status of knowledge and to examine the most
promising lines of future development.
