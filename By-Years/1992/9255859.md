This planning grant will lead to a proposal from the University of Idaho to
extend a successful model for science to mathematics education. The Mathematics
Assessment and Restructuring System (MARS) will design and validate an
instrument to systematically work in individual schools to help improve K-12
mathematics education. Using members of the Idaho Mathematics Coalition, the
project will develop an assessment instrument appropriate to different schools
across the state. A process of development, planning meetings, and validation of
the instrument will be used. The grant is for 6 months and includes 162% cost
sharing. //
