This award provides partial support for the construction of a 3200 sq.ft.
graduate student dormitory at the Bodega Marine Laboratory (BML). The Bodega
Marine Laboratory and Reserve are dedicated to multi-disciplinary teaching and
research in both marine and terrestrial habitats, serving students and
researchers from the University of California at Davis and 66 other academic
institutions during the last year, including over 100 graduate students from 24
institutions. BML and the Reserve have experienced robust growth in research and
teaching use by resident and visiting scientists, graduate students, and
undergraduates during the past thirty-six years. Use by graduate students has
increased by 65% in the last four years. The new housing will permit more
effective use of the Laboratory, the surrounding Reserve, and adjacent habitats
for research and training. Existing facilities are inadequate to support the
growing number of graduate student requests to work at the Laboratory and
Reserve, thus limiting the capacity of BML to support one of its chief missions.
