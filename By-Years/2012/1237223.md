This Innovation Corps project proposes to test the commercial feasibility of a
wall-climbing robot system based on the teams "City-Climber" technology for
building façade inspection and glass wall cleaning applications. The current
practice of manual inspection of building façade is time-consuming, expensive,
and poses risk to human workers. The City-Climber technology provides a solution
to meet a strong demand for automated inspection of building façades. In
addition, the City-Climber robots can be modified to carry out tasks such as to
clean glass walls and solar panels. Under prior funding, this team developed
several wall-climbing robot prototypes, named City-Climber.

Unlike traditional climbing robots that rely on magnetic devices and vacuum
suction techniques and some recent novel climbing robots such as vortex climber
and the robots using micro-spine inspired by the gecko foot, the City-Climber
robots use an aerodynamic rotor package which achieves a balance between strong
adhesion force and high mobility. If successfully commercialized, City-Climber
robots have many potential applications such as: 1) inspection of building
facades for cracks or other defects; 2) inspection of concrete structures such
as power plant tower, dam, bridges, etc.; 3) cleaning of glass panels of high-
rise buildings, 4) cleaning of solar panels; 5) inspection/spray
painting/blasting of storage tanks, aircraft, ship hulls, billboards, etc.; 6)
surveillance of tunnels or danger zones where ground access in not available.
