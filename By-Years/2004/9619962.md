Dr. James N. Demas and other members of the Chemistry Department at the
University of Virginia are being supported to continue a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1997-99, twelve
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry and
biochemistry. The research experience is enriched by scientific and ethics
talks, field trips, and a symposium for presentation of research results to
which a faculty member from the participant's parent institution is invited.
Recruitment of participants focusses on small, non-graduate degree granting
institutions.
