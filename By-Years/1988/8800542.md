In 1989 the Bureau of the Census will conduct the National Survey of Natural
and Social Scientists and Engineers, the fourth in this series of surveys in the
1980's on the Nation's experienced scientists and engineers. These surveys
collect demographic, educational, employment and geographic data on a cohort of
scientists and engineers who were originally identified in the 1980 Census of
Population. This information allows NSF to examine levels, changes, and trends,
particularly in the employment experience, of a large and important segment of
the science and engineering labor force. NSF, in its role as principal Federal
agency on scientific and engineering activities, is charged with maintaining an
up-to- date data base on the scientific and technical personnel in this country.
That data base, the Scientific and Technical Personnel Data System, is comprised
of data from this survey, the Survey of Recent Science and Engineering
Graduates, and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients. Information from these three
sources are combined to produce national estimates of the numbers and
characteristics of the Nation's scientific and engineering labor force.
