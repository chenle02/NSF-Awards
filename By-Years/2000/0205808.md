PI Kirshner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a program of diligent observation and
analysis of supernova explosions. The goals&lt;br/&gt;are to understand the
mechanisms by which stars explode, to assess the
supernova&lt;br/&gt;contribution to the heavy element enrichment of the
Universe, and to use supernova&lt;br/&gt;explosions as tools for measuring the
expansion history of the Universe. Many people have&lt;br/&gt;embarked on
finding supernovae, but these discoveries only lead to increased understanding
when they are followed up. This group has been one of the most effective teams
in the world at following supernovae -- in part because of the ideal
instrumentation at Mount Hopkins . In the coming years, the 6.5 meter MMT will
become available along with the extraordinary opportunities at the two Magellan
telescopes in the southern hemisphere. They are also refurbishing the 1.3 meter
former 2MASS survey telescope at Mount Hopkins to augment the world's supply of
infrared data. The group has made excellent progress in using Type Ia supernovae
as accurate tools to measure extragalactic distances. This leads to a
measurement of the expansion rate of the Universe, an estimate for the age of
the Universe, demonstration of time dilation at high redshift, a way to detect
large scale flows, and gives the only direct evidence for an accelerating
Universe. Supernova observations have revealed that 2/3 of the Universe is dark
energy, of an as-yet undetermined type, a finding with deep resonances with
fundamental physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
