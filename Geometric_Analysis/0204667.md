On the Geometry of Kaehler-Einstein Manifold

In this project, the proposer is going to understand Kaehler-Einstein metrics,
especially Calabi-Yau manifolds using the theory of moduli spaces, through three
different ways. The first way is to study the potential function of the Bergman
metric of a polarized compact Kaehler manifold. For the application in the
Kaehler-Einstein geometry, one needs to estimate the potential function from
below for a family of manifolds. The problem is related to the stability of
manifolds in the sense of Geometric Invariant Theory. The second way is to study
the relation between the K stability and the Mumford stability. Such a relation,
if exists, would give one new insights of the relations between the Kaehler-
Einstein geometry and the stability of manifolds. The third way is the geometry
of moduli space of polarized Calabi-Yau manifolds. A Kaehler metric on the
moduli space has been defined and was found that the Ricci curvature of such a
metric is negative away from zero by the proposer. In order to introduce
geometric analysis to the place, one needs to prove a version of the maximal
principle on the moduli space, even if the moduli space, in general, is not
smooth.

Einstein's general theory of relativity is a theory that interprets the concept
of gravity into the geometric property of the space. Recent development of in
physics shows that the universe may be of dimension ten, with three dimension in
space and one dimension in time plus a tiny six dimensional space called Calabi-
Yau threefold. One of the main mathematical tool to study the geometry of the
space is differential geometry. Since the discovery of the general relativity,
differential geometry becomes crucial to both mathematicians and physicists. The
project is one of the main field in differential geometry. It will help a lot in
understanding one of the basic force of the universe: the gravity and ultimately
understanding the space we are living with. It is difficult to believe that
without an extensive study of fundamental sciences such as general relativity,
modern technology like the use of atomic energy can come true. By the same
reason, today's fundamental study will not only enlarge our knowledge but
eventually benefit people's life as well.
