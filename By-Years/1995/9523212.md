9523212 Newman This research is for the development of an on-line Raman
spectrometer for the pharmaceutical industry. A variety of pharmaceutical
materials will be examined to determine their suitability for analysis by Raman
spectroscopy. Software will also be developed for automated spectrum
interpretation, and optical designs for conventional and fiber optic sampling
will be tested. The introduction of Raman spectroscopy into the pharmaceutical
industry will have major impacts. The rapid analysis of drug formulation will
meet the increasing requirements for frequent examination of products and may be
applied to the chemical, polymer, and food and beverage industries as well.
