This project is to develop new, effective distance metrics for comparing two
images. These metrics account for two effects. First, pixels can change their
position, deforming from one image to another. Second, pixels may change their
intensity. In many vision problems, intensity changes are primarily due to
lighting variation. The research team first addresses the effect of illumination
changes, which enables to develop a new, powerful, robust distance for measuring
the effects of lighting variation in an image. The research team combines this
with both existing and new methods to develop a robust distance that accounts
simultaneously for image deformations and intensity variations. Computing this
distance separates these two effects, providing a correspondence between images.
This can be used to track objects moving relative to a light, to match images
taken at different times of day, or to recognize objects seen under different
lighting, from different viewpoints, with variations in their
shape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new metric provides a theory of computation for
deformation and lighting that encodes our notion of image similarity. However,
it is still a considerable challenge to find ways to effectively compute with
such an image metric. Therefore, the research team also develops computationally
effective algorithms based on this new metric. These algorithms improve
performance in numerous applications such as face recognition, autonomous
navigation, and optical flow and tracking, in which variations in lighting and
shape cause significant challenges for existing methods.&lt;br/&gt;
