9319873 Lingle This award is for support of a small grant for exploratory
research (SGER) to measure surface velocities on Bering Glacier, Alaska, with
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, which began surging between March and
June, 1993. Use of satellite imagery is an appropriate approach to this problem
because of the scale of Bering Glacier, which is the largest in North America,
with width and length dimensions of about 15 km and 200 km, respectively, and a
total area, including tributaries of about 5,800 km2. The results of this work
will bear on the questions of (i) the seasonal timing of the onset and cessation
of glacier surges in Alaska and the Yukon Territory, (ii) whether surges
necessarily begin in accumu- lation areas then propagate downstream into
ablation areas, and (iii) the temporal evolution of the 2-dimensional surface
velocity field, which is a reflection of basal processes, as the surge
progresses. ***
