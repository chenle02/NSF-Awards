The science of palynology includes numerous subdisciplines which link it to many
other sciences. The breadth of studies within the field makes it particularly
important to coordinate and link between the various specialities to ensure that
practitioners stay abreast of developments within the science. This action
provides travel support for members of the American Association of Stratigraphic
Palynologists to attend the 7th International Palynological Congress in
Brisbane, Australia and associated field trips from August 18 to September 14,
1988. Attendees will present results of their work, will confer with experts
from other countries and will participate in field trips. Results are expected
to stimulate development and applications of this science.
