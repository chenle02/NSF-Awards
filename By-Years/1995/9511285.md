The present project is to prepare a database in electronic and book form of
phonological, lexical, and (to a lesser extent) grammatical information on
selected languages of northern Vietnam. We are targeting languages or varieties
unstudied outside Vietnam, specifically those found in the far northwest of
Vietnam: (1) Kadai and Tai family Bouyei/Yay (Giay/Bo Y), Laha (La Ha), San
Chay/Cao Lan, Bl./Wh/Red Thai (2) Hmong-Mien Hmong (Meo), Dao (Yao, Kim Mun),
Pa-hng (Pa Teng) (3) Mon-Khmer Khang, Mang This project is significant because
the Tai and Kadai, Hmong-Mien, and Mon Khmer groups of extreme northern Vietnam
(Haut Tonkin) occupy a special place in the linguistic history of East and
Southeast Asia, but have remained linguistically poorly known up to now. The
goal here is to begin to fill this gap in knowledge. The end products of this
study will be: (a) an electronic database in MS-Excel format with lexical items
in IPA transcription and (b) a research monograph. The data to be collected for
this project could be quite important generally for SE Asian linguists,
linguistic typologists, historians, and anthropologists studying the spread of
languages and material and non-material culture from China into SE Asia. It will
also be important specifically in clarifying: (a) the linguistic developments
that have led to modern Lao, Thai, Hmong and some Mon-Khmer languages, (b) the
nature of the proto-languages from which they have descended, (c) the
interaction of pitch and voice quality co-occurrence phenomena, and (d) the
terminological confusion about genetic affiliation and place in the family of
some of these groups.
