This research will consider numerical methods for highly advective flow
problems with particular application to simulation of flows in porous media and
incompressible flows modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations. Discretization by
operator splitting methods will be emphasized. The advection operator will be
approximated using the modified of characteristics, and diffusion-dispersion or
viscosity and the Stokes problem will be dealt with using finite element
methods. This work should provide new insight into flows in unsaturated zones
and flows in fractured media.
