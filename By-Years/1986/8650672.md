The Physics Department of San Diego State University will computerize its
advanced electronics laboratory by introducing microcomputer aided measurement
and analysis to the present experimental program. Approximately 100 science
students each year will benefit from this program, both in learning how to use
modern microcomputers and in speeding repetitive measurement tasks with their
assistance. Each student lab station will have a host Macintosh microcomputer
connected to a smaller data acquisition microcontroller. Electronic data
measurements will be made by the microcontroller upon student order to the host
computer. The numerical values obtained will be sent back to the host for
further analysis.
