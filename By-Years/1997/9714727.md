ABSTRACT EEC-9714727 GOODMAN This two year "TIE" project funds a collaborative
study with two Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC). The
two I/UCRC's are the Rutgers University Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center for Wireless Information Networks and the University of California San
Diego Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Ultra-High Speed
Integrated Circuits and Systems. The "TIE" project is entitled, "Interference
Cancellation Prototyping and ASIC Development for Wireless CDMA Communication."
The Rutgers University I/UCRC will investigate the critical issues of
acquisition and synchronizing essential for multi-user direct sequence CDMA
communication convolution coding and utilize recent results on multi carrier
DS/CDMA systems. In the second year further research to study other multi-user
detection architecture will be carried out after adding radio frequency
hardware. The University of California - San Diego Center will work with the
Rutgers University Center in designing an interference cancellation chip and
give it to National Semiconductor Corp. for fabrication . In the second year the
chip will be tested and incorporated into a CDMA communication system for multi-
users.
