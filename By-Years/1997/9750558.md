This project addresses the difficulty of college students in handling the
traditional courses in college algebra and preparatory algebra. These courses
stress symbolic manipulation and contrived problems. Students find the courses
to have little or no relevance to their background and goals. The project is
designed to achieve several major objectives through the integration of
technology, including (1) reducing the need for paper and pencil manipulation;
and (2) enabling the student to consider real-world problems drawn from the
sciences, the social sciences, and economics. The students are working in pairs
on computer-based laboratory projects to analyze real data obtained locally or
on the World Wide Web. They are using an algebra and graphing package to assist
them in difficult computations. The project is predominately affecting non-
science-majors and non-business-majors who want to take college algebra to
fulfill a university requirement. Such students tend to be bright, but deficient
in basic algebraic skills. *
