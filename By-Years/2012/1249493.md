This project is partially supporting the HI-TEC national conference and special
forums on technology education within the conference (http://www.highimpact-
tec.org/). The forums focus on the identification of critical issues and the
challenges of technology education. Importantly these forums are designed to
provide necessary feedback to the NSF and other stakeholders to help shape
initiatives in response to identified national and global challenges. The forums
are expected to engage participants from the ranks of community college
educators, technicians, and industry personnel in frank discussions designed to
highlight challenges and priorities faced by modern technology education and
provide stakeholders information on funding opportunities to support these
challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event significantly broadens the impact
of the ATE program by engaging new constituencies in STEM and workforce
education. One specific objective of this project is bringing students and
technicians to the conference to broaden their experience and solicit their
feedback concerning skills and competencies needed within the workplace. This
conference, more than any other single event, is a highlight and showcase for
the Foundation's long-standing efforts and initiatives to support technician
education at community colleges.
