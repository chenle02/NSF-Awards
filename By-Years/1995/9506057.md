PI: Okikiolu DMS-9506057 Okikiolu will investigate the connection between zeta-
regularized determinants of certain elliptic operators on a manifold with
boundary and certain Toeplitz determinants on the boundary. She has proved a
Campbell-Hausdorff formula for elliptic operators and a related trace formula,
and developed new methods for symbolic computation. She will now extend these
results to manifolds with boundary. Okikiolu also has proved an analogue of the
strong Szego limit theorem for spheres of dimension two and three, and will
further generalize this result. Partial differential equations form a basis for
mathematical modeling of the physical world. The role of mathematical analysis
is not so much to create the equations as it is to provide qualitative and
quantitative information about the solutions. This may include answers to
questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition, analysis often
develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuracy of
these approximations.
