The intellectual merit of this project, Bioscience Scholars (BioS) at the
University of Florida, stems from its goal of bringing a thesis-based BS/MS
program within reach of low-income students, making the scientific profession
and its community accessible to them and allowing them to achieve their maximum
potential. The project targets students in a statewide high school biotechnology
program who have already demonstrated an interest in biotechnology and acquired
substantial technical skills, but lack the financial resources to complete a
graduate degree. Scholars are provided coursework and workshops focused on
foundational knowledge, critical thinking skills and technical skills, and are
given the opportunity for extensive, mentored research experience. The BioS
program leverages an institutional commitment so that scholars graduate with a
combined BS/MS degree within five years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts
include curricular reforms that affect all biology students at the University of
Florida, not just the scholars. This program could serve as a national model of
creating diversity because the targeted population from which students are
recruited includes many underrepresented minority students. Finally, students in
this program are trained to fill local needs in the job market in Florida's
rapidly growing biotechnology sector.
