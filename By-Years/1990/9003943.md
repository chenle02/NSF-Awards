This award supports a workshop which would address the application of the Global
Positioning System (GPS) to earth science problems in Antarctica. With advances
in technology it is now possible to address real-time changes in the morphology
of the earth that results from processes such as tectonism (mountain building,
earthquakes activity) and the growth or decay of the earth's major ice sheets.
Such studies will be most important in bringing Antarctica into the mainstream
of global earth-science research. The workshop will: 1) identify and develop the
scientific objectives for a coordinated campaign, 2) identify the technical
needs associated with such a campaign and 3) draw up a plan for a possible
campaign.
