This is a supplement to a grant to assemble, publish, and disseminate a
sourcebook of findings from a research project previously funded by NSF. The
project was to design and develop a statistical system and comprehensive data
base to provide annual indicators of the quantity and quality of science and
engineering students. The sourcebook will contain information that will reflect
twenty.five years of experience with large educational data bases, beginning
with Project TALENT in 1960 to the conclusion of High School and Beyond (HS
&amp; B) in 1984. This book will be "must reading" for future researchers
proposing to use data from two or more data bases, especially those from the
National Assessment of Educational Programs (NAEP), the SAT Program, the
National Longitudinal Survey of 1972 (NLS), HS &amp; B, or Project TALENT.
