The proposed project involves development of a user-interactive software suite
for medical image analysis. The core algorithms consist of simultaneous
segmentation and registration based on active contour and active surface models.
This software is designed to deliver a practical, intuitive, and easy-to-use
desktop software tool to doctors, clinicians, and other health-care
professionals to extract geometric tissue features (segmentation) from collected
image data (including modalities such as MRI, CT, PET, etc.) while
simultaneously aligning such geometric structures across separately collected
datasets (registration). Included in the software application will be tools to
visualize and quantitatively measure the extracted geometric information,
thereby providing heavily sought information to aid in diagnosis, treatment and
surgical planning, as well as evaluation of trials and studies.

Current clinical practices in medical image analysis are labor intensive and
time consuming. The proposed software suite has the potential to be a powerful
tool that may reduce the time from current several work days to less than an
hour. If successfully developed, this tool could enable higher patient
throughput and assist in extracting accurate diagnostic information from medical
images. The technology finds application in cardiac function analysis,
structural neuro-imaging, planning cardiac resynchronization therapy, and
planning radiation therapy.
