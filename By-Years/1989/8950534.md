An image processing workstation will be used to develop images from satellite
tapes for the senior level Aerial Photo Interpretation course, which is a core
course, and therefore required of all geology majors. Satellite images are
ubiquitous and are used in oil, gas, and mineral exploration, environmental
monitoring, agriculture and forestry. The ability to interpret them is needed by
students to be competitive in the job market to work for federal agencies. The
equipment will also be used as a demonstration to students taking introductory
level courses in geography. The university will contribute 50% matching funds.
