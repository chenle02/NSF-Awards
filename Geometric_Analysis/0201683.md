ABSTRACT for DMS 0201683

This project concerns problems at the juncture of geometry, topology, and
physics. The mathematical challenge we address is :(i) to provide a rigorous
framework for functional integrals in geometrical quantum field theories, and
(ii) to use the rigorous framework to prove results which may be conjectured in
the heuristic/informal setting suggested by physics. Specifically, we will be
concerned with : (a) quantum Yang-Mills gauge theory over surfaces, (b) a three
dimensional Chern-Simons gauge theory, and (c) other functional integrals
arising from geometrical/topological quantum theories. The goal will be to give
rigorous foundations to the mathematical expressions and objects which arise in
these theories and then to use them to further develop mathematical ideas and
solve specific problems. The mathematics involved includes geometry and topology
connected with fiber bundles and Lie groups, as well as stochastic analysis and
infinite-dimensional integration. Stochastic analysis has often been applied in
the study of the geometry of manifolds. The present proposal addresses
situations which promise deeper applications of stochastic analysis in settings
enriched by geometry and topology.

This research program will bring together geometry and topology with stochastic
analysis to provide solid mathematical foundations for certain computations done
in physics, solve certain specific problems and develop new mathematical ideas
arising from quantum physics. The physics is quantum field theory, which
describes the quantum behavior of forces that govern the interaction between
elementary particles in nature such as those which make up protons and neutrons.
This project is concerned with development of fundamental mathematics connected
with an area of physics. There may be potential applications to surface physics
and other phenomena involving geometry and stochastics, but this project itself
is devoted primarily to foundations rather than application. History shows that
mathematics arising through an investigation of fundamental notions associated
to one particular context later finds application in areas far removed from the
original context, this being an essential aspect of the centrality of
mathematics to applied sciences.
