9320825 Krishna This research will develop theoretical models of trade in an
effort to understand the different effects of trade policy, especially when
markets are imperfectly competitive. Most often the effects of policy depend on
paying particular attention to the details of the implementation procedure. This
study focuses on three main areas where the details of implementation are
clearly important. The first is an investigation of export quotas, in an effort
to ascertain whether transferability of licenses is welfare enhancing. The
conventional wisdom is that transferable quotas are preferable to
nontransferable ones. A simple model is developed to show that contrary to
conventional wisdom, license prices could increase or decrease depending on the
quota level and the extent of free quota. The second part of the study deals
with issues of market access. There has recently been increasing pressure to
create rules to ensure market access. The effort here is to find out if attempts
to assure a minimum market share for U.S. products help or hurt its
competitiveness in the long-run. Finally, the study conducts an analysis of the
rules of origin used in Free Trade Agreements. These rules of origin are used to
determine whether a good is produced in a Free Trade Area and hence eligible for
preferential treatment of the Free Trade Area or not. This project is of
significant interest because it allows a better understanding of the
implications of different implementation procedures. The findings from the study
are also important in more general settings as well. For example, the issue of
the effects of permitting transferability is relevant for all types of permits
from pollution permits to permits to run a taxicab. ***
