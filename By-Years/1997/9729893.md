(Virginia Tech) CISE Research Instrumentation: A Research Laboratory for High-
Performance Computing,Configurable Computing, and Computer Networking This
research instrumentation grant enables five distinct research projects: -
Computational Physics- CAD for Digital Systems- Effective Parallel Numerical
Software for Networks of Workstations-Network Protocols and Performance
-Configurable Computing Machines. To support the aforementioned projects, the
PIs are building a research laboratory comprising sixteen Pentium II-based
personal computers, configurable computing boards, and a high-speed network
switch. In addition to supporting the needs of the individual projects, the
laboratory serves as a focal point for collaboration between the various
projects. The choice of Pentium II-based computers and configurable computing
boards for the basic architecture of the laboratory not only intersects with the
interests of the PIs, but also yields an excellent price/performance ratio for
the applications of interest.
