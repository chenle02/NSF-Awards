*** 96-60844 Yang This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will investigate low-cost processing of superalloys. Materials such as
superalloys have commercially desirable properties for applications in extreme
environments. Unfortunately, these materials are often unaffordable primarily
because of the inherent difficulty in forming and shaping these materials into
useful components. Phase I will explore a concept that superalloys can be
readily processed into useful shapes. Phase II would optimize the technology and
produce prototypes of commercial interest. Commercial applications are expected
in widespread use of superalloys in advanced structural tools, transportation
engine components, magnetohydrodynamic components, stress-prone high temperature
parts (for armaments, nozzles, and combustion chambers), and corrosion-prone
health care component, such as implants. ***
