Due to the need for faster processing, a growing number of newer computing
models are increasing speed with intriguing physical designs. Massive
parallelism, for example, exploits unique physical arrangements in order to
increase computer performance. Seemingly, the signal itself is becoming less
important. One can extrapolate further and envision a computer concept, where
the only role of the signals is to establish a stable structure, which in turn
would imply solution. The objective of this research is to examine a working
hypothesis that certain high performance computing can be done by negotiating
equilibria of appropriate anti-symmetric digital circuits through random noise.
The experimental circuits to be used will be embodiments of particular
algorithms. If the partial inputs and outputs keep well defined values, then we
believe that it is possible to superimpose chaotic perturbations in such a way
that the processor will settle to its stable state if and only if it attains a
solution of the algorithm. Such an asynchronous resonance processor can be a
high performance platform for a variety of applications, primarily in the area
of computer intelligence.
