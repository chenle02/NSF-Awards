This action provides partial support for Accelerator-Based Mass Spectrometry
(AMS) in the general applications area of the geosciences at the University of
Rochester. AMS provides unique capabilities for measuring extremely small
concentrations of isotopes in microsamples and is therefore a valuable technique
for dating and tracer work using cosmogenic radioactive isotopes such as
carbon-14, chlorine-36, beryllium-10, and aluminum-26. The Rochester AMS
facility is the only one in the U.S. capable of making accurate chlorine-36
measurements, particularly useful in dating and tracing the flow of groundwater.
