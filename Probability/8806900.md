The theme of the research is the application of empirical process methodology
to problems in statistics and econometrics. A multivariate location estimator to
be studied, depends on the translate of a fixed disc that contains the largest
empirical measure. The squared difference thus becomes the integral over two
crescent-shaped regions. Several limit theorems will be proved, along with the
graduate student Kim, to study the statistical properties of this estimator. The
optimal center and the optimal radius of the disc in the estimator will be
explored computationally. Different simulation methods will be studied for
generation of the random functions used in the estimation. The major
applications of the theory are in econometrics.
