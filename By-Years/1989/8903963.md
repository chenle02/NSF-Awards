The Mesozoic continental margin of the southwestern United States was the site
of major compression involving overthrusting and accretion of terranes to the
active margin. However, the extent of Orogen-parallel strike-slip faulting is
poorly constrained. Recent stratigraphic and structural data suggests the
presence of a major (>500 km displacement) cryptic intrabatholithic fault of
Early Cretaceous age in the Sierra Nevada. If confirmed, this discovery will
have far reaching consequences, including the necessity to radically revise
Jurassic and earlier paleogeography and tectonics of the western Cordillera.
This project will critically test several specific predictions of this new model
in an effort to establish the model's validity and to explore its impact on
tectonic interpretations of the Mesozoic of western North America.
