Abstract Gindikin

The focus of the proposal is the development of a method of complex horospheras
for real affine symmetric spaces, including real semisimple Lie groups. We
anticipate to apply this method to the construction of the models of series of
representations and to the decomposition of the regular representations on
series on the language of Hardy spaces of cohomology. As one of application we
hope to give an integral geometrical proof of the product-formula for c-function
of Harishi-Chandra. Another direction of my research is the investigation of
geometrical and analytic properties of the crowns of Riemann symmetric spaces -
their canonical Stein neighborhoods. Integral geometry is a branch of
geometrical analysis which investigates integral transforms associated with
different geometrical structures. The principal challenge is to find a
geometrical setting, more general than the group one, where it is possible to
develop a non-abelian harmonic analysis. Another direction considers complex
constructions responsible for the geometry of real affine symmetric spaces. Such
phenomena have roots in classical geometry of Poncelet and Pluecker.
