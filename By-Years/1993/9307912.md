ABSTRACT P.I. Robert Sokal SBR-9307912 There are currently two contending
hypotheses for the origin of the Indo-European speakers. Colin Renfrew has
challenged the established view, propounded by Marija Gimbutas, that the Indo-
Europeanization of Europe proceeded in three waves between 4400 and 2800 B.C.
from trhe Pontic steppes, north of the Black Sea. Renfrew has the Indo-europeans
arising in Anatolia much earlier (7000 B.C.) and entering Europe as early
agriculturalists, distributing themselves through Europe with the spread of the
Neolithic. Both of these hypotheses should have very different consequences for
the subsequent population relationships among European groups. Robert Sokal has
constructed a unique database on European ethnohistory, recording the location
and movements of most known ethnic units from 2200 B.C. to the present. In the
current pilot project, he will test the counts of movements in and out of
different locales in Europe against genetic diversities in these areas, and test
migration matrices against genetic distances. These and other tests will
determine the degree of robusticity of the database, given the likelihood that
there are some omissions or exaggerations in the database. This series of tests
will establish the utility of the database in further predictions of patterns of
genetic variation over the European continent. *** P\anthro\jfried\9307912.abs
