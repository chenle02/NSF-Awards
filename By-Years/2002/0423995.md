This award supports the 48 th , 49 th and 50 th annual meetings of the Wind
River Conference on Procaryotic Biology, to be held at the Aspen Lodge, Estes
Park, Colorado. The 48 th meeting will be held on June 2-6, 2004. The dates for
the other two years will not be determined until 12 months prior to the
meetings. The conference is primarily concerned with the biology of procaryotes,
and is the major, annually occurring meeting devoted to this subject area. A
significant feature of these meetings is their accessibility to graduate and
post-doctoral students, whose travel funds are frequently limited. To address
this problem, funds from the award are used to provide travel and support
scholarships to facilitate the attendance of graduate and post-doctoral students
working in the various areas that comprise procaryotic biology. Corporate funds
are also used to provide expenses for 3 - 4 distinguished scientists (per
meeting) as plenary speakers. The meeting helps disseminate science information
and provides a platform for students to give oral presentations. Moreover the
speakers and students are encouraged to interact and exchange ideas and
information and when possible to build long-term interactions. Since the topics
of interest of this conference span the broad range of procaryotic research,
there is a great deal of cross discipline discussion and communication.
