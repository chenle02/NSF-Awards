The Conference on Econometrics and Mathematical Economics (CEME) holds a series
of annual conferences on research issues in economic theory and statistical
methods for the analysis of economic data. The purpose is to stimulate
discussion and research in these areas, and to investigate the application of
cutting edge mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques to economic
research questions. The conferences focus on a variety of topics in statistical
methods and economic theory. Each topic conference meets once each year. The
conferences are broadly interdisciplinary, including researchers from
mathematics, operations research, and computer science. They also facilitate
communication between academic scholars and government economists, since the
statistical methods covered are important for many government economists. There
are special workshops aimed at young econometricians and young economic
theorists. Conference locations include universities around the United
States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
