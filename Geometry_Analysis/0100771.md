Abstract

Award: DMS-0100771. Principal Investigator: Peter B. Kronheimer

The aim of this project is to apply gauge-theory techniques to the study of
three-dimensional manifolds. The principal investigator proposes to investigate
Floer homology and closely related areas of geometry, and hopes to shed light on
the applicability of gauge theory to problems in three-dimensional topology. In
particular, it is hoped that a relation can be established between the Floer
homologies of three-manifolds defined on the one hand by the monopole equations
on the other hand by the instanton equations. (These are the equations which, in
four-dimensions, lead respectively to the Seiberg-Witten invariants and
Donaldson invariants of four-manifolds, and which have led to an flood of
results in four-dimensional differential topology in the past twenty years.) A
first goal is to prove that if the instanton Floer homology of manifold with
first betti number one is trivial in the strong sense that all the
representations of the fundamental group can be made to disappear by a holonomy
perturbation, then the monopole Floer homology groups are trivial also. (For the
instanton groups, the relevant representations are the representations in SO(3)
with non-trivial Stiefel-Whitney class.) By an application of a non-vanishing
theorem for the monopole Floer homology and use of Floer's exact triangle, this
would lead to a proof of the "Property P conjecture". A related goal in this
project is the development of new constructions for Floer homology, based on the
technique of finite-dimensional approximation (which has already seen convincing
application in the study of the four-dimensional invariants).

Topology is the qualitative study of space and its connectedness. Its importance
was recognized at the turn of the last century by the French mathematician
Poincaro, during his investigation of the laws of motion that govern the
movement of a three-body system such as the Earth, Moon and Sun moving according
to Newton's laws. In the past twenty years, topology has seen applications in
questions such as the knotting of proteins and DNA, and in modern theories of
high-energy physics. The topology of three-dimensional spaces, as opposed to
those of higher dimension, is of particular subtlety. Through this project, it
is hoped to bring new techniques to bear on outstanding questions in three-
dimensional topology. These techniques -- gauge theory and the Seiberg-Witten
equations -- originated in physics, where they had potential application to
fundamental questions such as quark confinement. They have been an effective
tool in the study of four-dimensional spaces (such as our space-time). The aim
now is to apply the same techniques to questions in dimension three.
