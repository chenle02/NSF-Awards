A pilot study of tropical soil organic matter will be conducted. Field studies
being conducted in Yurimaguas, Peru and in several other tropical agricultural
sites will provide data on soil organic matter dynamics. Some of these data will
then be used to modify a soil organic model developed for temperate zone
agroecosystems so that it can be used in the tropics. The remainder of the data
will be used to validate the modified model. The model is a cutting-edge
synthesis of current thinking in soil biology and chemistry. Its application to
tropical soils problems will provide much need integration of here-to-fore
unsynthesized information on tropical soils and their responses to management.
With this synthesis tool we should be better able to manage the often fragile
soils of the tropics. The investigators involved in the pilot study are world-
recognized experts in their respective fields. Dr. Sanchez has demonstrated, for
almost two decades, his ability to work in remote field settings in Latin
America. Institutional support at North Carolina State University and Colorado
State University are excellent.
