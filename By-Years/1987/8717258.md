This proposal deals with the processing of noble metal/superconducting oxide
composites into thin ribbons. Compositional homogeneity of the metallic
precursors is planned to achieve through rapid solidification processing,
namely, melt spinning; to form an amorphous ribbon. The metallic precursors of
the superconducting material also contain a noble metal, or a mixture of noble
metals. By selectively oxidizing the amorphous ribbon, a continuous skeleton of
noble metal interwoven with a continuous network of the superconducting oxide
will be obtained. The final material will comprise of a ductile
metal/superconducting oxide composite.
