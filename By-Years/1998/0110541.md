The long-term goal of this research project is to characterize and define the
specific processing events necessary for cell surface expression of MHC class II
molecules in a teleost species. The immediate goal of this project is to
determine the molecular events necessary for proper folding, assembly, and cell
surface expression of class II heterodimers. In particular, the work seeks to
determine the assembly of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II
heterodimers in teleosts proceeds with assistance from the endoplasmic reticulum
chaperone calnexin and the invariant chain. Preferential pairing of class II
alpha and beta chains will be tested with transfection of the previously
characterized encoding genes into catfish class II negative fibroblast cell
lines. RNA and cell surface expression of class II genes and proteins will be
examined. In other experiments, immunoprecipitations, immunoblots, flow
cytometry, and immunofluorescence microscopy will be used to test the role of
calnexin, calreticulin, and invariant chain in the processing and trafficking of
class II molecules. The availability of catfish lymphoid, macrophage, and
fibroblast cell lines, along with the previous characterization of two expressed
MHC class II A and class II B loci, make the channel catfish a unique system
among teleosts for the study of MHC class II assembly and cell surface
expression.
