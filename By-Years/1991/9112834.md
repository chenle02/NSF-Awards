An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change Research Program
(Our Changing Planet," Committee on Earth Sciences, 1991) is understanding and
modeling the geospace environment. As part of its contribution to the U.S.
Global Change Research Program, the National Science Foundation's Division of
Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research initiative, Geospace
Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal of supporting basic research into the
dynamical and structural properties of geospace, leading to the construction of
a global geospace model with predictive capability. The subjects of the first
GEM campaign are the magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and
the connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the ionosphere.
The cusp region is a rich source of ULF waves spanning the frequency spectrum
from near dc to above 1Hz. This is a grant to study the ULF wave spectrum at
cusp stations in conjugate hemisphere in order to investigate the conjugacy of
the cusp at these sites and to identify wave generation mechanisms associated
with the cusp.
