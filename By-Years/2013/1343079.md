This project focuses on a smartphone-based data acquisition system which has
evolved from a multisensory laboratory research system. The project involves
applying objective data collection and analytics to detect and quantify gait
speed, postural stability, and dynamic stability using readily accessible
smartphones for low cost evaluations. The approach provides both short and long
term advantages over traditional methods by removing inter-observer variability
and by allowing for a big data approach to improve assessments. Over time as
data are collected through the STS database, better clinical decision making
will be enabled through algorithm refinement. In addition to strengthening the
risk assessment result, this approach has the ability to improve the
availability of accurate point of care assessments by removing the need for
specialist training and facilities. The long term objectives of this effort are
to improve treatment outcomes and quality of life by replacing subjective data
with objective, information-rich assessments. It is anticipated that long term
cost of care will be reduced accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study has
the potential for both societal benefits and as technological advancements in
gait and stability measures. The system can enable the health care community to
implement widespread gait and stability evaluations as part of the clinical
decision making process. Though currently used, these tests are typically
restricted to populations with access to large gait laboratories. Increased
access may lead to broader use from Cardiac assessment to rehabilitation, to
prosthetics training and fitment, and others. The longer term broader impact is
the applicability of centralized objective assessment data and long-term outcome
for use in medical diagnoses and risk assessments. By providing access to large
scale objective data, patterns in test data that have heretofore been impossible
to see will become known and useful in better understanding the suitability of
different options for clinical care. Furthermore, access to this data by the
research community will open the door to large scale epidemiological studies
associated with gait and stability characteristics. Specifically, dynamic
stability measurements fundamentally extend the clinical horizons of clinical
gait and balance assessment.
