A combined Reactive Ion Etcher (RIE) / Plasma- Enhanced Chemical Vapor
Deposition (PE-CVD) apparatus will be purchased, for use in research in high
speed electronic and optoelectronic devices. The equipment will support the
research of at least nine faculty members. It is critical for at least eight on-
going research projects, including the investigation of heterostructure bipolar
and field- effect transistors, guided-wave and multiple quantum well modulators,
patterned epitaxial growth, metallization research and atomic diffusion studies
in III-V semiconductors. For future projects, the equipment will allow
investigation of epitaxial structures and devices scaled to micron submicron
dimensions. It provides a necessary complement to the advanced electron beam
lithography equipment and epitaxial crystal growth available at UCSD.
