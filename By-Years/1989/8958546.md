This project is concerned with three areas of database research; geometric data,
text and multimedia filing sytems and multiple disk file allocations. In search
of the best method to manage geometric data, several promising methods will be
analyzed and implemented for comparison. Emphasis will be given to space filling
curves and fractals, such as the Peano curve, the Hilbert curve, curves based on
Gray codes, because they lead to good distance preserving mappings. The second
project involves the development of a multimedia document filing system. The
novel characteristics of the system is that it will use signature files for text
retrieval, it will use optical disks for storage and it will allow static and
animated images in the documents. Declustering techniques that store a file on
multiple disks to maximize the parallellism will be studied. This goal is the
inverse of the first project. The problem is to group unsimilar records on the
same disk. A heuristic that uses information theory and error correcting codes,
because the codewords of such codes are deliberately unsimilar has been
developed. Preliminary experiments show that this heuristic consistently
outperforms older ad hoc heuristics.
