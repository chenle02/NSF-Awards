Machine learning is a central component in many data-driven research areas, but
its adoption is limited by the often complex choice of data processing, model,
and parameter settings. The goal of this project is to create software tools
that enable automatic machine learning, that is, solving predictive analytics
tasks without requiring the user to explicitly specify the algorithm or model
parameters used for prediction. The software developed in this project will
enable a wider use of machine learning, by providing tools to apply machine
learning without requiring knowledge of the details of the algorithms
involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, supported by the Office of Advanced
Cyberinfrastructure, and the Division of Computing and Communication
Foundations, extends the existing scikit-learn project, a machine learning
library for Python, which is widely used in academic research across
disciplines. The project will add features to this library to lower the amount
of expert knowledge required to apply models to a new problem, and to facilitate
the interaction with automated machine learning systems. The project will also
create a separate software package that includes models for automatic supervised
learning, with a very simple interface, requiring minimal user interaction. In
contrast to existing research projects, this project focuses on creating easy-
to-use tools that can be used by researchers without extensive training in
machine learning or computer science.
