This dissertation enhancement proposal outlines an approach to understanding
factors underlying the risk amplification process and the ways in which expert
opinions on risk perception combine with views of the public. Although the
influence of risk perceptions on public policy has been a popular topic for
researchers over the past decade, most of the analytical work has employed a
small set of methods (e.g., factor analysis) and has emphasized descriptive
rather than prescriptive elements of the attitude formation process. The
proposed research will attempt to use alternative data- interpretation methods,
such as partial least squares and covariance structure models, to review
existing data sets; these methods are thought to provide a stronger basis for
developing general structural models that could provide useful theoretical
insights. In addition, the project will collect additional data from an applied
setting that will be used to test alternative hypotheses about the risk
amplification process.
