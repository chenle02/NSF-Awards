In many complex problems related to discovery, detection, and diagnosis,
researchers and practitioners alike are continually faced with the question
?What data should I gather next?? When the possibilities for data collection are
overwhelming, and experiments or measurements are costly or time-consuming, this
question becomes all the more critical.&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates
guided sensing algorithms, which make recommendations about the next
measurements to gather, with the understanding that a domain expert makes the
final decision. Motivated by applications in emergency response and high-
throughput cell-based analysis, this work develops new methods for guided
sensing that account for temporal and task-based constraints, missing data, and
environmental noise as well as human error.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
makes two primary technical contributions. First, it generalizes classical
query-based learning algorithms to be robust to noise, with input and output
designed to match users? needs. To accomplish this, greedy decision tree
algorithms are designed with respect to new performance measures that reflect
task-specific objectives and constraints. Second, this work develops
interactive, nonparametric methods for statistical matching, a fundamental
problem in data fusion. The approach is grounded in new methods for
nonparametric clustering with missing data, and for unsupervised sequential
experimental design.
