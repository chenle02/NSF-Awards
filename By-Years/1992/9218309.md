This project will study algorithms and computational complexity of combinatorial
problems with an emphasis on parallel graph algorithms and approximation
algorithms. Besides the more traditional area of polynomial time approximations
to NP-complete problems, special attention will be given to efficient parallel
approximations obtained by NC algorithms. Such approximation algorithms are of
interest to problems in P too. The P-completeness proof of the maximum flow
problem shows that the least significant digit of the flow is difficult to
compute in parallel, but it is open whether good approximations could be
obtained in NC (i.e., for fast parallel algorithms). This would imply a
deterministic NC algorithm for bipartite matching. A seemingly fast candidate
algorithm based on least squares approximations is investigated, and its
extension to more general linear programming problems will be studied. The work
on the graph isomorphism problem will continue mainly by investigating the
performance of combinatorial algorithms involving only elementary group theory;
in particular, the performance of the k-tuple coloring algorithm for selected
parameterized classes of graphs.
