This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project probes a
variation geometric modeling and analysis framework based on concepts embodied
in finite element analysis. A procedural interpretation of geometric
dimensioning and tolerance information is formed as the stiffness matrix, loads
and material properties in order to create feature variation in size, position,
orientation, and form. The goal is to provide a standardized mathematical basis
for comprehensive, three-dimensional tolerance analysis. The inclusion of
structural deformations, thermal expansion, the discretized synergy with
coordinate measuring systems, the embodiment of robust design, and its intuitive
conceptual appeal is expected to advance the field of variation dimensional
management and simultaneous engineering. This innovation will enable the
engineering of three-dimensional objects (virtual parts) for optimal tolerance
allocation. Commercial applications are anticipated in many manufacturing
functions, including robust product design, simultaneous engineering, rapid
prototyping, cost reduction and quality enhancement, computer aided tolerance
analysis, and optimization for the design and manufacture of mechanical and
electrical systems.
