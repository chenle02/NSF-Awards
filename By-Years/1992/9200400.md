This award provides funds to the Graduate School at Baylor College of Medicine
(BCM) to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates SITE. Ten college
undergraduates selected from a nationwide pool of hundreds of applicants will be
exposed to a research atmosphere through their participation in a 10 week summer
career development program. Participants will be selected by a committee
composed of faculty from each basic science department. Students will be matched
with volunteer faculty mentors and become functioning members of their
laboratories. The unifying focus of the REU Site will be cellular signal
transduction. BCM has an outstanding reputation in this area of fundamental
biological research involving a number of basic science departments including
Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, and
Neuroscience. The projects that will be offered will involve subjects and
techniques that will be appropriate for students with a diversity of interests,
backgrounds, and levels of experience. The faculty of BCM have already gained
experience in designing undergraduate research projects and interacting with
college students through participation in a 3 year pilot program. The laboratory
oriented aspect of the program will be supplemented by students' participation
in research discussions, seminars, career development activities and
social/cultural activities sponsored through the SMART Program by the Graduate
School. NSF sponsored participants will have the benefit of interacting with
other undergraduates form throughout the nation who will be supported by other
sources and of entering an established career development program that
effectively promotes interest in science and prepares undergraduates to enter
research oriented careers.
