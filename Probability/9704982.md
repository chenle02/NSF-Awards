9704982 Resnick Sidney Resnick and Gennady Samorodnitsky will continue a program
of research organized around the theme of heavy tailed modeling and its
connections to long range dependence. Heavy tailed modeling frequently implies
infinite variances and thus departs from Gaussian methods. Broad themes of the
research program include parameter estimation and prediction in heavy tailed
models, model selection and confirmation, and the interplay between long range
dependence and heavy tails. Special attention is given to application areas
which include the financial and commodities markets and teletraffic networks
such as the World Wide Web. Both probabilistic modeling and statistical issues
are emphasized. Statistical issues include coping with changes of methods
implied by non-standard data features such as long range dependence, lack of
existence of moments and correlations, and dependencies which cannot be captured
by linear structures. Probabilistic models will be formulated and studied in an
attempt to qualitatively explain observed features of the data. The increasing
instrumentation of both financial markets and broadband data networks makes
possible the collection of huge quantities of data. Examination of some of the
data reveals features that classical statistics and probability models are not
used to dealing with and hence, this project has a dual purpose: (a) To develop
statistical tools which use the data to more reliably fit models and make
predictions; (b) To build probability models which provide qualitative insights
into the nature of the system under investigation. For example, modern broadband
networks exhibit characteristics much different from what is predicted by
classical models. A question which may be answered by this research is, "when is
it economically advisable to add service capacity to the network?".
