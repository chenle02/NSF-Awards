This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
is in the general area of metallacarboranechemistry. Metallacarborane compounds
are of substantial current interest because of the unusual types of chemical
bonds which they illustrate, and are also of practical importance because they
are precursors to important ceramics and can be used to synthesize new materials
with interesting electrical properties, such as one-dimensional conductors. The
major emphasis of the project is the synthesis of extended main group
heterocarborane systems that may exhibit interesting structural, electrical and
spectral properties. New charge-transfer complexes of main group
heterocarboranes will be synthesized and their structures obtained. Of
particular interest for these complexes are the factors which influence the
slippage of the apical heteroatom, the orientation of ligands bound to this
apical heteroatom, and the effect of ligand basicity on cluster bonding and
structure. Also to be explored are new areas of chemistry suggested by previous
work on the M(II)-inserted closo- and M(IV)-sandwiched commo-carboranes (M=Si
and Ge). This will include the synthesis of several multilevel stacked silicon,
germanium and mixed silicon/germanium sandwiched complexes and a study of their
electrical properties. The final area of heterocarborane chemistry to be
explored is direct synthetic approaches to extend, exploit and develop reactions
of main group heterocarboranes in which the apical heteroatom undergoes
predominantly nonreductive substitution reactions with a variety of main group
and transition metals.
