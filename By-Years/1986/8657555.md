Hopkins has recently been working out consequences of the nilpotence theorem in
stable homotopy theory. The nilpotence theorem determines the prime ideals of
the sphere spectrum thought of as a ring up to homotopy. The sphere is analogous
to the ring of integers, being an initial object in a suitable category of
rings. This analogy becomes more striking when one observes that the
"completions" of the sphere at its prime ideals acquire natural compact
topologies. He would like to assemble these completions into a global object
analogous to the ring of adeles in number theory. Such an object would be
appropriate for getting at large-scale aspects of stable homotopy theory. One
goal would be to construct L-series with analytic properties measuring the
homotopy groups of finite complexes and the homomorphisms induced by maps
between them. Fundamental to this is a family of cohomology theories
generalizing K-theory, and a basic problem is to represent them geometrically
with "generalized vector bundles". A theorem of Atiyah relates the K-theory of
the classifying space of a finite group to its character ring. D. Ravenel and
Hopkins have recently generalized the notion of character and proved an analogue
of Atiyah's result for these exotic K-theories. It is hoped that construction
will shed light on what "generalized vector bundles" should be. All of this
activity falls under the general heading of exploring and perfecting algebraic
techniques for treating qualitative features of spaces, e.g. connectedness,
knottedness, stability, and so forth. Such features can be every bit as
important for applications as are the usual features examined by methods of
classical analysis.
