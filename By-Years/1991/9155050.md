The University of Wisconsin @ Superior will initiate a five-week, residential
Young Scholars project in Mathematics, Chemistry and the Life Sciences which
will provide science enrichment activities for 20 precollege students entering
grades 11 and 12. This summer program will emphasize research participation in
mathematical modeling and exploratory data analysis involving acid rain data.
Students will use techniques of exploratory data analysis and linear regression
to analyze National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) data. Participants
will use computers to develop models of the pH of acid rain. Students will be
introduced to the sources of pollutants, the chemistry of acid deposition, and
the effects of acidification. During a two-day campout near acid- sensitive
lakes in Wisconsin, students will inspect an NADP sampling station and the
Little Rock acidification project.
