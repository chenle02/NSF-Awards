This action funds a Presidential Young Investigator award for five years. The
major field of research is the biodegradation of the aromatic polymer, lignin.
Areas to be studied are the enzymology and molecular biology of oxygen
activation and free radical reactions during lignin degradation by the wood-
destroying fungus Phanerochaete. Lignin is the biopolymer that holds together
the cellulose and hemicellulose fibers in woody tissues and is removed in the
paper pulping process. The biological mechanism employed by the fungus is
unknown but could be exploited to great economic and environmental advantage.
