This project will establish adult lecture-discussion series on scientific topics
at libraries throughout the United States, modeled after the "Lets Talk About
It" humanities series offered by the American Library Association. Programs and
program materials will be extensively tested and evaluated in Colorado libraries
before introduction into libraries in five additional states, followed by
national distribution. This program seeks to make effective use of libraries for
informal science education. Libraries are highly effective neighborhood
resources that are well positioned to offer programs and services, but that have
in the past offered few science- related programs. This project's combination of
prepared packages of lecture discussion series organization materials and the
use of local scientists and engineers as speakers and discussion leaders should
substantially increase the science offerings of public libraries. An award of $
98,533 for FY87 is recommended.
