9453668 Woolery The Dallas Urban Systemic Initiative (DUSI) has as its core a
vision that seeks to provide the mathematics and science fundamentals which will
permit all students to participate fully in a technological society and enable a
significantly greater number of Dallas students to pursue careers in
mathematics, science, engineering, and technology. The DUSI has three major
components: (1) the development of a new management structure for the Dallas
Independent School District (DISD) based on the principles of Total Quality
Management; (2) the development and implementation of a theme-based, K-12
science, mathematics and technology (SMT) curriculum and; (3) an effective use
of technology to advance the teaching of the SMT curriculum. The management
structure will be developed jointly by the DISD and experts provided by the
District's community partners. The new curriculum will be developed by teams of
master teachers, educators and science and mathematics professionals from the
community and will include the use of process oriented, student centered
pedagogy. The reforms brought about by DUSI will be supported by continuous
professional development for all teachers and by the extensive use of
educational technology in all classrooms. The District will implement policy
changes and redirect its resources to further support the plan. Resources have
already been, and will continue to be, provided by the District's academic and
corporate partners.
