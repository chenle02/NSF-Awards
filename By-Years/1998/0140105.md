This proposal requests support for a group at Michigan State University for a
program of research and education in experimental elementary particle physics
based on the CDF experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron proton-antiproton collider
and on the ATLAS experiment at the proton-proton Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at
Cern, Geneva. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MSU group has been a member of the CDF
experiment since 1992. The group has major responsibilities to the Run II
upgrades for the new plug calorimeters, to the new central tracker, to the muon
system upgrade and to a new central pre-radiator detector. They are actively
engaged in the analyses of QCD physics. The group's work on ATLAS
&lt;br/&gt;involves the construction and testing of the hadron calorimeter
subsystem, involving scintillator tiles and optical
fibers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Members of the MSU group are involving
undergraduates and high school teachers and students in their research
activities. The group is a member of QuarkNet, the multi-institutional effort to
involve high school teachers and their students in particle physics
research.&lt;br/&gt;
