The investigators will develop and apply the method of singular value
decomposition to interpret measurements made by a digital ionosonde. Both the
Doppler velocity and spatial location of ionospheric echoes can be obtained by
this method. The technique is based on measurements made in a few tens of
seconds with a sweep-frequency sounding. Existing data from the Utah State
University mid-latitude Bear Lake Observatory will be analyzed as well as data
obtained during an ionospheric heating campaign in Alaska during the Fall of
1992. The Doppler velocities will be compared with measurements of the neutral
wind from a Fabry-Perot interferometer and with the meridional component of the
neutral wind derived from model calculations.***
