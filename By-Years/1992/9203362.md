This research focuses on differential equations and differential geometry. The
research involves the study of manifolds without conjugate points, sharp
isoperimetric inequalities for manifolds of various dimensions, degenerate
systems of partial differential equations (especially equations of prescribed
curvature, the geometry of isospectral manifolds, certain classes of minimal
submanifolds, and certain applications of geometry to physiology. In general,
this research concerns mathematical models of the Riemannian geometry of
manifolds. Some of this research has application to physiology; for example, the
traditional treatment of gallstones is cholecystectomy (removal of the
gallbladder). However, lithotripsy (fragmentation) and dissolution of gallstones
has been advanced as an alternative in recent years. The investigators on this
award are involved in developing a sophisticated mathematical model which
predicts the behavior of fragments in solvent over time. The model predicts the
evolution of the stone/solvent interface and is a modification of the curvature
flow in differential geometry studied by many researchers.
