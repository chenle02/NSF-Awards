ABSTRACT The primary objective of this project is to produce an Austronesian
comparative dictionary with between 5,000 and 5,500 base entries and about 2,000
additional affixed forms. Secondary objectives include the creation of an
electronically acessible data-base which can serve a variety of purposes
(studies of sound change in particular daughter languages, statistical studies
of reconstructed forms, etc.). Data will be drawn from about 120 attested
languages, all of which have been used by the PI in past publications. For
reasons of time the project will be largely limited to integrating about 220
pages of unpublished pilot study material with various scattered publications
and a critical reassessment of the material in Otto Dempwolff, Vergleichende
Lautlehre des austronesischen Wortschatzes (1938). The published result will
contain well over twice the number of entries in Dempwolff (1938) in an up-to-
date orthography, a reverse English- Austronesian Index, and the following
features which are not found in Dempwolff: 1. affixed forms, 2. an explicit
indication of relative time-depth for all etyma, 3. detailed semantic
reconstructions, 4. annotations to the reconstructions, 5. an appendix of
submorphemic roots. It is anticipated that the results will be of great and
lasting value not only to Austronesian specialists, but also to long-range
comparativists and to social anthropologists and prehistorians interested in
island Southeast Asia and the Pacific.
