Developing an understanding of the origin and maintenance of sexual
reproduction is currently considered one of the foremost theoretical problems of
evolutionary biology. Why do organisms continue to "waste" resources and
"sacrifice" more rapid population growth by the production of males? Learning
the answers requires studying the opposite life-history strategy, thelytokous
parthenogenesis, a process in which female progeny are produced from
unfertilized eggs. Previous studies showed that the oribatid mite taxon
Nothroidea contains the largest known grouping of parthenogenetic animals; many
of the included families contain no sexual species at all. For a long time it
has been thought that without sexuality an organism cannot create the genetic
flexibility necessary to survive and evolve; supposedly, it is an evolutionary
"dead-end" at least in the long term. The investigators will use modern methods
to show that populations of these parthenogenetic mites do have substantial
genetic variability. With these results, combined with previous studies of
evolutionary relationships among these mites, the investigators will show that
parthenogenesis is not always a simple, evolutionary short-cut to eliminate the
"waste" involved in sexual reproduction. If whole groups of animals have evolved
in the absence of sex, then the future search for the underlying mechanism
should indirectly increase our understanding of sexual reproduction itself.
