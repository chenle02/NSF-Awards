The research goal is to model the dynamic vibratory motion of the vocal folds
using an interactive, three dimensional vocal fold model, whose parameters can
be adjusted by the researcher to interactively test new hypotheses concerning
voice production. The methodology includes spectral shaping and noise modeling
of fricatives, plosives and affricatives as well as nonlinear dynamic modeling
of vocal fold motion. A major motivation for this model is that imaging and
other methods for measuring aspects of vocal fold vibratory motion are difficult
tasks that involve probes inserted into the throat. The vocal fold model will be
tested using an articulatory speech synthesizer developed by the author under
previous NSF sponsorship. The significance of this interactive model is that its
features and parameters can be modified and are related to physiological
characteristics of the speech production process. Three applications for the
research results are training aids for the hearing impaired, methods to improve
the design of speech production systems for the vocally impaired, and improved
speech coding based on articulatory movement.
