Symbolic computation is exact -- the result of a computation is guaranteed
correct. This comes at a cost -- the computations are sometimes very slow and/or
memory intensive; at times, the correct results of a computation are too huge to
be of use. Numerical computation, on the other hand, is faster, and, on well
conditioned input problem instances, one can expect correct solutions in the
sense of backward error analysis. The numerical approach has been very
successful in solving a wide spectrum of computational problems in science and
engineering. However, there are situations where this approach is not completely
satisfactory. In several applications of polynomial system solving arising in
areas such as geometric modeling and kinematics, one needs the exact answer to a
given problem instance and not to a near-by instance. On the flip side, in many
application problems, the input polynomial system is not known exactly but to
within small error bounds. This changes the nature of questions that can be
asked of a solver. For instance, a question such as ``does a given system of
polynomial equations have a root of multiplicity r?'' changes to ``is the given
system of polynomial equations near a system that has a root of multiplicity
r?'' with respect to some appropriate measure of nearness. Existing
symbolic/numeric algorithms are not equipped to handle such questions well. Some
of the issues that need to be addressed in this framework are: characterization
of the solutions to a system of polynomial equations/inequalities in the
presence of small input errors; design of efficient algorithms for solving
polynomial systems that work in limited (or adaptive) precision; understanding
the factors that affect the stability of these algorithms; investigation of ways
to arrange the sometimes independent symbolic phase and numerical phase in
polynomial system solving to take maximum advantage of the strengths of each
other. This project investigates some specific instance s of polynomial system
solving in the above framework with particular focus on approximate polynomial
greatest common divisors and several special families of systems of polynomials.
A new parametric minimization technique is being studied and applied to the
approximate GCD problem and several of its variants. The concept of generic
Groebner bases is introduced and in combination with eigenvalue computations,
their effectiveness in the approximate solving of certain special families of
polynomial systems is being investigated. The investigation of generic Groebner
bases throws fresh light on some well-known unresolved issues in Groebner base
theory. The new techniques will be applied to polynomial systems arising in
geometric modeling and kinematics.
