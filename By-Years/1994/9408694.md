Abstract - Ciric - 9408694 Traditional process synthesis involves optimizing the
steady state economic performance of a chemical process. Stability analysis and
control system design are performed after the flowsheet structure, equipment
sizes, and nominal operating parameters have been specified. The objective of
this work is to incorporate controllability issues into process design. The idea
is to use an optimization based test to screen out process designs that are
unstable or difficult to control. The test is a non-local optimization-based
test of dynamic stability that asks whether a dynamic system will always remain
within the control neighborhood. The test is flexible and can be applied to
systems with parameter uncertainty, to constrained dynamic systems, or to
systems with discrete dynamic modes. The work will embed this optimization-based
test for stability within a larger optimization problem that seeks an economical
design. The PI plans to solve the resulting bi-level optimization problem with a
dual-temperature simulated annealing approach. Four specific problems will be
investigated: heat exchanger network synthesis, heat integrated distillation
systems, heat integrated reactor networks, and homogeneous azeotropic
distillation.
