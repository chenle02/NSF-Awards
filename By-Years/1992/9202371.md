The PIs wish to install and operate a partial reflection drifts and a meteor
radar over a three-year period at Sondre Stomfjord, Greenland. Goals include
studying high-latitude dynamics in the height range from approximately 60 to 110
km. The cooperative research effort with Clemson University and the University
of Colorado will include the study of seasonal variations in tidal amplitudes
and phases, gravity wave characteristics, climatology, and fluxes, and the
scattering mechanisms producing the partial reflections.
