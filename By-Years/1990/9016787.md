This research is aimed at developing a reliable manufacturing process to
fabricate fine superconducting, flexible wires capable of carrying current
densities in the order of 10,000 amperes/square centimeters under zero field and
at least 1,000 amperes/square centimeters in one Tesla magnetic field. The
research encompasses processing issues, including the parameters controlling
toughness of the engineered material, the role of thermomechanical treatment on
current density and the understanding of the critical material microstructural
parameters and their relationship to the processing procedures. The much sought
after characteristic of design of materials and materials processing operations
to produce microstructures for optimized (superconducting) performance will be
obtained from this research.
