Partial support is being provided for the detailed design of a long-baseline,
multiple-telescope interferometer array operating at visible wavelengths. This
award follows a four-year feasibility and design concept effort. A cooperative
venture between Georgia State University's Center for High Angular Resolution
Astronomy (CHARA) and the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) of the Georgia
Institute of Technology, the CHARA Array will consist of seven 1-m aperture
telescopes in a VLA-type configuration contained within a circle of 400 m
diameter. The Array will provide a limiting resolution of 0.2 milliarcsec. The
primary scientific program will be directed at the fundamental astrophysics of
single and multiple stars, but the Array will be applicable to problems in all
areas of contemporary astronomy. A significant fraction of observing time will
be open to the U.S. astronomical community with an emphasis on developing
methods for very high resolution imaging of broad classes of extended objects.
Thus the CHARA Array will serve as a prototype for next-generation imaging
arrays built as national facilities on the ground and in space.
