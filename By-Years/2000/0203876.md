Proposal Number 0203876&lt;br/&gt;Title: "Smart Event Models and
Architectures"&lt;br/&gt;Gail E. Kaiser, Columbia
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates wide-area
publish/subscribe event system models and architectures. The focus is on two new
models called Smart Events and Active Events, and an event bus architecture
called Virtual Private Event Networks (VPENs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smart events
are associated with a structural type model (a grammar or schema), and a
semantic model that defines the processing to be performed on the structural
subcomponents. Smart events are routed via content-based messaging, where
subscriptions may specify complex patterns indicating the events of interest.
Active events include their semantic model directly as mobile code. Active
events operate as&lt;br/&gt;mobile agents transported (conceptually) under their
own power point-to-point. Smart events may optionally include active event
substructures, enabling content-based messaging to be applied to this subset of
active events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VPENs extend multi-protocol label switching
(MPLS) protocols and mechanisms to the application layer, to improve the
performance of content-based routing by preplanning label switched paths when
publisher advertisements as well as consumer subscriptions are available. VPENs
also add encryption-based security and privacy in the style of virtual private
networks (VPNs).&lt;br/&gt;
