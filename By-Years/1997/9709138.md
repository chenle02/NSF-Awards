Tayfun Sonmez Project Abstract In this research three related projects are
conducted. In each project, the design and analysis of various mechanisms are
carried out for different classes of matching problems. In the first project two
notions of manipulation are formulated for centralized two- sided matching
markets (Gale &amp; Shapley (1962)). Matching activities both before and after
thee centralized market are often observed in these markets. Notions of
manipulation via withholding positions and manipulation via pre-arranged matches
are introduced and unraveling behavior is justified from an incentives point of
view. Environments yielding manipulation opportunities are analyzed and two
prominent mechanisms are evaluated based on their vulnerability to manipulation.
In the second project a mechanism es proposed for the allocation of housing.
Various properties of this mechanism are studied (including its efficiency and
fairness properties) and its axiomatic characterizations are obtained. A wider
class of problems which captures some real life complications in the allocation
of housing is introduced, and our proposed mechanism are extended to this wider
c lass. In the third project a new class of matching problems that models
centralized college admissions via standardized tests is introduced and a
mechanism that is used in some real life applications is studied. An alternative
mechanism based on the Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm is proposed
and is shown to be the only `reasonable` mechanism based on its efficiency and
fairness properties.
