Abstract (Zworski, 1216660)

This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants,
especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the "The
Weyl Law at 100" conference that will be held from September 19--22, 2012, at
the Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences in Toronto, Canada.
In 1912 Hermann Weyl published his paper establishing the Weyl law which gives
the leading asymptotic description for the counting function of eigenvalues of
the Dirichlet or Neumann Laplacian on a bounded domain in the Euclidean space.
He later conjectured the form of the second term in asymptotics of the counting
functions. After contributions by many mathematicians, among them, Courant,
Hilbert, Agranovitch, Levitan, Hormander, Seeley, Duistermaat, Guillemin,
Melrose and Sjostrand, the Weyl conjecture was solved by Ivrii in 1982. The
workshop is intended as a forward-looking celebration of the 100th anniversary
of Weyl's paper. Among the directions to be explored are the (conjectured)
connection between random matrix theory and high energy distribution of
differences between eigenvalues, probabilistic Weyl laws for non-self-adjoint
operators, distribution of scattering resonances and fractal Weyl laws, and
physical experiments related to quantum chaos and inverse problems.

All of the conference topics are central to analysis and are extremely active
areas of research. The conference will bring together a broad spectrum of
accomplished researchers thereby providing ample opportunities to develop
collaborative interactions, and the format of the meeting is such that young
people will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the
various conference activities.
