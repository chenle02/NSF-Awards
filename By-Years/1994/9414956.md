9414956 Taylor The Board on Physics and Astronomy, in collaboration with the
National Materials Advisory Board, has established a committee to carry out a
major study of the field of optical science and engineering (OS&amp;E), a
diverse interdisciplinary area of scientific and technological activity that is
playing an increasingly area of scientific and technological activity that is
playing an increasingly important role in driving economic growth. OS&amp;E is
emerging as a key enabling element for a host of applications that address
critical national needs such as manufacturing, information technology, health
care, transportation, environment, and education. It is also a vital area of
frontier scientific research. The purpose of the study is to define the field of
optical science and engineering, assess the state of the art in research and
technology, project the future impact of OS&amp;E on national needs, identify
institutional and educational innovations needed to optimize the contributions
of OS&amp;E to national needs, identify how public policy influences the ability
of the field to meet these needs, and examine trends in private and public
research activities as compared to those in other countries. The study is being
supported jointly by NSF, NIST, and ARPA. The Foundation of the report will be
based on the conduct of 5 major workshops; each workshop would be organized
according to national needs and would address issues that cross OS&amp;E
scientific and technical disciplinary boundaries. ***
