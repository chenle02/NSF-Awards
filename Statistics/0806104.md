Many observed time series processes are correlated and also exhibit volatility
clustering. Volatility clustering is the tendency of observations relatively
small in absolute value to be followed by other small observations, and the
tendency of observations relatively large in absolute value to be followed by
other large observations. Autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) models, the
standard linear time series models for stationary data, cannot alone be used to
describe the dependence in these series because ARMA processes with independent
and identically distributed errors have constant conditional variances.
Nonlinear white noise models with time-dependent conditional variances, most
notably generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic(GARCH) models,
are, therefore, often used to describe the ARMA errors of time series with these
features. This project addresses ARMA-GARCH model estimation. Specifically, the
investigator is researching the distribution for least squares estimators of
ARMA model parameters when the white noise error process is dependent and heavy-
tailed. A rank-based technique for estimating GARCH model parameters that is
both robust and efficient is also being developed. Both standard symmetric GARCH
models and asymmetric GARCH models are being considered, and model order
selection procedures are being designed.

Correlated processes exhibiting volatility clustering include, for example,
atmospheric measurements and economic indicators. In practice, stationary time
series of this nature are often first modeled as an ARMA process using least
squares and then, if the ARMA residuals exhibit conditional heteroskedasticity,
a GARCH model is fit to the residuals. The investigator is developing theory
behind this standard procedure for fitting ARMA-GARCH models and developing a
robust and efficient GARCH estimation technique. The project results are,
therefore, improving the efficiency of model-fitting and enhancing the
understanding of corresponding parameter estimates. The overall project impact
is a greater understanding of physical and economic systems.
