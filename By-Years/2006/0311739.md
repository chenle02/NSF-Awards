Mathematical Sciences (21) In this project faculty at California State
University at Long Beach are partnering with colleagues at Cerritos and Orange
Coast Community Colleges to adapt the WebWorK homework assessment system for use
in several pre-service teacher preparation courses. This system (developed by
faculty at the University of Rochester under DUE-9950567 and DUE-0126940) serves
as an electronic homework helper, giving students immediate feedback, allowing
for multiple attempts, permitting the individualization of problems for each
student, and recording responses to enable review of student progress.
Concurrent with this effort are professional development workshops for faculty
at the participating institutions. Embedding the use of this system in these key
courses is enabling the project team to achieve several interrelated goals: 1)
improvement in the general technological literacy of both the undergraduates in
the pre-service courses and the college lower division mathematics teachers; 2)
preparation of the pre-service teachers to be on-site trainers in their schools
and thus eventually to use WeBWorK in their own courses; and (3) creation of a
WeBWorK user manual for use in technology classes for pre-service teachers.
