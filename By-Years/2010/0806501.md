The Proteomics and Functional Genomics (PFG) Scholarship program is supporting
academically talented but financially needy students, and reaching out to
underrepresented groups. Students are receiving interdisciplinary training
integrating biology, chemistry and computer science. These students will
eventually attend graduate school or obtain jobs in proteomics and functional
genomics or related fields. Students are recruited from high school through
advertising and contacts with high school science teachers. The project is aided
by the Office of Admissions, UW System Women and Science Program, and UW Oshkosh
Science Outreach. The project is supporting 8-10 students during the first year
and 5-6 students in each of the three subsequent years. A strong sense of
community is being established among students by enrolling all students in
single introductory science course sections, housing students on the same
dormitory floor, providing staff-hosted social events, and working with peer
mentors. Students are provided with research/internship opportunities, faculty
mentors, and full use of the Career Services Center. The project extends a
successful REU Site in proteomics and functional genomics at UW Oshkosh.
