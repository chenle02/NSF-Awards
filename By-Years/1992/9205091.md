The regulatory mechanisms utilized for the control of expression of the
rudimentary gene of Drosophila melanogaster will be examined with a combination
of genetic and molecular approaches. The underlying hypothesis is that there
exist a number of trans- acting regulatory genes which interact with the
rudimentary gene to produce the developmental program of gene expression. The
tissue- specific control regions within the 5'end of the rudimentary gene will
be more precisely mapped and characterized. Fusion proteins will be isolated and
used to generate antibodies to the wild-type mod(r)1 and mod(r)2 proteins. These
antibodies will be used to determine the tissue distribution and the cellular
localization of the wild-type proteins. Additionally, the antibodies will be
used for the characterization and purification of the gene products. Lastly, the
null phenotypes and normal functions of mod(r)1 and mod(r)2 will be determined.
Mutants which have deficiencies and have a null phenotype will be isolated and
characterized. cDNA's will continue to be isolated and sequenced in an effort to
determine the biological function of these genes. %%% An understanding of the
many ways in which genes are regulated so that the precise developmental pattern
of a living organism almost invariably occurs is critical to our insight into
life processes.
