The aim of this project is to provide upgraded and innovative computing
capabilities for courses in electrical engineering. Plans have been made to
establish a high- speed fiber optic backbone for all departments. One high-
speed workstation, in a cluster environment, is being provided for each
department. A few smaller workstations (four per department, and 20 for the
entire College) are being located around each high speed workstation in each
department. These workstations handle some computing locally, but, if the load
increases, jobs will be submitted to the cluster. The addition of industrial-
type workstations permits: courses in computer communications, numerical
methods, etc. to be enhanced; students and faculty to have access to image
processing, data visualization, parallel processing, computer networking and
multimedia document processing. Students are being provided with access to the
Internet and a Unix operating system environment. Also, faculty and students
have access to updated and upgraded systems which support innovative senior
projects and research.
