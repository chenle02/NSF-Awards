During the past few years, there has been increasing interest in the development
of processing techniques based on the high-order statistics of the signals.
These techniques take into account, in a systematic manner, the non-Gaussian
aspects of the signals. Digital communication signals represent a particularly
important class of non-Gaussian signals for which high-order processing
techniques appear to be well suited. Adaptive channel equalizers are an
indispensable part of modern digital communication systems which attempt to
correct the distorting effect of the channel to allow higher transmission rates.
The objective of the proposed research is the development and analysis of high-
order processing techniques, focusing on their applications to communications
processing. As a particularly promising application of these techniques, this
proposal presents a novel approach to channel equalization, based on recent
theoretical results on parameter estimation based on high-order statistics
developed by the principal investigator. The proposal will also investigate
other applications of high-order statistics to communications signal processing
including signal analysis, signal detection, and signal design.
