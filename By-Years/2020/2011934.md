The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and
study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the
preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue
STEM graduate programs and/or careers. This project will take place at Virginia
State University. It is expected that learning outcomes will be improved leading
to an overall increase in retention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to
build on the existing facilities and expertise at Virginia State University
(VSU) to establish an interdepartmental and interdisciplinary program in
genomics and bioinformatics. Faculty members involved in the project come from
biology, mathematics, and computer science, and will design and offer a rigorous
curriculum covering all three areas. The students in the program will receive
state-of-the-art and practical training, particularly in genomics, statistics,
and computer programming. This training will be achieved through the rigorous
curriculum, a series of well-designed summer workshops, various research
projects throughout the duration of the program, and scientific exchanges with
peers and other scientists at research conferences. Students will also receive
advisement and career guidance in this new and high demand
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
