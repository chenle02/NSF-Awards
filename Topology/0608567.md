Culler and Shalen are continuing their study of the topological structure of
hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The context for this work is the on-going unification of
the geometric and topological theories of 3-manifolds. The results can be viewed
in terms of the theorem, which is a consequence of work of Gromov, Thurston and
Jorgensen, that the set of volumes of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds is a well-
ordered set of real numbers. The proposed research aims to understand the
topological properties of the 3-manifolds with volume less than a given
threshold value. Alternatively, the goal is to determine the volume which
corresponds to the ordinal at which a given topological property first appears.
The techniques used range from very classical topological methods, such as a
refined version of the tower construction used in proving the Loop Theorem, to
the most recent developments, including the proof of the Marden Tameness
conjecture and Perelman's estimates on the change of volume under Ricci flow.
Interesting connections with group theory and combinatorial topology are also
involved.

The spaces which are being studied in this research project, namely
3-dimensional manifolds, serve as mathematical models of the spatial aspect of a
possible physical universe. New connections between modern physics and the
mathematical theory of 3-manifolds are being discovered at a rapidly
accelerating pace. The mathematical theory has traditionally been divided into
topology and geometry, where geometry focuses on quantities which can be
measured, such as lengths, angles, areas or volumes, and topology focuses on
global properties that are preserved even when the geometric features are
distorted. However, these two aspects of the subject are closely related, and
there are many examples of results which relate geometric properties and
topological properties. Recent mathematical achievements, beginning with the
Mostow Rigidity theorem and continuing up to the recent proofs of Marden's
Tameness Conjecture and Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, are leading toward
a unification of the geometrical and topological theories of 3-manifolds. The
research supported by this grant concentrates on hyperbolic manifolds, a class
which includes the vast majority of 3-manifolds with a homogeneous geometric
structure, and aims to understand in a quantitative sense how topological
complexity depends on the geometrical volume of the manifold.
