9725577 Kirschvink A coherent, global paleogeography of Cambrian time has begun
to emerge during the last decade, although numerous questions remain. This
project is aimed at resolving one of these-whether the Cambrian rocks from the
Anti-Atlas Mountains in Morocco, along the northern margin of the west African
craton, originated on this craton or was not yet a part of the Gondwana assembly
until after the early Cambrian. Paleomagnetic poles will be obtained and
corrected in order to test for Cambrian allochtoneity between these rocks and
the rest of Gondwana. Results are expected to considerably clarify the timing
and geometry of the final assembly of the Gondwana supercontinent.
