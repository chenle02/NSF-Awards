This research project will use anonymized real time cellular phone location data
combined with other sources of data to investigate the employment effects of the
COVID19 pandemic. The research will develop an innovative theoretical model of
job destruction and job creation, at the granular level, in response to the
pandemic and use the data assembled to estimate the model. The model does not
only account for job destruction and creation at various locations but also
changes in the types of jobs created as well as the changing industries in which
the jobs are created at the various locations. The new model is likely to
influence how researchers investigate the effects of pandemics on employment at
various locations. The research results will provide important inputs into how
to craft policies to counter the employment effects the current as well as
future pandemics particularly, and economic disruptions generally. The results
will also establish the US as the global leader in understanding the employment
effects of pandemics and how to develop policies to reduce their
effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project builds on existing high
frequency anonymized cellular telephone data at the MTI to investigate the job
destruction and job creation effects of COVID19. The PIs will combine the MTI
data with other data sources (e.g. HERE, QCEW, etc.) and use the data and
Dingell &amp; Nieman method to construct occupational composition indices based
on all 968 Occupational Employment Survey (OES) that allows for teleworking at
various locations. The PIs will develop a model of job destruction and job
destruction of the various job categories at particular locations. The PIs will
then use the indices based on the data constructed to estimate the job
destruction/creation model at the granular level. The panel structure of the
data allows the PIs to study the short term as well as the long term employment
effects of economic shocks. Besides the methodological innovation in this study,
the results will also provide guidance on policies to counter the effects of the
current and possibly future pandemics. The results will also establish the US as
the global leader in understanding the employment effects of pandemics and how
to develop policies to reduce its effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
