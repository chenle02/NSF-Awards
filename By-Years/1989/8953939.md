The calculus curriculum is being revised to provide students with more complex,
real world problems, to help them develop the skills involved in performing
multi-step reasoning, and to help them learn to express mathematical ideas
precisely and coherently. A unique computational environment is being developed
in which students use the computer as both a tutoring device and a computational
aid. The system, called the Calculus Companion, consists of a user-friendly
interface to the computer algebra system MAPLE and numerical computation and
graphical display routines.
