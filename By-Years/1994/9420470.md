9420470 McKeown Research will be carried out in high energy electron scattering
with the foals of determining the spin and flavor structure of nucleons,
observing manifestations of quark degrees of freedom in quasielastic scattering
from nuclei, and testing the hypothesis of color transparency in nuclear
reactions. Additional experiments will be carried out with high energy photons
and high energy protons to study the onset and manifestation of quark degree of
freedom, and the up- down-antiquark distribution in the nucleon. Low energy
studies will be carried out with beams of light ion to study reactions of
importance in understanding stellar burning of helium, big-bang nucleosynthesis,
and the so- called solar neutrino deficit problem. Theoretical studies will be
carried out in support of these experiments and in other forefront areas
including: Monte-Carlo shell model calculations, fusion reactions, pion
interferometry, and coherent- and squeezed- state pion emission. Education of
graduate students and postdocs is a strong component in every aspect of this
umbrella grant to operate the Caltech Kellogg Laboratory. ***
