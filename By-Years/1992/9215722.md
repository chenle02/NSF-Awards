The ultimate goal of this project is to develop Computer-Aided Value Engineering
(CAVE) technology to automate, support or otherwise leverage the process of
recommended more cost-effective alternative facility designs. One unexplored way
to generate more reliable alternative designs is to utilize the owner's and
designer's performance and functional intent. The specific objective of this
project is to couple artificial intelligence techniques with computer-aided
design technology to aid in the elicitation, representation, and manipulation of
implicit intent with the purpose of generating and pricing within a life-cycle
context plausible value engineering design alternatives. Value Engineering is a
process which if properly employed can help the US Architecture-Engineering-
Construction industry regain its world-wide cost effectiveness. CAVE technology
is anticipated to influence the value engineering discipline as much as CAD
technology has influenced the facility design process.
