The proposed research will deal with problems that are on the boundary between
different fields of mathematics; harmonic analysis, ergodic theory, and number
theory. The problems occur in different contexts however a central role is
played by properties certain exponential sums and related methods of analytic
number theory, such as the Hardy-Littlewood method of exponential sums. One set
of problems concern maximal and singular integral operators associated with
polynomial surfaces on discrete nilpotent groups. These are discrete analogues
of problems harmonic analysis on Euclidean spaces, and also are naturally
connected to pointwise ergodic theory of non-commuting transformations.
Technically, a crucial role is played by an extension of the "circle method" to
an operator valued settings, which arises because of non-commutativity of the
underlying group. Another set of the proposed problems are in the settings of
additive number theory/combinatorics, as they are to show the existence of
certain structures in subsets of positive density, or in cells obtained after a
finite partitioning of integer lattices. The emphasis is on the Fourier analytic
approach to address certain problems in the multidimensional or nonlinear
settings.

Because of its interdisciplinary nature, the project is expected to have an
impact on the various fields involved. It aims utilize and extend several
techniques, some of which is recent and is still being developed. The emphasis
is on the interplay of techniques of the above fields, to attack open problems
of interest. The project would enable the PI to continue to support graduate
students and post-docs, and in general, to introduce young researchers to this
rapidly developing area of mathematics.
