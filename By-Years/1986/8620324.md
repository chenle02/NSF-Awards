The investigators propose a definitive experiment to resolve the controversy
regarding the origin of the "DX phenomenon" in n-type A1GaAs semiconductor.
Resolution of this question is crucial to the future development of high
performance III-V semiconductors. The two models for the DX center, leading to
loss of low temperature conductivity, predict different local geometries for
dopant atoms. We propose to use Mossbauer spectroscpopy to probe the local
environment of donor tellurium atoms in A1GaAs semiconductors at 77K. The
spectrum of undistorted substitutional donor sites will be distinguishable from
spectra of sites that are asymmetrically distorted or are associated with
vacancies or other defects. Consequently, a careful Mossbauer experiment should
be sufficient to distinguish between the models for the DX center.
