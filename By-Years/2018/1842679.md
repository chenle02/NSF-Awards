Contemporary scientific discovery depends upon easy access to data, and
associated sophisticated tools and applications, to enable consequential
research and education. Researchers who once worked in local, isolated
laboratories now routinely collaborate on a global scale. Technological advances
in data analysis techniques and cloud computing have enabled numerous science
research communities to advance and accelerate scientific discovery. The Cloud-
Ecosystem in a Box (CEB) project creates a community of practice among minority
serving institutions. CEB assists in training investigators and students in
diverse communities to migrate their scientific research activities to both
National Science Foundation (NSF)-supported experimental cloud computing
research testbeds, and to private sector cloud computing systems. This project
will train diverse communities in rich and complex emerging sources of data and
new advances in data analysis techniques, expanding the nation's information
technology workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CEB will develop a collaborative
community, initially composed of 10 institutions, which will generate conceptual
and methodological innovations in cloud computing research leveraging NSF funded
cloud and industry ecosystems. The activity will also create a means of: 1)
enabling and fostering innovative change within cloud computing training; 2)
sharing knowledge and resources as innovation takes place; 3) enabling
heightened outreach to diverse communities to build a vibrant pipeline for
students aspiring to enter information technology professions; and 4) strengthen
the ability to evaluate new research strategies leveraging these
resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
