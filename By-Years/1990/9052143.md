A new laboratory course in Molecular and Cellular Biology is being developed, in
which students use some of the major techniques employed in modern biology. The
laboratory exercises present the techniques in the context of biological
investigation, rather than as isolated demonstrations. The equipment purchased
includes UV-Vis spectrophotometers, chromatographic equipment, horizontal and
vertical gel apparatus, ultracentrifuge rotors, and DNA sequencing apparatus.
Use of these items gives students useful skills and teaches them the importance
of the associated techniques in biological research. This project should have a
significant impact on the quality of the graduates, making them better prepared
for graduate school, medical school, or employment in research laboratories or
biotechnology companies. The university will contribute an amount equal to the
award.
