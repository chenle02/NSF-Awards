The Women in Engineering, Science and Technology Program (WEST) at the New
Jersey Institute of Technology is increasing the number of women who transfer to
baccalaureate programs after receiving the AS degrees from New Jersey community
colleges. WEST has discovered that investing in faculty mentors of math-able
women is a long-term solution to the gender pipeline problem. It is currently
developing a model faculty mentoring program for six community colleges. In
addition, WEST is presenting four career days for 400 students, and presenting a
state-wide conference for 100 community college faculty on the topic of "Gender,
Engineering, Science and Technology." This conference will be videotaped and
broadcast nationally on the Community College Satellite Network and regionally
on the Cable Television Network as a program entitled "She Wants To Be An
Engineer."
