Computer vision measurements will be combined with analytical developments in
mechanics to obtain useful "hybrid" methods for analyzing the integrity of
structures ;itin-situ;ro. An accurate, three-dimensional non-contacting
measurement technique which can be used to compute small motions of an object,
with particular application to robots will be developed. Initial work will
center on the general optics equations and on appropriate simplifications
necessary for the intended applications. The improved non-contacting computer-
based measurement technique will be applied to investigate the microscale
motions of materials, yielding improved models of multilayer media, fracture
processes, etc.
