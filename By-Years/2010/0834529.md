Holistic Approach to Reliable Pervasive Systems



This project proposes a holistic approach to developing reliable pervasive
systems through three contributions:

(1) A unified view of a pervasive distributed system is proposed for debugging
purposes. This view overcomes the heterogeneous requirements for various
technologies. The key idea is to formulate all system artifacts, system wide or
local to a given node, static or temporal, independently of their granularity,
into relations. Programs are debugged by writing SQL-like queries over these
relations. A query compiler is developed that translates queries into system-
level or node-level replay requests, and in the meantime, instruments
application code to populate relevant relations. (2) Programming language
support is proposed to facilitate the tracking of dependencies among essential
events in the program. To that end, a simple language built on Java is proposed,
with annotations for high-level application events and their dependencies. This
represents one of the cornerstones for dealing with the large number of events
in dynamic pervasive applications. In addition, the integration with a
programming language allows the query compiler to verify parts of queries
referring to application-specific definitions. (3) Runtime and communication
support through specific overlay networks is investigated to efficiently
propagate events as well as causality information across nodes. At the node
level, an instrumented Java virtual machine is used to log and trace local
events in a runtime-adaptable manner. Such an adaptive event logging/tracing
strategy significantly reduces resource demands.

Involvement in computer science student organizations will be specifically
leveraged to promote undergraduate student research.
