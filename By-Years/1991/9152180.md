A four-term undergraduate course sequence, with a focus on VLSI design
techniques, is being developed with laboratory exercises to complement each
course. Standard cell techniques receive the major emphasis with other
techniques also being stressed. IC fabrication (using MOSIS) of prototype ICs is
being planned for incorporation in the laboratory coursework. Testability is
introduced at an early stage of the sequence, and emphasized through-out.
Equipment obtained includes five (5) Apollo workstations, using Mentor-Graphics
software, plus eight (8) 80386-based PCs using ORCAD. The goal is for the
students in the sequence to experience taking an IC design concept all the way
through analysis, simulation, design, fabrication and testing.
