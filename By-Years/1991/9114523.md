This research deals with damping of dynamic systems by means of thin fluid
layers and jet flow impingement. Vibration in mechanical systems is an
increasingly inhibiting factor in the quest for higher efficiency and
productivity, factors which often translate as increased speed and light weight
moving components. In earlier work, the principal investigator has demonstrated
that damping obtained through the use of fluid layers is particularly effective
at low frequencies. This project expands on that earlier work and attempts to
enhance the damping effects achieved therein. Two topics are investigated here,
comprising edge effects and free jet impingement effects. For the first topic,
an effort will be made to make the edge effects (steady vortex and jetting) a
dominant contributor to the damping. For the second topic, the plan is to study
the damping resulting from the interaction of a vibrating surface with free jets
impinging on it. The project contains an experimental component to verify the
analytical aspects of the research.
