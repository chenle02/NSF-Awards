*** 9731613 Weinreich This grant continues the theoretical and experimental
Musical Acoustics work that has gone on at the Physics Department of the
University of Michigan for well over twenty years. Specific study areas proposed
for this funding period include: a) The physics of wind instruments, including a
new application of nonlinear dynamics and the analysis of time series to an
investigation of the degrees of freedom of reeds, lip reeds, and vocal folds; b)
The "directional tone color" of violins, including design of special "DTC
loudspeakers" which mimic their directional characteristics' c) The physics of
"dissected instruments" (in which a computer link is inserted into the fast
oscillation loop of an instrument), including the coupling of a dissected violin
corpus to an actual violin; d) Research into the directional characteristics of
the reverberation of a room, with particular applications to architectural
acoustics. As in the past, this work has implications not only for fundamental
physical understanding and for the building of better musical instruments, but
also for other areas of science such as nonlinear vibration analysis, wave
propagation, and psychoacoustics. Its special merit in educating physicists is
that it constitutes the type of research in which even undergraduates can be
fruitfully involved. ***
