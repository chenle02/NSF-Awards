The objective of this project is to provide a complete package of KIDSPACE
hands-on science experiences to small and developing science centers across the
country through the National KIDSPACE Partnership Program. This project will
allow twelve (12) selected science centers to implement a complete, proven
education package geared toward young children at a fraction of the cost of
starting one from scratch. This project will provide comprehensive training to a
large core of educators within the science center field, and will support
continued research into the informal science education of young children through
an original Research Study and the formation of a national User's Group. Best of
all, this project will generate a wellspring of invaluable science-play
connections for hundreds of thousands of children to tale with them into
adulthood.
