9400572 Kamath The research builds upon previous work which involves the
construction of a generic, persistent object oriented "based model" of a system
that is maintained in a current state of accurate and detailed system
representation at all times. This base model is specific to an organization, and
supports modeling across several problem domains using multiple analysis and
optimization tools. This project will lead to the conceptualization and
development of a new, comprehensive, and cohesive modeling environment for
aiding manufacturing systems. In the past, this process has depended largely
upon a "brute force" approach of "cutting and trying". based upon as disjoint
mixture of methodologies, intuition, and judgement. The comprehensive modeling
environment well permit changes to the system to be considered at any time and
evaluated within the context of a total system analysis and evaluation.
