This dissertation enhancement grant provides partial support for a U.S.
graduate student, Scott Johnston, working under the guidance of Dr. John
Schwille, Assistant Dean of International Studies at Michigan State University,
to perform a study on the construction of mentor roles in science education
teachers in Zimbabwe. Mr. Johnston will examine A-level science teachers in
Zimbabwe participating in the Science Education In-Service Teacher Training
project (SEITT) to determine how these teachers incorporate the pedagogy and
concepts that they learn through SEITT into their own teaching styles and
mentoring relationships. The results of this project will provide important
feedback on the effectiveness of SEITT which will allow the project leaders to
revise the program while it is still in an early stage. Staff members of the
Science and Mathematics Education Department at the University of Zimbabwe will
collaborate with Mr. Johnston on this project. This study will make an important
contribution to the understanding of the development and usefulness of mentoring
roles for science education teachers. The grant will also provide support to
enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.
