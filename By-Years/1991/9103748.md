The basic goal of this research is ice formation in the atmosphere. The basic
approach includes experiments performed with an instrumented cloud chamber and
simulations using a numerical model. Experiments will focus on ice initiation by
natural aerosols from -5 to -40 degrees C, and for a range of humidity
conditions, both subsaturated and supersaturated with respect to water. Results
from these and previous studies of artificial ice nuclei will be incorporated
into numerical simulations of natural and seeded clouds, for comparison to
atmospheric observations.
