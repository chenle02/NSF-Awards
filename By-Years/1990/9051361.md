New technology is being brought into the teaching lab for pharmacology to allow
students to measure drug and electrolyte concentrations accurately, safely, and
easily with minimal hazardous waste. It adds an experimental component to the
teaching of pharmacokinetic concepts. Bench-top analyzers with multiple
analytical capabilities permit chemical testing of blood components in a
capillary tube with no plasma separtaion required. The system can be calibrated
and sample concentrations are determined photometrically by a microprocessor-
controlled program. The TDX system utilizes fluorescence plarization to perform
chemical analyses at body temperature. The Kodak DT system is a dry-chemistry
desk top analyzer with modules employing electrolyte and colorimetric tests to
provide precise levels of exogenous and endogenous substances. Each system
provides a print-out of sample results. These instruments are becoming more
prevalent in clinics and hospitals, but can also be used creatively in teaching.
The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
