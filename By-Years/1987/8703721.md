This research is structural investigation of the nucleation stage in multianion
oxynitride glass ceramic materials, e.g. barium-aluminum-silicon oxynitrides, or
magnesium-aluminum- silicon oxynitrides. The study will determine, using magic
angle sample spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, the relationship of local
microstructural units to nucleation phenomena. Glasses processed by conventional
melting or by sol-gel techniques will be chemically analyzed, and thermal
stability and microstructure will be determined. Differential thermal analysis,
x-ray diffraction, small angle x-ray scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance, and
electron microscopy will be used to characterize the specimens. The research
will provide the knowledge base needed to fabricate new glass and glass ceramic
materials having novel combinations of properties.
