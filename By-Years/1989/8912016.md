This proposal is to finalize the design of an acoustically tracked mid-depth
ocean floats designed by the investigator. SOFAR (sound fixing and ranging)
floats transmit sound pulses to a fixed receiver. These instruments (RAFOS,
SOFAR backward) - are tracked using fixed sources with receivers in the float
which is debriefed by satellite upon surfacing. Now that several experiments
have been successfully completed, this project will standardize the design and
make construction by others in the community feasible. Hundreds of these floats
will be deployed in the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) in the early
1990's.
