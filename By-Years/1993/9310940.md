Why are the two sexes different? The simple answer is steroid hormones. Steroid
hormones stimulate cell growth, sexual differentiation, and also trigger the
expression of sex-typical behaviors. One of their most important targets is the
brain. Until recently, it was thought that steroids exerted their effects
directly on gene expression by binding to receptors in the cell nucleus. It has
recently become clear that steroids act through nongenomic mechanisms as well.
These recent findings may necessitate a "paradigm shift" in the way research
into reproduction is conducted because it seems that the mechanisms of steroid
action are much more complicated than previously thought. At large scientific
meetings, practitioners of various disciplines tend to interact with each other
and do not necessarily become exposed to fast breaking developments that,
although relevant to their work, involve unfamiliar methods and expertise. The
purpose of this conference is to bring molecular investigators together with
behavioral neuroscientists to promote collaborations that can capitalize on
recent advances in our understanding of the mechanism of steroid hormone action.
