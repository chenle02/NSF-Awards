This proposal has two research goals. One is to study the genetic changes that
may be important in the formation of species and the other is to study the
factors that may influence the membership in communities. A related group of
yeast species which live in decaying plant parts will be used in the
investigation. Genetic studies of the yeasts will include evaluation of
chromosome, enzyme and DNA changes, while ecological studies will include
investigations on host chemicals, insect relationships and yeast-yeast
competitive interactions. This research should be important to basic science
because it will help us understand how species are formed and why species live
in specific habitats. Indirectly, the research will help clarify insect-
microorganism relationships that might aid in controlling pests as well as to
help understand how to manage plant pathogens.
