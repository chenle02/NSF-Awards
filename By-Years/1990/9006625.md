Glossopteris is a fossil plant group distributed widely among the southern
continents. Paleobotanists have studied the remains of this plant genus in
detail, but have never brought together the disparate observations of leaves,
seeds, and wood anatomy. Dr. Kathleen Pigg has located mineralized specimens
wherein different parts of individual plants have been preserved in association.
Careful study of these fossils may illuminate the anatomy of the Glossopteris
plant as a whole. Reconstructing the anatomy of Glossopteris species will have
wide impact. In addition to clarifying the confused taxonomy and classification
of disassociated plant parts, this research will document the nature of stem-
leaf connections, and the vein systems of individual leaves. These anatomical
features are critical to our understanding of this important plant group, and
will offer a new window into its place in the evolution of gymnosperms and the
origin of flowering plants.
