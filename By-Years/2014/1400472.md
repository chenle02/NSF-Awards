This award provides student travel support for the 19th Annual International
Conference on Architecture Support for Programming Languages and Operating
Systems (ASPLOS) to be held from March 1-5 2014, in Salt Lake City, Utah. ASPLOS
is the premier conference for multidisciplinary systems research spanning
computer architecture and hardware, programming languages and compilers,
operating systems and networking, as well as applications and user interfaces.
The importance of such cross-cutting research continues to grow as we grapple
with the end of Dennard scaling, the explosion of big data, scales ranging from
ultra-low power wearable devices to exascale parallel and cloud computers, the
need for sustainability, and increasingly human-centered applications. ASPLOS
embraces systems research that directly targets these new problems in new
ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF support ensures participation of US students
while paying attention to underrepresented groups. To broaden participation, the
grant is intended specifically to increase the numbers of students who cannot
otherwise attend, that is, students who do not have any financial support
whatsoever, e.g., from their advisors, departments, universities. The broader
impacts include building international community and cooperation in the research
areas of the conference, and enhancing education of students with exposure to
and interaction with leading-edge research and researchers. This award will
therefore help train the next generation of architects, operating systems
builders and language designers in interdisciplinary integration of their
respective skills.
