This project supports the purchase of a small outboard motor boast for field
logistics of NSF scientists and other visiting scientists at the Smithsonian
Institution's field station on Carrie Bow Cay on the barrier reef of southern
Belize. The Carrie Bow Station is the core support facility for the Caribbean
Coral Reef Ecosystems program administered by the National Museum of Natural
History. At present, the two small Boston Whalers (13 and 15 ft) at the facility
are assigned to Smithsonian researchers as a priority. This new boat (23 ft) is
needed to relieve the management obligations of the Smithsonian field station
that is shared my many NSF scientists, to ensure NSF scientists adequate field
support and safety, and to allow NSF scientists essential access to specific
study sites on the barrier reef.
