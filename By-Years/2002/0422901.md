OISE-0422901 Liu

This is a U.S.-China research project between Dr. Jingpu (Paul) Liu, North
Carolina University and Professor Zhongyuan Chen, East China Normal University
to study sediment flux and fate of the Yangtze River sediment delivered to the
East China Sea. This is an exploratory project enabling Dr. Liu and David
Velozzi, a graduate student, to join a research vessel operated by the East
China Normal University to conduct two cruises in the East China Sea to study
the sedimentary flux from the Yangtze River to the East China Sea. This research
project will be jointly supported by the NSF and the National Natural Science
Foundation of China.
