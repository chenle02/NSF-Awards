Development economists have long been interested in poverty traps: feedback
loops that make it difficult for individuals to escape poverty. New work at the
intersection of psychology and economics suggests a focus on psychological
micro-foundations. In particular, worries about financial problems may capture
individuals? attentional and therefore decreases their available cognitive
resources; this in turn can create behaviors that further worsen poverty. While
previous work has explored these ideas, there is scant evidence of these
channels impacting real economic outcomes. This project seeks to provide the
first piece of evidence on the impact of poverty on economic field behavior:
worker productivity. Results from this study would provide the first evidence on
how poverty, operating through cognitive function, could directly reinforce
itself. This would be a first step toward a more thorough integration of
psychology within development economics, with important implications for public
policy and the wellbeing of the poor. For instance, if the hypothesized effects
are indeed at play, then impediments to productivity would occur precisely at
times when individuals face the greatest financial trouble and therefore face
the greatest need for cash. This implies that reducing volatility or mitigating
financial vulnerability could have direct productivity benefits. In addition,
transfer or public workfare programs could have productivity benefits that are
unmeasured to-date. Finally, the hypothesized feedback effects of poverty would
be evidence of an underlying determinant of persistent inequality and reduced
social mobility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study uses a three-week field
experiment to examine whether income directly affects labor productivity by
changing cognitive function. The experiment directly and cleanly tests whether
poverty affects productivity by experimentally inducing variation in financial
constraints?via large lump-sum wage payments. To provide evidence on whether the
underlying mechanism that drives this relationship is cognitive load, the design
makes use of two complementary approaches: (i) It tests whether the estimated
impacts of poverty on productivity are larger for a manufacturing task that
relies more heavily on cognitive resources. (ii) It uses a salience intervention
that directs worker attention to financial constraints, and tests whether the
negative effects of this intervention on productivity are dampened when
financial constraints are (experimentally) eased. Productivity, labor earnings,
consumption patterns, and cognitive function will all be measured.
