The current explanations for educational disparities between minorities and non-
minorities, as measured by grade point averages (GPA), standardized test scores,
achievement tests, etc., range anywhere between genetic inferiority, genetic
comparative advantages, and purely environmental factors. However, this entire
literature, especially in economics, has for the most part, ignored a phenomenon
entitled 'Acting White' (hereafter referred to as 'AW'). This postdoctoral
research and training plan attempts to theoretically model and empirically
estimate this phenomenon, in order to shed some light on the set of possible
explanations for the observed disparities in educational attainment and
performance between minorities and non-minorities. It is believed that in an
environment in which 'AW' is present, one can have disparate educational
outcomes between multiple groups even when they are all genetically identical.
This result is due to the fact that the minority group may be required to make
additional investments that may or may not be complementary to their likelihood
of success in the dominant society. Furthermore, by ignoring the possibility of
the 'AW' phenomenon, current qualitative interpretations of empirical data
related to educational attainment may be misplaced.
