A coupled mechanistic and non-mechanistic inquiry is proposed to link
quantitatively the elliptical instabilities observed in boundary layer shearing
flow to the optimal properties of a thermal efficiency functional. In earlier
study, the extremes of the corresponding shear flow functional have determined a
unique scaling and detailed average properties of turbulent Poiseuille flow from
boundary to boundary. Preliminary results for the thermal functional reproduce
the observed 1/4 power and 1/3 power regions of turbulent convection at low and
moderate Rayleigh number. Here it is proposed to determine the consequences of
optimizing the functional when the surface heat transport is controlled by the
convectively induced shear flow, as in the geophysical arena. Preliminary
estimates of this extreme suggest an asymptotic heat flux proportional to the
half power of the Rayleigh number divided by its logarithm (as in R. Kraichnan's
1962 mixing length theory). The proposed study can lead to quantitative optimum
fields of velocity and temperature free of empirical parameters from the range
of current laboratory data to convective flows controlled by surface turbulent
momentum transport. The comparison of the data with such results will establish
the limits of validity of the "efficiency" functional and its thermal
generalization as statistical stability criteria.
