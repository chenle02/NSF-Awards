The objective of this expedited award for novel research proposal is to
investigate the reversibility of multivalent cation insertion in V6O13 single
crystals. The work would involve generating equilibrium voltage composition data
useful in evaluating potentially energetic anodes for high energy density
secondary batteries. A.C. impedance will be used in conjunction with structural
studies to correlate structural-transport relationship of cation insertion.
