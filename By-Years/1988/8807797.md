The elderly population of the United States is growing. While research on the
normal elderly exists, little is known about the experiences of the troubled
elderly. This category includes individuals who are physically or cognitively
impaired. This research project will analyze the processes of becoming a
troubled aged individual and the effect this has on these individuals, their
families, and health professionals. In addition, the researcher will isolate
those areas and assumptions where the cognitive models of aging of all three
groups are incongruent. This research addresses a central problem in gerontology
and medical anthropology and will have direct relevance toward identifying and
solving the increasing problems in the US of caregiver burden, lack of
compliance with health care recommendations and quality of life issues.
