A two-week institute in parallel computing is proposed. The objective is to
give approximately 25 graduate and post-doctoral researchers a fundamental
understanding of parallel computing. We will present a series of lectures on
topics including parallel architectures for scientific computation, software
tools to aid in implementing parallel algorithms, use of graphics
representations in the construction of parallel programs, and vectorization.
Participants will then experiment with test problems and with a specific
application that they have brought with them to the institute. Ample time will
be provided on the four multiprocessors in Argonne's Advanced Computing Research
Facility. Some class time will also be spent reviewing UNIX and discussing the
communications facilities available for local and remote access to these
machines. The proposed institute will provide an excellent opportunity for
university researchers to acquire knowledge and experience in the area of
parallel computing. We are hopeful that after the institute is over, researchers
will continue to use the machines in the Advanced Computing Research Facility to
conduct experiments in parallel computing. Thus the institute will have the
long-term benefit of increasing our understanding of the applications for which
specific computer architectures are best suited.

submitted for support for a two-week, twenty-five student institute (workshop)
on parallel programming and computing. The institute will emphasize software
tools, parallel algorithms and vectorization as applied to nuThe institute is a
very important step in bringing parallelism to computational science.
