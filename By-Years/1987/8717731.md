The computer integrated mechanism synthesis system, taking the form of a
"knowledge-based system", will make use of man-machine interface theory to guide
the designer through multitudes of possible mechanism designs. New kinematic
design criteria will continue to be developed drawing from geometry, relative
kinematics, graph theory, and industrial designers' problems. Development of
these criteria represents fundamental breakthroughs in the understanding and
formalization of the initial stages of the mechanism design process. Parallel
research will continue in the theory and application of type synthesis,
artificial intelligence, and certain areas of dimensional synthesis. Expert
system design modules will be developed and tested to help evaluate their
usefulness to the designer and to investigate potential productivity increases
by using these new tools.
