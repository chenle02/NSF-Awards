Adams 9404992 The study of enzymes isolated from organisms inhabiting
unconventional ecosystems has led to the realization that biocatalysis need not
be constrained to mild conditions and can be considered at pH's, temperatures,
pressures, ionic and solvent environments long though to be destructive to
biological systems. However, the intrinsic basis for biological function under
such extreme conditions is only starting to be addressed, as are applications
for what can be called extremozymes. In addition to expanding the search for
novel and interesting enzymes from extreme environments, it is important to
bring to bear the current sophistication in the study of protein structure and
function. Also, those familiar with potential uses of biocatalysis must become
more aware of the opportunities and challenges associated with the
identification study of extremozymes. Ultimately, given the information acquired
from the study of extremozymes, modification to less stable enzymes to improve
their ranges of stability and activity remains a possibility. %%% This workshop
will bring together representatives from academia, government and industry to
provide a perspective on extremozymes and their place in modern biocatalysis.
Contributions will cover both fundamental and applied aspects in an effort to
describe exciting developments in progress as well as to identify potential
opportunities for the use of biological catalysts under extreme conditions. ***
