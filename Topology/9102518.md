This research project consists of two main parts, concerning (1) the topology
of real algebraic sets, and (2) the topology of smooth 4-manifolds. The first
part will build on the investigator's success (together with Henry King of the
University of Maryland) in settling an old conjecture of John Nash. The second
part will focus on the construction of fake smooth structures on 4-manifolds,
particularly their detection by means of such new invariants as Floer homology
and the still newer invariants of Turaev-Reshetikhin-Witten coming from quantum
groups. Both parts of this project concern themselves with very natural objects
which are ubiquitous in mathematics and mathematical physics. Four-manifolds are
cosmologically important, since we live in a manifold of three space dimensions
plus one time dimension.
