9800869 Yu The investigator proposes to study the K-theory of Roe algebras and
group C* algebras. The K-theory of Roe algebras and group C* algebras both serve
as receptacles of higher indices of elliptic operators and have important
applications to problems in differential geometry and topology such as the
existence problem for Riemannian metrics with positive scalar curvature, the
Novikov conjecture on the homotopy invariance of higher signatures, and the
zero-in-the-spectrum conjecture on the spectra of Laplacians. The methods to be
employed include controlled operator K-theory, infinite dimensional almost flat
bundles, cyclic cohomology, and combinatorial Chern-Connes characters. Manifolds
are spaces glued together by Euclidean spaces. Examples of manifolds include
spheres and tori. In differential geometry one studies how manifolds are curved.
For example a flat piece of paper has zero curvature while the sphere has
positive curvature. This is why we can not bend a piece of paper into a sphere.
A basic problem in differential geometry is to determine when a manifold can
have positive scalar curvature. Another important problem in mathematics is the
classification of manifolds. By surgery theory the classification problem for
higher dimensional manifolds can be essentially reduced to the Novikov
conjecture. The K-theoretic higher indices of certain elliptic differential
operators can be used to attack the positive scalar curvature problem and the
Novikov conjecture. A key step in this analytic approach is the computation of
the K-theory of Roe algebras and group C* algebras.
