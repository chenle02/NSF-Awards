ABSTRACT DMS - 0202536.

This project concerns two major themes. The first is the study of rigidity
theorems (i.e. metric uniqueness) on compact manifolds. Here for example we
consider isospectral problems: to what extent must spaces with the same spectra
(e.g. eigenvalues of the Laplace Beltrami operator, or Lengths of closed
geodesics) be isometric. This also includes questions about metric rigidity
induced by conjugacy of geodesic flows, as well as inverse scattering problems.
The other theme considers infinite groups G acting cocompactly on nonpositively
curved spaces H (in the sense of Alexandrov). The project is to study the
relationship between the geometry of H and the induced action of G on the ideal
boundary of H. This can be considered an aspect of geometric group theory and is
partially motivated by some questions of Gromov. As well as these two major
themes the proposal concerns the authors continuing work on various
isoperimetric inequalities. These groups show up as symmetries of Hadamard
spaces H (which include spaces of nonpositive curvature.)

The first theme of the project concerns the question of whether a space can be
determined by a certain set of data. One part of this relates to questions of
remote sensing. For example: can you determine the density of an object (say a
persons body or the moon) from measurements taken "from the outside"? The CAT
scan is a practical example where one determines the mass density (or more
accurately the absorption coefficient) of an object from measurements of the
total mass along straight lines. An alternative set of measurements is the set
of times it takes for sound to travel between any two points on the boundary
(this is a special case of the boundary rigidity question dealt with in the
proposal). The thrust of the proposed study is to determine under which
circumstances certain sets of data (e.g. eigenvalues, lengths of closed
geodesics, distances between boundary points) are sufficient to completely
determine the geometry of the spaces in question. Groups show up naturally as
symmetries of various spaces. The second theme of this project concerns the
study a certain class of infinite groups.
