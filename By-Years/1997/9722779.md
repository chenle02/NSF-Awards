9722779 Olafsson This is an international collaboration that involves the PI,
three co-PIs (Thomas Branson and Palle Jorgensen, U. of Iowa; and Peter Gilkey,
U. of Oregon) and researchers in Germany, France, Norway, and Denmark. The
research will attempt to solve a number of problems in modern analysis dealing,
in particular with geometric and analytic aspects of spectral theory on Lie
groups, homogeneous spaces, and more general manifolds. This award is expected
to promote a strongly interactive research program focusing on the stated areas,
that will also allow graduate students to participate in the international
collaboration. Although the research plan envisions five separate research
groups (two in Germany, and one in each of the other countries), all of the
topics are related, and there will be extensive interplay among the groups. The
problems to be studied are motivated by current questions in mathematical
physics, and their solution will be a substantial addition to that field.
