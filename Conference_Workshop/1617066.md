This award supports participation of junior researchers in the research
conference "Latent Variables 2016" held at the University of South Carolina,
October 12-14, 2016. The statistical concept of a latent variable (a quantity
whose values are inferred rather than directly measured) is important for
statistical analysis in a wide variety of fields, from medicine to social
science to machine processing of natural language. The purpose of the Latent
Variables conference is to encourage the exchange of research ideas in latent
variables, and to motivate and direct future research in this and related areas.
The conference provides an excellent opportunity for young researchers to
present their work, to learn about recent developments in the field, and to
initiate new research collaborations.

The conference features four plenary talks by leaders in the field, as well as
six pairs of concurrent sessions, each with three speakers, that will include
address research progress in several areas related to latent variables theory
and analysis, including multiple testing, frailty models, objective Bayes
analysis, factor models, diagnostic screening, model misspecification, group
testing and biomarker pooling, item response theory, model-based clustering,
generalized linear latent variable models, and measurement error models. Poster
sessions will provide additional opportunities for exchange of ideas, and one of
the poster sessions is designated specifically for graduate students to present
their research. Additional information can be found at the conference web site:
