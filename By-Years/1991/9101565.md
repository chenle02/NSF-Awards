The promise of high temperature, superconducting ceramic materials is well
known. However, there are many practical difficulties involved in fabricating
technologically useful conductors from these materials. The Phase I effort has
demonstrated the usefulness of a laser-driven solidifaction process in producing
high temperature superconducting wires with a controlled orientation of the
ceramic crystals to improve the conducting properties. The Phase II research
objectives include design of a computer-controlled, laser-driven directional
solidification furnace, determination of the best extrusion parameters for the
precursor material, characterization and testing of the wires which are produced
and scale-up of the process.
