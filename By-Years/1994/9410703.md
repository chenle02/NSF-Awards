9410703 Sambanis One of the most promising advances in the treatment of diabetes
in recent years has been the demonstration in animals that beta cells or
complete eyelets encapsulated in a material that allows the free diffusion of
glucose and insulin can function in vivo without being rejected. The potential
to develop this into a biologically based artificial organ and providing natural
control of glucose levels would be great for insulin-dependent diabetes. The
research proposed in this application is concerned with the development of a
bio-artificial pancreas which is functional in the long-term, easily
implantable, relatively inexpensive, and amenable to large scale manufacture.
The work employs the use of existing biomaterials to encapsulate living,
cultured beta cells, and to focus on characterizing and improving the function
of these cells in this immuno-isolated environment. ***
