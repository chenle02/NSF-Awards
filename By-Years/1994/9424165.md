This award provides funds for a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site in
Archaeology through Davidson College. The award provides the opportunity for ten
students to join the Athienou Archaeological Project in Cyprus. Students will
(1) receive instruction in survey and excavation techniques (e.g., remote
sensing, computer-assisted mapping), record keeping and data management, and
artifact analysis; (2) participate in seminars taught by experts on
archaeological method and theory and the cultural history of Cyprus; (3) visit
prehistoric and historic sites on Cyprus; (4) plan and complete an independent
research project; and (5) live in Athienou and learn about life in modern Cyprus
from the villagers. Three faculty and three graduate students will provide the
primary instruction along with other project specialists. The students will
master the methods of archaeological field research, including new high tech
approaches to data collection and analysis, and gain a better understanding of
archaeological theory during the eight week program. This award contributes to
the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in
science through active undergraduate research experiences.
