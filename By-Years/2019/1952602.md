This workshop aims to bring together stakeholders from US universities
responsible for curating, developing and delivering programming, education, and
other resources relating to innovation and entrepreneurship. This will better
support universities on identifying and implementing best practices developed
across the nation, help develop improved and more uniform practices for
entrepreneurship education and for fostering entrepreneurship, and better inform
the National Science Foundation on current activities and present and future
needs of universities in the areas of innovation and
entrepreneurship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
