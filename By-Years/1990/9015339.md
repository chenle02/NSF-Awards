The stabilization of an interconnected power system is an important design goal.
This project deals with this stabilization throughout the use of decentralized
control theory and variable structure controllers. Regulation and static var
device control will be considered. In addition, fault tolerance through the use
of neural network architectures will be used. Throughout the project, variable
load level and telemetered data in the presence of noise are considered.
