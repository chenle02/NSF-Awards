9507549 Wurtele The maintenance of a balance between anabolism and catabolism is
crucial to the net biosynthesis of phytochemicals. This metabolic balance is
particularly evident during seedling development when large quantities of seed
reserve (lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates) are catabolized. The resultant
intermediates are then utilized as substrates for the biosynthesis of new
phytochemicals, or they are respired to generate ATP, which supports the
biosynthetic reactions. These metabolic interconversions require the coordinate
action and regulation of many antagonistic processes. This award will study the
catabolism of leucine and subsequent utilization of the derived carbon in young
seedlings of soybean and Arabidopsis, as an example of how organisms coordinate
complex interconnected metabolic pathways to achieve net interconversions of
biomolecules. In plants, the catabolism of leucine is thought to occur in
mitochondria, via a set of reactions which are partly in common with a pathway
by which mevalonate may be metabolized to non-isoprenoid compounds. Acetyl-CoA
thus formed from leucine and mevalonate can be further metabolized for
respiration, gluconeogenesis, and lipogenesis. These investigations will define
previously unknown mitochondrial metabolic processes and begin to indicte how
they interface with metabolism in other organelles. The understanding of
catabolic provesses will ultimately provide a better understanding of how plants
maintain a balance between anabolism and catabolism. Comprehension of how this
balance is regulated may open new, as yet unforeseen, avenues to the improvement
of agricultural production.
