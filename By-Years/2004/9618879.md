This conference facilitates discussion among a diverse group of people on the
directions and implications of computer networking technology in society. The
theme of community values in relationship to computer and communication
technology development will be explored. The foci are: children and education,
civic and community values, economic systems, and cultural values and diverse
communities. The fifth theme is critical issues including universal access,
media ownership and control, Internet censorship, telecommunications activism,
etc. The plan includes a second day of community oriented workshops to build
action agendas and recommendations, and the production of high quality printed
and electronic proceedings to extend the reach of the conference beyond the
actual event. Attendees, endorsing organizations, and workshop organizers will
be able to have their statements included in the conference web site, to enrich
the dialogue among stakeholders and add issues, data, and relevance to the
research agenda on community use of networking technology. The Home Page address
