The proposed research will develop new molecular and genomic tools and
approaches for the gelatinous bloom-forming Antarctic salp, Salpa thompsoni, in
order to understand the interplay between the salp's complex life history,
potential for rapid population growth and bloom formation, and the environmental
conditions of the Southern Ocean. Salpa thompsoni is an increasingly important
player in the highly-vulnerable Southern Ocean pelagic ecosystem. Despite being
recognized as a key component of growing importance in Antarctic pelagic
ecosystems, no study has been published on their population genetics or
genomics. The research proposed here - including analysis of genome-wide
patterns of gene expression of Salpa thompsoni associated with life history
events and specific environmental conditions - will be the first of its kind on
a salp species. The molecular genetic techniques and approaches proposed here
are widely used in bio-medical laboratories and are increasingly applied to
diverse model species, but have yet to be applied to ecologically-important but
phylogenetically-obscure species, such as salps. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Small
Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) is requested because of the increasing
urgency of understanding the underlying causes of observed changes in the
Southern Ocean pelagic ecosystem, including the shifting balance between the
keystone species, Southern Ocean krill (Euphausia superba) and the gelatinous
bloom-forming Antarctic salp (Salpa thompsoni). Given the lack of molecular
genetic and genomic information for the target species or any close relative,
the proposed research may be perceived as too high risk for funding via usual
NSF programs and panels.
