Dr. Chu will study the physical structures and energetics of regions of ionized
hydrogen (HII regions) which are under the influence of supernovae and winds
from stars. The work will be a mixture of observations and theoretical
interpretation. Dr. Chu will first study giant HII regions around associations
of OB type stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud to investigate the interactions
among stellar winds, supernovae, and the interstellar medium. Research on the
interactions among young, hot stars, supernovae, and the interstellar medium can
be important to understanding how stars modify their environments and affect the
rate of star formation. One advantage of studying giant HII regions is that the
large number of ionizing stars make it possible to see the relatively rare
stellar wind phenomenon and to investigate its effects on the interstellar
medium. Rapidly expanding shells of gas have been detected in at least one giant
HII region, and some of the shells must be young, wind-blown bubbles. These
young bubbles and the emission of X-rays, which implies the presence of
supernova remnants, near a high concentration of O type stars pose many
intriguing problems for theorists on the interrelationships of these phenomena.
