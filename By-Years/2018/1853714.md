Many scientific problems (e.g., computational biology, high-energy physics,
climate science) rely on high performance computing (HPC) systems to manage and
process massive amounts of data. However, with the rapid increase in scale and
complexity, even the specially-designed and well-maintained HPC platforms may
fail. This research aims to design innovative methodologies that scrutinize
parallel file systems, the major storage software which empowers HPC platforms,
and uncover the issues in parallel file systems that can lead to data loss under
various failure scenarios. Such an effort is a fundamental step towards building
highly reliable HPC systems and meet the demand of data-driven scientific
discovery. In addition, this project integrates the research activities with
education and outreach efforts to train broadly inclusive and globally
competitive science workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, this
project includes two synergistic research tasks, which enables automatic testing
as well as diagnosing the issues in parallel file systems. The first task
focuses on testing parallel file systems through a single-fault injection
framework, which interrupts the normal workloads of the target parallel file
system automatically, and examines if the interruption could lead to any issues
that cannot be fixed by the corresponding checker of the parallel file system.
Building on the first task, the second task focuses on diagnosing the issues
uncovered in the previous task through a two-level provenance-based analysis.
The first level analysis builds the coarse-grain, inter-node provenance, which
provides a high-level picture of the entire system behavior. The second level
analysis creates the fine-grain, intra-node provenance that contains causal
paths within each individual node. In addition, multiple provenance traces are
aligned and compared automatically to help locate the problematic code region
with minimal human efforts.
