AST-0201670 Venkatesan, Aparna

Dr. Venkatesan is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to carry out a program of research, education, and public outreach at
the University of Colorado. She will develop theoretical models of the formation
of the very first generation of stars in the early universe. Recent observations
of high-redshift quasars have provided new constraints on the epoch of formation
and on the gas out of which the stars were formed. In addition to her
theoretical work, Dr. Venkatesan will collaborate with other astronomers at the
University of Colorado in further observations of high-redshift objects in order
to learn more about the properties of the intergalactic medium at various
epochs. As her primary outreach activity, she will tutor and teach for the local
Upward Bound program which targets Native American students. Her educational
skills will also be developed by teaching astronomy courses for the general
public. ***
