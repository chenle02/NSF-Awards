This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of interfacial structure and dynamics. The goal of this research is
to develop an understanding of the dynamics of lateral charge and mass transport
processes in monolayer and bilayer assemblies. Drawing upon pioneering advances
made during the tenure of NSF grant CHE-8504368, Professor Majda and his
students will pursue four related research thrusts: In the first, they will
explore the dynamics of translational diffusion in bilayer assemblies as a
function of the structure of the individual constituent amphiphiles; second,
they will determine the kinetics of electron transfer reactions taking place
laterally in organized monolayer assemblies; third, they will characterize the
reactivity of amphiphilic porphyrin molecules in monolayers as a viable approach
to the electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen to water; and fourth, they will
explore the applicability of organized monolayer assemblies to the control of
the selectivity of electrode reactions. These research thrusts take advantage of
this group's recently developed abilities to design and control the structure of
monomolecular assemblies and to probe the behavior of these systems with novel
electrochemical methods. Also, fluorescence spectroscopic methods, Langmuir-
Blodgett techniques, epifluorescence microscopy, and contact angle measurements
will be applied in these experimental efforts. This research will contribute to
an enhanced understanding of the behavior of molecules in organized monolayer
and bilayer assemblies such as biological membrane systems. Additionally, these
studies should give rise to new insights into the design of efficient and
selective electrocatalytic systems.
