The magnetic effects of low and high temperature hydrothermal alteration on
titanomagnetite in oceanic rocks are poorly understoods. The objective of this
study is to examine the lower crust rocks of Josephine Ophiolite with empkhasis
on the alteration effects on magnetic properties. The study will lead to a
better understanding of the importance of dykes and gobbros on magnetic
anomalies.
