This funding support allows the institution to incorporate state-of-the-art
controls and on-line performance monitoring capabilities to an existing ten
kilowatt mini steam cycle power plant in the thermal engineering laboratory of
the Mechanical Engineering Department at San Diego State University. These
improvements greatly enhance the instructional value of the mini cycle power
plant, making it an effective teaching tool for thermodynamics instruction. In
addition, the mini steam cycle improvements add seven new experiments, with
state-of-the-art instrumentation and data acquisition, to the thermal
engineering portion of the Engineering Systems Laboratory course. This award is
being matched byu an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
