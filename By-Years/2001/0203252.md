Solar energetic particle (SEP) events associated with coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) will be studied by developing a detailed convection-diffusion model of
particle transport and acceleration in the solar corona and in interplanetary
space. The model results will be compared with energetic particle population
observations obtained at 1 AU, using the ACE and Wind data, and at several AU,
using the Ulysses data. The focus of the effort will be on the low-energy (20
keV/nuc to 5 MeV/nuc) particles which remain poorly understood since they
interact more readily with entrained solar wind structures. Low-energy particles
are more strongly affected by the convection, wave-particle interactions, and
adiabatic deceleration. Accordingly, these transport effects, as well as those
associated with continuous acceleration, will be incorporated into the modeling
effort. Because energetic particles precede the arrival of the CME by at least
one day, characterizing these SEPs can potentially aid in the formulation of
space weather forecasts.
