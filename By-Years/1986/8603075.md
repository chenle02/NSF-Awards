The research project involves development of new semiconductor device concepts
associated with intraband (as opposed to interband) processes, related device
physics, and related infrared (IR) experiments. Devices include quantum well IR
detectors and sources, as well as extrinsic silicon IR detectors employing
unconventional modes of detection. Modeling will be carried out to decrease
compositional control demands on previously proposed quantum well IR detector
structures which offer the possibility of high quantum efficiency, narrow band
detection and fewer materials problems than narrow gap long wavelength detectors
like HgCdTe which employ interband transitions. Improvements in quantum well
intraband transition photon sources will be studied. Near IR intraband quantum
well devices require larger barrier heights and indirect gap materials.
Compositionally simple (GaAs-AlAs) devices also involve indirect gap barriers.
The effect of high indirect gap barriers on carrier dynamics will be examined as
an extension of theoretical work already begun on the interaction of electrons
and holes with barriers. That work includes the effect of lattice mismatch and
will be extended to include the effect of strain.
