The principal investigator will study the partitioning of important radiogenic
and trace elements between mineral and melt under mantle conditions. Using the
laser heated diamond cell, experiments will be conducted at pressures up to 100
GPa and temperatures up to 5000 K. The proposed experiments will be the first
done under the appropriate high pressure and temperature conditions to provide
constraints on lower mantle geochemistry.
