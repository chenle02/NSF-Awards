In the USA and temperate regions throughout the world, Rosaceae ranks third in
economic importance. The most important fruit producing crops include apple
(Malus), pear (Pyrus) raspberries/blackberries (Rubus), strawberries (Frageria),
and stone fruits (Pyrus) such as peach, apricot, plum, cherry and almond.
Additionally, the Rosaceae contains a wide variety of ornamental plants
including roses, flowering cherry, crabapple, quince and pear. The Rosaceae
Genome Database will integrate genomics data for the model genome species,
peach, with that of the expanding data sets of the other important Rosaceae
species for the purpose of facilitating gene discovery and characterization in
this important plant family. This will be facilitated through the development of
a centralized, curated, publicly available worldwide database incorporating the
accumulated genomics data for all important species in Rosaceae. This will
include the following: Collection and integration of all Prunus genomic data
into a centralized database repository, development of web tools to facilitate
access and retrieval of all data stored in the Prunus genome database and
development of sequence processing and analysis resources for the Rosaceae
community. This research program will provide the bioinformatics infrastructure
necessary for the community to avoid duplication of research efforts and
facilitate the use of genomics data for Rosaceae species. A major component of
this program involves the development of a graduate program for teachers and
public agents to provide training in the application of bioinformatics tools for
the use of genomic resources, with particular focus on peach genomics.
