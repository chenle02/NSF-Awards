9634920 Maniatty This grant provides funding for the development of a numerical
tool for determining optimal process parameters in bulk forming processes, such
as rolling, extrusion, and forging. The developed numerical tool will determine
the optimal process geometry, temperature and speed that satisfy specified
design criteria for a given two-dimensional forming process. An optimization
algorithm based on an adaptive arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian finite element
formulation for modeling large deformation thermo-elasto-viscoplastic contact
problems will be used. The algorithm will be implemented in the context of an
existing advanced computational framework that has tools for mesh generation,
adaptivity, and parallel computing. Experiments involving the extrusion process
will also be performed to validate the algorithms developed. Experimental dies
will be manufactured according to the optimal die shapes predicted in this work
and tested at the predicted optimal die speeds. A model press, which can extrude
plasticine material marked with a grid, will be used in these experiments to
observe the material flow behavior. If successful, the results of this research
will lead to improvements in the design of bulk forming processes and new
developments in optimization methods for handling complex non-linear problems.
The primary goal of this work is to determine optimal process geometry, thermal
conditions, and process speed in bulk forming processes that will satisfy
typically prescribed design criteria. These design criteria may include
generating a uniform flow of the material, generating a specified material
property distribution in the formed product, minimizing the production time, or
minimizing the energy required for the process. Determining the process
parameters to achieve these objectives will help to reduce the cost and improve
the quality of the final product in processes such as extrusion and forging. The
work will also contribute to the computational tools and metho dologies
available for nonlinear optimization problems.
