This scholarship program provides up to eighteen need-based scholarships to an
integrated community of academically talented MS and PhD graduate students who
are educated in the economic, social, and environmental pillars of
sustainability, well prepared to transfer research techniques and knowledge from
their different graduate perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engaging women and
underrepresented groups in engineering builds additional capacity in these
fields that are critical to advancing sustainability goals. The project
explicitly provides scholarships to recruit, educate, and retain students into
STEM fields (including underrepresented groups). It will facilitate knowledge
sharing among MS and PhD graduate students and their faculty advisors. This
project focuses student and faculty educational efforts on some of the most
pressing challenges facing our global society, and catalyzes the development of
the next generation of engineers with global awareness and the skills necessary
to lead true change by engineering for a better future.&lt;br/&gt;
