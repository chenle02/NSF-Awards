Bilingualism is becoming more prevalent in the U.S.A., mimicking the state of
affairs in almost all other parts of the world. More and more people use at
least two languages at home, at school, or at work. The apparent bilingual
future invites several questions about the nature or bilingualism: How do
bilinguals deal with the different language situations they encounter? Can they
use each language selectively according to the situation, or are both languages
always automatically available in all contexts? To what degree does one language
interfere with or facilitate the other?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With NSF support
Dr. Canseco-Gonzalez will answer these and similar questions using an innovative
technique that allows her to manipulate how and whether the environment elicits
bilingualism and thereby study the impact on bilinguals. The broader impacts of
the research are relevant to policy makers, educators, social services
providers, and parents alike. For instance, should driving tests always be
administered in a driver's first language? Should children learn two languages
simultaneously? This research also encourages participation by underrepresented
minorities both as undergraduates engaged in research and as research
participants.&lt;br/&gt;
