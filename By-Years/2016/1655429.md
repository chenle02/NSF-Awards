The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to have
advanced lithium-sulfur batteries enable increased range of electric vehicles
with lower cost. One of the most challenging problems in electric vehicles is
the short driving distance and relatively high cost, which have been mainly
caused by the performance of the current Li-ion batteries. These batteries are
good for small electronics such as cell phones and computers, but their energy
densities and prices do not meet the current demand required for large scale
systems. The proposed battery technology can achieve an energy density five
times higher than those of the current Li-ion batteries as well as lower the
manufacturing cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will further
develop a process technology that enables sponge-like three-dimensional carbon
nanotube bulk materials while maintaining the properties of individual
nanomaterials. With this novel scalable synthesis method, the junctions/contacts
between carbon nanotubes are seamlessly connected by covalent bonding, ensuring
excellent electron transport across the junctions/contacts. Typical methods for
commercial carbon nanotubes result in powdery materials which necessitates
additional manufacturing processes to make practical bulk materials. In
comparison to the conventional methods for making battery electrodes, the novel
manufacturing method used in this project results in electrically conducting
scaffold electrodes with large surface areas, eliminating inactive binders and
conductive additives in batteries, which allows for remarkably increasing the
energy density of lithium-sulfur batteries.
