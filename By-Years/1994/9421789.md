Science, especially physics, can be extraordinarily difficult for the average
person to understand. Historians of science coming with their expertise in
historical methodology are able to analyze many of the motivations and actions
taken by scientists, but they are not always able to follow the extremely
technical mathematics which scientists use to produce their theories. Yet
scientists who have the technical expertise to follow the mathematics frequently
do not have the historical understanding to place the scientific work within a
rich historical context. Consequently, it is critically important that
scientists with both mathematical sophistication and historical sensitivities
bring these combined skills to bear on the major issues in the development of
science. Professor Nauenberg, a physics professor at the University of
California, Santa Cruz, brings this combined technical and historical skill to
bear on one of the central issues in the development of modern physics: orbital
dynamics. From Ptolemy in the ancient world through Copernicus and Newton up to
the twentieth century efforts of Albert Einstein, orbital dynamics has been a
critical factor in the acceptance or rejection of theories of physics. Indeed,
it was Einstein's explanation of the peculiar orbit of Mercury that physicists
found far more convincing for support of his theory of relativity than the more
famous prediction of the gravitational bending of light. Professor Nauenberg is
examining this history of the study of planetary orbits. In this part of his
research, he is looking at the work of Newton and Hooke to trace the development
of their work in orbital dynamics. Among other issues, he is examining the
degree of validity of Newton's application of his principles of dynamics and
gravitation to the anomalies in the orbit of the moon and Hooke's role in the
early development of dynamics. The results of these studies promise to elucidate
in ways previously not possible how these extraordinarily technical issue s
developed. The ultimate solution to these planetary orbital anomalies took until
Einstein to achieve. How scientists worked toward this ultimate solution
provides us with an extraordinary picture of how extremely difficult scientific
problems are attacked and finally resolved.
