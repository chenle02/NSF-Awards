During late oogenesis in Drosophila, ovarian follicle cells synthesize and
secrete several proteins that assemble to form the vitelline membrane and
chorion sublayers that comprise the eggshell. Dr. Waring's research is directed
towards understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie eggshell formation.
She proposes to continue her studies on the dec-1 gene, an eggshell gene that is
exceptional in terms of its size, mutability, production of alternatively
spliced transcripts, and post- translational protein modifications. In addition,
she will expand her studies to include other eggshell genes so that she can
begin to establish functional interrelationships among the eggshell proteins.
Studies are proposed in three areas. First, antibodies that have been raised
against different regions of the dec-1 gene will be used to study proteolytic
processing of the three dec-1 primary translation products and their
derivatives. Second, product specific antibodies will be used to localize
different eggshell proteins in assembling and mature eggshells. By comparing the
distribution of different eggshell proteins in wild type and mutant eggshells,
she hopes to gain insight into protein-protein interactions that are important
in eggshell assembly. Third, by structural and functional comparisons of the
dec-1 gene in evolutionarily distant species, she hopes to identify molecular
features of the dec-1 gene that are essential for its function. Macromolecular
assembly has been extensively studied in viruses and bacteriophage due to the
ready availability of mutations that disrupt their assembly. The eggshell in
Drosophila provides an opportunity to study a macromolecular assembly process in
a genetically amenable eukaryotic organism.
