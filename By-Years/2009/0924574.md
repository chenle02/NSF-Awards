This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to further
develop the Tapping Finger Identification (TFI) technology investigated in Phase
I. As mobile devices become more powerful and ubiquitous, text entry remains a
major bottleneck to the wider adoption of mobile computing. To address this
urgent need in lack of an acceptable solution, this TFI technology enables high-
speed input in mobile devices and gaming applications using conventional typing
techniques and keyboard layouts. In addition to demonstrating the feasibility of
TFI during Phase I, the project will develop an IP strategy and a set of tools
essential to future research and development. To date, one prototype has been
implemented and a license agreement to commercialize some portion of the TFI
technology was reached with an external partner. Completion of the Phase II
research in two years will pave the way for commercialization of this innovative
technology as we transition toward mobile computing. The technology developed
could potentially impact a broad range of application areas, including mobile
computing, gaming, military, and mobile security.

Mobile devices are becoming more powerful and ubiquitous. According to the IDC,
convergent mobile devices grew 51% in 2007, and will grow from 124 million to
376 million in 2012. Data entry, however, remains a major bottleneck to the
wider adoption of mobile computing. Most users are frustrated with existing
input methods on portable devices, such as phones and mobile PCs. Much less a
paragraph of text, simply entering a website's URL in a phone or mobile PC would
be a burden for many. To address this urgent need in lack of an acceptable
solution, the outcomes of this project projects the enablement of high speed,
efficient mobile input using conventional typing techniques and keyboard
layouts.
