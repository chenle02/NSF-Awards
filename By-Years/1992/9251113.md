The Department of Chemistry is upgrading its laboratory instruction in chemical
separations and analysis through the purchase of a gas chromatograph-mass
spectrometer (GC-MS) system. The theory and practice of GC-MS analyses is being
integrated into the undergraduate laboratories covering advanced organic
chemistry, instrumental analysis and molecular structure for chemistry majors
plus a chemical instrumentation laboratory course for biologists. The instrument
is also used in undergraduate student research projects which currently include
efforts to improve precombustion desulfurization of Illinois coal, novel
syntheses of new pharmaceuticals, synthesis of new catalysts for the chemical
industry and the design of safer artificial sweeteners based on natural
products.
