Qualitative simulation is a method for representing incomplete, qualitative
knowledge about the structure of a mechanism, in the form of a qualitative
differential equation (QDE), and deriving qualitative predictions about the
possible behaviors of the mechanism. Reliable inference about continuous
mechanisms in spite of incomplete knowledge is critical to the fundamental AI
tasks of diagnosis and design, where one's knowledge is necessarily incomplete
The QSIM program provides a simple, clear representation for qualitative
structure (QDEs) and qualitative behavior, and a clean, efficient algorithm for
qualitative simulation. This award supports its documentation and distribution
through the Software Capitalization Program. //
