9313670 Brink The GLOBEC NW Atlantic/Georges Bank observational program is
planned to last for 4.5 years, beginning in 1994. As part of this effort, Dr.
Brink and colleagues will deploy three moorings throughout the period at the
Bank center, on the northwestern end, and on the south flank. All moorings would
measure currents, temperature, conductivity, phytoplankton proxies (fluorescence
and light transmission) and photosynthetically available radiation. Most
deployments will use acoustic Doppler current profilers which also allow
estimates of zooplankton stocks. The central mooring will be equipped with a
complete suite of meteorological sensors. This project will also deploy Argos
tracked drifters on each of the broad scale hydrographic cruises. The drifters
will provide quantitative estimates of water residence times and preferred exit
sites from the Bank. This measurement program will provide continuous records of
the physical and biological status of waters over the Bank, and a context for
all other measurements made during the GLOBEC Georges Bank study. The data base
will be used to understand the effects of advection and stratification on the
plankton population over the Bank. ***
