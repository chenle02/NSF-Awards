ABSTRACT Tim Colonius CTS-9501349 California Institute of Technology The
research component of this CAREER award will theoretically investigate the sound
generated by turbulent subsonic jets using first principles. The equations of
motion for a three dimensional unsteady flow will be solved numerically. These
computations build upon previously developed numerical methods which were used
to investigate sound generation in a two-dimensional mixing layer. These
techniques will be applied to the turbulent jet, which is a prototype problem
for turbulent shear flows. This work will assist in the design of quieter jet
engines and will also aid in the development of new computational fluid dynamics
codes that can be applied to other aeroacoustics problems. The educational
component of this work consists of introducing, in a comprehensive fashion,
modern numerical methods into the undergraduate curriculum. Such techniques are
essential for maintaining our graduating students at the cutting edge of
technological application.
