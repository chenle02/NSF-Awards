&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surface plasmon resonance biosensors
have revolutionized the study of&lt;br/&gt;molecular interactions. Current
instruments can provide detailed kinetic&lt;br/&gt;information about complex
formation without reagent labeling, but are&lt;br/&gt;low throughput. New array-
based biosensor technology is poised to&lt;br/&gt;make a significant
contribution to the proteomics revolution by increasing &lt;br/&gt;the number of
surface reactions that can be monitored simultaneously. The&lt;br/&gt;challenges
in producing protein arrays are two fold: depositing and
maintaining&lt;br/&gt;active proteins on a surface and physically creating dense
arrays of proteins &lt;br/&gt;within small target areas (typically 1 cm2). The
current award seeks to &lt;br/&gt;optimize the conditions for solid-pin spotting
of peptides and to fabricate novel &lt;br/&gt;fluidic devices that would allow
for in-flow protein immobilization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of
this work include training students in biosensor technology&lt;br/&gt;and
nuclear receptor biology. In addition, the technology that results from this
work&lt;br/&gt;will permit large-scale mapping of protein interactions, which
will serve as the&lt;br/&gt;basis for interpreting complex biological
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
