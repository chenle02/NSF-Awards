Within the department's new biochemistry emphasis, a new course will be
developed that stresses high performance liquid chromatography. HPLC techniques
are powerful isolation and purification methods. Experiments to be performed in
the course will involve separations with peptides, proteins, lipids, and nucleic
acids. A "user-friendly" HPLC will allow the students to concentrate their
laboratory efforts on critical sample preparation, pre-purification,
application, and data analysis, with a minimum amount of instrument-dependent
complex operational procedures. The university will provide 50% matching funds.
