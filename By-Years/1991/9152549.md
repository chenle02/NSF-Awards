Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) will be incorporated into the
curriculum of the joint chemistry department of St. John's University and the
College of St. Benedict. The FTIR instrument will be used in the organic,
advanced inorganic, physical, instrumental analysis, and nonmajor chemistry
courses, as well as student research. Experiments will enhance student
understanding of functional group transformations, library
matching/identification of unknowns, group theory, kinetics, and
rotational/vibrational spectroscopy of heteronuclear diatomic molecules. The
instrument will give non-science students firsthand experience with the way
scientists gather data and solve problems. The grantee will match the NSF award
from non-Federal sources.
