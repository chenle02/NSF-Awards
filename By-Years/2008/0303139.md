ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The Cabeza DeVaca Earthmobile
Program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific aims of The Cabeza de Vaca Project are
to augment geoscience education among students from economically challenged
public middle schools, provide geoscience training to public middle school
science teachers, and increase community awareness of geoscience issues through
public organizations and events. This program uses a state-of-the-art geoscience
mobile laboratory and trained faculty and students from Texas A&amp;M
University-Corpus Christi (TAMU-CC). The Cabeza de Vaca Earthmobile
Program&lt;br/&gt;is supported by various organizations including The Texas
State Aquarium, The Corpus Christi Science and History Museum as well as the
Colleges of Education and Science and Technology at Texas A&amp;M University-
Corpus Christi. Due to newly state-mandated science exams to be administered at
the end of fifth grade, initial emphasis is placed on fifth and sixth grade
students. The PIs collaborate with public school middle science teachers and
other educators, to advance knowledge and understanding of physical science
applications of geoscience by students. The PIs will develop appropriate GLOBE-
based laboratory exercises for middle school students, and run workshops to help
teachers enhance geoscience applications in their science courses. This approach
advances understanding in the geosciences while promoting teaching, training and
learning. At the end of each school year, schools in the program will take part
in a poster session to share their findings with the public. Outreach efforts
will continue while school is not in session, especially during the summer
months, at community and state fairs as well as at other public events where
local environmental geoscience issues will be addressed.&lt;br/&gt;
