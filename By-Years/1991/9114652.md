This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology graduate
student from Arizona State University, studying the demographic variation in a
tribal society in Indonesia. Six local societies will be studied to answer
questions about the effects of demographic variables on marriage choice and the
resultant patterns of residence and behavior. The project will test the
hypothesis that choice of spouses will vary between communities with local
population size and distribution as well as age structure, sex ratios and family
size. Previous studies of the effects of marriage choices and preferential
mating rules did not record detailed demographic data, so the interaction
between demographic processes and marriage rules could not be intensively
studied. Methods include participant observation, structured interviews, and in-
depth interviews with family heads. Most demographic research is on large scale
societies, yet basic data from simple societies is important to test theories of
human demographic function and social evolution. This research will also be
valuable to decision makers interested in family planning in the tropic world.
