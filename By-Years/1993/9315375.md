9315375 Wasserman Research on the physics of compact stars will be continued by
a team of researchers with many years of experience in this field. Topics to be
addressed include a Bayesian analysis of ray burst statistics, the production of
cyclotron lines from relativistic flows, baryonic matter in the galactic halo,
x-ray emission from slowly accreting neutron stars, explosions of neutron stars
near minimum mass and the formation of brown low mass dwarfs by slow accretion.
