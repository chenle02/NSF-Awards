The project team has developed a cohesive framework for high rate underwater
communication via acoustic particle velocity channels. Propagation
characteristics of such channels were studied and new communication and signal
processing solutions were devised for transceiver design. Given the low data
rates offered by the conventional technology and the high demand for fast data
and video communication, the team plans to further develop the technology for
widespread use. There is a need for improved underwater modems to communicate
among underwater sensors, deep-water moored instruments, autonomous underwater
vehicles, surface vessels, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Widespread use
of this technology has the potential to positively impact offshore oil and gas
industry, fishing industry, environmental and ocean monitoring systems to
predict natural disasters such as hurricanes, systems for inspection and repair
of underwater constructions and facilities, ocean exploration, etc. The
developed transformative technology to communicate via particle velocity
channels is expected to have a technological impact on underwater communication
systems, which have almost exclusively used the acoustic pressure channel for
decades. The impact of the proposed plan, if successful, could be the
significant advancement of the underwater communication technology in a number
of different applications. This could result in a major enhancement of our
ability to benefit from the many resources that underlay the world's oceans.
