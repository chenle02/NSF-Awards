9500019 Trumper This engineering research equipment award will be used to build
a unique high lateral resolution positioning system: 1.0 nm repeatability in a
25mm x 25 mm x 100 micrometer space. This system forms the basis for what is
termed the long-range scanning stage (LORS), a critical component in the next
generation of equipment used to manufacture integrated circuits, photo-masks,
and micromechanical actuators. The basic components funded by this award are a
scanned probe microscope comprised of a system controller and a sample stage for
scanning transmission or atomic force microscopy, a laser interferometry system,
and a high speed data acquisition and digital signal processing system. The
design is based on the investigator's expertise in hybrid oil/magnetic bearings
that achieve a mechanical noise level of 0.4 nm peak-to-peak. This precision
mechanical positioning device is a new concept, that will form the basis for new
types of ultra precision manufacturing equipment needed to produce high value
precision or micromechanical products, and photo-masks for integrated circuits.
