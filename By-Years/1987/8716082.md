This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides support for the
research of Professor Joseph Gajewski of Indiana University. This work is
focused on using secondary kinetic isotope effects and stereochemistry to
determine transition state structures in concerted reactions. Strategies have
also been developed to demonstrate the possible existence of intermediates in
certain allylic rearrangements. The reactions to be studied include 1,3-shifts
in the vinylcyclopropane rearrangement; 3,3-sigmatropic shifts of substrates
with strong electron withdrawing groups at C-2; ionic 3,3-shifts; 2+2, 2+3, and
2+4 cycloadditions; and carbonyl additions. Attempts will also be made to
parameterize transition state bond lengths, angles, and constants for molecular
mechanics calculations of diastereoselectivity in pericyclic reactions and
carbonyl additions. Work of the type supported in this grant is essential if we
are to understand the dynamics of simple organic reactions. Such understanding
provides the necessary foundation for studies of chemical reactivity in complex
molecular systems.
