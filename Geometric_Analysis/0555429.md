Abstract

Award: DMS-0555429 Principal Investigator: Mikhail Lyubich

The main focus of the program will be the interaction between 3-dimensional
hyperbolic geometry and holomorphic dynamics. These two fields have flourished
through the past 30 years, with numerous fruitful exchanges that have enriched
both of them. Both fields have been heavily influenced by major conjectures; the
Thurston Geometrization Program in hyperbolic geometry and investigation of the
intricate structure of the Mandelbrot set in complex dynamics. Recent years have
witnessed many exciting breakthroughs in the both fields. The program provides
an opportunity to consolidate these recent achievements and to discuss further
directions they open. It will also touch on a number of active related fields:
holomorphic dynamics in several variables, laminations and foliations, partially
hyperbolic dynamics, and Teichmuller flow. The program will take place at the
Fields Institute, which is mounting an intensive semester of activity in this
area during the period January-May 2006. A number of graduate courses, mini-
courses and seminars, as well as three Workshops on various themes of the
program will be carried out during that time. They will be largely directed
towards young researches who will have an opportunity to learn about most recent
events in the field. The NSF funding will be used to support American
mathematicians who wish to participate in this activity, principally young
mathematicians without other sources of support.
