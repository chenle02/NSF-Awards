The project is awarding thirty scholarships per year to students who are
enrolled in a computer information technology, computer networking, computer
programming analysis, engineering technologies or mathematics transfer program
and/or to enter the workforce.

The project is providing multiple support systems for the CSEMS scholars such as
academic counseling in "Student Success" workshops and supplemental instruction,
peer and online tutoring, cohort meetings, career exploration events, financial
aid sessions, a "Computer Technologies Club, and career planning. Business and
industrial connections are being promoted through Career Exploration Events, a
"Tech Camp" which is providing hands-on experiences in technology, "Career
Exploration Events" held three times per year, and by taking students to
business sites for tours and work exposure.

The project is targeting underrepresented classes of students who are
financially needy and academically talented to attain educational goals and
become workers in a myriad of high technology jobs in a region that has the
nation's fifth largest high tech workforce. The project is building upon a
previous CSEMS grant and is incorporating lessons learned into this project.
