The pioneering works of Bennequin and Eliashberg from the 1980s and
&lt;br/&gt;the 1990s have shown that, among all contact structures, the tight
&lt;br/&gt;ones best reflect the topology of the ambient space. Only in the past
&lt;br/&gt;decade have sufficient tools been developed to allow many of the
&lt;br/&gt;basic classification questions in the subject to be attacked. The PI
&lt;br/&gt;proposes joint work with Honda and Mati\'c to analyze the contact
&lt;br/&gt;topology of Haken manifolds using cut-and-paste techniques. Important
&lt;br/&gt;outgrowths of this investigation include constructions of tight
&lt;br/&gt;contact structures in Haken homology spheres, extensions of the
&lt;br/&gt;relationship with foliation theory to laminations and hyperbolic
&lt;br/&gt;manifolds, and an understanding of the interplay between the
&lt;br/&gt;subsurface complex and contact structures on a
product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three-dimensional manifolds are modeled on the
three-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;space we live in. Contact and symplectic topology
were originally &lt;br/&gt;motivated by questions of physicists working in
classical mechanics &lt;br/&gt;and thermodynamics. They arise in a surprisingly
broad array of &lt;br/&gt;applied situations ranging from fluid flows to the
manufacture of &lt;br/&gt;projection screen televisions. The proposed research
has the &lt;br/&gt;potential to produce new results applicable to these
fields.&lt;br/&gt;
