Computer science, and computer security in particular, tends to learn from our
successes and ignore our failures. The workshop series Learning from
Unanticipated Scientific Security Research Results&lt;br/&gt;(LUSSRR) addresses
this limitation. Through this series of workshops, researchers present their
unexpected results - which may be failures, but may also be opportunities to
learn something other than what was expected. This process encourages
researchers to learn from each other and avoid duplication of effort, while
encouraging new approaches to old problems. LUSSRR workshops publish proceedings
which are included in the traditional digital libraries such as IEEE and ACM.
