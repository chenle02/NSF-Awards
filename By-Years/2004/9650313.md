For the past several years, the Chemistry Department has been engaged in a
program to modernize its facilities and instrumentation. A new organic lab has
been built. The chemistry storage area, preproom, balance room, and
instrumentation room have all been remodeled and updated. New instruments have
been purchased including two infrared spectrometers, an ultra-violet-visible
spectrophotometer, two high pressure liquid chromatographs, and a nuclear
magnetic resonance spectrometer. Acquiring a new atomic absorption (AA)
spectrometer is the next logical step in this modernization program. It is the
perfect addition to the department's array of state-of-the-art equipment. Recent
chemical education literature has stressed the need to improve student interest
and success in general chemistry courses. One way to do this is through active
participation in laboratory experiments that have an obvious relevance to
everyday life. Direct, hands-on experience with AA can spark interest in
learning science while teaching basic instrumentation and research skills to
undergraduate chemistry students. The plan to use AA spectroscopy involves its
immediate implementation in the laboratory component of three freshman-level
chemistry courses.
