9404087 Previato The research covers aspects of Hamiltonian and integrable
systems as related to the geometry of algebraic curves and the theory of moduli
spaces of vector bundles. Several aspects of the theory of theta functions will
be considered in their relationship with certain classes of differential
equations. The research has potential applications to other branches of
mathematics, mathematical physics, in particular the theory of solitons. ***
