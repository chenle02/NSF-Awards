9410236 Jia The purpose of the proposed research is to develop a feasible and
effective approach to software development based on Z formal specifications that
is suitable for industrial applications. The goal is to synthesize production-
quality code. It does not intend to fully automate the development process,
rather to integrate design refinement, program synthesis, software components
reuse, and manual development. The proposed approach depends on human engineers
to make design decisions through interactive sessions, and it attempts to fully
automate the implementation processes. The key components of the proposed
approach include design refinement using predicate transformation, refinement of
loose specifications, reusing and fine-tuning of generic algorithms and data
structures. The proposed project will experimentally apply the proposed approach
in industrial environments. Prototypes of supporting tools for design refinement
and code synthesis will be developed. ***
