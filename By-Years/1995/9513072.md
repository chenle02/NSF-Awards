9513072 Lieb This research is devoted to various aspects of many- body theory in
quantum mechanics, to certain aspects of field theory and differential
equations, and to some problems in pure mathematics. These various topics have
grown out of a body of research over several decades and the underlying unity is
that solutions in the various problem areas shed light on each other. There are
four major areas. One is the study of geometric symmetry breaking in such models
as Ginzburg- Landau vortices and Skyrmions. The question of symmetry breaking is
a crucial one in modern physics. The second concerns electron correlations in
many-body systems which, currently, is a central topic in areas such as
superconductivity. The third concern centers around the structure of atoms and
molecules. The earlier work in these areas, notably the problem of permanent
dominance for matrices and the question of the continuity or lack of it for
Steiner symmetrization of functions, which is a useful tool in quantum mechanics
and analysis. ***
