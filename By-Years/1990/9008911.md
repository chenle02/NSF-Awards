This award supports an international workshop in three areas of condensed
matter physics: surfaces, thin films and small particles. The U.S. organizers
are Adolfo Eguiluz of Montana State University and Fernando Ponce of Xerox
Corporation, along with five others from countries other than the U.S.: Mexico,
Germany, Colombia and Brazil. The Peruvian organizers are from Lima and Cusco:
M. Horn, V. Latorre, E. Lopez-Carranza and E. Gil. In addition, there is an
International Advisory Committee with members from countries throughout Central
and South America as well as from the U.S., Spain, France and Italy. Forty
contributions have been invited out of a total submission of 150 abstracts
indicating wide interest and participation on the part of Latin American
physicists and others from the U.S. and Europe. Some of the papers are the
result of ongoing U.S.-Latin American collaborations. The proceedings will be
published by an international publisher as have those of previous such symposia.
The workshop will consist of oral presentations in addition to poster sessions.
The topics include atomic and electronic structure of metallic and semiconductor
surfaces, interaction with radiation, physics, and chemisorption, quantum
effects, magnetism and applications to catalysis and corrosion. In keeping with
the goal of fostering mutilateral collaborations, a round-table session will be
held to highlight the main themes of the workshop, make recommendations of
future research directions and to organize preliminary arrangements of
collaborative projects that have developed during the workshop.
