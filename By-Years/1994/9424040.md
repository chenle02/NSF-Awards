With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program and the Office of
multidisciplinary Activities are supporting the research of Dr. Marc M.
Greenberg of the Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University. Dr.
Greenberg will focus his work on developing solid phase oligonucleotide
synthesis supports. The resulting protected oligonucleotides have important
biological properties and the work has important biotechnical implications. The
focus of this research is the development of orthogonal linkers for solid phase
oligonucleotide synthesis that utilize known photochemical and organometallic
reactions, and conjugation of the biopolymers released from these novel
supports. Conjugation methodology will focus on the formation of bonds between
oligonucleotides and peptides as well as between two oligonucleotides. The
methodology will be particularly useful for the synthesis of RNA molecules.
