An award is made to the University of California, Irvine (UCI), to develop a new
type of microscope that can be used to study the properties of cell membranes.
The SCRM instrument provides a unique solution for cell membrane studies where
the use of fluorescent labels is questionable, thus enabling new discoveries in
cell biology and membrane biophysics not previously possible with current
technologies. The development and application of the SCRM technology forms a
thorough training opportunity for two graduate students and one undergraduate
student in the areas of engineering, optical physics and biology. An important
component of this program is to bring the new SCRM technology into the
classroom, which is achieved by using the prototype instrument in a graduate
level course on Molecular Biophysics. The new microscope will also be actively
used in the Laboratory Experiments &amp; Activities in the Physical Sciences
(LEAPS) program, which brings underrepresented students from the Santa Ana
School District to the UCI campus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The special feature of
this microscope is its capability to interrogate membranes of live cells with
high contrast, but without the use of fluorescent labels. This new mode of
inquisition, called surface-sensitive coherent Raman microscopy (SCRM), is
achieved through merging the imaging properties of two existing techniques:
coherent Raman scattering (CRS) microscopy and total internal reflection
illumination. Compared to conventional CRS microscopy, SCRM offers a ten times
higher axial resolution at imaging speeds of more than 10 frames per second.
