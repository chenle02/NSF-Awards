Fisk University operates a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site on
materials modification and characterization; the Site is based in the Physics
Department at Fisk. Twelve students are recruited nationwide every year for a
nine-week summer research experience. Students participate in a variety of
research projects that involve crystal growth, glasses, nonlinear optical
materials, surface science, ceramics, and associated characterization
techniques. Undergraduate participants also attend a research seminar series and
prepare oral and written presentations on their research projects.
