This award support participation in the conference "Combinatory Analysis 2018"
to be held June 21--24, 2018 at the Pennsylvania State University. The aim of
this conference is to provide a means for research mathematicians, graduate
students, and others interested in partitions to explore new achievements,
current research trends, and problems in this area by bringing together top
researchers with junior mathematicians. It is expected that this conference will
stimulate significant collaboration among the researchers in attendance. Further
details are available at the conference website:

The conference is expected to attract around 100 participants. The topics to be
covered in this conference are very broad encompassing many different subject
areas from number theory to combinatorics that are related to partition theory;
in particular modular forms, special functions, enumerative combinatorics, and
representation theory. In addition to seventeen plenary talks, several parallel
sessions of 20-minute talks are planned. After the conference, the refereed
proceedings will be published as Special Issues of Annals of Combinatorics
(Springer) in 2019. The majority of the money in the award is intended to
support graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, including women and
under-represented minorities.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
