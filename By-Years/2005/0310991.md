The proposed research focuses on understanding the inherent computational
complexity of various algorithmic questions which have arisen recently in
connection with a variety of optimization, scheduling and resource allocation
problems coming from Internet and telecommunications routing and usage
applications, among others. Our main goal is to provide efficient (polynomial-
time) algorithms for those problems, which have them, sharp approximation
algorithms for those, which don't, and appropriate non-approximability results
when this is appropriate. Problems of this type form a critical part of the
foundations of theoretical computer science. In addition to increasing our
understanding of the fundamental reasons as to why some problems are so much
harder to solve than others, the discovery of efficient algorithms (when they
exist) can contribute to more effective use of Internet network and processing
resources, memory usage in parallel computation algorithms, more efficient
pattern recognition methods in computational biology, and increased capacity for
many kinds of communication networks, for example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
