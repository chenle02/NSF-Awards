This Growing Convergence Research project aims at crop improvements through deep
integration across life sciences (plant biology, agronomy, genetics), physical
sciences (engineering), and computational sciences. Specific goals are to
develop tools and apply methods that capitalize on advances in these respective
fields to provide acceleration of crop improvement progress -- an outcome of
worldwide importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposers seek to build on their
early progress in measurement of plant architecture, increasing scale to
accommodate large populations, accelerating data processing and enhancing
scientific visualization to efficiently pair imagery with rich information
provided by post-processing algorithms. Further, it is important to go beyond
quantification of growth trajectories and link these to measurements of crop
yield, to reveal subsets of measurements that are accurate proxies for yield,
and DNA markers that are diagnostic of salient genes. This multidisciplinary
project is closely tied to the education of students and the public at many
levels. The researchers will build on their long and positive involvement with
talented members of underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
