9714044 Silander This dissertation enhancement grant supports a US graduate
student, Mr. Steven Pousty, working under the guidance of Dr. John Silander,
Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Connecticut,
to conduct a study on a terrestrial isopod in the Negev Desert in Israel. Data
will be collected on Hemilepistus reaumuri to determine the effect of spatial
heterogeneity on dispersal and population dynamics. The individual and
population data will be integrated into a simulation model which will allow Mr.
Pousty to examine the feasibility of scaling from individual movement to larger
spatial scales in heterogeneous environments. Dr. Moshe Shachak, of the
Department of Biology at the Ben Gurion University of the Negev, will
collaborate with Mr. Pousty on this project. This study will make an important
contribution to the existing knowledge on the role that dispersal has in scaling
organisms to their landscapes, and to our understanding of larger-scale patterns
in landscape ecology. The grant will also provide support to enable a promising
student to establish a strong, independent research career. ***
