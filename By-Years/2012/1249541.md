As a first step in building a community of 100Gbs campuses and best practices in
science and engineering research applications supported across this
infrastructure, Clemson Univerity proposes to host two workshops that will bring
together stakeholders from ten academic institutions across the country in a
sustained dialogue to develop and refine a model for coordinated infrastructure
aggregation that connects campuses via the forthcoming Internet2 Innovation
platform. These workshops will result in a shared agreement, governance
structure, and roadmap to be reported back to the NSF and broader community.

Participants will discuss strategies and required infrastructure to leverage the
Internet2 innovation platform with its 100Gb/s backbone to connect campuses and
allow high performance interconnections that can be built and broken down in ad-
hoc ways using OpenFlow. The recommended strategies to build these connections
coupled with the consortium's community building characteristics will serve as a
model for "team science" that other institutions can follow.

As a result of these workshops, the project will develop a strategy and roadmap
for leveraging NSF investments on campuses around the country and enabling
science and education deployments that are not possible today.
