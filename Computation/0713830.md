The principle objective of this proposal is to develop new methods for the exact
solution of ordinary and partial differential equations. The research topics
contained in this proposal are motivated by recent advances in symbolic methods
and recent theoretical developments in the field of geometric analysis of
differential equations. The theoretical developments provide for a new, unified,
coherent approach to symmetry-based solution techniques. Advances in symbolic
methods for symmetry computations and in the implementation of symbolic software
for computations in differential geometry and Lie theory provide the
computational environment for testing the practical utility of these theoretical
constructions. The proposed research activities balance mathematical formalism
and rigor with a desire to create effective and efficient new algorithms for
solving differential equations which build upon and complement existing solution
methodologies.

Almost all processes in the physical sciences and engineering are modeled by
differential equations of one kind or another. By studying these differential
equations and their solution, one gains understanding of how these processes
evolve. Mathematicians use analytical, numerical, geometric and algebraic
methods to study differential equations. This proposal deals with geometric and
algebraic methods since these methods are best suited for implementation in
interactive computer algebra systems (CAS). This work will expand the number and
kinds of equations which can be solved by CAS. A unique feature of this proposal
is the investigators ability to quickly implement new theoretical advances and
distribute them to a very broad clientel of mathematicians, scientists and
engineers. In addition, the computer software developed by the investigators is
very useful for training advanced undergraduate and graduate students in
important topics in geometry and algebra.
