This award, jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and
Chemistry, supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the
University of Minnesota-Twin Cities for the summers of 2005-2007. The program
director is David Thomas. Twelve students per summer will be involved in this
project at the University of Minnesota Supercomputing Institute. The focus of
the project is the application of computational approaches to the mathematical
and physical sciences. The program's purpose is to stimulate the interest of
participants in pursuing careers in research that involve the application of
computer science and advanced computation to cutting-edge problems in physical
sciences and mathematics. The selected interns will be supervised and advised by
active faculty researchers at the Supercomputing Institute and work closely with
the faculty members and their research groups. They will prepare a written
report on their work and make a presentation about their research at the end of
the program. Students will be recruited nationally, including those from
institutions with high enrollment of women and minority students. Students with
interests in computer science, scientific computation, visualization, physical
or biological science, or engineering are the focus of this program.
