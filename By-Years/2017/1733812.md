Swarm robotics explores how groups of robots can work towards a singular goal,
which is typically achieved by equipping each robot with sensory capabilities,
basic computing power, and movement. The sensors detect and use information
about the environment to decide on the next action. Swarm robotics has made many
advances in recent years, but is still in its infancy. This project proposes to
explore swarm robotics systems in a non-standard way as physical systems. The
PIs take a "task-oriented" approach to develop the distributed algorithmic rules
that the robots will run (at the microscopic level) in order to converge to the
desired collective behavior (at the macroscopic level). This will provide
understanding of the minimal requirements for individuals to accomplish the
desired behavior, for both algorithmic and physical realizations, and will
provide a more principled approach for studying swarm robotics. The robots
envisioned are small in scale, ranging in size from millimeters to centimeters,
so that when deployed in dense environments, they will behave as programmable
active matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs have strong records for
interdisciplinary research, including initiating interdisciplinary areas (e.g.,
robo-physics, self-organizing particle systems, and the fusion of statistical
physics and randomized algorithms). They have a strong commitment toward
supporting minorities, women, and undergrad research (e.g., through NSF REUs,
including through this project, NSF S-STEM programs at ASU; ADVANCE and S.U.R.E.
programs at Georgia Tech). Any breakthrough in this combination of swarm and
active matter systems will require employing analyses and techniques from
stochastic systems, condensed matter physics, swarm systems, robotics, and
distributed algorithms to understand and achieve the desired group dynamics, and
hence will bring together and educate researchers from different disciplines and
specialties. New research approaches and findings will be incorporated into
multiple graduate courses and workshops will provide tutorials for bridging
multiple disciplines, making material accessible to young researchers and
helping to widely disseminate results. Findings (including open source code)
will be published in the various disciplines, and will be be made available on
our web pages and ArXiv. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project explores the
fundamentals of swarm robotics from a physics standpoint, by viewing the
ensemble as active matter composed of programmable elements at the micro-level.
The project will follow a (macro-)task oriented approach, and design a
distributed stochastic algorithmic framework to design and evaluate algorithms
at the micro-level that will yield the targeted emergent macroscopic behavior.
The emergent behaviors it addresses include compression (maintaining coherence
of a connected community while minimizing perimeter), bridging (connecting two
or more locations in the most efficient manner), alignment (determining an
agreed upon direction of orientation), jamming (obstruction of movement by
increased collective flow), and locomotion (collectively moving while
maintaining cohesiveness). Many of these have interesting converse problems
which are also equally worthwhile, such as exploration (maintaining a connected
population, but exploring maximal area) and non-alignment (representing a
disordered ensemble). In some cases the collective behavior acts like a physical
system changing between a liquid (disordered) and a solid (ordered) state, as
determined by phase transitions in the systems. The project will explore
stochastic and distributed algorithms for rigorously achieving these goals.
