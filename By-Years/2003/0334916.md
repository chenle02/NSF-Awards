The Lyot Project extends the use of the classical coronagraph instrument to the
3.63 meter high-order adaptive optics telescope operated by the U.S. Air Force
on Maui. The diffraction-limited images obtained using the telescope/coronagraph
combination will allow detailed observations of circumstellar material extremely
close to the associated star, which acts as its own wavefront sensor. The
coronagraph will, for the first time, directly probe solar system scales and
companion masses below the brown dwarf range. The current project will improve
the functionality of the existing coronagraph by implementing a novel phase-mask
and a special system that images perpendicular polarization vectors
simultaneously.
