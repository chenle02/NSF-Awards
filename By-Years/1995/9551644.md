The university is purchasing a laser setup and computerized detector system to
allow the introduction of representative examples of modern laser spectroscopy
into the undergraduate program. Components that accommodate a wide range of
projects have been selected and help demonstrate concepts that are unique to
laser spectroscopy. These experiments use a pulsed nitrogen-tunable dye laser
module to generate excited state molecules. A computer-interfaced oscilloscope
and photomultiplier monitor the decay in emission following a laser pulse. In
other experiments, a laboratory computer controls either the laser frequency or
an emission monochromator and processes signals from a gated detector to obtain
excitation, fluorescence emission, or Raman spectra. Students use a visual
programming language (Labview) to design software for computer control and
integration of the modular components, data acquisition, and signal processing.
These projects have been selected to reinforce quantum mechanical concepts
developed in Physical Chemistry II and to provide undergraduate students
experience and research opportunities with modern physical chemistry tools.
