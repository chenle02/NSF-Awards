The University of La Verne will use this grant to connect three of it's remote
campus sites to the Internet. These include: the Inland Empire Center, the San
Fernando Valley Site and the Ventura Center. The campus sites will be served
with a 128KB frame relay connection. The students and faculty of the University
of La Verne need the Internet connections to be able to access information
resources throughout the state, the nation and the world. The connection will
benefit the faculty, staff students of this institution as well as the community
in general. The award provides partial support of the project for two years.
