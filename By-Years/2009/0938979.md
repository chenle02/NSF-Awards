This award will support two researchers from the University of Hawaii on a
planning visit to Canada in 2009. The primary goal of the visit is to initiate a
long-term collaboration between researchers from the University of Hawaii and
the University of British Columbia to advance the proficiency of students in
physics, chemistry, biology, and geology through engaging new courses on global
environmental challenges. The planning visit will enable the researchers to
develop and assess the effectiveness of a new undergraduate curriculum on global
environmental challenges for non-science majors. The team will adapt a
scientific approach to teaching and developing the curriculum. Specifically, the
team will:&lt;br/&gt;- establish what students should learn from the
introductory courses, &lt;br/&gt;- scientifically measure what students are
learning,&lt;br/&gt;- adapt instructional methods and curriculum,
and&lt;br/&gt;- incorporate effective use of technology and pedagogical research
to achieve desired learning outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;The team plans to disseminate
the effective strategies and courses to all community colleges and universities
in the University of Hawai'i system, as well as University of British Columbia.
