9503747 Neumann College This proposal requests funds for Neumann College to
establish a connection to the Internet using a developmental model which
includes four stages: * Institutional cabling and wiring * Library and
multicampus network * Integrating technology with teaching-learning * Outreach
with underserved urban school (Chester, PA) for teacher development and student
learning. These connections will rovide operations management and information
services and it will give the college a 56 thousand bits per second connection
to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The benefits of this NSFNET connection include e-mail between local and
remote researchers and educators, file transfer capability and the ability to
use remote computer resources. Also the college will have the ability to
investigate innovation in educational resources and incorporate them into their
curricula.
