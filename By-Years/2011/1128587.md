The objective of this program is to develop a new type of optoelectronic nano-
hand by integrating fiber optics, electronics, and NEMS/MEMS (nano- or micro-
electromechanical systems) in a unified platform. The PIs plan to carry out four
core research tasks. First, they will demonstrate a prototype optoelectronic
nanohand. Second, they will investigate its optical waveguiding properties.
Third, they will investigate optical force exerted by laser beam delivered by
the nanohand. Finally, they will investigate in situ electrical and optical
characterization, and explore the application of the
nanohand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is the demonstration and
development of new capability to manipulate, control, and characterize
individual nanoscale objects. The proposed nanohand has several unique features.
It has a large aspect ratio and is free of substrate support. The nanohand has
multiple independently controlled nano-actuators or fingers. An object can also
be potentially controlled by auxiliary optical force. Finally, electric
measurements and optical characterization can be performed to probe a single
clenched nanoscale object in situ. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are
as follows. The proposed nanohand represents a new class of multi-functional
nano-manipulators and can have significant impact on several areas including
NEMS/MEMS, optics, and bioengineering. It can open new possibilities for
realizing nano-opto-electro-mechanical and nano-robotic systems, for assembling
complex three-dimensional nanostructures, and for probing the properties of
nanoscale systems and devices at a single nanoparticle or single nanowire level.
The multi-disciplinary nature of the proposed research also makes this program
an excellent opportunity to educate and train students.
