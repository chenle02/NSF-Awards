Cohesionless soils exhibit a loss of stiffness and strength when subjected to
earthquake or explosive loading, followed by a gradual recovery as confining
pressures and/or cementitious bonds redevelop. If the soil experiences further
shock loading during this period of reduced stiffness, the soil experiences
large shearing strains, and may liquefy. However, quantitative measures of this
behavior are not available. This research program is a laboratory and field
investigation to observe the changes in soil stiffness as a function of the
soil's properties, stress history, and magnitude of disturbance, in order to
determine the increased risks associated with secondary disturbances. The
laboratory phase of the program uses two types of resonant column apparatus to
monitor soil stiffness: a Hardin-type device modified for impulse loading, and a
recently-developed resonant column-torsional shear device. The former apparatus
can generate high pressure, short- duration impulse loads typical of explosions,
while the latter device will simulate earthquake-type ground motions. Stiffness
losses following detonation of conventional explosives will be monitored during
the field testing. Subsurface dynamic pore pressures and ground motions will be
measured and related to the changes in the soil stiffness as determined by
cross-hole shear tests.
