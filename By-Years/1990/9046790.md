This project is a continuation of a recent project to study the in-plane seismic
resistance of two-story masonry walls with openings under the coordinated TCCMAR
program. Additional experimental work will be conducted, using the existing test
set-up to permit (1) out-of-plane movement at floor levels, and (2) application
of out-of-plane loads. This additional study will resolve the discrepancies
existing between two different design concepts: (a) the earthquake damage is
concentrated in vertical masonry piers and (b) the walls should be designed as
coupled walls in which case the damage will be concentrated at the wall bases.
This study will broaden the theoretical basis of masonry walls design concepts
and facilitate the development of rational design methodologies to resist
seismic loads.
