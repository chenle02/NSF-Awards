Mating interaction, surface to surface interaction is prevalent in mechanical
devices. It is a functional primitive from which complex mechanical function is
synthesized. Transmission of power, of heat, and of fluids are examples of areas
where the complex function of a device can be reduced to primitives based on the
concept of mating. The purpose of the proposed work is to study how a certain
kind of mechanical function, namely that which can be reduced to mating
interaction, can be represented by constraint based languages. We will
investigate how mating of mechanical parts can be represented by mating
constraints and how synthesis of mechanical function from mating primitives can
be represented by the hierarchical composition of the mating constraints of a
constraint model. Our work will follow the theoretical/experimental methodology
of artificial intelligence, exploratory programming. The research will be
centered on a computational realization of the constraint paradigm, since this
paradigm can formally represent the intuitive notions of mating interaction and
those of functional decomposition and synthesis used in mechanical design.
