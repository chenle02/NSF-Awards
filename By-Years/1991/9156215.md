A cooperative effort among six colleges - Dartmouth, Grinnell, King, Middlebury,
Princeton, and Spelman - is resulting in the development and teaching of new
introductory mathematics course called CHANCE. CHANCE treats issues that are
reported in the news: statistical problems related to AIDS, the effects of
lowering serum cholesterol on heart attacks, the use of DNA fingerprinting in
the courts, maintaining quality of manufactured goods in the face of variation,
informed patient decision making, reliability of political polls, and so forth.
Students study the newspaper accounts of these topics, articles in general
science journals, such as Chance, Science, Nature, and Scientific American, and
finally the original research papers. Summary modules, student projects,
classroom experiences, data sets, bibliographies, and other materials are being
disseminated to both college and precollege teachers through an electronic
network.
