Integrated circuits are pervasive, found in everything from mobile phones and
televisions, to cars and airplanes. In order to continue to produce new and
more-capable electronics, it is necessary to develop techniques for creating
example electronic systems that provides critical information about how to
improve the design and fabrication of integrated circuits. This NSF-funded
project is focused on developing a design approach for creating integrated
circuits that closely resemble electronics actually used in phones, televisions,
etc. but also have the property that they can be easily diagnosed when they fail
to work properly due to non-idealities in design and/or manufacturing. The
knowledge learned from diagnosis will then allow the design and manufacturing to
be improved in order to reduce/prevent integrated circuits for actual products
(phones, cars, etc.) from failing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the support of the
NSF program, an integrated circuit design methodology based on logic-function
regularity will be developed. The planned methodology produces a test circuit
that reflects various physical aspects of actual integrated circuits used in
everyday products while guaranteeing optimal test and diagnosis characteristics.
The methodology will allow both designers and manufacturers of integrated
circuits to produce new, more capable integrated electronics for future
products. Example circuits will be design and manufactured in collaboration with
industrial partners to demonstrate the capabilities of the methodology.
