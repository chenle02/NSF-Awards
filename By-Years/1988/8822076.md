The local segmental dynamics of polyisoprene and polystyrene will be
investigated using three complementary and interactive techniques. Time-resolved
optical spectroscopy will be used to observe directly the orientation
autocorrelation function associated with a backbone bond in anthracene-labeled
chains. C-13 NMR experiments at a range of temperatures and Larmor frequencies
will be used to access some information about the correlation function
associated with local dynamics in unlabeled polymers. Brownian dynamics computer
simulations will provide quantitative predictions for both experiments, and new
qualitative insights into the detailed mechanisms of local motions. Together
these techniques will address the relationship between molecular structure and
local dynamics, the role of the solvent environment in local motions, and the
connection between local and global polymer motions.
