The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project is in the
development of a low-cost, high sensitivity sensor to measure contaminants in
groundwater. These measurements are currently performed using technologies that
are relatively expensive ($250-300 per water sample) and have a long turn-around
time (10-15 business days). The proposed on-site optical detection technology
targets a 10-fold reduction in test price ($20-30 per water sample), and fast
detection time (&lt;10 minutes). The proposed sensor will possess the following
advanced attributes: high sensitivity, high specificity, fast detection, ease of
operation, low power consumption, zero chemical release, low operational cost,
remote measurements, and long-term stability without the need for recalibration.
Moreover, direct use of the sample water will potentially eliminate
uncertainties associated with measurement techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed toward
development of a powerful on-site detection and monitoring system for trace
levels of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in groundwater. The proposed
technology uses fluorescence quenching induced phase shift. A fluorescent
material with PFAS molecule binding sites will be fabricated and its PFAS-
induced fluorescence quenching will be experimentally evaluated. Using phase
fluorometry, the phase shift of quenched emissions against excitation pulses
will be recorded and correlated to the concentration of PFAS in water. The key
technical risks lie in improving sensitivity by three orders of magnitude for a
complex aqueous sample.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
