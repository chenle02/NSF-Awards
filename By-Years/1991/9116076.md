This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in condensed
matter physics between Jean Toulouse of Lehigh University and Michel Rousseau,
University of Maine in LeMans, France. The investigators will study structural
phase transitions fluorides with perovskite structure. The objectives of their
collaboration are to investigate the physical mechanism involved in structural
phase transitions (SPT) and to understand the properties of these materials
during the phase transitions. The Lehigh group brings to this collaboration a
solid background in defect studies and experience in ultrasonic, dielectric and
spectroscopic experimental techniques. This is complemented by the French
investigators expertise in neutron scattering and x-ray studies and their
ability to grow high quality crystals. Structural phase transition in mixed
systems, especially oxides, is an area of considerable current interest. Mixed
systems are important to the development of high Tc superconductors, optical
materials and structural materials. Further knowledge about the effects of
structural phase transition on the composition of materials could lead to the
development of improved, high performance materials.
