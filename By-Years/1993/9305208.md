The proper form of a multicellular organism requires precise control of
terminal differentiation events. This research will address how a single
terminal differentiation event is executed during the development of a simple
model organism, the nematode C. elegans. The analysis will focus on the terminal
differentiation of lateral hypodermal "seam" cells, which terminally
differentiate during the final (4th) molt. Several distinct cellular processes
are coordinately controlled during this terminal differentiation event,
including cell cycle, cell fusion, and the stage-specific regulation of cuticle
gene expression. A gene called lin-29 has been identified as a pivotal component
in programming the execution of seam cell terminal differentiation. Loss of
lin-29 function causes hypodermal cells of the adult stage to reiterate
indefinitely the larval program of cell divisions instead of exiting the cell
cycle and differentiating. lin-29 encodes a putative transcription factor of the
(Cys)2-(His)2 class, and, thus likely programs these events by regulating the
transcription of other genes. The major objective of this work is to identify
genes controlled by the lin-29 protein. Three approaches will be employed to
identify lin-29-regulated genes. ı1! Interactions of lin-29 protein with
predicted target genes: The stage-specific expression of the cuticle collagen
genes, col-17 and col-19, will be analyzed. col-17 expression is
transcriptionally repressed during the larval/adult switch, whereas col-19
expression is activated. The role of lin-29 in the alternative repression and
activation of these genes will be tested. ı2! Differential hybridization screens
to identify genes whose expression is influenced by the presence or absence of
lin-29 protein: Genes isolated in this fashion will be examined for direct
regulation by lin-29, and those directly regulated will be characterized
further. ı3! Development of a protein-DNA UV crosslinking method to isolate DNA
sequences bound by a specific protein in vivo: In the future, this method will
be used to identify genes bound by lin-29 protein in vivo, and should also be
applicable to the isolation of genes controlled by other C. elegans gene-
regulatory proteins. Genes involved in cell cycle exit and cell fusion, as well
as additional stage-specifically expressed cuticle genes, should be identified
by these methods. Analysis of the types of genes regulated by lin-29 in vivo
will lead to an understanding of how a complex terminal differentiation program
is orchestrated at a specific time during development.
