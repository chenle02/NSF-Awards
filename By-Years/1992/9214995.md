A study of the nonlinear dynamics of charge density waves (CDW) is proposed. A
capacitive coupling technique will be developed which will allow the application
of local electric fields to a sample on length scales as small as the
longitudinal phase-phase correlation length. Measurements of the real-time
response of the CDW to local and global perturbations will be quantitatively
compared with recent theory of CDW dynamics which explicitly takes into account
the effect of quasi particles on the CDW transport. Studies of effects due to
pulse-duration, mode-locking, delayed critical switching, nucleation of
dynamical solitons, ratcheting the CDW into a self-organized critical state,
avalanches and critical dynamics below threshold will be investigated. The work
will advance the understanding of the nonlinear dynamics of systems with many
degrees of freedom and many metastable configurations.
