In general terms this proposal concerns the behavior of systems with many
degrees of freedom. Here one looks for (a) collective behavior of the system as
a whole or (b) a statistical description of the behavior that an individual
component might exhibit. It is emphasized that (a) and (b) are not disjoint
criteria: indeed quite often (but not always) they coincide. The setups that
will be used to promote these studies are of four types; all, to a greater or
lesser extent, are interrelated and all four have their origins in the
description of physical problems. These are (i) [Classical Spin--Systems]
Lattice models of spins or particles interacting under certain rules, primarily
local, which are known as the laws of classical equilibrium statistical
mechanics. (ii) [Quantum Spin--Systems] A similar setup as in (i) but under the
rules of quantum equilibrium statistical mechanics. (iii) [Interacting Particle
Systems] Models where individual particles or spins occupying lattice positions
update their position or state dynamically in time according to stochastic rules
that are themselves effected by the existing local configuration. (iv) [Cluster
Models/Graphical Representations] Graphical models where, in addition to local
rules, configurations are determined, stochastically, according to global
considerations or non-local rules. In addition to the standard lattice based
large-scale descriptions, some of the work will concern continuum models --as
well as continuum limits of lattice models.

A philosophy which became prevalent beginning in the late 1960's is that of
universality: Once the basic nature and premise of the constituents and their
interactions are determined, the resultant (possible modes of) large?scale,
long?time collective behaviors in systems with many degrees of freedom do not
depend on the meticulous details of the model. Thus a variety of systems will be
investigated where the nature of the interacting constituents is of the simplest
type. However, it is anticipated that the full tapestry of collective behavior
will be exhibited. Thus, notwithstanding the physical origins of these types of
models, it is anticipated, at least by the PI, that these types of models allow
for a broad range of applications--even beyond the physical sciences. (Already
some of this has come to fruition in the context of a related proposal which
concerns the study of criminal behavior and allocation of police resources.)
Moreover and perhaps more pertinently: This proposal and its predecessor
encompass a broad array of problems with multiple facets providing research
opportunities at every level and the successful completion of the program will
require the assistance of many collaborators ranging from the undergraduate to
the senior research collaborator.
