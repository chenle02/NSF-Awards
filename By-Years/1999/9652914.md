The proposed project is to develop and implement a "Introduction to
Engineering" course at the University of South Alabama (USA) and Bishop State
Community College (BSCC). The goals of the project are improved retention of
first-year students at USA who are not taking Calculus I during their first
year, and career exploration and preparation for students at BSCC. The pre-
engineering course has the following objectives: 1) gain understanding of the
engineering profession; 2) develop problem-solving skills; 3) make connections
between mathematics, sciences and engineering ideas; 4) practice teaming skills;
5) enhance written and oral communication skills; 6) develop a positive attitude
of self; and 7) use email. The innovation of the proposed project is integration
of Service Learning into the first-year engineering design experience: under the
guidance of faculty advisors, student design teams will design, produce, and
deliver to middle-school teachers educational modules and manipulatives that
allow hands-on learning of mathematics. The special audiences targeted are:
first-year students at USA who are not taking Calculus I in their first year,
students at BSCC who want to find out about the engineering profession; and
Mobile County students currently participating in an honors program (Accepting
the Challenge to Excel) sponsored by the College of Engineering at USA. The
proposed project is a collaborative effort by the College of Engineering at USA,
Bishop State Community College, and the SECME (Southeastern Consortium for
Minorities in Engineering) program of the Mobile County Public School System.
The proposed project has the potential to become a model project for integrating
Service Learning into the first-year engineering design experience to improve
student retention and recruitment of under- represented groups.
