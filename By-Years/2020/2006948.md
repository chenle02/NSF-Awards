With the multi-core revolution, scaling to multiple cores is critical for
performance. Even small fractions of sequential code seriously limit performance
gains from parallelism. Critical sections sequentialize the execution and thus
increasingly limit performance as the number of cores increases. The classic
approach to scaling software to many cores begins with making locks more fine-
grained. This is often not sufficient to scale beyond a handful of cores;
scaling further often requires data structure implementations to be replaced
with new implementations. Existing profilers inform developers where time is
spent, but it is hard for developers to judge the impact of poorly selected data
structure designs. It is often not clear whether the synchronization overhead is
fundamental to the computation or can be addressed by rewriting the
implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a new approach to
profiling concurrent code based on information flow. Information flow analysis
enables this approach to differentiate between concurrency bottlenecks that are
fundamental to the computation and bottlenecks that are merely artifacts of the
particular implementation. This approach has the potential to not only suggest
where synchronization can be optimized but can also identify opportunities to
improve performance by rewriting to code to eliminate superfluous conflicts.
Previous work focused mostly on detecting conflicting accesses to shared data
and thus missed this optimization opportunity. The project will implement this
new approach in the FlowProf tool which will be publicly
available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
