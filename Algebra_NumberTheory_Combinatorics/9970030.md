The main goal of this project is further research into a most promising
conjecture about group characters. The complex irreducible characters of a
finite group G separate naturally into blocks with respect to any prime p
dividing the order of G. Each such character has a defect, which depends only on
the power of p dividing the degree of that character. In 1992 the principal
investigator of this project formulated a conjecture relating the number of
characters with a fixed defect in a fixed block of G to the numbers of
characters with the same defect in related blocks of certain p-local subgroups
of G. This conjecture, if true, would imply several other important conjectures
about blocks of group characters. Furthermore, a very strong form of it would
hold for all finite groups G if it held whenever G is simple. Since the finite
simple groups have been classified, this gives some hope of proving a number of
major conjectures about characters of arbitrary finite groups by verifying this
one strong conjecture for all blocks of finite simple groups. This verification
for any given group involves a long, delicate calculation. It has been carried
out in detail by several people for a large number of individual simple groups
and a few infinite families of such groups. So far it has always proved to be
correct. We hope it will continue to do so.

Groups in mathematics grew out of the notion of symmetry. We regard the
symmetries of any object in physics, chemistry or mathematics as transformations
of that object onto itself preserving all relevant properties of the object.
Then the composition of two such symmetries is again a symmetry of the object.
So is the inverse of any symmetry. In mathematical terms, this means that the
symmetries form a group. This symmetry group is an important invariant of the
object, and is much studied. In quantum mechanics, differential geometry and
algebraic number theory the relations of this group with other invariants of the
object are often expressed using representations of the group by complex
matrices, one for each element of the group, which behave under multiplication
as the corresponding group elements do under composition. When the group is
finite, such representations are completely determined by their characters,
which are the functions mapping each group element into the trace of the
corresponding matrix. The relations between finite groups and their characters
have fascinated mathematicians for over a hundred years. While many of the rules
governing such characters are known, examination of examples suggests that other
rules exist. There are many conjectures about such rules, but they tantalize us
by remaining beyond our powers of proof.
