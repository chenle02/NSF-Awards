The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Haystack Observatory will provide
research experiences in radio astronomy and atmospheric science for 21
undergraduate students during the summers of 1991, 1992, and 1993. The
Observatory, located in Westford, massachusetts, operates large radio telescopes
for studies of molecular line emission from galactic and extragalactic radio
sources and utilizes high-power radars for the study of the earth's upper
atmosphere. The Observatory is also engaged in the development of
instrumentation for interferometry and other radio science applications. Under
the guidance of the Observatory staff, the students will be engaged in both
scientific and technical projects and, through hands-on assignments, will be
exposed to the excitement of research. The program will continue the successful
participation by Haystack Observatory in the Research Experiences for
Undergraduates program since 1987. The research projects are supplemented by a
series of seminars, facility tours, research discussions, report preparation,
and participation in and presentation of research work at conferences. Follow-on
activities are planned for the students at the end of each summer program.
