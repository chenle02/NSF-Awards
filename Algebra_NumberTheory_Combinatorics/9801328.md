ABSTRACT Dinakar Ramakrishnan Cal Tech DMS 98-01328 In this project, Professor
Dinakar Ramakrishnan will study three technical problems central to the
Langlands program in Number Theory. One problem involves the principle of
functoriality involving the Asai L-functions and automorphic forms on the
general linear group of degree 4. The second involves a conjecture of the famous
mathematician from the early part of the century, Ramanujan. The final project
is to understand a class of cusp forms over complex multiplication fields with
regular infinity type. One of the most important mathematical ideas of the
second half of the century, is that analytic formula often encodes discrete
information. For example, one might want to count the number of solutions of a
particular equation, but discover that the solutions are very hard to find.
Mathematicians call these kind of problems 'discrete' because you are counting
separated things. The functions that appear in calculus, and for which calculus
works so well, are not 'discrete', but 'analytic' because they deal with all the
real numbers no matter how close together. Amazingly, the right kind of analytic
function can contain the answer a discrete examples. Actually the first examples
of this were discovered a couple hundred years ago, but in the past thirty
years, these examples have been systematized into a branch of number theory
called the Langlands program.
