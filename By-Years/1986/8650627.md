This project will introduce high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) into
biochemistry, organic chemistry, and instrumental analysis laboratory courses
and research projects for undergraduate students at Chestnut Hill College.
Chemistry and biochemistry majors will use a gradient HPLC system to study
parameters in chromatographic separations; to separate and analyze natural
products, pharmaceuticals, and various organic compounds which the students
synthesize; and to pursue more varied research projects. Working with this
important modern technique will broaden substantially the students' laboratory
experience, and will help Chestnut Hill College continue to prepare women for
careers in chemistry and biochemistry.
