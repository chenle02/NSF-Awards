This forty-eight month project will provide middle and high school students and
teachers with access to live scientific data from the Center for Embedded
Networked Sensing (CENS). It will result in curricular modules that are built
around sensor networks and that target core life science content and inquiry
standards. Current funding for scientific research has provided an ecosystem
monitoring network that supports extensive remote investigations of the James
Reserve in California. This project adds the educational interface and
supporting materials to support authentic investigations by schools. It allows
schools to do investigations and inquiry in the same way and in the same
environment as scientists.

The project builds on the $20 Million STC project to create a network of sensors
for scientific use. The proposed project aims to create a student-friendly view
of the CENS sensor network, with wrap-around instructional activities for
classroom use in a broad range of the sciences. Dissemination of these
activities will be in conjunction with the CENSnet project. A research component
includes the study of fading technological and pedagogical scaffold for inquiry
and measuring student gains.
