Archaeological research in Mesoamerica has traditionally focused on the
highland valleys of central Mexico and the Maya lowlands ignoring coastal zones.
This research project will begin to redress this bias. The student will study
human ecology and interregional interactions in the Rio Verde valley on the
coast of Oaxaca, Mexico. He will excavate three Late Formative sites and conduct
sedimentological sampling in the floodplain. Patterns of resource exploitation
will be examined to determine how the coastal region differed from highland
populations in resource use and how this affected interactions between the two
ecological zones. Specifically, the student will address the important issue of
how late Preclassic highland population growth and agricultural intensification
affected coastal areas. This study will provide crucial information on the
prehistory of the Mixteca Costa and its relationship to other areas of Oaxaca.
Collecting data concerning both social and geomorphological interactions between
the Rio Verde valley and the highland populations centered at Monte Alban will
add to our understanding of highland-lowland and primary state-secondary state
interactions.
