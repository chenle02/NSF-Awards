Dynamic free boundary problem refers to solving partial differential equations
in a domain whose evolution is a priori unknown. One example is the problem of
melting ice, where the interface of ice and water is determined dynamically by
the distribution of temperature, or solution of the heat equation, in the water
region. A particular focus is given on problems where solutions are given with
very little regularity. A good example is the problem of drops sliding on tilted
surface. In this case the shape of the drop can change drastically when the
velocity is increased, and a singularity (corner) develops at the rear of the
drop when the velocity exceed a certain critical value. At higher speeds the
tail of the drop may break into another component (pearling). Another example is
oil drops moving up towards water in a container when initially water, the
heavier fluid, is poured on top of oil. The project aims towards a better
understanding of the properties of these problems and provide a framework for
developing accurate computer-based numerical simulations. Graduate students will
be trained by participating in the research.

The problems to be discussed arise in a variety of physical phenomena, including
the motion of capillary drops, crowd motion, tumor growth, and filtration of
fluids in porous media. The presence of lower-dimensional structure is
ubiquitous in the physical literature, either as a boundary of a domain or a
singular part of an evolution. Many nonlinear PDE problems which are otherwise
well-understood face significant challenges when they are coupled with a moving
interface, even in seemingly simple settings. Besides the nonlinearity of the
problem, the difficulty lies in the non-locality of the problem, in the sense
that the behavior of solutions depends on the global geometry of the free
boundary. Dynamic problems face an additional difficulty coming from the lack of
a priori regularity of the free boundaries. By studying proposed problems we aim
to develop general methods to deal with such difficulties. In addition to energy
and integral estimates, it will be often necessary to introduce geometric
methods to understand pointwise behavior of the moving interface.
