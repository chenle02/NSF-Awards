9417022 Rankin The American Mathematical Society requests a grant in the amount
of $110,688 for the twenty--fifth AMS-SIAM Summer Seminar in Applied
Mathematics, to be held in the summer of 1995. Previous seminars were held
annually or at two or three year intervals since 1957 for a total of 24
seminars. The 1995 topic, "Mathematics of Numerical Analysis", was selected by
the 1993 AMS-SIAM Committee on Applied Mathematics. Members of the Organizing
Committee for the 1995 Sumer Seminar are: Stephen Smale (chair), Gene Allgower,
Lenore Blum, Alexandre Chorin, Phillippe Ciaret, Felipe Cucker, James Demmel,
Ron DeVore, Gene Golub, Arieh Iserles, Bert Jongen, Herb Keller, J.L. Lions, Jim
Renegar, Michael Shub, Gilbert Strang, Shmuel Winograd and Henryk Wozniakowski.
The 1995 Summer Seminar will be held during a four-week period in July/August,
