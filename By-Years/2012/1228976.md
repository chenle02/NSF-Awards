Workshop: Communication theory and Signal Processing in the Cloud
Era&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Affordable virtualized computing resources have enabled
storage and processing of information at a scale never previously imagined
possible. Cloud computing is enabling what has been called the industrial
revolution of data. Algorithms to store, process, compress and protect this
information at a cloud scale are much needed. Much of this infrastructure is
currently developed without a good understanding of fundamental principles from
information theory and signal processing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop
`Communication theory and Signal Processing in the Cloud Era' will take place on
June 25 and 26 at University of California, Berkeley. The meeting focuses on
bringing together internationally known experts in academia and industry to
identify new challenges in cloud computing, coding techniques and content
distribution at large scale.
