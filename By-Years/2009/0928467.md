ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;28 July 2009&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0928467&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Sea Education Association&lt;br/&gt;PI: P.
Joyce&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requests one Shipboard Scientific
Support Equipment (SSSE) item for the Sea Education Association for use aboard
the SSV ROBERT C SEAMANS; namely a new GPS based gyro compass. This item will
enhance navigational safety and provide greatly improved support capabilities to
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The SSV ROBERT C
STEVENS supports 12-week academic learning programs (?Sea Semester?) for the Sea
Education Association based in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. During this program,
the vessel routinely exposes students to oceanography, seamanship, navigation,
and other maritime traditions. Pubic outreach is achieved through web sites,
satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and open house
events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
