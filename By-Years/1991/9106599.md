An experimental research program will be undertaken to realize in the laboratory
the process of photon duplication, a novel process in which the photon
statistics of an input beam of light is duplicated into two output beams, one of
which can be measured while leaving the other for further manipulation. This
process is of interest from a number of standpoints that are both fundamental
and applied. Fundamentally, photon duplication is a phenomenon that has never
been observed; it requires quantum- optic experimentation in a regime that has
never been explored. It also leads to novel quantum nondemolition detection
strategies that are efficient and do not require largepump power or explicit
phase-sensitive measurements. From an applied standpoint, a photon duplicator
can be used in a communication network as a transparent optical tap.
Specifically, we propose to analyze the detailed physics of photon duplication
and to perform an experiment that will demonstrate the process. A four-wave
mixing experiment will be carried out in a regime where photon duplication is
predicted to occur. A platelet of CdTe, pumped by a mode- locked and Q-switched
Nd:YAG laser, will be used as the nonlinear medium. CdTe is chosen because it
has been shown to have a large third-order nonlinearity with a sub-nanosecond
response time. Photon correlations will be measured using a novel pulsed shot-
noise detection scheme that we have developed. In addition, we will investigate
avenues toward implementation of the process of photon duplication in nonlinear
optical waveguides.
