This award will support a U.S.-France planning workshop to be held in Paris,
France in May, 1996. It will be coordinated by Douglas Siegel-Causey of the
University of Nebraska and Christine Lefevre, Curator and Archaeologist of the
Comparative Anatomy Laboratory at the French National Museum of Natural History.
The objective of the workshop is to develop a joint research project on human
and environmental interaction, over a long interval of time, in the Aleutian
Islands. They also propose to synthesize preliminary results of previous field
studies on Aleutian archaeology and study collections on the Aleutian Islands in
the 19th century at the French National Museum of Natural History .
