CBET - 1512686, Subramaniam, Anand B. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes
to develop a recently reported technique for sensing of biological entities
using a method known as magnetic levitation. One of the main advantages of the
proposed method is application in environments where electricity and analytical
instruments are not available. The sensor output is visual and thus impactful
for low resource settings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes to develop
a recently reported technique for sensing of biological entities using a method
known as magnetic levitation. One of the main advantages of the proposed method
is application in environments where electricity and analytical instruments are
not available. The sensor output is visual and thus impactful for low resource
settings. The approach for biosensing uses changes in the density as a sensing
mechanism. The proposed studies are focused on understanding the effect of bead
shape and size, and size of the nanoparticle catalysts on the performance of the
density-based biosensor. Mathematical modeling of experiments will be conducted
and compared with experimental data, and that effort will allow the formulation
of analytical models on the process of electroless growth of nanoparticles on
surfaces under various conditions. Broader Impact: The proposed research will
contribute to the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students
in a diverse, multidisciplinary environment. The PI will partner with local high
school teachers in the relatively underserved Central Valley region of
California to disseminate the scientific findings on low-cost diagnostics and
nanoscience. The PI plans dissemination of results on the PI's website as well
as through journal publications and presentations.
