The Polar Research Board (earlier called the Committee on Polar Research) was
established in 1958 by the National Academy of Sciences, in response to the need
for scientific advice on the increases in U.S. and international activities
relating to the polar regions. The Board is a multidisciplinary body with
representation from four broad areas: the social, biological and physical
sciences as well as engineering. Members are drawn from academic institutions,
national laboratories and industry. The activities of the Polar Research Board
are funded by a wide range of government agencies, including the Department of
Energy, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration, the Office of Naval Research, the United States
Coast Guard, the U.S. Geological Survey, as well as the National Science
Foundation (NSF). This grant provides the NSF portion of support to the Board.
Activities of the Board during the grant period include development of a
national polar research plan, providing federal agencies with advice on the role
of arctic and antarctic research in studies of global change, examination of
current issues in glaciology, representing the United States on the Scientific
Committee on Antarctic Research, ensuring active U.S. scientific participation
in the International Arctic Science Committee activities, as well as completing
a series of studies relating to more detailed problems of polar research.
