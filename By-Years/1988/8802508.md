This proposal is for a joint research project between two NSF
Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers: the Edison Welding Institute
at Ohio State University and the Measurement and Control Engineering Center at
the University of Tennessee. The joint project which is to be cost shared by
both Centers is to conduct research on the development of a visual sensory
system to determine quality control factors of a weld. The study will explore
ways to improve the visual imaging system now used to control the weld bead size
and tracking to one that incorporates the identification and extraction of
visual (sensor) descriptive measurements, which have a strong correlation with
the weld pools desired quality control properties in real time. At present, no
such system exists and the industrial benefits of such a system has significant
economic benefits to U.S. industries. A woman undergraduate will augment the
research by studying and analyzing the capability of the image processing to
assess the weld quality. The Program Manager recommends that Ohio State
University be awarded $22,789 for one (1) year for their part of a joint project
with the University of Tennessee's Industry/University Cooperative Research
Center for Measurement and Control Engineering. This includes $5,000 from the
"Funding for Support of Women, Minority, and Disabled Engineering Research
Assistants" program.
