Research is proposed in the determination of the covalent structure of
biochemically interesting complex carbohydrates by physical methods including
NMR spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.
Several specific experiments are proposed in the structure of oligosaccharides
from mucin glycoproteins and also in complex bacterial polysaccharides. The
prospect of using NMR spectroscopy of intact glycoproteins for exploring and
screening carbohydrate structure in mucins will be evaluated. 1H NMR and
heteronuclear 1H detected 13C NMR spectroscopy will be used. The complete
covalent structure of the capsular polysaccharide of a pathogenic strain of
Vibrio vulnificus will be determined. The complete 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the
Re-LPS (lipid A) from E. coli will be assigned and the anomeric configuration of
the ketodeoxy octanoic acid (KDO) residues will be determined. Prospects for use
of heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy for structure determination of
lipopolysaccharides and exploration of the conformation will be evaluated. The
circular dichroism method for determination of the absolute configuration of the
sugar residues of complex carbohydrates will be extended to new types of
monosaccharide residues and chromophoric polysaccharides. The use of
13C-enriched bacterial polysaccharides for heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy,
especially 3-dimensional NMR methods will be explored.
