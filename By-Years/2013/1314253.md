Objective: This proposal brings together an international US-Ireland team of
scientists at University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), the Cork Institute of
Technology (CIT), and Queen's University Belfast (QUB) to explore a bottom-up
approach to electrically-driven photonic crystal lasers (PCLs) using III-V nano-
pillars (NP) grown on Si. This proposal presents a unique set of capabilities to
remove deficiencies in NP characterization, making it possible to develop NP
lasers to their potential. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The NP-PCLs have been
engineered to surpass the necessary 10 fJ/bit requirement for inter-chip
communication by implementing a high-Q, small current aperture cavity with
greater than 90% waveguide coupling efficiency. With this international
collaboration a rapid development process is possible, where NP growth and
device fabrication is performed at UCLA, pump-probe spectroscopy and emission
dynamics is performed at TNI, and atom probe tomography and scanning Raman
spectroscopy at QUB. The combined effort of the groups will allow researchers to
quickly characterize material quality and gain, and evaluate device
designs.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The cooperative interaction between the US
and Ireland allows for a comprehensive project going much further than would be
possible for any individual partner. The participating groups will exchange best
practices in areas involving interdisciplinary research, student involvement in
research, and community participation. These themes are supported by several
efforts to incorporate the findings into nano-materials curricula, train
graduate, undergraduate and high school students, and form a concerted effort
aimed at increasing minority student participation both in the US and Ireland.
