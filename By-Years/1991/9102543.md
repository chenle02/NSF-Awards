Previous and on-going NSF-funded research by the PI shows that pore-water
exchange carbonate particles, organic matter and sea water is far more extensive
than previously thought. As a result, platform carbonates may act as a sink for
more organic carbon than previously envisioned because of the storage of
isotopically- depleted C in recrystallized carbonates. The PI requests funds to
continue her work in looking at sediment/organism relations in determining
chemical and microstructrual sedimentary parameters. Some work will continue in
Florida Bay, but new studies will begin on Great and Little Bahama banks.
