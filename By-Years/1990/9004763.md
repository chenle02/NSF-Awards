The overall goal of this research is to identify factors involved in blue-light
induced transcription of proteins in higher plants. There are two basic classes
of transcription factors, core factors and regulatory factors. Core factors
allow for low level, constitutive expression. Their presence or activity is not
regulated and they function for many genes. Regulatory factors are not always
active and affect the rate of Pisum sativum (pea) and Arabidopsis thaliani to
identify the regulatory factors that effect blue-light transcription of a
pigment-binding protein found in plants. Blue light represents a regulatory
signal for many events in growth and development. Examples of these events are
found in all the kingdoms and range from bacterial motion to alleviation of
winter depression in humans. The basic biochemical mechanism by which blue light
is perceived and transduced into a signal useful for the cell is probably very
ancient. Indeed, as light represents one of the oldest environmental cues, it
may be that blue-light regulation is the oldest signal. Understanding this
ancient mechanism will provide insight into how cells interpret many
extracellular signals.
