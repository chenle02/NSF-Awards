Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Howard University and the University of Texas-El
Paso (UTEP) are being funded to jointly develop an Alliances for Graduate
Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) project to address the issues of
producing underrepresented minority Ph.D. recipients who are prepared to become
future members of the professoriate. The objectives of the Howard-UTEP Alliance
are to: 1) increase the numbers of underrepresented students entering doctoral
education at Howard and UTEP through "Introduction to STEM Graduate Study"
workshops; 2) decrease time-to-degree and prepare entering STEM doctoral
students through a Summer Pre-Doctoral Research program; 3) prepare
underrepresented doctoral students for future faculty careers through the PFF
program; 4) increase the likelihood that underrepresented doctoral students will
complete their degrees through systematic and structured retention and mentoring
services; 5)increase opportunities for underrepresented students to obtain
research university faculty positions and their familiarity with post-doctoral
fellowships through annual "Introduction to the Post-Doctorate" workshops;6)
enhance a sense of institution-wide STEM community engagement among doctoral
students through interdisciplinary activities, distance learning, and a STEM
honor society; 7) improve the oral and written communications skills of STEM
doctoral students through "Communications Skills for Scientists" workshops; and
8) encourage participation among STEM departments and faculty through the AGEP
Faculty Advisory Council. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: These
activities address NSF's Intellectual Merit criteria by addressing the
preparation of doctoral students and the educational process in an innovative
and creative manner, and through the expertise of the faculty and administrators
who will be engaged in the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The
program addresses NSF's Broader Impact criteria in any number of ways, most
generally in its attention to underrepresentation in doctoral education and the
professoriate, and its intended impact on that issue.&lt;br/&gt;
