The California Coast Noyce Mathematics Partnership project in the Robert Noyce
Teacher Scholarship Program will advance the national need of preparing and
retaining qualified mathematics teachers in high-need schools. Through a
partnership between California State University Channel Islands (CI) and
California State University Monterey Bay (MB), both Hispanic Serving
Institutions, this Track 1 Noyce project will support 33 recipients in becoming
qualified, certified mathematics teachers prepared to teach in diverse
classrooms. The project will provide scholarships at the two campuses to
undergraduate mathematics majors, as well as to STEM professionals, seeking a
mathematics teaching credential, resulting in the production of 20 scholars at
CI and 13 scholars at MB. Project components will entail subject matter
preparation, pedagogical preparation, field experiences in diverse school
settings coupled with cultural competency preparations, and a range of support
mechanisms during both the scholarship funding years and induction years of
teaching. Support structures will include (i) development of a strong
professional network, including mentoring and induction efforts, (ii)
coordination of an annual mini-conference for scholars at both campuses, and
(iii) frequent collaboration through social media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
California Coast Noyce Mathematics Partnership project will provide scholars
with relevant cultural and educational experiences, improve scholars'
pedagogical content knowledge, and enhance scholars' instructional strategies.
Scholars will study curriculum and develop interactive learning activities
incorporating modern technologies. The project will include academic language
development and extensive networking, debriefing and mentoring, by using a
tailored on-line collaboration site that tracks data on interactions,
vocabulary, exchanges, etc. Data on recipients' progress and achievement will be
collected and analyzed for assessment and improvement purposes.
