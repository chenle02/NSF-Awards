To meet the growing demand of the communications industry, this institution has
developed an emphasis on digital and fiber optic communication in the
undergraduate curriculum of the electronics technology program. This project
provides six substations for experiments in data and fiber optic communication,
and telephone networking techniques. The major equipment acquired under this
project include six sets of fiber optic measurement systems, six digital
communication experiment boards, two computer-controlled telephone exchanges,
and two Zenith, Z-248 personal computers. The availability of this equipment
allows the electronics technology students to reinforce theoretical concepts
with hands-on laboratory experience in digital and fiber optic communication,
and telephone networking technology. This award is being matched by an equal sum
from the grantee.
