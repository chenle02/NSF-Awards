During the past five years, UT Arlington's Department of Electrical Engineering
has conducted an experimental program involving undergraduate scholars in
research projects. This program builds on the past experience. Specifically,
this current program is strengthened by increasing the funding, raising the
number of students to eight, providing research opportunities during summers,
and emphasizing recruitment of underrepresented US citizens and permanent
residents in electrical engineering. The philosophy of the program is the
integration of undergraduate scholars into existing research projects and the
significant interaction between faculty and students. The scholars are
encouraged to be creative and productive and are expected to gain considerable
independence during two consecutive academic semesters. A full-time summer
research opportunity is then available with significant research contributions
possible.
