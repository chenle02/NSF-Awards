Professor Zimmer will study a variety of questions within the general program
of understanding the actions of semisimple Lie groups and their discrete
subgroups on manifolds. This includes an investigation of the topological,
geometric, and analytic properties of manifolds admitting such an action, and
the measure theoretic, topological, and geometric structure of the actions
themselves. The techniques of ergodic theory and algebraic groups, combined with
the geometric structure inherent in the situation, will be essential throughout
the work. This award will also support three junior investigators who will
conduct research in the same general area. Groups usually arise as
transformations which preserve the symmetry of some system much as the group of
rotations preserves the symmetry of a sphere. Given an abstract group there are
often many ways it can be realized or represented as a group of transformations.
There has been much research done on the representation of groups as linear
transformations on a vector space. It is in the still unchartered realm of
nonlinear actions of groups on curved surfaces or manifolds where Professor
Zimmer's research will take place.
