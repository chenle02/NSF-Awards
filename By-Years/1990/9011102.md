This project is part of the NSF/USGS initiative within the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) to investigate the effects of the Loma Prieta
earthquake of 17 October 1989. It concerns the observed performance of six
sanitary landfills located within the Loma Prieta earthquake damage zone.
Immediately following the Loma Prieta earthquake, these landfills were inspected
for damage and evidence of slope movement, and the observations recorded. The
objectives of this research program are: (1) to estimate the mean peak ground
acceleration that these landfills were subjected to during the earthquake; (2)
use these estimated ground accelerations in a deformation analysis; (3) compare
the predicted deformations with the observed conditions; and (4) based upon this
comparison, to assess the validity of the input parameters and the analytical
techniques used.
