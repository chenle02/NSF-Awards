The objective of this project is to support faculty members and departments in
efforts to assess student learning in at least one of the
following:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Coherent blocks of courses of undergraduate
mathematical sciences, including entire degree programs; and (2) Individual
courses, especially reform courses, using various assessment tools across
varieties of institutions. The targeted blocks of courses are: (a) the major in
mathematics, (b) courses for future teachers; (c) school mathematics as a
preparation for college mathematics, usually called college placement programs;
and (d) general education courses, including those aimed at quantitative
literacy. This latter block includes study of assessments of the mathematical
and quantitative literacy achieved in entire degree programs, recognizing that
much mathematics is learned outside mathematics courses. Assessment cycles that
use assessment for program improvements are of special interest, including those
that use research on learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support from this work
includes: (1) Nationwide distribution and discussion of a 1999 volume of case
studies on assessment practices in undergraduate mathematics; (2) Compilation
and nationwide distribution of a second volume of case studies and syntheses of
coherent sets of case studies; (3) Construction and maintenance of a website to
contain an annotated bibliography, literature synopses, interviews, and
assessment designs; and (4) Development and operation of a series of workshops
for faculty working&lt;br/&gt;on campus-based assessment programs, including
both face-to-face and electronic venues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assessment cycles
for program improvement have not been integrated into core operations of
departments. This project greatly facilitates assessment program development
through wide dissemination of knowledge gained through experiences with
assessment. &lt;br/&gt;
