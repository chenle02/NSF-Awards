This award from the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the NSF Division
of Chemistry supports Prof. Sarah Brooks at Texas A&amp;M University. Prof.
Brooks and her students study the role of secondary organic aerosols SAO) in the
nucleation of atmospheric ice particles. Recent measurements indicate that
several current assumptions about the organic aerosol phase and the cloud-
forming properties may be incorrect. First, the majority of SOA in the
troposphere exist in a viscous, rather free-flowing liquid state. Second, the
presence of viscous organic aerosols represents a previously unrecognized supply
of particles capable of causing the freezing of ice crystals in clouds. The data
collected are used to assess the role of viscous phases and retarded water
diffusion in atmospheric ice nucleation processes. The project also includes the
training of graduate students, undergraduate students, and high school students.
During summers at Texas A&amp;M, high school students attend the campus-wide
TAMU Youth Adventure Program to participate in lecture and laboratory activities
including, "The role of viscosity in the foods we love." &lt;br/&gt; The team
collects quantitative data on the phase, water diffusion, and ice nucleating
ability of representative organic compounds and mixtures. The phases of sample
aerosols are characterized by their temperature-dependent viscosities and the
temperature at which they transition from liquid to glass using specialized
spectroscopic techniques. In addition, the freezing temperatures of all samples
are determined using our custom ice microscope technique. Taken together the
data are used to evaluate whether a minimum glass transition temperature
requirement exists for viscous aerosol to facilitate the freezing of
droplets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
