9521184 Duffy One of most pervasive and irreversible effects of environmental
change wrought by human activity is the reduction in species diversity on local
and global scales. The consequences of declining for ecosystem function remain
largely unquantified and unpredictable. The loss of species in low diversity but
high recruitment environments, like estuaries, may severely alter production
levels and trophic transfers. This research will involve a series of mesocosm
experiments to test the effects of invertebrate grazer species on: 1) the
structure of eelgrass communities, particularly the algal epiphytes, 2)
functional processes within the eelgrass ecosystem, especially primary and
secondary production, vascular detritus processing, and organic matter export to
underlying sediment, and 3) the responses of the plants to nutrient enrichment.
The results of this work are likely to provide the first experimental evidence
about the roles of mesograzers in shallow water vegetation communities,
including their individual and collective effects on community structure and
function. ***
