Willson This research is examining several important theoretical issues in
nonlinear transistor networks including stability criteria for and global
properties of dc operating points, transient circuit simulation, and stability
issues related to analog resistive networks for implementing two-dimensional
signal processing algorithms. Additional research is being pursued in the design
of FIR filter banks, neural networks, and other topics. While these areas of
research are somewhat diverse, they share the unifying characteristic that all
projects have as their primary goal the development of a better and more
rigorous understanding of the fundamental nature of the circuits and their
properties, and the development of new and useful techniques for their analysis
and design.
