To maintain a robust innovation system, it is important to make full use of
qualified personnel, and to create products that are matched to potential users.
In the US, women are under-represented in the science and technology labor
force, and innovation systems do not always address the ways that gender and
technology intersect. As a result, there are bottlenecks in the innovation
system. This award addresses those two problems by building on a European Union
policy directive that requires attention to gender in innovation. The award
funds the development of cases in which attention to gender led to important
technological innovations. These cases are refined and tested by an
interdisciplinary group of researchers from natural and physical science,
engineering, social science, and humanities. This research contributes to
theories of how gender shapes scientific knowledge. While previous policy
interventions sought to increase women?s human capital, or to redress
institutional problems, this research will examine how attention to gendered
knowledge can make science and technology work attractive to women, and also
contribute to innovation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Case materials are visually and
technically documented, and made available to policymakers, practicing
scientists and engineers, and teachers through an interactive website,
publications, and policy documents. The creation and testing of the materials
will geographically and demographically diverse researchers, undergraduate
researchers, and students.
