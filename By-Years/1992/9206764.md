This research will examine heterogeneous telecommunication networks, and
develop novel solutions techniques for designing these networks to survive under
link or node failure. The interconnections of Local Area Networks (LANs), the
connection of LANs to Wide Area Networks (WANs), the interconnection of WANs,
are all examples of heterogeneous data networks. Each of these networking
problems have unique characteristics based on the communications protocols and
the routing behavior of the interconnect devices. The research will consider the
design problem for heterogeneous networks in the framework of formulating a cost
minimizing mathematical programming (or optimization) approach. Survivable data
networks are a special class of minimum-weight k-connected capacitated spanning
networks. Designing minimum-weight k-connected spanning networks is NP-hard. The
problems that this research addresses involve the consideration of additional
constraints, and are also NP-hard. The solution techniques are based on a hybrid
of simulated annealing and graph theory. In addition to successfully
implementing these methods for some heterogeneous network design problems, the
PIs propose to work on the design of international heterogeneous
telecommunications networks.
