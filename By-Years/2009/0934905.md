This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The K-State Robert Noyce Scholarship
Program is increasing the supply of highly qualified middle and high school
teachers (Grades 6-12) in biology, chemistry, earth and space science, and
physics. The program is providing opportunities for 20 freshmen and sophomores
to work in informal STEM education settings both on and off campus; is
increasing by 17 the number of undergraduates in the targeted STEM disciplines
receiving licensure; and enabling 12 graduates in the targeted STEM disciplines
to gain licensure through a newly established Graduate Certificate in Teaching
and Learning. High need schools are identified and recruited through three
existing partnerships: the Professional Development School Partnership, the
Center for Intercultural and Multilingual Advocacy, and the Center for Rural
Education and Small Schools. Within the definition of high need local
educational agency, the K-State program further targets schools serving a high
percentage of individuals from families with incomes below the poverty line, a
high percentage of English language learners, and rural populations. The
evaluation plan includes the development of a database for maintaining
demographic data; the Scholars' academic progress and perceptions of the
usefulness of the program elements; the effectiveness of program elements,
especially new teacher support; and subsequent teaching challenges in high need
schools.
