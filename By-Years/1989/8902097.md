This research is concerned with a numerical and analytical study of resonant
interactions of linear and nonlinear waves. The immediate goal is to describe
resonant wave interaction for model equations and the role it plays in the
formation of shock waves with the help of numerical, asymptotic and dynamical
systems of conservation laws with specific symmetries, in particular, to the
numerical simulations of magnetic field line reconnection in two and three
dimensions.
