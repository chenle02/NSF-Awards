The study of the origin and evolution of humans necessarily includes as subject
matter our nearest relatives, the non human primates. Understanding how living
primates use their bodies (muscles and bones) to move about in different ways
provides the proper context for the reconstruction of ancient lifestyles of our
ancestors. We need to understand the relationship between body form and
function, and know different structures work, or what it is for, if we are to be
able to interpret fossil finds correctly. This project concerns the application
of certain experimental methods to such analyses of anatomical form and function
in living non human primates, using bone strain analysis, telemetered
electromyography, and the analysis of kinematics and kinetics through triplanr
videotaping and the use of an electronic pressure measurement system. These are
all extremely sophisticated ways of monitoring muscle activity and bone stress
and strain of animals perform different sets of movements - walking, arm
swinging, knuckle walking, and so on. The information obtained will be used to
help interpret the adaptive significance of features distinguishing living
monkeys, apes and humans, and to apply that understanding to the interpretation
of the fossil evidence for human and primate evolution.
