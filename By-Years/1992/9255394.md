This project will explore mechanisms for producing rapid advances in innovative
practices for developing more effective utilization of laboratory experiences in
pre-college chemistry. The findings from this exploratory research will produce
some immediate positive changes in practice as well as lay the groundwork for
significant further study. The results of this research will lead directly to
changes in approach to the use of laboratory time and to improving attitudes on
the part of school administrators concerning the value to students learning of
laboratory type of experiences. The study takes into account current
understandings related to designing laboratory experiences both by professionals
in the United States and in other countries.
