This research project will investigate nonstructural and building contents
damage that occurred during the 19 September 1985 Mexican earthquake. The
research project will develop a systematic and comprehensive database on
nonstructural and contents damage to buildings, organize the database into a
readily accessible format for use by other researchers, perform analyses on case
study buildings and nonstructural components, and disseminate the results to
professionals. It is expected that the results will directly benefit not only
architects and structural engineers, but also mechanical and electrical
engineers, construction building code officials, and building owners, managers,
and occupants.
