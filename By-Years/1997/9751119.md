Any undergraduate program in chemistry that prepares students for graduate work,
teaching, or industrial employment needs to provide significant and substantial
exposure to the theory and practice of modern nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy. This technique is unrivaled as an instrumental method for the
determination of molecular structure and is finding increasing applications in
other areas of chemistry including analytical and physical chemistry. It is also
an essential component of any instruction in the area of biochemistry. In the
chemistry program, exposure of students to modern NMR has been severely limited
by the previously available instrumentation. Only old, unreliable, continuous
wave, 60-MHz instruments have been available for most of the curriculum. This
project provides a high-field, superconducting NMR that allows routine use of H,
13C, 19F, 31P, and correlation spectroscopy throughout the curriculum. Initial
and comprehensive exposure starts in the sophomore organic laboratory sequence
and is followed by uses in analytical, physical, and inorganic laboratory
sequences. A new biochemistry curriculum can also be greatly enhanced by
acquisition of this instrument. The extensive undergraduate research program
also benefits greatly from this acquisition. *
