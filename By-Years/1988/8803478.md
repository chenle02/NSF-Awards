In recent years several important advances have been made in the theory of
singularities of complex analytic spaces and mappings: introduction of local
polar varieties (by Le Dung Trang and Teissier), existence of a canonical
Whitney stratification (by Teissier), topological characterization of Whitney
stratifications (by Le Dung Trang and Teissier), Morse theory on singular spaces
(by Goresky and MacPherson), structure of the tangent spaces at singular points
(by Le Dung Trang and Teissier), Hodge theory on singular spaces (by Steenbrink,
Zucker, Varchenko, Saito), its relation with the study of linear differential
systems via the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence (by Mebkhout, Kashiwara, Kawai),
triangulation of stable maps (Verona). These advances give new tools to
investigate systematically basic problems in the theory of singularities.
Gaffney and Le will investigate the following problems: (1) The problem of
equisingularity of families of mappings, e.g. the problem of finding algebraic
invariants to determine if a family of mappings is topologically trivial. The
concept was introduced by Zariski for spaces and it was shown by Le and
Ramanujam that the constancy of the Milnor number gives the topological
equisingularity of a family of complex hypersurfaces. (2) The relative Lefschetz
Theorem on hyperplane sections for maps from singular spaces into Pn. (3) The
canonical decomposition of the local monodromy of complex hypersurfaces and its
link with the resolution of singularities and the geometry of Polars. (4) The
conormal structure and higher order conormal structure of singular spaces: this
should lead to results on the geometry of linear differential systems.
Furthermore, the techniques involved are quite effective, and the investigators
hope to be able to use existing software to implement algorithms to determine
the shape and the topology of complex analytic singularities.
