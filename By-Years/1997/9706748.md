9706748 Pazzaglia The Cascade range in Washington state is unusual because it is
an actively rising range in a forearc region. Existing seismic studies have
emphasized very young movements, and have shown that the local convergence is
N-S. However, the longer deformation signal is not well known. This proposal
will use river profiles, fluvial deposits and geomorphology to measure uplift
rates in the Olympic Mountains on the scale of tens of thousands of years. This
study will yield exportable results by establishing how quantitatively
geomorphologic processes can be correlated with long term deformation in a
tectonically active region.
