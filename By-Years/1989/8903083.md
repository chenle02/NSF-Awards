This is a continuing program of research and cooperative training by four
professors specializing in applied mathematics. Their work concentrates on the
application and development of functional analysis, asymptotics and scientific
computing; it emphasizes the integral connection between these three approaches
to scientific discovery. Professor Slemrod plans to investigations on phase
transitions and coagulation. Professor M.C. Shen proposes studies of magnetic
fluid dynamics, liquid transport in physiology and nonlinear gravity waves.
Professor R.E. Meyer intends to improve the approximation of observables in wave
processes. Professor J.M. Vanden-Broeck plans analytical and numerical studies
on nonlinear surface and internal waves of ship hydrodynamics and geophysics.
