Fractals are defined by the repetition or near-repetition of a pattern on
infinitely many scales. They appear extensively in nature and are prevalent in
human-generated data such as financial time series, sound files, and internet
traffic patterns. By their very nature fractals are rough, non-differentiable
objects that cannot be studied by the classical mathematical methods of
calculus. The more modern tools of multifractal analysis, which quantify the
degree of roughness that appears on various scales, can be used instead. It is
particularly interesting to apply multifractal analysis to randomly generated
objects, which by default tend to exhibit fractal behavior. Random measures,
which for example describe the rainfall distribution over a particular state or
the distribution of energy in turbulent fluid flows, are a particularly fruitful
area for employing multifractal analysis. The results of such an analysis can
often be used for prediction and forecasting of the underlying random system.
This research project aims to further develop the mathematical foundations for
analysis of multifractal properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this
project is to analyze the multifractal properties of a broad class of random
measures that appear in models of statistical mechanics. The focus will be on
random pinning models, random polymer models, random measures arising in two-
dimensional conformally invariant systems, and spectral measures of random
matrices. In all cases, the major quantity of interest will be the multifractal
spectrum, which quantifies the amount of mass the random measure assigns around
various points in the space. Computation of the multifractal spectrum is closely
related to the theory of large deviations for computing the decay of
probabilities of rare events. Many of the tools from that theory will be
employed in this project, including the notion of Gibbs condition for describing
the most likely behavior of the random system when a rare event occurs. As all
the random measures listed above can be described using tools from stochastic
analysis, specifically the Wiener chaos decomposition, a particular goal of this
project will be to incorporate tools from stochastic analysis into this
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
