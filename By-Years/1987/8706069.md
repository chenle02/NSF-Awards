The basic assumption in past research on hashing for external files was that
the database is disk-resident and the records are processed in a single
processor environment. This work focuses on parallel processing of hashed files
in main memory databases. We will focus on some fundamental design issues,
particularly the handling of overflow buckets, bounds on the main memory access
time, concurrent accesses to databases, and processor memory interconnection
architecture. A new hashing technique called multi-directory hashing is the
primary focus of the first phase of this research. Multi-directory hashing is a
generalization of extendible hashing with parallel processing capability.
Initial research shows that multi-directory hashing achieves the lower bound on
main memory access time and maintains close to 100% storage utilization. The
long range goals of this research are: (1) Develop algorithms for parallel main
memory databases that are alternative to B-trees, digital search trees, and
hashing; (2) Develop and analyze processor-memory architectures suitable for
these algorithms; (3) Develop an efficient parallel main memory database
management system.
