Teams of engineering students will use the new Integrated Design Laboratory to
design a complete robot, off-road vehicle, or similar project using modern
design tools. They will use solid modelling, parametric design, modern product
database systems, computerized project planning and coordination systems and
design optimization tools. Computer science students will develop software
projects, using modern CASE tools in a typical networked workgroup setting. They
will explore modern graphics applications with high-performance PC computer
systems, and experiment with numerical methods using modern symbolic computation
packages, and develop expert system applications with powerful AI tools.
Cartography students will explore the emerging field of Graphic Information
Systems using modern digital mapping and database techniques, including a
digital database for the southeastern Wisconsin area. The new laboratory
consists of a network of modern workstations and comprehensive integrated
systems of supporting software.
