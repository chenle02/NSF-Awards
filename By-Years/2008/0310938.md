Engineering - Engineering Technology (58)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first
objective of the project is to introduce a universal testing machine that allows
students to gain experiences and skills in performing analysis and tests on
various mechanical properties of plastic materials. To accomplish this goal,
students follow the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)
procedures. The second objective is to implement six new exercises in the
plastics technology curriculum, and two new lab exercises in the Computer-Aided
Design engineering analysis curriculum to develop problem-solving skills. The
equipment is used in four different courses with a combined student enrollment
of one hundred students. Using this equipment, the students develop individual
or team research projects, and present their findings at Central Michigan
University's annual Student Research and Creative Endeavors Exhibition (SRCEE).
All students presenting at SRCEE are eligible for consideration to present their
research at the "Posters Under the Dome" located at the State Capitol Building.
