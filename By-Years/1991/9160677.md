This project will investigate the possible use of a three- dimensional
quantitative imaging process, by measuring the microwave scattering field and
utilizing a scattering inversion algorithm. The research is expected to produce
a low-cost and transportable piece of equipment to be used to determine the
moisture content in concrete, roofing materials and to monitor material defects.
