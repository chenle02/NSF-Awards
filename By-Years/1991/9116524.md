This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement award is directed towards understanding
the immunological factors contributing to variation in reproductive performance
in non-human primate species. Among some human populations, immunological
similarity between mates appears to increase the likelihood of pregnancy loss.
If true, this would provide an evolutionary pressure selecting for increased
genetic diversity within populations. This study will investigate the
relationship between reproductive outcome and the major histocompatibility
complex in a captive colony of Macaca nemestrina at the Washington Primate
Research Center. The degree of immunological similarity between successful and
unsuccessful pairs will be compared. Findings from this study will help to
characterize the evolutionary forces which are currently effecting the
reproductive performance in all primates.
