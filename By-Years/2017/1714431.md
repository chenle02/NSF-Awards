Software reliability is increasingly vital in modern life. The power grid, the
cars we drive, our hospitals, and even our food production rely heavily on
software to function. The risk of errors can be mitigated by tools, called model
finders, that produce concrete examples to help software developers understand
their system. However, most such tools suffer from the principle that you get
precisely what you ask for, but sometimes not what you really want or need. This
project works to improve the effectiveness of model-finding tools, both by
increasing their explanatory power and improving presentation of examples. The
tools developed in the project will be applicable to a wide range of users and
domains, including formal-methods education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
explores a unique melding of model-search and proof-search that has henceforth
been unexplored. The contributions of this project include: (1) well defined
notions of "Must this be here?" and "Why is this here?" for model finding in
first-order logic with transitive closure, along with algorithms for answering
these questions; (2) novel approaches to navigating between models and selecting
which models to present, based on the concept of coverage from other formal
methods sub-fields; and (3) extensions to the widely-used Alloy Analyzer that
realize these ideas and make them available to the community.
