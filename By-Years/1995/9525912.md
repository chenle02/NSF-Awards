OCE-9525912 Weisberg Analyses focusing on the observation within the TOGA COARE
(Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment) Enhanced Monitoring Array will be
conducted in collabration with scientists from NOAA/PMEL who deploy the TAO
array. The analyses will examine the oceanic variability observed over the COARE
region, conduct heat, mass and momentum studies and examine the realtionship
between the COARE domain and the far field in the context of understanding the
influence of the western Pacific warm pool on seasonal to interannual climate
variability.
