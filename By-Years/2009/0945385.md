This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to design and
develop an automated, behavior-based, malware analytics software system. This
system addresses the growing problem of significant delay between a malware
outbreak and the response from the IT security community. The response time to
malware outbreaks is becoming increasingly longer - sometimes as long as 2
months or longer for a given malware instance. The main cause of this problem is
two-fold: a) overdependence on manual analysis of the malware in practice today
and b) a significant increase in the number of new malware, with the current
level as high as 5,000-10,000 unique instances a day. NovaShield, Inc. will
develop an automated software system to collect, store, summarize, and
categorize the vast amounts of data associated with the thousands of new malware
being encountered daily. This automated solution will provide data mining
capabilities and data filters for efficient data queries that will help find
answers to specific questions about malware and their behavior. The solution
will also include tools to capture, view, understand, and query the behaviors of
new malware so that the means for detecting them can be developed more rapidly.

The proposed research will have broad impact and, if successfully deployed,
significant commercial opportunity. By enabling early detection and remediation,
the research will lead to improving the response time to malware outbreaks
before they have time to do serious damage. The solution will ultimately provide
businesses, government agencies, and consumers with better protection against
emerging threats than exists today, thereby making their computing environment
safer and reducing the financial losses they incur due to malware.
