This project will deploy a pilot OpenFlow network (a form of Software-Defined
Network [SDN]) for the Computer Science and the Physics and Astronomy buildings
at the University of Washington. This capability will enable high-performance
layer-2 connections to the desktop for both GENI experimentation and for high
performance computing applications. The project will provide an opportunity to
develop an operational model for the innovations promised by OpenFlow and
advance the understanding of how to integrate OpenFlow into campus networking
infrastructures. Travel budget is included for sharing and presentations of
findings to the broad GENI community and non-technical user
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although OpenFlow is currently being widely
discussed and are key elements in the GENI architecture, there is little
operational or campus-level architectural experience with using it. In
particular, the integration of OpenFlow and other SDN technology into science
DMZs and other issues of campus security and policy are not fully understood in
operational contexts. The project outcomes include reporting of results and
lessons to other campus network operators and to SDN researchers and
industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;OpenFlow and other
software defined networking approaches have the potential to transform
highcapacity data transfer and networking in our emerging world of data-driven
discovery. The UW's OpenFlow proposed deployment, along with the commitment of a
full-time engineer devoted to managing the facility in an operational network
setting, will advance our understanding of these methodologies and serve to
inform our broader campus-wide network planning and deployment efforts
prospectively. The University of Washington will share data from these pilot
deployments with both the University of Washington research community and more
broadly with the Research and Education Network Community, including at one NSF
sponsored conference for such purposes.
