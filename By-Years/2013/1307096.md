An experiment will be pursued to search for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of
the electron using cold cesium and rubidium atoms. The apparatus will be
appropriately modified based on what has been learned over the last three years,
and then EDM data collection will commence. The experiment uses atoms launched
and loaded into a pair of parallel one-dimensional far-off-resonant optical
lattice traps in a magnetically shielded region of space, laser-cooled and
optically pumped. EDMs will be measured by observing coherent atom evolution in
electric fields that are directed oppositely in the two traps. It is projected
that the experiment will be sensitive to an EDM as small as 3x10-30 e-cm, which
is a 300-fold improvement over the current limit.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A
particle with a permanent EDM implies that both time-reversal invariance and
parity invariance are violated. Both of these symmetries are in fact violated in
the standard model of physics, which predicts very small, but non-zero EDMs for
fundamental particles. Proposed extensions to the standard model tend to predict
much larger EDMs, close to the current experimental upper limit. Continued non-
observation of EDMs would rule out many possible extensions to the standard
model. Conversely, should an EDM be observed, it would be the first experimental
result of any kind that cannot be incorporated into the standard model of
physics. If an EDM is found in an atom or molecule, the extraction of the
fundamental physics will be far more reliable in the alkali atoms used in this
experiment than in other more complicated atoms or molecules. This experiment
addresses a question of fundamental importance to elementary particle physics.
Such questions are normally addressed with high energy experiments, but in this
case the precision tools of atomic physics can be applied to a much lower energy
system, with a concomitant lower cost. Undergraduates and graduate students will
be trained in the experimental research methods and develop skills preparing
them for the nation's scientific work force.
