Household Impacts of the Nisqually Earthquake&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The February
28, 2001 Nisqually earthquake was moderate in magnitude (Mw = 6.8) and thus
provides a unique opportunity to measure the economic impacts of an event of
this type. This project will amass systematic evidence regarding the economic
impacts on households through a telephone survey of randomly selected households
according to zones defined by ground motion levels. This is in sharp contrast to
typical spatial criteria: political units, zip codes, or census tracts. Three or
four categories of ground motion will be defined. Survey data will be correlated
with major categories of impact; damage at the home; financing for repairs;
changes in economic behavior made as a result of this event; changes in
mitigation and preparedness (e.g., insurance); and baseline economic and
demographic information about the households themselves. The results of this
study will include a large, unique database on household
losses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The database will serve to test the hypothesis that
actual losses exceeded official estimates. The explanation for the difference is
that many categories of loss are never reported. Insights into the nature and
extent of unreported losses may help public agencies respond to future disasters
as well as better evaluate the benefits of pre-disaster mitigation investments.
The database will also allos reliable estimation of the total amount of loss
incurred by households in the region. This can provide a baseline against which
other loss estimations can be compared, e.g., FEMA's HAZUS . &lt;br/&gt;
