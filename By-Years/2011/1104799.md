This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports Prof. Carl Batt from
Cornell University in his development of educational materials to teach members
of the public about nanoscience. The award activities will include the
development of an interactive space ("Nanooze: A Chemistry Extravaganza") to
engage members of the public with nanoscience -- to be housed at Disneyland --
as well as the development and dissemination of print and web-based materials,
including the "Nanooze" magazine. The work includes assessment of the various
activities. The site at Disneyland will reach a large number of citizens, and
the demographics of those impacted are likely to be quite different from those
who might be exposed to similar exhibits at science museums.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoscience is the study of matter in the scale between
the atomic/molecular and the macroscopic. Matter in this size regime show
interesting and unique properties -- properties that enable new kinds of
materials and devices. Work like that of Prof. Batt is aimed at introducing a
broad cross-section of American society to this burgeoning area of research. In
addition, connecting young people with current areas of science enables the
Foundation to more effectively encourage young people to pursue careers in the
science and technology sectors.
