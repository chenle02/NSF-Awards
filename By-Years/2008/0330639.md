The proposed research is to investigate middleware technologies for ubiquitous
computing, and under a partnership with HP Labs, extend those technologies to
support interactive applications on the grid. The following research
contributions are expected:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Develop attribute-based
naming and discovery of resources;&lt;br/&gt;* Develop novel techniques for
higher-level data fusion leading to synthesis of resources where
applicable;&lt;br/&gt;* Develop novel techniques for recovering from failures
(both real and perceived performance);&lt;br/&gt;* Develop novel resource
allocation strategies that take into account a variety of parameters including
time-varying load on participating resources, dynamic user demands, and location
information; and&lt;br/&gt;* Undertake detailed scalability studies of the
proposed techniques in the context of ubiquitous computing
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A concrete deliverable beyond these research
nuggets will be the incorporation of this middleware technology into standard
grid computing infrastructure such as the Globus toolkit in partnership with HP
labs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The location-aware middleware will be demonstrated in
two ways: campus-based outdoor activity support based on the Georgia Tech campus
and the Aware Home, a unique laboratory for the investigation of ubiquitous
computing in a domestic setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has broad impact
and intellectual merit with respect to its potential for adoption and use via
Globus integration and industry partnership.&lt;br/&gt;
