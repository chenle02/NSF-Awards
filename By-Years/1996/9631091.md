This project will implement a scalable, World Wide Web- interfaced, data
management system to support the mission of the National Center for Ecological
Analysis and Synthesis and further the ecological community's efforts to
integrate ecological data over increasingly broader ranges of space, time and
discipline. The project will expand on the work that has been done for the San
Diego Bay project at the San Diego Supercomputer Center by integrating
systematics collection data from the Bishop Museum in Hawaii, ecological survey
data collections for selected California bioregions, and researcher- supplied
data collections to be used at the ecology center. This range of data will
provide pathfinders to develop standards and practices within the ecological
community enabling it to anticipate and resolve known and yet-undiscovered
problems to improve the predictive value of ecology, facilitate data sharing,
and preserve valuable ecological data. The project will also address the issues
of intellectual property rights in data, publication of data, and funding
mechanisms for the long-term maintenance of ecological data in conjunction with
the Ecological Society of America (ESA). These issues have been identified by
the ESA as key to the utility of large and long-term data sets, and the sharing
of those data by the ecological community. The ESA has established a special
committee to initiate consistent practices and propose policies to facilitate
data sharing and archiving by the ecological community. The ESA will utilize
this project to participate and assist in the construction of a system that can
satisfy its mandate to explore the structure, operation, and use of ecological
data archives. The ESA is working to ensure the financial sustainability of an
effective ecological data archive.
