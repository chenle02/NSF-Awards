This grant supports research to gain a detailed understanding of the influence
of chemical composition on the higher order plane selectivity in silicon
anisotropic etching. A polished single crystal silicon sphere, 0.25 inches in
diameter is chosen for the study because it provides a systematic tool to
measure the plane selectivity in the various etches. Two critical questions will
be addressed: the role of the cation in aqueous solutions, and the role of
alcohol and other additives to the anisotropy of the etching. The visualization
of three dimensional micromachined structures will assist in the design of
complex microstructures.
