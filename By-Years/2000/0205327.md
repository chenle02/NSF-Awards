EIA-0205327 David E. Evans University of Virginia ITR: A Framework for
Environment-Aware, Massively Distributed Computing &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We
propose to develop a programming language for swarms of devices that allows a
programmer to express an application in terms of desired aggregate behavior
rather than explicitly programming individual devices. We will produce a program
synthesizer that automatically generates the appropriate device programs that
will implement the aggregate behavior for a particular deployment. The program
synthesizer draws from a library of primitives that can be combined to produce
complex applications with known scaling and non-functional properties. In
addition to analytical results, we will test our approach using simulations and
using a physical swarm composed of wireless devices with sensors and actuators.
