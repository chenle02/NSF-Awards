In this project, supported jointly by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division and the Metals, Ceramics and Electronic
Materials Program of the Division of Materials Research, the surface and gas-
phase mechanisms of diamond thin film growth will be investigated. Emphasis is
placed on studies of the halogen catalyzed CVD growth of diamond, and surface
science studies combined with molecular modelling and growth kinetic studies
will provide a detailed understanding of the mechanism of diamond thin film
growth. Optical interferometry and atomic force microscopy will be used to
monitor growth rate and the effects of atomic scale morphology on the quality of
the diamond thin films studied here. %%% A detailed understanding of the
mechanism of halogen assisted chemical vapor deposition of diamond thin films
will help to optimize the growth conditions and efficiency of the preparation of
these thin films. Diamond thin films promise to have a wide ranging
technological impact as electronic and optical materials, and a detailed
understanding of the growth process is essential to the development of this
important technology.
