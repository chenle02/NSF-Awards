An Advanced Center for Laser Science and Spectroscopy (ACLaSS) is proposed.Three
subprojects are included:&lt;br/&gt;1) Laser Spectroscopy and Materials
Modeling, 2) Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Application, and 3) Laser Remote
Sensing.&lt;br/&gt;Laser Spectroscopy and Materials Modeling of Plasmon-Coupled
Optical Nanoparticles and Molecules for Photonic Applications: Primary research
will be focused on investigating the spectroscopic analysis and electric field
enhancement of plasmonic nanoparticles, and the optical properties of
semiconductor quantum dots and Raman molecules with plasmonic coupling in the
spectral region from visible to MIR for photonic applications including light
amplifications, chemical molecular sensing, and nonlinear optical
modulations.&lt;br/&gt;Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Application: Development of
Low-Quantum Defect Gain Media for Eye-Safe Lasers: Development of new laser gain
media continues to be an active area of research with a large range of potential
applications for the civilian and military sectors. The proposed activities will
be focused on developing new gain media with low-quantum defect operating in the
eye-safe infrared spectral region of ~1.5-1.7 Ã¬m.&lt;br/&gt;Laser Remote
Sensing: Atmospheric remote sensing has applications in weather forecasting,
global climate change, and provides a better understanding of the troposphere.
The proposed work will focus on expanding the capabilities of the current lidar
systems to include new atmospheric retrievals and aerosol characterization.
