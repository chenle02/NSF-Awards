9317775 Smith The Gesneriaceae, the African-violet family of plants, is a mostly
tropical group in the New and Old Worlds, little known biologically except for
those species prized as ornamentals. Dr. James Smith of Boise State University
has pioneered the application of new DNA-based methods of analysis to problems
of taxonomic delimitation and phylogenetic reconstruction in this family. With
assistance from undergraduate students in research, he is exploring phylogenetic
relationships in representative species of all tribes and most genera of the
family, using traditional morphological characters and new evidence from
chloroplast DNA. Concordance in these independent datasets will lay the basis
for detailed studies of biogeography and of the evolution of pollination
systems. The comparison and integration of data from different sources
constitute an important arena of contemporary phylogenetic research. Taxa from
predominantly tropical regions are rarely explored as model systems in this
debate, because in general they are poorly known. The RUI project by Dr. James
Smith will contribute new DNA data and refined morphological insights to the
study of Gesneriaceae in particular and to taxonomic methodology in general.
