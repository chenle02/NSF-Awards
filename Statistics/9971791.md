This project contains three topics: (1) survival analysis with multiple event-
time data, (2) growth curve analysis and, (3) computerized adaptive testing.
Topic (1) develops new parametric families for multiple event times that satisfy
marginal proportional hazards requirement and proposes semiparametrically
efficient estimator for regression parameter in the marginal Cox model. It
establishes nonparametric estimation and testing procedures and their large
sample properties for gap-time data, which cannot be handled directly by
existing methods due to (informative) right censorship. It also introduces a
class of semiparametric transformation models for recurrent event times and
develops inference procedures that are easy to implement and valid under general
assumptions. Topic (2) deals with random growth curves and develops
nonparametric testing and semiparametric estimation procedures. A crucial issue
being handled there is how to correct bias cause by incompleteness of the growth
curves. Topic (3) develops statistical methods in design and analysis of
computerized adaptive tests. It proposes novel approaches to item selection
through suitable stratification to improve efficiency, item exposure rate
distribution and test security.

The three topics are motivated directly from scientific and educational
applications. The first two topics are applicable to many biomedical studies
including modeling of disease development, testing superiority of a new
treatment and estimation of treatment efficacy. The third topic originates from
the recent emergence of computerizing standardized tests, which include such
widely available tests as GRE and GMAT. The new statistical methods provide more
accurate and efficient tools for measuring educational achievements.
