This Presidential Young Investigator is performing research in large
distributed computer systems with adaptive decentralized resource control, i.e.,
collections of decision-making agents which reside on a geographically
distributed set of computers and which control resources so that work can be
carried out in an integrated and coordinated fashion. Finding good methods for
adaptive decentralized control addresses the question of how to make task and
resource allocation choices correctly and efficiently in light of the formidable
problems which arise as a result of distributing control. Probably the most
difficult of these problems is that multiple agents must make good fast
coordinated decisions based on uncertain and differing views of the global
system state. The research approach is experimental. The Principal Investigator
will create a laboratory to work on problems of load balancing, network routing
and distributed sensing and interpretation. The laboratory will consist of
multiple workstations with a file server, interconnected by a variety of
different networks for work on decentralized coordination protocols under
different topologies, a general purpose multiprocessor allowing for experiments
to be conducted with notes acting as controlling agents numbering in the
hundreds of thousands, and development software, including prototype object-
oriented programming environments and expert system environments.//
