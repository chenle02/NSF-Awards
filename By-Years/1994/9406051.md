Funds are requested to help support expenses for invited speakers for the 53rd
annual symposium of the Society for Developmental Biology (SDB). The meeting
will be of medium size (300-400 registrants); junior-level attendees will be
provided with some financial support. The meeting will include a broad range of
topics; plant, animal and microbial systems will all be represented in sessions
organized around developmental problems and themes rather than particular
systems or organisms. Approximately sixty scientific talks will be presented;
there will be a series of six plenary sessions as well as eight minisymposia.
The minisymposia will be organized and chaired by experts in the individual
areas, but most of the talks will be given by junior people.
