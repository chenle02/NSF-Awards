In search of Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS/CDMA) receiver
designs with favorable cost versus performance characteristics, we consider
adaptive linear tap-weight filters. The architecture under consideration is the
most conventional, but the chosen design optimization criterion is not. Based on
stochastic approximation concepts, we propose the development of recursive
algorithms that minimize directly the induced probability of error (average Bit-
Error-Rate). The novelty of this approach is the incorporation of the
performance evaluation measure directly into the design process. The nature of
this project involves feasibility studies, development, and theoretical analysis
of the induced linear filter Bit-Error-Rate surfaces. We plan to focus initially
on memoryless, time-invariant DS/CDMA channels and then we aim at the
development and performance evaluation of pertinent receivers that operate
successfully in multipath fading channels. In terms of the impact of the
proposed work, we recognize that this line of research goes well beyond DS/CDMA
communications and may lead to studies for non-least squares (possibly MBER)
optimization of linear and non-linear filters.
