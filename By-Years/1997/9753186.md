9753186 Larson Kilauea volcano, on the island of Hawaii, presents a major
seismic as well as volcanic hazard. Hawaiian volcanoes have also generated mega-
landslides and tsunamis in the geologic past, and Kilauea's south flank is
considered the most likely site of such a catastrophe in the future. Frequent
deformation monitoring is needed to understand south flank instability and to
provide short term hazard assessments. Stanford University, in collaboration
with the USGS Hawaii Volcano Observatory (HVO), has installed a continuously
operating GPS network on Kilauea for this purpose. This network currently
measures deformation from 2-10 days after the data are collected. The P.I. will
extend this network into a real-time deformation and hazards warning system,
such that cm level precisions can be determined within 30 minutes of data
collection. She will visit the Hawaii Volcano Observatory in the summer of 1998
to work on technical issues with the onsite HVO science team. As a visiting
professor in the Department of Geophysics at Stanford University, she will
develop and implement the software system and work on modeling of both seismic
and volcanic deformation.
