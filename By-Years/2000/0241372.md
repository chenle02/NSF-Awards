To understand how the earth's climate might change in response to anthropogenic
influence, such as the burning of fossil fuel, it is necessary to understand the
natural variability of climate over glacial/interglacial times. One method of
studying this variability is through investigation of the deep-sea sedimentary
record, which contains chemical, fossil and mineralogic evidence of past
climatic conditions. A potentially important signal in the sediments is the
ratio of Ge to Si in opal, which varies in response to changing ocean
conditions. To derive the maximum use of this tool, its chemical behavior in the
sea floor must be fully understood. Therefore, this work will study the
fractionation of Ge and Si in ocean sediments by laboratory experiments that
would create a controlled diagenetic setting to determine the incorporation of
Ge and Si into iron oxyhydroxices and sulfides. Additionally, existing pore
water samples will be analyzed to investigate the behavior of Ge in different
ocean settings. Field Studies in the California borderland will be carried out
to collect additional pore waters and to deploy in-situ benthic chambers to
measure the fractionation Ge and Si in different environments.
