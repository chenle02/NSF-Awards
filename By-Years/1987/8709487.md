Monochromatic imaging devices are like television cameras, with the capability
added to make images in the light of just one wavelength, such as that emitted
at 630 nm wavelength when ionospheric oxygen ions recombine. However, they have
much greater sensitivity to low light levels than television cameras, and read
out the image data in digital form directly into computers. An imager is to be
built that provides images of the whole sky and is equipped with a set of
filters to image in any one of four wavelengths. In this way the structure of
the emissions from several levels such as from Na and O at 85km and 95km
altitude, and N2+ and O+ from 150 and 250 km altitude can be made. The imager is
to be used in conjunction with the radar at Millstone Hill for study of magnetic
storm effects on the ionosphere. It will also be taken to other parts of the
USA, Canada and overseas for observations with other instruments in CEDAR
coordinated campaigns, such as in studies of the waves and winds in the
mesopause region (80 to 100km altitude). The PI and his associates are
international experts in construction of this equipment and in image data
processing and interpretation of the results.
