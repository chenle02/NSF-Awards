This research will measure turbulent shear flows bearing particles of sufficient
size and concentration that their presence should influence the turbulence.
Experiments in a water tunnel with refractive index matched solids will employ
high speed video cameras and 3-D laser doppler anemometry to measure
simultaneously particle and fluid velocities. The research also will numerically
solve to coupled fluid and particle equations of motion. The research should
help understanding of the transport, deposition or resuspension of particles by
turbulent shear flow near solid boundaries.
