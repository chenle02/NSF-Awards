An SBIR Phase I Award will support development of instrumentation to study
corrosion based on detection of the magnetic fields which are generated by the
corrosion currents. The sensitivity and spatial resolution will be evaluated and
refined and the possibility of remote, non-invasive determination of details of
the corrosion processes will be evaluated.
