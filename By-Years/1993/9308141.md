PI will examine, by various techniques, the internal structure of exceptionally
well-preserved specimens of certain Paleozoic calcareous green algae
(Chlorophyta), commonly known as phylloid algae. These organisms were important
carbonate producers in Late Paleozoic times, but as yet their structure and
taxonomy are not well understood. This study will test the utility of several
techniques and should contribute to a better understanding of the Chlorophyta,
allowing comparisons with other Paleozoic collections and with presumed living
relatives, especially Halimeda.
