This project is supporting three cohorts of academically talented students with
demonstrated financial need in attaining baccalaureate degrees in electrical
engineering at Suffolk University. Scholar recruitment is being done in
partnership with the Boston Public High School system, with additional support
from local power industries. Cohort-building and developmental activities for
scholars build on best practices from other institutions and include a project-
based first-year seminar, enrichment and career-development sessions, course-
affiliated study groups, faculty and peer mentoring, and internship
opportunities. The intellectual merit of the project lies in a cohesive and
focused approach to scholar recruitment, retention and career transitions which
leverages strong participation by high schools and industry and the supportive
community of electrical-engineering students and faculty at Suffolk. The broader
impacts include expanding and diversifying the power-industry workforce, as well
as providing a well-assessed model for consideration by similar institutions.
