With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Mount Holyoke College will acquire an atomic force
microscope (AFM). This equipment will be used to explore (a) the impact of
surface topography on wettability; (b) the effect of surface chemistry and
energetics on protein adsorption using a combinatorial approach; (c) the
structure and interactions of microbes at interfaces; and (d) donor-acceptor
interactions in matched component systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemistry is a
scientific discipline that studies structure and processes at the molecular
scale. In the past, chemists learned to examine and elucidate molecular events
by performing collective spectroscopy, that is, measuring average properties
from solution or solid-state experiments. Modern techniques, including AFM,
allow measurements at a much faster and smaller scale. AFM allows the direct
observation and understanding of molecular events occurring in chemical and
biological processes, enables the correlation of microscopic structures to
macroscopic properties, and permits the design of materials with nanoscopic
features. These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, including
surface and organic chemistry, materials science and biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
