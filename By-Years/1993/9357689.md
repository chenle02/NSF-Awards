9357689 Rimoldi NYI: Information Processing Problems in Wireless Communication
Networks We are approaching an era of personal communication that requires an
infrastructure capable of providing untethered access to a global network from
any point on (and above) the surface of the earth. Implementation of this
scenario in an already congested radio frequency spectrum requires renewed
efforts to understand the design of more efficient information processing and
network control in wireless communication networks. We will mainly concentrate
our efforts on information processing problems. One such problem is how to
ensure that a number of transmitters can send information packets to a common
central station in an efficient way. Solutions that have been considered for
implementation so far are suboptimal. Of particular interest from both a
theoretical and a practical point of view is the use of codes based on lattice
structures. These structures can be used to design multiple-access codes that
approach channel capacity and are well suited for being used with bursty sources
with a decoder of manageable complexity. Also of interest is the use of lattice
structures to achieve successively refined quantization of analog sources.
