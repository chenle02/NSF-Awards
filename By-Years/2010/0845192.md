(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As computing becomes
embedded in the very fabric of our society, the&lt;br/&gt;exponential growth and
advances in cheap, high-speed communication&lt;br/&gt;infrastructures allow for
unprecedented levels of global information&lt;br/&gt;exchange and interaction.
As a result, new market forces emerge that propel&lt;br/&gt;toward a
fundamental, cost-efficient paradigm shift in the way computing
is&lt;br/&gt;deployed and delivered: computing
outsourcing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outsourcing has the potential to minimize
client-side management overheads&lt;br/&gt;and benefit from a service provider's
global expertise consolidation and&lt;br/&gt;bulk pricing. Companies such as
Google, Yahoo, Amazon, and Sun are rushing&lt;br/&gt;to offer increasingly
complex storage and computation outsourcing services&lt;br/&gt;supported by
globally distributed "cloud" infrastructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet
significant challenges lie in the path to successful large-
scale&lt;br/&gt;adoption. In business, healthcare and government frameworks,
clients are&lt;br/&gt;reluctant to place sensitive data under the control of a
remote, third-&lt;br/&gt;party provider, without practical assurances of privacy
and confidentiality.&lt;br/&gt;Today's solutions however, do not offer such
assurances, and are thus&lt;br/&gt;fundamentally insecure and vulnerable to
illicit behavior. Existing research&lt;br/&gt;addresses several aspects of this
problem, but advancing the state of the&lt;br/&gt;art to practical realms will
require a fundamental leap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses these
challenges by designing, implementing and&lt;br/&gt;analyzing practical data
outsourcing protocols with strong assurances of&lt;br/&gt;privacy and
confidentiality. It will also l initiate the exploration of the cost and
energy&lt;br/&gt;footprints of outsourcing mechanisms. This is essential as the
main raison&lt;br/&gt;d'etre of outsourcing paradigms lies in their assumed end-
to-end cost&lt;br/&gt;savings and expertise consolidation. Yet, research has yet
to explore and&lt;br/&gt;validate the magnitudes of these savings and their
underlying assumptions.
