In this project managed by the Chemistry Division at NSF, Professor Daniela
Arias-Rotondo and her students at Kalamazoo College will design, prepare, and
study manganese-based compounds that could have potential applications in
converting solar energy into electricity. Manganese is a low-cost, low-toxicity
alternative to the materials currently used for these applications. Students of
varied backgrounds will work on this project, closely mentored by Prof. Arias-
Rotondo, who will also establish peer-mentoring opportunities for the project
participants. Additionally, Prof. Arias-Rotondo will re-design the laboratory
portion of the Inorganic Chemistry course offered at Kalamazoo College to give
students a research-like experience in the class. To accomplish this goal, some
of the compounds developed in this research project will be incorporated into
the Inorganic Chemistry teaching lab.

The photophysics of manganese coordination complexes is an underexplored
research area, as is the organometallic chemistry of manganese in low oxidation
states. Prof. Arias-Rotondo and her students aim to synthesize carbene ligands
to coordinate to manganese in several oxidation states and characterize the
resulting compounds through a combination of NMR and optical spectroscopy, x-ray
diffraction, and electrochemistry. Computational modelling will be used to aid
the interpretation of experimental data, creating a more thorough description of
the molecular and electronic structure of these coordination complexes. The PI
seeks to synthetically modified ligands to study the effect of substituents on
the properties of the Mn compounds. This project could potentially yield robust
photoactive manganese complexes with charge-separated excited states that can be
accessed with visible light as well as design principles to prepare other Mn
compounds and tailor their properties.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
