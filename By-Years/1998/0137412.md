The research program outlined in this proposal is driven by the need to develop
novel means of acquiring, storing, manipulating and synthesizing signals and
images for use in a feedback loop. This is the essential mandate of controlled
active vision in which one uses a combination of techniques from systems and
control, signal and image processing, as well as a computer vision for this
purpose. The design of novel techniques for using visual information in control
systems appears in a number of practical systems problems ranging from remote
controlled weapons and vehicles to telesurgery, manufacturing systems, and ATR.
Moreover, these efforts are leading to enhanced man-machine interfaces for
interactions with computers.

In this research, the PI will consider certain novel methods based on the notion
of "optimal mass transport" for such problems in controlled active vision. This
type of technique has appeared in econometrics, fluid dynamics, transportation,
statistical physics, shape optimization, expert systems, meteorology, and
nonlinear control analysis and synthesis.
