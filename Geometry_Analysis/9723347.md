This award provides partial support for the Southern California Geometric
Analysis Seminar, an annual two-day conference at the University of California,
Irvine, which is designed to promote interaction among the members of the
Southern California mathematics community who work in the field of Geometric
Analysis and related areas. The major goals of this project are to bring
graduate students and young researchers together with top-ranking senior
researchers in the field and to serve as a conduit for the flow of ideas. In the
past, these meetings have led to new collaborations and new results whose impact
grows in significance long after the conference is concluded. The importance of
such conferences is heightened in the area of Geometric Analysis because this is
a field which cuts across many areas of mathematics, both pure and applied, and
thus requires its practitioners to come in frequent contact with a wide variety
of ideas and methods. Topics covered in the past include gauge theories,
Riemannian geometry, sympletic geometry, evolution equations, and curvature
flows.
