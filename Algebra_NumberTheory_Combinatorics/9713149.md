Lazarsfeld 9713149 This award supports work on a number of problems in algebraic
geometry. The first is to explore the connections between invariants from higher
dimensional complex geometry and the rich classical geometry of abelian
varieties and Riemann surfaces. The principal investigator also proposes to
continue his work on the geometry of irregular varieties, as well as on the
problem of trying to find lower bounds on the local positivity of an ample line
bundle at a very general point of a smooth projective variety of arbitrary
dimension. Finally, he will investigate some questions growing out of a recent
observation with Bo Ilic to the effect that if X is a projective variety of
dimension n with non-negative cotangent bundle, then the least degree of a
projective embedding of X must grow essentially exponentially in n. This is
research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the
oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary
flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that
could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.
Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis
and topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as
in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
