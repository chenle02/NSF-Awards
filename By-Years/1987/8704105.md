The objective of this research is to develop an integrated dynamic model and
computer control system for a typical wastewater treatment plant designed to
take advantage of as much information as possible including predictions from
fast-time computer simulations, the knowledge of expert operating engineers and
plant operators, and information from both off-line analyses and on-line
sensors. Computer simulations based on the model will be used to prepare plans
for physical experiments to test the model and control system at pilot or full
scale. The strategies will have the goal of minimizing operational costs while
meeting requirements for the effluent wastewater and sludge produced. They will
take into account interactions between the individual processes as well as those
between the liquid and solids processing trains. The dynamic nature of
wastewater collection systems, receiving bodies of water, and sludge transport
and disposal will be considered in development of the strategy to be used in
approaching engineering design of treatment plants and in their operation to
meet control objectives.
