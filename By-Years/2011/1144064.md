The Conflict Consortium will bring together two groups of scholars for the
purposes of solidifying relationships in the field of subnational conflict,
developing a list of best practices as well as most commonly utilized variables
to assist in field development and to provide instructions for others in the
fields of political science and sociology who wish to understand, use and create
their own databases. These workshops will improve the current research in this
area, lead to greater accumulation of findings in the future and provide
guidance to those in as well as those consider work in this area of research.
The Consortium will also attempt to provide the framework within which data
projects could be better coordinated with one another and courses taught on the
subject at diverse venues around the globe.
