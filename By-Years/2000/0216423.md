This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award provides funds for the purchase
of a scanning electron microscope and a Fourier transformation infrared
spectrometer. This equipment will be used to support research on development of
three-dimensional nanomanufacturing technologies and on those technologies'
applications in nanophotonic structures and devices. Most nanophotonic
structures with designed functionalities are complicated and three-dimensional,
therefore three-dimensional nanomanufacturing technologies are essential. The
scanning electron microscope can provide images with high resolution, and the
Fourier transformation infrared spectrometer can measure the essential optical
properties of photonic structures and devices. These structural and optical
properties will provide important information and guidance for the development
and optimization of nanomanufacturing processes. The research conducted using
this equipment is interdisciplinary and involves the collaborative efforts of
researchers from various departments. This will likely lead to advances in the
sciences and technologies of nanomanufacturing, photonic material, and devices.
By creating a tight-nit environment of mechanical engineers, electrical
engineers, and chemists, a new generation of engineers with interdisciplinary
knowledge and research experience will be trained through participating in these
research activities. The advances in nanomanufacturing and education will
benefit society by helping the United States maintain a competitive edge in this
high technology industry and prepare a high quality workforce for the nation's
economy and security.
