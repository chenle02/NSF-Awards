Digital sky surveys are increasingly pivotal in astronomy, but existing
computational methodologies are unable effectively to analyze the resultant
extremely large databases. This project will develop and apply methods that
combine the analysis of imaging, photometric, and spectroscopic data to mine
astronomical databases and detect peculiar celestial objects of scientific
value. Peculiar galaxies are very different from the majority of galaxies and
carry crucial information about the interactions of objects, their formation,
and their evolutionary history. They are important for addressing fundamental
questions about the early, present, and future universe. Software and source
code developed in this project will be open to the community. The principal
investigator has been leading high-impact inclusion and diversity programs that
engage students from underrepresented minorities. The present project will
strengthen these student experiences, continuing to use research as a tool for
increasing diversity and inclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algorithms, both new
and already developed with previous NSF support, will be applied to the most
significant existing digital sky surveys, including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS), the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (PanSTARRS),
and the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and will be prepared for the future, notably
for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), the most powerful astronomical
imaging device and the primary NSF astronomical project for the
decade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
