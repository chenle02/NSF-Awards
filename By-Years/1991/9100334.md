An ideal place to begin learning what options are available to me is the Society
of Neuroscience meeting on October 27 - November 2, 1990, in St. Louis. The
Society has a placement service and many groups that will serve as important
contacts, such as a women's meeting and a minorities group. Also there will be
personnel and representative from diverse research centers I can meet
personally. The poster sessions will offer me an opportunity to meet scientists
in the field I am interested in.
