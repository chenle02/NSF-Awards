0214206&lt;br/&gt;Withers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides support for
an upgrade of the computational facilities at the Center for Earthquake Research
and Information (CERI), University of Memphis. Equipment to be purchased will
include two SUN multi-CPU severs, a RAID system, a tape backup system, two color
printers, and several individual workstations. This equipment will facilitate a
multitude of CERI functions including, a role as an information center for state
and local governments interested in mitigating seismic hazards surrounding the
New Madrid Fault Zone, maintenance of a public outreach program on earthquake
hazards, maintenance of the central and eastern U.S. seismicity database in
collaboration with the USGS, and basic seismological and geodetic research and
education. Several researchers at CERI including Mitch Withers, Arch Johnston,
Michael Ellis, Robert Smalley and Chuck Langston will employ this equipment for
research in earthquake seismology, mantle tomography and active margin plate
kinematics. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
