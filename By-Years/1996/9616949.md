Helfrich 9616949 Laboratory experiments and numerical studies of planetary-
scale flow in multiply connected domains will be conducted to examine
circulation features (e.g. recirculation zones, zonal jets and flow separation)
that are induced by islands and to explore the validity of the linear Island
Rule developed by Godfrey. The experimental work will begin with an examination
of flow in the barotropic lid- driven sliced cylinder analogue of the beta
plane. A number of island geometries will be examined and the effects of
stratification will be added. A companion numerical study using the Miami
Isopycnic coordinate model (MICOM) will be undertaken for comparison with the
experiments.
