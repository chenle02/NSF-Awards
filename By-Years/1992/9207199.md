Bdelloid rotifers are common fresh-water invertebrates comprising 4 families,
numerous genera and hundreds of species. Neither males nor meiosis are known
within the Class. Although remarkable, this does not exclude rare or
unrecognized forms of genetic exchange. A more rigorous test is therefor
required. The proposed investigation depends on the expectation that a diploid
line that lost sexual reproduction and genetic recombination far back in its
evolution will accumulate a much higher level of silent-site heterozygosity than
a sexually reproducing line. For a given gene, heterozygosity will be measured
by comparing the nucleotide sequences of its two homologues cloned from the DNA
of a rotifer population grown from a single egg. Such tests will be done with a
number of different genes and different bdelloid families and genera. Bdelloid
DNA will also be examined for mobile genetic elements, in order to test the
possible association between sexual reproduction and the load of insertion
mutations. For comparison, heterozygosity and mobile elements will also be
investigated in monogononts, a class of rotifers in which sexual reproduction
and meiosis are known. %%% The usual and accepted view is that without sex and
recombination, evolution and adaptive success is not possible. That hypothesis,
however, has been impossible to test. The availability of Bdelloid rotifers and
recombinant DNA technology have changed that and this work may make it possible
to find a more definitive answer to a fundamental question in genetics.
