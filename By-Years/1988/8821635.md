They will focus on extending neutron scattering studies in two entirely new
directions. Because of the recent advances in the preparation of diluted
magnetic semiconductors (DMS) layered structures (epilayers and superlattices),
by molecular beam epitaxy, and because of the opportunities which these advances
provide for structuring novel spin configurations, they will focus on neutron
scattering in layered DMS systems. Similarly, advances in bulk crystal growth
have extended the field of DMS to alloys based on transition metals other than
manganese (e.g., zinc1-xcobaltxsulfur, zinc1-xironxselenium). Neutron studies of
these systems will provide information on the interactions between the iron and
the cobalt ions, which are magnetically quite different fron manganese. Finally,
they will continue their neutron studies of the manganese-based DMS alloys with
a view at elucidating the spin freezing process occuring in these materials at
low temperatures.
