Career: Adaptive Concurrency Management for Multicore Computing Abstract: Given
the increasing emphasis on multicore computing, concurrency management is likely
to be one of the key techniques to unleash the power of multicore processors.
Concurrency is the capability of executing multiple tasks simultaneously, but it
is often difficult to achieve due to data and control dependencies. The proposed
research aims to optimize thread-level concurrency for multicore applications.
It will investigate architecture features for efficient shared data accesses,
and use these features to dynamically control the advancement of concurrent
threads and the allocation of CPU resources. The project will target computing
platforms of immediate concern and the techniques will be made accessible to the
programming community by integrating them into existing programming tools. The
project will also extend theoretical results towards efficient multi-threaded
algorithms. The proposed research project is expected to significantly improve
the performance of multicore computing and expand the range of applications that
can benefit from such processor platforms. It is expected to facilitate
efficient multicore processing for computation-demanding applications in
science, engineering, and business.
