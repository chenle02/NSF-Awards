9306813 Carey The overall goal of this 3-year project is to increase
understanding of regulatory signals underlying changes in intestinal function
during the seasonal cycle of a mammalian hibernator, the 13-lined ground
squirrel. Previous studies in the applicant's laboratory have documented
structural and functional changes in small intestinal tissues of ground
squirrels that are closely related to the seasonal cycles of food intake and
metabolic activity in these animals. During the proposed project period, we plan
to extend our earlier findings and determine how digestive enzyme and nutrient
transport function are regulated during the different activity phases of ground
squirrels. This objective will be met by focusing on four areas: (1)
characterization of sugar and amino acid transport at the level of the brush
border membrane; (2) immunocytochemical localization of Na+-glucose transporter
and sucrase-isomaltase proteins in intestinal tissues; (3) determination of
intestinal epithelial cell age and migration rates in hibernating and active
squirrels; (4) determination of messenger RNA levels coding for NA+-glucose
transporter and sucrase-isomaltase proteins during specific activity states of
the squirrels. This project will directly address the increasing evidence (in
non-hibernating species) that the presence of luminal substrate is required for
maximal expression of nutrient transporters on brush border membranes, by
studying a mammal that has been shaped by adaptive evolution to forego feeding
for long periods of time. Together, these studies should provide a comprehensive
picture that characterizes the regulation of nutrient digestive and transport
function on multiple levels. Information gained from this study will increase
our understanding of the ability of intestinal transport systems to adapt to
dramatic changes in food resources in a seasonal environment. ***
