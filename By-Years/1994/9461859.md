The monolithic ring approach to building powerful, highly-coherent laser
sources is been well proven at the two wavelengths of 1064 nm and 1319 nm. The
commercial market and the thus technological value of this laser design
increased if more wavelengths were available at the same high power and extreme
coherence. This research explores lasers based on the monolithic ring resonator
design at a number of wavelengths other than 1064 nm and 1319 nm. These lasers
may applications in absolute-distance interferometry, astronomical
instrumentation for detection of astronomical millimeter waves, atomic clocks
and precision metrology using specific near infrared and visible wavelengths.
The Phase I objective is to powerful, single-frequency, diode-pumped laser
oscillation on a number of laser lines that have not yet been used commercially.
Two techniques are employed. First, using Nd:YAG, the research uses wavelength-
selective coatings to get as many wavelengths as possible. Second, lasers at two
quasi-three level laser lines - Nd:YAG at 946 nm, and Yb:YAG at 1030 nm - are
constructed by using diffusion-bonding to create monolithic resonators with
doped and undoped regions. The range of single-frequency laser lines which are
available is expected to be expanded. Phase II will be the design of lasers at
wavelengths identified in Phase I.
