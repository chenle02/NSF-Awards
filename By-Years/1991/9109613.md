This Research Planning Grant award will allow Dr. M. Lynne McAnelly to work in
the laboratory of Dr. Harold Zakon at the University of Texas at Austin in order
to develop her independent research program. The acquisition of membrane
properties of cells of the electric organ of a weak electric fish will be
studied to determine whether cells switch from membrane properties
characteristic of muscle cells to those of neural cells. This award will provide
Dr. McAnelly with training and experience needed to pursue an independent career
in developmental neurophysiology.
