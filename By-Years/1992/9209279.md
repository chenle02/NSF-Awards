The focus of this research is the development of new classes of radical
reactions based on the study of mechanism and rate. Acyl germanes, silanes and
stannanes will be developed as reagents for radical additions, cyclizations and
annulations. Aryl selenomalonitriles will be developed in the same vein with a
special emphasis on the study of 1,2-asymmetric radical reactions. %%% With this
award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Dennis P.
Curran of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. Professor
Curran will focus his work on the understanding of organic radical reactions and
the development of new transformations which will add to the repertoire of
preparatively useful radical reactions.
