9321295 Poulter This award from the Synthetic Organic Program will support a
series of three annual "Workshops on Organic Synthesis and Natural Products
Chemistry." These workshops have the dual purpose of (1) providing an effective
forum for informal discussion among young scientists on current research in
topical areas of organic synthesis and natural products, and (2) assisting the
Program staff in identifying emerging areas and researchers. This process, in
turn, will aid the Program in long-range planning. The specific goals of the
workshops include: 1) Providing an environment for the dynamic exchange of ideas
in organic synthesis and natural products chemistry among a small group (about
20) of active young researchers in these fields. 2) Encouraging an attitude of
cooperation amoung individuals working in related areas, and thereby, avoiding
duplicative efforts. 3) Stimulating participants to study new problems and
methods in syntheic and natural products chemistry. 4) Creating an atmosphere in
which the scientific and social interaction among participants will be both
stimulating and pleasant. ***
