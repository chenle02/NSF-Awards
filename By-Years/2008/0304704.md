The goal of this project is to apply quantitative techniques to measure
emissions of sesquiterpenes from trees and agricultural plants. Sesquiterpenes
are biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) that are chemically reactive and
have low volatility. Their oxidation products are considered responsible for a
significant fraction of the secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), especially over
forested regions. A systematic investigation of speciated and total
sesquiterpene emission factors will be conducted. Vegetation will be surveyed by
environmentally controlled enclosure experiments (leaf cuvette and branch
enclosure). Emission samples will be collected on inorganic solid adsorbents and
sesquiterpenes will be identified and quantified in the field by thermal
desorption/gas chromatography with mass spectrometry and flame ionization
detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project will include
close collaboration between research groups at the National Center for
Atmospheric Research and the Institute of Alpine and Arctic Research at the
University of Colorado, Boulder, the construction of a field instrument for on-
site identification and quantification of sesquiterpene fluxes, support for a
graduate student and undergraduate students, and various outreach activities.
