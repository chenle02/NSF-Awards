Polymeric membranes currently in use in hydrogen separation technology have
limited selectivity (i.e., they do not retain certain impurities) and, in
addition, are heat-sensitive. The latter restriction implies that hot streams of
gas must be cooled sufficiently before the separation step. Metallic membranes
overcome these difficulties, but the ones used currently are expensive since
they are made of palladium-silver alloys. This proposal outlines an
investigation of the technical feasibility of using a less expensive titanium
alloy that is highly permeable to hydrogen. This Phase I research under the
Small Business Innovation Research Program will focus on methods to clean and
coat titanium alloy membranes with thin layers of palladium or nickel to avoid
oxidation effects. The coated membranes will then be tested for hydrogen
permeation rates and for selectivity, under typical industrial conditions. The
PI, Dr. Dwayne T. Friesen, and his employer, Bend Research, Inc., have
established an excellent record of productive research and are very well
qualified for support. Funding at the requested level of $39,866 for six months
is recommended.
