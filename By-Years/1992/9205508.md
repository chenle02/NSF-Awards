This investigation will include determination of the relevant hydraulic and
physical characteristics of the carbonate host rocks and the stratigraphic
environment. Field work will be conducted to measure fracture densities and
orientations for input to a numerical model of flow through fracture networks.
These data and fracture flow estimates will then be applied to a numerical model
to simulate flow of mineralizing fluids and heat in the area of ore
mineralization. Flow patterns and temperature distributions established with
this flow model will then be used with a chemical speciation model to simulate
zones of ore and gangue mineral precipitation. The model will be used to test
several postulated ore transport and emplacement mechanisms. Results of this
research will help validate or constrain hypotheses on the formation of the
Upper Mississippi Valley ore deposits, as well as Mississippi Valley-Type
deposits in general.
