This research focuses on the study of atomic structure and electron dynamics as
seen through the interaction of fast electromagnetic pulses with negative ions.
The program is composed of three different components, all involving
photodetachment: detachment dynamics followed through production of continuum
wave packets, detachment occurring via resonance states in complex ions, and
multiphoton ionization and detachment. Advantage is taken of the fact that, in
the absence of the strong Coulomb term in the continuum, the contributions of
the electron correlation effects to the dynamics are magnified. Nanosecond and
picosecond pulsed lasers are used in combination with ions either in a beam or a
Penning trap.
