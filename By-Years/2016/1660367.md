This study seeks to understand the role of surface differences in determining
average surface fluxes in the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL). Insights will be
used to develop new physically-based models and parameterizations that can
properly account for the interaction between natural land surface differences
and turbulence in the lowest layer of the atmosphere near the surface. This
study will incorporate a numerical weather prediction (NWP) module as part of a
summer camp called Hi-GEAR (Girls Engineering Abilities Realized) and an
outreach program called Discover Engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key
hypothesis of this study is that under the stratified conditions characteristic
of the NBL, surface heterogeneity will localize turbulent fluxes horizontally
and vertically, and will enhance the flux contrast between regions with
different surface states, such as temperature. The uniqueness of the proposed
research rests with the fact that current surface flux parameterizations in
models do not account for these interactions.
