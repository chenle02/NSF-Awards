This award provides partial support for the acquisition of a laser capture
microdissection (LCM) system and ancillary cryo-preparation equipment to be used
for examining plant materials at the Donald Danforth Plant Sciences Center. The
LCM system is able to capture selected cells from sectioned materials. The
technology allows for the identification of specific cell types and their
precise removal from tissue without damage. Captured cells can then be used in a
wide range of downstream assays, such as EST library generation, RT-PCR
amplification, microarray analysis, single and two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis analyses of protein products, Western blotting, and MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometry. The precision of cell capture with LCM combined with current
metabolic, genomic, and proteomic analyses comprise a powerful tool which is not
widely available. In addition to training graduate and postgraduate researchers,
the Danforth Center also provides training to undergraduate students during the
summer months through its Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program.
