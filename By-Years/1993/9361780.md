9361780 Ghosal Efficient, environmentally stable, easily processable and cost
effective semiconducting materials are needed from fabrication of light emitting
diodes to be used in large area displays and density optical recording. The
proposed Phase I research utilizes copolymers to fabricate visible light
emitters made of novel organic polymer composites. Constituents of the proposed
composite material can be varied to achieve desired efficiency of light
emission, low voltage of operation, required brightness, and other important
operational parameters. the flexibility and ease of the proposed material's
processing technique enables route to inexpensive, reconfigurable and high pixel
density displays. The future benefits of the proposed structures are: (i) high
quantum efficiency of the light emission, (ii) controllable chromaticity, (iii)
low voltage of operation, and (iv) long time reliability. ***
