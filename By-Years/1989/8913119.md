This project seeks to illuminate interconnections between the use of
generalized degree theory and minimax methods for nonconvex functionals applied
to bifurcation problems in the mathematical theory of nonlinear functional
analysis. Plans include the adaptation of arguments concerning A-proper mappings
for finding multiple solutions of operator equations to possible use in
numerical approximations. The concept of A-proper mapping has been used in
proving results of Landesman-Lazer type for semilinear equations whose linear
parts have finite-dimensional kernels. Work will be done seeking to obtain
extensions to the infinite-dimensional case. Various models in mathematical
physics arise in this context. A second thrust of this work involves the
application of a recently established, and very precise, form of the Morse
deformation lemma. It will be used to obtain information concerning differential
equations with discontinuous nonlinearities and to produce indirect existence
results for free boundary problems. Using Clarke's concept of subgradient,
variational inequalities and nonconvex problems will be analyzed via the
mountain pass lemma and more general saddle point techniques to develop new
applications to mechanics.
