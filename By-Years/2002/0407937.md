0407937&lt;br/&gt;Graham, Michael H.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas Program
award will provide support for a planning visit by Dr. Michael H. Graham, San
Jose State University, to work with Dr. Alejandro H. Buschmann at Universidad de
Los Lagos in Puerto Montt, Chile. The PI has initiated a long-term research
program to investigate the effects of kelp diversity on kelp forest ecosystem
function. This planning visit will help the PI to determine the efficacy of
including Chilean kelp populations into the research program. The addition of
Chilean populations and endemic kelp species will broaden both the geographic
and taxonomic breadth of the long-term research, enhancing the potential success
and impact of the results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the importance of
studying this ecosystem, this project will involve training of graduate students
from both countries, strengthening the abilities of these young researchers to
conduct both basic and applied research.&lt;br/&gt;
