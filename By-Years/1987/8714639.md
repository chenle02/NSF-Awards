One of the greatest threats to maximum performance and system reliability in
industrial equipment is fouling and corrosion of the equipment surfaces. Fouling
and corrosion combined cost the U.S. billions of dollars annually. Much of the
fouling is due to biofilms forming on equipment surfaces in contact with water
and significant amounts of corrosion result from the resultant microbial
activity at the equipment surface (generally a metal alloy). Biodeterioration
has been observed on many materials including metals, concrete, wood, and
plastics. Despite the concern over microbial corrosion, most of its literature
contains anecdotal material. This investigation focuses on microbial corrosion
of metals and metal alloys. Measurements will focus on defining the metal-
biofilm interface through the use of microelectrodes and real time
electrochemical monitoring of corrosion processes. Microbial process engineering
techniques will integrate the measurements in a model for describing/predicting
microbial corrosion in industrial environments. New instrumentation or new uses
for current instrumentation related to detecting, identifying, and monitoring
microbial corrosion processes are also anticipated outcomes of the research.
