The proposed research addresses the development of capacitive proximity sensor
arrays that can detect geometric features of interest such as edges of surfaces,
locations of holes, spatial angles of workpieces relative to an end-effector,
and distance between end- effectors and workpiece, while avoiding the extensive
computing requirements and other problems typically associated with machine
vision systems. The project will also explore the use of this technique in a
fully automated surface-quality transducer system which will allow the
quantitative determination and characterization of surface profiles and defects
on technical surfaces, independent of the optical and magnetic properties of the
surface. The transducer will be capable of quantitatively determining local and
average surface roughness as well as depth and size of surface flaws. The sensor
consists of a thin short lead embedded in a hard ceramic substrate, and is
therefore rugged and can, due to its small size, be configured to almost any
desired shape in order to examine hard-to-reach surfaces.
