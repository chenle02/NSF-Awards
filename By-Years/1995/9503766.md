9503766 Spanos This project conducts a research investigation featuring
improved models which accurately describe the seismic response of equipment and
of some other block-like structural systems. The approach undertaken in this
study considers the impact of the block with the foundation as a continuous
process of time. This impact model represents the influence of most of the
important geometrical, mechanical, and material quantities such as material
stiffness, block aspect ratio, value of the coefficient of friction, and the
plastic behavior of the structure. Further, new numerical methods for analysis
and design of multi-block systems based on versatile discrete element method
will be developed. Stochastic analysis of block-like structures under earthquake
excitations will also be carried out. Upon developing the theoretical and
numerical aspects of the proposed methods, these models and the analyses will be
applied to investigate the design problems of a variety of practical equipment
and historical monuments structures. ***
