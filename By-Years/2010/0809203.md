This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports the work of Professor Viktor N. Nemykin of the University of Minnesota
- Duluth to design and characterize new porphyrins and tetraazaporphyrins
directly connected to redox-active transition metal centers. A series of
porphyrins with meso-ferrocene or ruthenocene units will be synthesized along
with tetraazporphyrins with ferrocene units connected or fused to the
macrocycle. Systematic investigations will vary the nature of the metal ions
incorporated into the porphyrin ring, the number and mutual orientations of the
appended metallocene fragments, the nature of the linkers between the
metallocenes and porphyrins, and the extent of rotational freedom of the
metallocenes. The systems may demonstrate mixed valence and electron migration
properties that are useful for high-density molecular information storage
systems. The specifically designed, modular character of the project is
especially suitable for the undergraduate researchers who will take part in the
research. The research efforts will also strengthen the M.S. Graduate Program at
the University of Minnesota - Duluth.
