This action funds a 3-year continuing grant to the National Academy of Sciences
to coordinate the U.S. National Committees for 5 scientific unions thus ensuring
effective U.S. participation and leadership in the international bioscience
community. The unions are the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular
Biology, the International Union of Biological Sciences, the International Union
of Pure and Applied Biophysics, the International Union of Microbiological
Sciences, and the International Union of Physiological Sciences. Also supported
is DIVERSITAS, an international program of biodiversity science. While each
National Committee undertakes unique activities, they have a common mission to
advance global access to scientific knowledge and research resources and to
foster networks and communication worldwide.
