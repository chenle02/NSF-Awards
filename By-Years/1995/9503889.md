9503889 Tindall This award supports a one year Japan Society for the Promotion
of Science postdoctoral fellowship for Dr. Craig Tindall. The research work
conducted for this fellowship will be performed in Professor Toshio Sakurai's
laboratory at the Institute for Materials Research (IMR) at Tohoku University.
The proposed work consists of fundamental studies of copper compounds on silicon
and silicon dioxide surfaces. These materials are of interest because more
knowledge of their chemistry will help to create processes which may be used to
make faster integrated circuits. As a postdoctoral fellow at IMR, Dr. Tindall
will have the opportunity to become familiar with some very powerful
experimental apparatus which has been developed by Professor Sakurai's group.
Since this equipment is not readily available in other laboratories, Professor
Sakurai's laboratory will provide an excellent environment in which to perform
this research. In addition, the Electro- Communication Institute at Tohoku
University is also a very highly regarded facility, and may provide an
opportunity in the second year of this fellowship to carry out some studies of
deposition of copper layers on silicon and silicon dioxide. ***
