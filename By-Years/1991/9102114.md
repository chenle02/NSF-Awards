The proposed research will test the new hypothesis that plateau uplift is a
fundamental cause of late-Cenozoic climate change. Specifically, this work will
involve sensitivity-test experiments with two general circulation models (GCM's)
as well as the analysis of late-Cenozoic trends in cored DSP and ODP sequences
to monitor windblown dust fluxes and surface-ocean productivity in the
equatorial Atlantic, eastern Atlantic and northwest Pacific oceans. The results
of this study should address several key questions about the late-Cenozoic,
including the relative influence of orographic and CO2 changes to regional and
global cooling as well as to changes in moisture-balance patterns.
