This project weaves together several threads in the disparate areas of topology,
arithmetic, and algebra. Questions in arithmetic - such as determining the
symmetries of a number system - can be difficult to resolve directly, but are
sometimes easier to address in a probabilistic or statistical sense. One main
goal of this project is to use tools in topology (and specifically the geometry
of configuration spaces of points in the plane) to resolve geometric analogues
of these statistical questions in arithmetic. Along the way, the Principal
Investigator will develop tools to study the structure of algebraic objects
governing these questions; these tools will be strongly informed by the
geometric setting of these configuration spaces.

The Principal Investigator will particularly aim to establish and refine
conjectures of Malle, Delaunay, and others in the function field setting. The
methods involve a new tool for the computation of the homology of braid groups
using the homological algebra of braided Hopf algebras. As part of this work,
the Principal Investigator will develop a structure theory for braided Hopf
algebras, and use this to better understand their homological algebra. Finally,
the Principal Investigator will reverse the roles of the subjects involved, and
use arithmetic tools to address questions in chromatic homotopy theory,
particularly surrounding the chromatic splitting and redshift conjectures.
