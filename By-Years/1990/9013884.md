Supramolecular assemblies, e.g. monolayers, vesicles, extended bilayers, cast
bilayers, and tubules, are two-dimensional arrays of amphiphiles. The recent
introduction of methods to polymerize these assemblies provides a means to
prepare new materials with unusual properties. The nature of these two-
dimensional polymerizations and the effect of the assembly structure on the
polymerization reaction has been poorly understood. However our previous
research has provided valuable insights into these polymerization processes. The
objective of this research is to enhance our fledgling understanding of the
fundamentals of two- dimensional polymerizations. Specifically, this reserch
will emphasize the following: a) the factors that control the size of linear
polymers formed in homolipid and mixed lipid assemblies; and c) determination of
the effect of the frequency of crosslinks in the polymerization of the
assemblies on both the rate of lateral lipid diffusion, and the appearance of
domains in two-dimensions. These data, to be determined primarily for extended
bilayer and vesicle assemblies, are expected to provide a basis to evaluate how
two-dimensional polymerizations parallel or deviate from the established
principles of isotropic polymerizations. This research combines synthetic
chemistry, instrumental characterization, and surface science. It is expected to
provide a rational foundation for the use of two-dimensional polymerizations for
the formation of new materials, such as membranes.
