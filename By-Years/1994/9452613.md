9452613 Toll This project is supports recent curricular reform in biology by
introducing undergraduate students to modern, experimental research technologies
and techniques in the study of animal systems. In improvements to laboratory
instruction of physiology, students will use Macintosh computers, fitted with
hardware/software interfaces, transducers, and signal conditioners, to function
as virtual oscilloscopes and chart recorders. Experiments based on these
technologies will encompass physiological study of the respiratory, circulatory,
muscular and nervous systems. Students will use microsurgical transplantation
and microinjection technologies in developmental biology, directed toward the
study of controls of cytodifferentiation and organogenesis in both protostomes
and deuterostomes. With the benefit of these new technologies, students will
first master the new techniques and then will be encouraged to design conduct,
and analyze the results of their own experimental procedures. These modernized
laboratory experiences will be incorporated in the new biology curriculum for
implementation in the fall of 1994 as follows: one first-year course required of
all students, both majors and non-majors; the second semester of introductory
biology required of majors; two upper-level courses in biology. The new
curriculum has at its core, experimentation and original, creative research,
with all second-year biology majors taking a laboratory-based research methods
course in preparation for advanced classes.
