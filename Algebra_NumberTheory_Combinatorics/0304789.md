This research plan is divided into three projects, each of which combines
combinatorics with cohomology and computation in some way. The first project
deals with certain systems of partial differential equations defined by a
combination of discrete convex polyhedral data and continuous parameters. These
`hypergeometric systems' provide a fertile source of examples for the more
general theory of holonomic systems, and the goal is to shed light on how their
solution spaces vary in continuous families, using the algebraic theory of local
cohomology. The second project applies a computational perspective to the
homological algebra of injective resolutions. It aims to demonstrate that
exerting sufficient combinatorial control over the maps in injective resolutions
of finitely generated modules over polynomial rings can make effective
computation and storage of these resolutions possible, even though injective
modules are themselves seemingly intractable. The final project places summands
in combinatorial formulae for certain universal cohomology classes in bijection
with components in Grobner degenerations of orbit closures for algebraic groups.
This degeneration technique should provide a geometrically positive proof of the
Buch-Fulton conjecture for quiver coefficients, which generalize the famous
Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.

Combinatorics, the study of discrete structures, arises as an organizing
principle in widely varying contexts throughout the sciences, including
mathematics, computer science, physics, and biology. Applications of
combinatorics occur not only when the original problem is itself discrete, but
frequently also when the original problem deals with continuous phenomena. For
instance, it can happen that a single type of discrete structure can be imposed
universally upon a variety of continuous systems. This kind of framework often
lends deep insight into the nature of such systems and their interconnections.
Combinatorial frameworks can also endow certain special systems with enough
order to bring previously intractable problems within grasp, conceptually or
computationally. Conversely, within many fields, understanding certain special
systems whose parameters are defined in a combinatorial context can lead to
methods applicable in general. The projects outlined here will broaden the
understanding of how discrete structures arising in these ways can control
phenomena in the areas of differential equations, homological algebra, and
algebraic geometry.
