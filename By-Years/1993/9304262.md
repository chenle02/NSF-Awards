The chemistry of rotaxanes will be pursued. Rotaxanes are supramolecules in
which a bead is threaded by a linear subunit. Bead dissociation is sterically
prevented by two bulky groups (stoppers) attached to both ends of the linear
subunit. A substantial portion of this work will be done with rotaxanes in which
cyclodextrins are used as the beads. This project will investigate the nature of
the fundamental interactions leading to self-assembly of cyclodextrin-based
ı3!rotaxanes and ı4!rotaxanes, structures with either two or three cyclodextrin
beads, respectively. In a second aspect of the work, rotaxanes will be
synthesized where the cyclodextrin bead completely encapsulates a redox-active
group. These systems will allow an evaluation of the importance of solvent
reorganization in electron transfer reactions. The third aspect of the work will
investigate the possibility of electrochemically controlling the position of an
electron acceptor bead encapsulated on a thread with two different donor
stations. %%% This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of
Professor Angel K. Kaifer at the University of Miami. Large molecular systems
will be prepared that are composed of a bead molecule which encapsulates a
linear string molecule. Bulky groups will be placed at the ends of the string to
prevent dissociation of the bead. The assembly process to form these large
molecular systems will be studied. A particular portion of the string will be
oxidized to generate a positive charge and the effect of the bead on this
process will be evaluated in the context of solvation. Control of the movement
of the bead along the string by oxidizing or reducing different stations on the
string, and thereby changing charge at these stations, will be studied.
