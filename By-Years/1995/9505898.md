9505898 Salyers DNA transfer by conjugation from bacteria to plants and from
bacteria to yeast has been demonstrated, but transfer of bacterial DNA to
mammalian cells has not been reported. The lack of evidence for DNA transfer
from bacteria to mammalian cells is probably due to the failure to look for such
events in the right way rather than to the absence of such events in nature. The
first systematic attempt to determine whether bacteria can transfer DNA to
mammalian cells under laboratory conditions is being undertaken. Since this is a
high risk project, the project is focused on a single achievable goal, whose
accomplishment will determine the feasibility of further work in this area.
Specifically, shuttle plasmids that can replicate in mammalian cells as well as
in bacteria are being constructed, and broad host range conjugal elements of
bacteria are being tested for the ability to mobilize the shuttle plasmids to
mammalian cells. %%% This Small Grant for Exploratory Research takes advantage
of the unique qualifications of this researcher to test for the possible ability
of bacterial cells to transfer genes to animal cells. If such transfer is
demonstrated, it would have important implications for genetic studies of
animals, both from an evolutionary point of view and as a new technique for the
genetic manipulation of animal cells ***
