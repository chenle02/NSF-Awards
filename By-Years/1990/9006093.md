This is a proposal for funding for a fluorometer that measures of samples over
a range of wavelengths from the visible through the mid infrared. This
instrument would complement existing absorption spectrometers. The addition of
this instrument would enhance the optical property measurement facilities and
ensure the complete characterization of materials fabricated in a department
that already has an excellent record for the measurement of physical and
chemical properties of ceramic materials. The instrument requested would enable
the measurement of luminescence of materials out to a wavelength of 16 on a
variety of sample geometries and sizes at temperatures down to 77K. In
particular, it would enhance the optical fibre fabrication program currently
being developed at the New York State College of Ceramics by allowing
comprehensive defect amd dopant analyses.
