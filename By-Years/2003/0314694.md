0314694 Coale This 3-year award to San Jose State University in California
provides support for technical services during NSF-funded programs on R/V Point
Sur, a 135' general purpose research vessel operated by Moss Landing Marine
Laboratories (MLML) as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
System research fleet. MLML will provide one shipboard technician on each cruise
of R/V Point Sur to support seagoing research projects and to maintain,
calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use
research instrumentation. In addition to these basic support functions, the
technical support group will maintain and provide an undulating towed vehicle
system for making oceanographic measurements to qualified users requiring those
services in support of their funded research programs on R/V Point Sur or other
UNOLS vessels, as schedules allow.
