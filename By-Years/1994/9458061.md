9458061 Schadler Micromechanics problems critical to the failure of composite
materials are examined. Laser Raman Spectroscopy (LRS), which can measure strain
and phase changes with 2 micron spatial resolution, and x-ray stress analysis
are the primarily tools used. Hydroxyapatite (HA), a ceramic material present in
teeth and bones, is inherently brittle and, as a man-made material, is limited
to nonstructural applications. Using LRS, the toughening of HA with zirconia is
studied and the transformation zone mapped as a function of load, exposure to
physiological solutions, and volume fraction of zirconia. Aqueous and organic
environments are known to decrease the mechanical properties of graphite/epoxy
composites. Degradation of the interface during exposure is a primary mechanism
of composite failure. LRS is employed to monitor the integrity of the interface
as a function of solvent polarity, temperature and time. In pursuit of computer-
aided instruction techniques, appropriate hardware and software will be
developed for use in polymer education. %%% This research should assist in the
development of composite systems for structural applications. ***
