This project is building a high-performance multiprocessor from commodity
desktop computer systems and off-the-shelf interconnects. Commercial Intel
Pentium workstation boards, each with attached memory, disk, and I/O, are
attached to a Paragon backplane. Communication uses a new mechanism called
virtual memory-mapped communication, which disguises interprocessor
communication as write operations to memory. The node interface maps physical
pages in the memories of individual nodes to each other, so that a write to one
mapped page results in messages to other nodes that share the mapped page. The
operating systems on the individual nodes use their ordinary virtual memory
mechanism to support virtual page mapping. In addition to this word-by-word
communication, DMA transfers are available, with control registers located in
the address space of individual processes. This allows high bandwidth
communication that maintains user-level protection. Research to be addressed in
the project includes the achievement of high-bandwith low-latency communication
between processes, the structure of an I/O system supported by the new
communication mechanism, and performance evaluation of the resulting system.
