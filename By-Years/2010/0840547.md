"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program of the Division of Chemistry will support the CAREER development plan of
Prof. Matthias Batzill of the University of South Florida. Prof. Batzill and his
research group will investigate the surface and interface properties of well
defined single crystal surfaces of doped oxides under ultra high vacuum
conditions using state of the art surface spectroscopic techniques including
photoemission, temperature programmed desorption, and scanning tunneling
microscopy. Prof. Batzill will focus his studies on three systems of great
industrial importance: Sb:SnO2 (ATO) with applications as gas sensor, oxidation
catalyst, and transparent conducting oxide electrodes; Y:ZrO2 (YSZ) with
applications in solid oxide fuel cells and as thermal barrier coatings, and
Zr:CeO2 with applications as oxygen storage materials in three way exhaust
catalysts. Drawing from concepts of materials science, solid state physics, and
surface chemistry, the project will provide excellent training opportunities to
graduate students. Prof. Batzill will also establish an outreach program that
will translate the excitement of "seeing" atoms into a hand-on learning
experience for motivated high school students and high school teachers.
