DMS 0353198&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI J Hogan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of
Arkansas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spring Lecture series 2002: Applied Harmonic
Analysis: &lt;br/&gt; Multiscale Geometric
Analysis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the 29th in
a series of spring lectures at the University of Arkansas. The main speakers are
David Donoho and Emmanuel Candes, with about 8 other major figures giving
shorter lectures. The web site for the conference
is:&lt;br/&gt;http://comp.uark.edu/~jeffh/sprlecture04.html. The subject is
extremely active and multidisciplinary, lying at the crossroads of harmonic
analysis, statistics and signal processing. For this reason, a larger than usual
audience is anticipated, and its location brings significant mathematical
activity to an area that is less visible in the US&lt;br/&gt;mathematical world.
Particular efforts have been made to attract faculty and students from
neighboring institutions, many of which have significant minority enrollment.
Lectures notes will be provided, and there will be discussions of open
problems.&lt;br/&gt;
