9634736 Magnanti This research involves the development of solution methods for
solving finite dimensional fixed point and variational inequality problems. The
goals of this project are to create and study algorithms that are able to solve
broader classes of problems than the current state-of-the-art and to accelerate
the convergence of "inefficient" algorithms. New solution methods based on a
general theory of averaging will be investigated; these include averaging
schemes with the identity map, averaging schemes with contractive maps and path
following methods, general averaging using resolvents, component-wise averaging,
and averaging relative to a potential. The investigators will apply their
results on averaging to devise efficient algorithms for the traffic assignment
problem and in computing economic equilibria. Fixed point and variational
inequality problems are pervasive in the fields of engineering, economics and
operations research. They arise in such diverse areas as differential equations,
game theory, optimization, decision analysis, and extreme value theory, to name
a few. This research holds the potential for significant advances in both the
theory and computational solution of this class of problems. It builds an
important foundation for the analysis of network equilibria. In engineering, it
should ultimately find useful applications in the design and operation of
transportation and telecommunications networks.
