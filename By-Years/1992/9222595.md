The objective of this grant is to explore midlatitude seasonal cycle and
subseasonal interactions, especially during spring and fall. Hypothesis:
seasonal transitions are analogous to laboratory flow regime transitions, i.e.,
they involve instabilities and intermittencies, and the exhibit hysteresis. The
methodology involves using EOF and harmonic analysis The PI will compare the
seasonal cycle in ECMWF global analyses for the 1980's with decade-long
simulations computed by NCAR Community Climate Model version 2 (CCM2) and by a
quasigeostrophic model. One CCM2 simulation will be forced by interannually
varying sea surface temperatures. The PI will track the time-varying position of
the midlatitude jet during spring and fall to document seasonal transition time
scales, intermittencies, and winter to summer versus summer to winter
hysteresis. The expected significance of this research is validation of the
seasonal cycle in the CCM2. If the CCM2 does not realistically model the
"climate change" that occurs during the seasonal cycle, its reliability in
simulating climate change in other contexts will be open to question. Also it is
expected that we will gain increased understanding of seasonal transition
processes.
