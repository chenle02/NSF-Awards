This award funds a project that uses three different research methods to analyze
why people donate bone marrow and how donors are matched with recipients.

The biology of the human immune system means that most people who need a marrow
donation cannot look to immediate family for a donor match. Therefore,
registering as a potential marrow donor is a largely altruistic act. Anyone who
chooses to register knows that the likely beneficiary will be a stranger. This
altruistic act comes at significant non-monetary costs; marrow donors must
undergo a painful and invasive medical procedure.

Existing theories of altruism in economics and decision science do not predict
what we observe when we look at decisions to register as a marrow donor.
International comparisons show that there are significant differences across
countries in the percentage of citizens who register. This project uses economic
theory, decision-making experiments, and international attitude surveys to
determine the causes of these differences.

The project also includes a study of global cooperation between donor
registries. Most developed countries operate some sort of national registry, so
it is relatively easy to search within a country for donor/recipient matches.
However, there are good genetic reasons to search around the globe for matches.
This is especially true for the United States, a genetically diverse country.
American citizens in need of a marrow donation may find their best matches
abroad. For this reason, global cooperation across marrow registries is
important. However, such global cooperation creates an incentive for small
homogenous countries to free ride on the investments of large diverse countries
such as the U.S. A small nation may prefer to spend little money on donor
registration, thinking that it can draw on the large US pool of potential donors
to meet citizen needs. The project will analyze the incentives for global
cooperation and develop new ideas to encourage such cooperation.
