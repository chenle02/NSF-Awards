Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computing, as a discipline, continues
to struggle with recruiting sufficient numbers of students to meet employer
demand. A variety of approaches in the introductory course have been proposed to
increase recruitment. Investigators for this project are developing a course
that uses a novel approach of having students create visual projects using the
programming language Processing. The language is built on top of Java but
provides a simplified syntax and enhanced features to support art and
multimedia. Students post their project portfolios on a social networking site
where they can view and comment on each other's work. Fundamental concepts from
the traditional CS1 course are covered with the goal of preparing students for a
traditional CS2 course. Expected results include a sketchbook-oriented text and
ancillary materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emphasis on art, as well as
computing, aims to increase recruitment and engagement of students not
previously attracted to the discipline. In particular, experience suggests women
respond well to this approach. Wide adoption is encouraged with faculty training
workshops targeted to a variety of colleges and universities. Pilot versions of
the course are being offered at a small liberal arts college as well as a
comprehensive university. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
