Artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to disrupt the way many people work,
especially adults without a college degree. On the other hand, AI is predicted
to create new job opportunities, primarily in the fields of Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Math (STEM). This project explores how more adults without
college degrees can obtain these higher-paying STEM jobs created by AI and new
technologies. Because employment is the primary way people gain social and
economic mobility in the U.S.A., the goal is to develop new, holistic
understanding about the factors that will help adults without college degrees to
overcome labor market barriers to access, participate in, and complete STEM
education and training for higher-paying jobs created by new technologies. The
results will help develop grounded solutions for institutions, organizations,
and policy makers to ensure the future of work will have more equitable societal
outcomes, particularly for groups who have largely been left behind as jobs have
transformed in the past few decades.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project pursues
this objective in three ways. First, the project uses ethnographic methods to
develop in-depth, grounded hypotheses about the organizational, social, and
behavioral factors that adults without a college degree face when trying to
obtain new STEM skills and jobs. Second, the project uses the insights from the
first part to employ field experiments testing which grounded hypotheses lead to
better organizational, individual, and employment outcomes. Third, these results
contribute to creating evidence-based curriculum and strategies that
organizations and universities can use to help people without a college degree
obtain higher-paying jobs created by AI and new
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
