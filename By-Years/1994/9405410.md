9405410 Kelso This award provides one-half the funding necessary to acquire
equipment for a magnetics laboratory to be installed and operated in the
Department of Computer, Geologic and Mathematical Sciences at Lake Superior
University. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds
necessary to acquire the equipment. The equipment consists of a high-temperature
(i.e., operated at greater than 77K) superconducting magnetometer, a thermal
demagnetizer, an alternating field demagnetizer, and a magnetic susceptibility
bridge. The new equipment is to be used primarily in the research projects and
classroom exercises of the Principal Investigator and students. These projects
will include study of the time-temperature dependence of how rocks are
magnetized in situ and application to geological problems such as the
magnetization of the oceanic lithosphere and the effect of chemical changes and
metamorphism on the magnetic properties of rocks. The Principal Investigator's
department does not offer the doctoral degree, and Lake Superior University is
eligible for the NSF Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) activity. The
Principal Investigator's research and teaching programs will involve significant
participation by undergraduate students. ***
