ABSTRACT OPP-9721347 ROMANOVSKY UNIV. ALASKA This project is designed to gather
and synthesize currently available environmental data (landscape
characteristics, meteorology, active layer and permafrost characteristics) along
the East Siberian transect through the Sakha Republic, Russia, in a GIS with the
same format as being planned in Alaska. The data will be used to calibrate
currently available numerical and analytical models at 15 to 20 sites and be
used to investigate current active layer and permafrost conditions, to scale up
the results, to investigate past active layer and permafrost conditions using
the meteorological record and temperatures in permafrost boreholes, and to
predict future (50 to 100 years) active layer and permafrost conditions using
available climatic scenarios for the region. Information on past and future
variations in the active layer and permafrost is important in assessing past and
future changes in the decomposition and storage of carbon in arctic soils which
governs the release of trace gases to the atmosphere. Thawing of permafrost will
allow plants to tap more nutrients leading to changes in the arctic ecosystems.
The proposed study is designed to integrate with existing and future research
projects in the program by providing data for use in model parameterization and
validating other model predictions.
