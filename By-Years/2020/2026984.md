Every day people have to choose between getting something immediately or getting
something even better in the future. Saving for a vacation, retirement planning,
and even working towards completing a large project all require foregoing
immediate rewards to achieve long-term goals. Psychologists, neuroscientists,
and economists have studied how people make these decisions, exploring how the
weight put on the present and the future vary across individuals and their
situations. Crises, such as the spread of COVID-19 in the United States, involve
a unique configuration of stresses that may influence the way that people think
about the present and the future. In such crises, short-term thinking can have
detrimental consequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team is exploiting a
unique and urgent opportunity to document how people’s choice between immediate
and delayed rewards changes during a crisis. In January 2020 the team collected
a large dataset on inter-temporal choice from over 3,000 participants. The
researchers are using this dataset as a baseline for examining how people shift
between long-term and short-term during the COVID-19 crisis. Heterogeneous
infection rates and remediation strategies in different regions provide an
unprecedented natural experiment for examining the impact of these factors on
how people make decisions. By collecting an equivalent dataset at multiple
points in the progress of the crisis, together with information about local
conditions and stress levels, the reseaach team can can explore how these
factors influence people’s decisions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
