Nanotechnology encompasses subjects from physics and chemistry to emerging
technologies such as photonics and biotechnology; and its market segments go
beyond the traditional electronics and materials industries, to encompass
segments as diversified as lubricants, paper manufacturing, cellulose, energy,
consumer products and the food industry. Forecasts of nanotechnology workforce
needs cite 500,000 nanotechnology technicians needed by 2020. The ATE Regional
Center, Nano-Link, will grow both an industry and education network to help meet
these workforce needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nano-Link will continue and expand
on the successes of the last six years by: providing nanoscience course content
to an expanding set of colleges supporting the introduction of nanotechnology
aware technicians into industry positions; increasing the number of multi-
disciplinary educational modules to address the growing market segments;
expanding outreach to underrepresented minorities by creating culturally
relevant educational content; and providing college faculty best practices on
interacting with industry as nanotechnology educational programs are updated and
developed. Ongoing assessment of progress towards the project's goals will help
inform the overall project evaluation, which in turn will contribute to building
the knowledge base regarding the effectiveness of the network of project
partners in achieving improvements in nanotechnology education and meeting
regional workforce needs.
