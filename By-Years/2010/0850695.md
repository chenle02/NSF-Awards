This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This award provides funding for a new Research Experiences for Undergraduate
site focused on human-centered computing at Clemson University. The objective of
the REU site is to provide talented undergraduate students genuine research
experiences through immersion into the activities of and culture of a research
lab. The project recruits students locally and nationally from undergraduate
institutions with emphasis on minority and women students. Each year 10 students
participate in on-going research being conducted in the Cybersociety Lab and the
Virtual Reality and Eye Tracking Lab. The students receive 8 weeks of intensive
training in the research areas, support from peer and faculty mentors, and
professional development opportunities.

The intellectual merit of this project lies in the potential contributions to
the field human-centered computing of the research. The project has an excellent
faculty leadership team that has an outstanding track record in advances in the
timely and important areas studied within their labs. The topics are current and
of interest to both students and the research community at large and well suited
to undergraduate exploration.

The broader impacts of the project include providing a quality research
experience to undergraduate students, particularly women and students from
underrepresented groups. The participating faculty members are committed to
including under-represented minority students in their research. Thus this
project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate students and
faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting
learning.
