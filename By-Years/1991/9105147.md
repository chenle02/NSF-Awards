Geochemical, sedimentological and paleontologic evidence from deep sea
sedimentary sequences indicates that significant changes in the ocean climate
and chemical system occurred from the late Paleocene to early Eocene. The early
Eocene climate was characterized by elevated temperatures at high latitudes and
in deep oceans, by diminished thermal gradients, and by decreased atmospheric
circulation. Moreover, the mean isotopic composition of marine carbonate dropped
by 3 part per mil. Climate models indicate that such decreases in planetary
temperature gradient must have had profound effects on continental climates.
Paleocene- Eocene climate change has been proposed as an important driving force
in the evolution of continental plants and animals. However, verification of
model results with empirical data is difficult because of the low precision of
marine-terrestrial correlations and because of a general lack of quantitative
terrestrial climate proxies. This study has two goals: 1) to correlate with
greater precision Paleocene through early Eocene marine strata to continental
sections from the Bighorn Basin, WY, and 2) to evaluate changes in mean annual
temperature and humidity in continental regions. Large scale, synchronous
perturbations in the carbon isotope composition of terrestrial carbon reservoirs
(organic matter, soil carbonates, and tooth apatite) and marine carbonates will
supply isochrons for correlation. Temperature and humidity will be determined
through oxygen isotope analysis of soil carbonates, and teeth from terrestrial
and aquatic mammals.
