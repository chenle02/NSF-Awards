This project will quantify and interpret the dependence of the spatial and
temporal characteristics of atmospheric flow regimes, focusing on events bearing
non-gaussian distributions. The work is expected to contribute to the
understanding of low-frequency atmospheric variability and changes in weather
extrema, and the sensitivity of such events to small variations in climate
forcing. A hierarchy of numerical models will be employed, ranging from a
baroclinic, quasi-geostrophic scheme to a simplified global climate model. This
novel strategy will be applied to investigate the anthropogenic forcing (such as
the doubling of carbon dioxide) on regime persistence time via probability
density functions.

This project addresses a topic likely to provide useful information on extreme
weather conditions, and how they impact the climate system. It is anticipated
that the results will be of interest to forecasting the breakdown of persistent
regimes, and be relevant to society at large for mitigating the effects of
unusual weather conditions. Statistical and diagnostic tools developed as part
of this study will be made available to the scientific community.
