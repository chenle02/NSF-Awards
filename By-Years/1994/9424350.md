DMS-9424350 Heinonen This award is to partially qupport a conference to be held
at the University of Michigan in August 1995. The focus of the conference is to
high light the important ties between complex analysis and other broad areas of
analysis that have resulted through the theory of quasiconformal mappings. Key
topics of discussion will be conformal mappings, dynamical systems, potential
theory, Tiechmuller spaces and algebraic geometry, Kleinian groups and
hyperbolic manifolds, partial differential equations, and quasiconformal and
quasiregular mappings in space. Conformal mapping is the study of mappings of
plane (and higher dimensional) domains by transformations which preserve
infinitesimal angles and orientation. The maps play central roles in the
geometric theory of analytic functions and potential theory by reducing many
questions concerning functions defined on arbitrary domains to the same
questions restricted to a class of highly symmetric domains.
