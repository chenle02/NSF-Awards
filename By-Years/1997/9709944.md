9709944 Kou This project addresses bulk crystal growth of electronic and
photonic materials by modifications to the liquid-encapsulated Czochralski
technique with emphasis on reducing dopant segregation. The approach includes
the study and introduction of a technique to achieve zone leveling for
flattening the axial dopant profile; the idea is to maintain the growth melt at
composition C0/k where C0 is the desired crystal composition, k, the segregation
coefficient, and to supply additional material of composition C0 to the melt at
the same rate as the crystal grows. %%% The project addresses basic research
issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological
relevance to electronics and photonics. The research will contribute basic
materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to bulk crystalline materials
required for fabrication of electronic/photonic devices and integrated
circuitry. Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and understanding gained from
the research is expected to contribute to improving the performance of advanced
devices and circuits by providing a better understanding and a basis for
producing improved materials, and materials combinations. An important feature
of the program is the integration of research and education through the training
of students in a research area essential to the field of electronics/photonics.
