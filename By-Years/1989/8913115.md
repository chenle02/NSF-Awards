This award will support collaborative research between Professor Vittorio Celli
of the University of Virginia and Professor Giorgio Santoro of the Universita di
Modena, Italy. The investigators intend to determine the atomic and electronic
structure of metal surfaces, and the nature of atomic motions on these surfaces.
Working in close collaboration with experimental groups in Italy and in Germany,
the researchers will provide the numerical calculations and the theoretical
developments that are needed to extract the true picture of these surfaces from
data obtained by He beam scattering and other techniques. This work will extend
their current research on the phonon spectra of well-ordered surfaces and will
continue the systematic application of the theory to new surfaces as more
experimental data becomes available. Furthermore, the researchers intend to
extend the theory of atom- surface scattering to include multi-phonon effects
and scattering from strongly anharmonic surfaces.
