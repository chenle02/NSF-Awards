9412818 DeRobertis This Americas Program award will support travel and related
expenses for ten U.S. scientists and four U.S. post-doctoral students to attend
and participate in the " International Workshop on Molecular Biology of Cell
differentiation and Embryonic Development" to be held in Santiago, Chile, on
January, 1995. The students will be full participants and present lectures on
their work. Partial support for four Latin American graduate students is also
included in this award. The workshop organizers are Dr. Edward DeRobertis,
University of California, Los Angeles, in collaboration with Dr. Jorge Allende,
University of Chile. The objective of this workshop is to strengthen
international scientific collaboration in research and to stimulate the interest
of young scientists and students in an area that has undergone dramatic advance
in recent years. The attendance of world leaders in the field and
representatives from outstanding Latin American laboratories is likely to lead
to the identification of research opportunities and closer integration of
efforts. ***
