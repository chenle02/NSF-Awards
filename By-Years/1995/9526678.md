9526678 Tajima This research is to investigate the seismic structure of the
upper mantle transition zone, from 400 to 700 km depth, which is key to
understanding the mode of convection within the Earth's mantle as well as the
chemical composition of the Earth. In this project, the plan will be to
delineate seismic structure of the transition zone associated with Japanese
subduction zones using upper mantle (triplicated P and S waveforms recorded at
regional stations. Three major issues debated recently will be considered: 1)
what velocity anomalies are associated with the subduction zones in the
transition zone; 2) whether the subducting slabs flatten at the bottom of the
transition zone or extend into the lower mantle; and 3) whether the seismic
structure derived for the upper mantle supports a model of chemical layering or
one with discontinuities due to temperature-dependent phase transitions
approximately at 410 km, and possibly at about 525 km. *** ??
