9632784 FAIRBANKS Circulation of water over Georges Bank can be described by two
modes: (1) the canonical mode, that is an anticyclonic gyre with source waters
originating in the coastal Gulf of Maine; (2) the "shunt mode" that is
characterized by direct injection of Scotian Shelf Water across the Northeast
Channel onto the south flank of Georges Bank. The primary objective of this
study is to assess the amount of biological variance explained by these two
circulation modes. The project will use the oxygen isotope tracer oxygen-18 of
the water to separate local and upstream freshwater sources and to
quantitatively estimate the percent contribution of each to Georges Bank water.
This project is a part of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studies,
Phase 2 program. ***
