This award supports a program of experiments, theory, and simulations on a range
of fundamental nonlinear processes in plasmas. The studies will focus on
problems for which precise experimental tests of theory can be obtained.
Experiments will be performed on non-neutral plasmas, plasmas that contain a
mixture of free electrons, ions, and uncharged species, using an electron trap
and an ion trap with a broad range of operating regimes and diagnostics. The
simplicity of these systems allows a depth of understanding and a precision of
comparison between theory and experiment that is rarely possible otherwise. The
award will support training of a graduate student, and results of the research
will have broader applications to natural and engineered plasma systems,
including space plasmas and fusion plasmas for power
generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is an integrated study of nonlinear
plasma processes including wave-wave interactions; particle, heat, and momentum
transport caused by applied electric and magnetic field perturbations; and
effects associated with nonlinear particle trapping in both waves and applied
fields. Ongoing experiments have observed nonlinear wave instabilities with
features that are consistent with a new kinetic particle theory of nonlinear
particle detrapping and retrapping in the wave troughs. These experiments, along
with accompanying theory and simulations, will be extended in order to consider
this trapped particle mechanism in the context of other waves, including
nonneutral ion acoustic waves in mixed H-electron plasmas, and electron acoustic
waves. New experiments on negative ion-electron nonneutral plasmas will also be
pursued, making connections to nonlinear processes of importance in quasi-
neutral plasmas and in plasmas used in anti-hydrogen production. A major focus
will be on the interplay between effects of convective fluid nonlinearity versus
kinetic trapped particle nonlinearity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
