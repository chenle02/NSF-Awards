The principal investigator studies limit theorems for independent, identically
distributed random vectors. In particular he will focus on the more tractable
case of operator- stable random vectors. He plans to characterize associated
symmetry groups of operator-stable laws. Limit theorems for sums of independent
random variables are the foundation of mathematical statistics. In more than one
dimension the corresponding analysis focuses on limit theorems for sums of
independent random vectors. The principal investigator will investigate the
specific case of the operator- stable class of probability laws.
