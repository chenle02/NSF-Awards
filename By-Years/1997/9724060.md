9724060 Giulivi Nitric oxide (NO) is a radical synthesized from the guanidino
nitrogen of L-arginine and O2 by dioxygenases called nitric oxide synthases
(NOS). Recently, immunocytochemical evidence for a protein antigenically related
to NOS was localized in mitochondria from different tissues. No reports,
however, are available on mtNOS activity, the precise role of this enzyme, or on
the mechanistic aspects of NO metabolism in mitochondria from different tissues.
It has been shown that NO (either generated chemically or pure NO gas) binds
reversibly to cytochrome oxidase, inhibiting mitochondrial O2 consumption at nM
concentrations. However, an endogenous production of NO, i.e., a continuous flux
of NO close to target molecules within the organelle, may lead to different
steady-state concentrations than those obtained by the addition of a bolus of
pure NO gas and consequently may elicit distinctive biological effects. Thus,
the presence of a NOS in mitochondria and the production of NO by mitochondria
might have important implications for energy production in a cellular setting.
The goal of this project is increasing the understanding of the production of NO
by mitochondria, along with elucidating the regulation of the process, the
physicochemical characteristics of mtNOS, and the targets of NO in mitochondria.
The production of NO by mitochondria gains significance from the modulatory
effect this molecule may have on energy metabolism, O2 consumption, and O2 free
radical production. The ubiquitous distribution of mitochondria, the
diffusibility of NO through cellular membranes, and the roles of NO as a
cellular transmitter, messenger, and regulator suggest that mitochondrial NO may
be involved in overall physiological regulation.
