Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Schlumprecht&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The author will work on
several open problems in Geometrical Functional Analysis. The first problem asks
whether or not every infinite dimensional Banach space admits a non-trivial
operator, i.e. an operator that is not a compact perturbation of a multiple of
the identity. The principal investigator proposes to explore several interesting
variations on this theme, each with a distinctly structure-theoretical flavor. A
counter example to aforementioned question would present the first example of an
infinite dimensional Banach space for which it is known that every operator on
it has an invariant subspace. Secondly, he presents an approach to the most
general formulation of the invariant subspace problem, namely: does every
adjoint operator have a nontrivial invariant subspace? The third part of the
proposal deals with quasi-greedy bases, one of the mathematical ideas that help
provide a theoretical groundwork for image compression and reconstruction and
asks for the existence of quasi-greedy bases in each Banach
space.&lt;br/&gt;Banach spaces, their geometric and topological structure, as
well as operators on them, provide a natural framework for studying dynamical
systems, differential equations, physics and multiresolution analysis. For
example, it is pointed out in the proposal how Banach space theoretical ideas
relate to the theory of image compression and reconstruction. &lt;br/&gt;
