Gromov 9732734 The investigator organizes an international conference at
Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques to study pattern formation in biology,
mathematics, and computer graphics. Collaborations will lead to new tools for
analyzing, computing, and visualizing patterns. Symmetry and structure arise
often in nature, and their presence is often betrayed by patterns.
Mathematicians, biologists, and computer scientists approach these common
problems from different perspectives. One goal of the conference is to stimulate
synergistic interchanges about these problems between these different
disciplines. The conference aims to foster a greater understanding of patterns,
their significance in biological areas, and how they can be handled
mathematically and computationally.
