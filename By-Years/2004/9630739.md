Bishop 9630739 This is an award the objective of which is to determine the
feasibility of using regenerated activated carbon, catalyst- impregnated
activated carbon and Portland cement to solidify and stabilize contaminated
soils and hazardous wastes containing potential environmental contaminants. The
regenerated carbon is derived from processes to remove contaminants from water
but which has become unsuitable for reuse in the process from which it has been
derived. The research involves determination of the extent to which the
solidification process results in the immobilization of the contaminants. The
proposal leading to this award was submitted under guidelines contained in NSF
95-111, Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison With Industry. The industrial
partners in conduct of this project are the Calgon Corporation and E.I. DuPont
de Nemours and Company. Results of this project are expected to provide the
engineering design basis for use of spent activated carbon that can no longer be
sufficiently reactivated for reuse in the process from which they were derived
to adsorb and immobilize contaminants in sludges and soil. The use of spent
activated carbon in this process provides a potential use for a large quantities
of spent activated carbon that would otherwise be managed by incineration or
placement in secure repositories for hazardous substances.
