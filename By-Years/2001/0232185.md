This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at
developing diagnostics for liquid fuel combustion systems. The proposed
instrumentation will provide a noninvasive measurement of liquid volume, surface
area and velocity within a cross-sectional plane of the dense spray. The
technique is applicable to burning and non-burning sprays and is equally
effective for spherical and non-spherical drops and particles. The proposed
device is a novel combination of ensemble laser diffraction and image
correlation velocimetry, both of which are well-developed technologies and many
practical issues concerning their implementation have been already resolved. The
goal of the project is to build a bench-top system and prove the underlying
concepts. A number of issues concerning the effectiveness of the proposed
diagnostics in the combustion environment will also be addressed.

The broad impact of this work will be commercialization of a new diagnostics
tool that may enable cleaner and more efficient liquid fuel combustion systems.
