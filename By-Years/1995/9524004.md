9417050 Delcourt Landscapes change through time due to human activity and
natural disturbances. Long-term changes in the landscape have generally been the
domain of study for paleoecologists, while ecologists have focused on more
recent characterization of landscapes. This study develops new ways to interface
ecological and paleoecological data sets. This provides a means for projecting
the impacts of future climate change and land-use change on the locations of
ecological transition zones and the overall composition of the landscape.
