Proposal Number: 0208956 Title: Formal Verification of Hybrid Systems Using
Global Optimization

The embedding of logic-based controllers in modern technological systems such
as automobiles, air and spacecraft, oil refineries and chemical processes, power
generation plants and distribution networks, etc., is ubiquitous. Such systems
are characterized by a coupling between continuous state dynamics and the
discrete state dynamics of the logic based controllers, which are simultaneously
responsible for interlock, sequencing and safety functionality. As performance
and safety demands on technological systems increase, the design of logic based
controllers encompassing all these functionalities simultaneously is
increasingly complex. Once a design has been proposed, it is highly desirable to
verify formally that the design does indeed implement all the desired
functionalities. Ideally this verification step should take into account the
continuous dynamics of the underlying technological system. This project is
developing formal verification technologies that can accommodate such hybrid
systems.

Formal verification problems for hybrid systems can in principle be formulated
and solved as mixed-integer optimization problems. However, for formal
verification purposes, it is essential to guarantee that the global solution of
the optimization problem is found in a finite number of iterations. This project
is developing novel deterministic global optimization algorithms for hybrid
systems in the continuous time domain that can provide such guarantees.
