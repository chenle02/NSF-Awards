This proposal aims to support the International Conference and Workshop on
Cluster Algebras and Related Topics, to be held in Mexico (Morelia and Mexico
City) in December 2008. These activities will be cofunded by the Algebra, Number
Theory, and Combinatorics Program and the Office of International Science and
Engineering.

Cluster algebras provide a unifying algebraic and combinatorial framework for an
impressive variety of phenomena in settings as diverse as quiver
representations, Teichmuller theory, classical and non-commutative algebraic
geometry, tropical calculus, Poisson geometry, Lie theory, and combinatorics of
fans and polytopes.

The conference and workshop bring together both young and established
researchers working on all major lines of inquiry involving cluster algebras and
objects derived from them (cluster categories, cluster varieties, quivers with
potentials, etc.), with the goal of cross-fertilization and exchange of ideas
between the different domains of application.

The conference and workshop attracted approximately 100 participants, including
a large number of young researchers, most of them from the US and Latin America.
The format of the event---a week of introductory mini-courses followed by
another week of research talks---is designed to introduce young mathematicians
into this exciting field, and facilitate exchange of ideas between established
researchers with different mathematical backgrounds.
