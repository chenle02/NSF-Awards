Optical guiding of high intensity laser pulses in a plasma waveguide is
investigated in order to develop new short wavelength sources, soft x-ray lasers
and compact laser-driven particle accelerators. The investigation offers a
practical approach to study and apply nonperturbative, laser-matter interactions
at ultrahigh intensity.
