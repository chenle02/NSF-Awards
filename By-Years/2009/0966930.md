Previously established unpublished data show that biofilm cells are more
resistant to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) than planktonic cells. The goal of
this research is to determine the fate and transport of AgNPs in a single
species biofilm system and to examine the role of AgNPs in the proliferation of
antibacterial resistance in attached growth systems. The specific objectives and
associated tasks include (1) characterizing AgNPs and examining microbially
induced particle aggregation/dissolution and determining the spatial/temporal
distribution of AgNPs in biofilms, (2) examining the spatial and temporal
variation of microbial activity within the biofilm exposed to AgNPs, and (3)
evaluating the impact of AgNPs on gene expression of the stress related genes
and antimicrobial resistance genes in biofilms. The research will use
microrespirometry, two-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscopy (2P-LSM)
and laser capture microdissection microscopy to determine bacterial activity,
AgNPs and cell activity within the biofilm, and the levels of antimicrobial
resistance gene expression at different biofilm depth, respectively. The
research will further examine particle dissolution/aggregation/transformation by
microorganisms using advanced electron microscopy (TEM/SEM/ESEM) coupled with
energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). Two bacterial species Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa will be
used for single species biofilm studies because P. aeruginosa is a well-studied
opportunistic pathogen that is commonly found in the environment to form
biofilms while E. coli is still used as the principle indicator for drinking
water pollution monitoring. Significant broader impacts involve student support.
