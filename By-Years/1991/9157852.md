Biochemical Engineering is drawing upon knowledge bases from areas such as
Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Genetics. A multidisciplinary approach to
problems in Biotechnology is most productive, and an active collaboration with
researchers in this field is to be part of this research program. Attention will
be focused on the two research topic areas of interest to the Principal
Investigator, that is, oxygen toxicity to living cells, and the metabolic
engineering of living cells.
