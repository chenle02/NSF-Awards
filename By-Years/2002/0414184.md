The nature and number of genetic changes required to form two new species from
one ancestral one is a lingering problem in evolutionary biology. A defining
feature separate species is their inability to form fertile hybrids. A pair of
Drosophila species between which a low number of fertile hybrids still form,
have been discovered. By using this pair of species, D. mojavensis and D.
arizonae, a combination of molecular and classical genetic techniques can be
used to determine how many genetic factors are responsible for the emerging
sterility and the chromosomal locations of the factors. Anthropogenic change is
fueling the loss of species at an alarming rate. While we have some
understanding of the factors that cause loss of species, our understanding of
how new species form is sorely lacking. The present study will provide important
new information about the origin of new species. At the same time, it will
advance our understanding of the genetics of sterility of male insects. Sterile
male insect techniques are an important tool in the control of economically
important insect pests.&lt;br/&gt;
