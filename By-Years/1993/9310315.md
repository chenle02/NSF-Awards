9310315 Fairweather The goal of the proposed research is to develop effective
parallel sparse linear system solvers for solving the algebraic equations
arising in the finite element discretization of elliptic and non-elliptic
coupled systems of partial differential equations. These solvers will be based
on domain and subspace decomposition methods for use in the solution of linear
and nonlinear coupled multicomponent problems, such as chemically reactive
flows. The emphasis will be on scalable, transportable algorithms.
