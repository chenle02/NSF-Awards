This project will support a comprehensive literature review to determine what
existing evidence says about the determinants of student decisions to enter
post-secondary science and enginee- ring studies. Special emphasis will be
placed on the factors that influence student selection of pre-college
preparation, the influence of gender and ethnic characteristics, and the
influence of public and private programs. Computerized bibliographic search
techniques will be used in identifying both theoretical and empirical work from
the several relevant research disciplines including education, sociology, and
economics. The project will produce an integrated overview of existing evidence,
hard-copy abstracts, and electronic abstracts for the literature reviewed. This
is the first of a series of structured literature reviews planned to provide a
comprehensive assessment of what existing evidence says about the various
factors that determine the supply and demand of scientists and engineers.
Results will improve understanding of the science and engineering labor market
pipeline and operation, identify gaps in evidence, and inform further research
relevant to science and engineering personnel decision-makers.
