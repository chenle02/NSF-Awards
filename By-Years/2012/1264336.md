Deficiency of lung surfactant causes a disease called respiratory distress
syndrome. The standard treatment of this disease involves an injection of
animal-extracted, lipid-based surfactant formulation into the patient?s lung.
However, the treatment if very expensive and there has been a long-standing
search for a more viable (synthetic) formulation. This proposal will probe
(using optical micro-viscosimetry and micro-rheology techniques) the molecular
origins of the minimum surface tension exhibited by promising biodegradable
polyesters (PLGA) , the surface pressure-area hysteresis behavior in dynamically
compressed films, and the viscoelastic properties of PLGA monolayers. If
successful, the results of this proposed research can have an important impact
on the field of materials engineering, expanding our fundamental understanding
of materials properties and dynamics of thin film polymers.
