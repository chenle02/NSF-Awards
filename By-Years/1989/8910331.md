Many organizations have found that they have high cost investments in software
systems that are vital to their operations but which they cannot adapt to their
current needs. Their ability to compete has become limited by their existing
software. Improved methodologies for re-engineering large software systems would
have major economic benefits. Typical software re-engineering tasks include: .
re-structuring a system of 'old code' to conform to modern software engineering
standards . porting from one computer, operating system, programming language or
data-base to another . enhancing a system to add major new functions The prime
focus of the research will be to define methodologies for understanding
persistent data in large transaction processing software systems. An
understanding of the purpose and utilization of the data that a system stores
for relatively long periods of time is a key to many kinds of software
modification. The principal investigator will work with a company that has
extensive practical experience in the design, construction and modification of
real-world transaction processing systems. If possible, case studies will be
made of a small number of actual re-engineering activities to clarify needs and
to evaluate the applicability of the methodologies developed. The principal
investigator is well-qualified to pursue this research and a grant is highly
recommended.
