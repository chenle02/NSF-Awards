This is a SBIR II project. The objective of the project is to provide the
community of macromolecular crystallographers with a detector-independent
software package for collecting and processing diffraction data obtained with a
variety of electronic area detectors. Under the Phase I project, a prototype
software package called POLYDET has been developed. The Phase II project will
further develop and modify POLYDET by testing it on data from the Argonne CCD
(charged coupled device) detector and other commercial and non-commercial area
detectors on conventional and storage ringe sources.
