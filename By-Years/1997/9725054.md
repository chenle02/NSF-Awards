The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Prof. Stephen Leone of the
University of Colorado at Boulder in his continuing studies of alignment and
wave packet chemical dynamics. In these experiments, he will prepare atoms in
specific excited states and probe the orbital alignment of two colliding excited
state atoms. From these studies he will measure 3- and 4- (and possibly 5-)
vector correlations. In addition, he will investigate wave packet focusing and
alignment in diatomic and polyatomic molecules using ultrafast laser techniques.
Here he plans to measure photoionization cross sections vs. internuclear
separation, select time-dependent photofragment pathways, and study polyatomic
wave packet dynamics of fluxional molecules (pseudorotation in lithium trimer
molecules, e.g.). Ultimately the objective in the field of molecular reaction
dynamics is to control and/or be able to predict the outcome of elementary
chemical processes. The experiments proposed by Leone easily satisfy both
objectives and nicely lead us into the chemistry of the next millenium when it
may become possible to manipulate routinely which products are formed in a
reaction and the states in which they are formed.
