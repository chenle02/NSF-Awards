This research is the continuation of a long-term project, begun in 1972, to
study the ecology, behavior, and demography of mantled howler monkeys. The
objectives of the study are to examine what influences density, dispersion,
reproductive success, and food selection of the monkeys. Ecological and
behavioral data will be collected on individuals living (1) in different
habitats; (2) at different population densities; and, (3) in different-sized
social groups. A comparative analysis of the results will be done to test
various hypotheses generated from sociobiological theory. One hypothesis, for
example, is "Group members share resources with relatives" more than with non-
relatives. The research is able to concentrate on individual strategies because
most of the total population of 350 howlers are uniquely marked and
identifiable. Long-term and multidisciplinary studies of marked animals can
provide valuable information on life-history variables and kinship
relationships, factors which can change over time. Many species of nonhuman
primates are either threatened or highly endangered and attempts are being make
to protect the most endangered. One powerful tool in this regard is mathematical
modeling, and models must be tested with data from long-term demographic studies
such as this one.
