Three attacks on the problem of analysis of multivariate survival functions are
to be made. First, notions of dependence and of asymmetry are to be incorporated
into familiar formulations with product limit representations. Secondly,
representations in terms of generalized cumulants of counting processes will be
investigated. Third, estimators will be constructed for censored data from a
Markov renewal process; and the prediction problem will be considered.
