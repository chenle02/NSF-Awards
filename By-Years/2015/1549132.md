This award will fund the creation of the Center for Bright Beams (CBB). CBB's
overarching research goal is to increase the intensity ("brightness") of beams
of charged particles by two orders of magnitude while decreasing the cost of key
accelerator technologies. CBB will promote significant advances in scientific
disciplines ranging from physics to chemistry to biology by enhancing the
capabilities of the accelerators essential to research in these fields. It will
conduct collaborative research with national laboratories and companies,
leveraging their diverse expertise, and will transfer technology to them. It
will help integrate the research into instruments that advance the frontiers of
knowledge in life sciences, materials science, condensed matter physics,
particle physics, and nuclear physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CBB's
industrial partners will incorporate their inventions into instruments for
manufacturing integrated circuits, producing medical radioisotopes, and
developing new pharmaceuticals. CBB will transfer their bright beam technology
to market leaders in accelerator components, electron microscopy,
photolithography, and wafer inspection. A multifaceted, integrated education
program for students comprehensively addresses the needs of students and
represents a value added by the STC. Opportunities for undergraduate under-
represented minority (URM) students in summer research programs build on
existing REU programs and will increase the number of total research positions
available for summer research. At the graduate level, the STC will offer
fellowships dedicated to URM students. CBB will prepare a diverse workforce to
address the shortage of accelerator scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three
research themes have established supporting goals: Beam Production: Develop
electron sources that increase beam brightness by two orders of magnitude. Beam
Acceleration: Develop next-generation superconducting radio frequency (SRF)
cavities that outperform today's cavities by a factor of ten in cryogenic
efficiency and by a factor of two in accelerating field strength. Beam Transport
and Storage: Develop a) beam transport systems that preserve beam brightness in
electron microscopes and in linear accelerators and b) beam optics that increase
equilibrium beam intensity in electron storage rings for light sources and for
high energy physics.
