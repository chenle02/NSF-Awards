Instrumentation : Applications of Parallel Computing in Computer Science,
Computer Engineering, and Analysis and Visualization of Massive Date Sets This
research instrumentation enables research projects in: - Applications of
Parallel Computation,- Compiler Optimization Using Integer Programming, -
Synthesis of Pipelined Hardware/Software Systems,- Analysis and Visualization of
Massive Data Sets, and - Languages, Compilers and Systems. To support the
aforementioned projects, the University of California, Davis will purchase a
symmetric multiprocessor parallel computer. All of these projects either involve
development of software for parallel computers or require the high-performance
of such a system. The methods and software developed under this project will be
available to researchers in computer science and engineering and in applications
areas such as genetics and environmental science.
