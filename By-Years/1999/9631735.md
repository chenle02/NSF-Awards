9631735 Poulson This proposal was submitted in response to the Environmental
Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry solicitation, NSF 92-6. It is being jointly
funded by the Earth Sciences Division, the Molecular and Cellular Sciences
Division, and the EPSCoR office. The proposed research will involve the use of
stable isotopes as a potential technique to investigate the sources and
processes affecting behavior of hazardous organic compounds in the subsurface.
The proposed interdisciplinary research will combine geochemical and
microbiological components in an experimental investigation of the carbon
isotope systematics of toluene, one of the five more frequently detected
groundwater contaminants at hazardous sites. the research will emphasize
fractionation accompanying processes such as adsorption, volatilization,
dissolution of a free liquid phase, and microbial degradation. Stable isotope
compositions will be monitored using gas chromatography - combustion - isotope
ratio mass spectrometry. The research may ultimately contribute to approaches
used to identify and quantify natural processes involving these organic
compounds and also to engineer remediation efforts.
