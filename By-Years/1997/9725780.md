9725780 Arrowsmith The Altyn Tagh fault in northern Tibet has unique
characteristics that make establishing its kinematic history pivotal to
understanding the evolution of the Indo-Asian collision. This feature, arguably
the largest active intracontinental strike-slip fault system on Earth, is a
focal point in both end-member models that have been proposed to describe the
mechanical behavior of continental deformation: distributed shortening and
lateral extrusion. This project involves a four year, integrated geological,
geochronological and geophysical investigation that will focus on the
determination of the magnitude, rate, and distribution of slip on the Altyn Tagh
fault at time scales between 10,000,000 years to 4 years. The principal
investigators will utilize geologic mapping and geochronology to establish
piercing points, use paleomagnetic analysis to investigate several possible
oroclinal folds along the fault, undertake a GPS survey to establish the slip
rate, slip distribution and locking depth along the fault zone, and use mapping
and cosmogenic dating of geomorphological features to establish Quaternary slip
rates. ***
