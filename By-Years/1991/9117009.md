This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative science project
between Professor Julius Rebek, Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, and Professor Kenji Koga, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences,
University of Tokyo. The project involves the investigation of catalytic proton
transfer agents for asymmetric chemical synthesis. This cooperative effort seeks
to develop the techniques and understanding of factors governing the
stereoelectronics of protonation and deprotonation. This will require a focus on
both the proton source as well as the trajectory of proton transfer. Professor
Rebek has performed extensive studies of stereoelectronic effects at carboxyl
function and the chemistry of molecular recognition. Professor Koga has a
program in asymmetric deprotonation reactions and the chemistry of lithiated
amine bases. Their collaboration in this project draws on the complementarity of
their research programs.
