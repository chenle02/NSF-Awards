An Institute for Science Education would be established that will consist of the
faculty, staff, and students from the fields of science, mathematics,
engineering, technology, and education of the University of Wisconsin-Madison
and the staff of the National Center for Improving Science Education in
Washington, DC. The Institute would invite distinguished scholars from
throughout the United States and other countries to work independent of on-going
EHR Directorate programmatic activities to examine science, mathematics,
engineering, and technology education in a comprehensive fashion. The Institute
plans to conduct long-term and short-term research projects that result in new
knowledge and meaningful syntheses of knowledge about the effectiveness of the
total education system. The goals outlined for the Institute are: to enhance the
knowledge base through improving evaluation of education models, programs, and
practices; to facilitate sharing of information about exemplary practices; to
strengthen the policy environment for education; and to increase the
effectiveness of exemplary programs and practices.
