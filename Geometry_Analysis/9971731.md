This project is concerned with Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten Floer homology
groups of oriented homology 3-spheres Y. In his earlier work on rational Yang-
Mills Floer theory the principal investigator has shown that interaction between
irreducible flat connections and the trivial connection over Y can be described
by a single integer. This integer is an invariant of the homology cobordism
class of Y, and is additive under connected sums. The invariant is positive if Y
bounds a smooth 4-manifold with non-standard negative definite intersection
form. In the first part of the project the principal investigator will study the
corresponding invariant in rational Seiberg-Witten Floer theory, which is
defined for oriented rational homology 3-spheres with a spin-c structure. The
second part will focus on the relationship between these two invariants in the
case of integral homology spheres, using PU(2) monopoles. The object of the
third part of the project will be to understand the homology cobordism
invariants arising from Yang-Mills Floer theory with mod 2 coefficients. These
invariants do not seem to have any analogues in Seiberg-Witten theory.

Broadly speaking, the principal investigator will study spaces of dimension3 and
4 using certain non-linear partial differential equations from theoretical
physics.
