In the study and analysis of building damage after an earthquake, the total
economic loss incurred in a building can be determined for various structural
types based on field data. However, little research work to date, if any, has
been accomplished to segregate economic losses among various building elements
such as structural versus nonstructural, mechanical, interior/exterior finishes
and cladding, etc. This project focuses on filling this knowledge gap by: (a)
analyzing damage patterns in actual buildings, (b) developing a detailed
classification of the types and locations of typical building damage patterns,
and (c) quantifying losses among the various subsystems of a building such as
the basic structure, exterior cladding, interior finishes, mechanical
components, and other nonstructural elements which compose the entire building
system. This research will provide a specific mechanism for differentiation and
quantification of subsystem damage patterns within the total building system.
Results anticipated will enhance our understanding and ability to retain the
proper balance between cost and risk in the seismic design of architectural
components and systems.
