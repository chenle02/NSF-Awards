Dr. Fiona Goodchild is a cognitive psychologist who is the Education Director of
the NSF Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at the University of California at
Santa Barbara. She focuses on a variety of mentoring, research and peer
networking activities that impact K-12, undergraduate and graduate students. Dr.
Goodchild has created an educational process that replicates itself and adapts
and continues to "grow" new scientists. There is ample evidence that using an
advance research laboratory environment to do this kind of education and
outreach takes a very creative and talented individual, which has been a
hallmark of Dr. Goodchild's effort.
