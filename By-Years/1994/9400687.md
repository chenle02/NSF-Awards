9400687 Wu This award supports mathematical research on problems arising from
the classical theory of complex analysis and potential theory approached from
several new points of view. The work concerns investigations into the nature of
null sets for doubling measures and related problems on quasiconformal mapping.
In particular the question of whether null sets of quasisymmetric homeomophisms
on the unit circle are invariant under bilipschitz homeomorphisms. Work will
also continue on harmonic measures for uniformly elliptic partial differential
operators. Particular emphasis will be placed on building operators on the
positive orthant by genuinely n-dimensional methods so that the support of the
corresponding harmonic measures have small Hausdorff dimensions. Effort will be
made to investigate practical ways of estimating expected lifetime for
conditional Brownian motion for domains satisfying a capacity density condition.
A new characterization of such domains is expected to result. Research in
complex analysis and potential theory focuses on problems related to real and
complex functions of several variables which satisfy certain partial
differential equations. The theory is highly geometric and methods for attacking
the many important problems are drawn from a multitude of mathematical theories
such as probability, differential geometry, differential equations and
functional analysis. ***
