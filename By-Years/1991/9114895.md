The analysis and design of structures for earthquake resistance requires
reliable estimates of the ground shaking expected at the site. Current
procedures for the evaluation of these seismic ground motion characteristics
tend to be empirical and result in estimates that are restricted to the
particular earthquake and site for which they were developed. The results of
such analyses therefore may not be suitable for general seismic response
analyses of structures. This research program addresses the task of establishing
reliable estimates for the description parameters that influence the seismic
motions at a site. The multitude of recorded earthquake data at SMART-1 (Strong
Motion Array in Taiwan-1) and the newly developed techniques for decomposing the
motions into their dominant wave components is used for this purpose. The
analysis of the dominant wave characteristics at the site for a number of
earthquakes provides a basis with which to evaluate general expressions for the
stochastic characteristics of the seismic motions (power and cross spectral
densities of the motions in three orthogonal directions, their rotational
components and their spatial variability). The development of attenuation
equations that relate the stochastic descriptions of the motions with the
earthquake and site characteristics is being explored.
