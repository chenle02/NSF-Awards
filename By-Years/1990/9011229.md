This RIA proposal is to develop techniques to combine images of the heart using
a variety of modalities: MRI, PET and CT. Combining such images is difficult
because of differences in resolution, size and orientation. The proposed
technique is novel; it uses multilayer neural networks for the image processing
tasks. If successful, this project will result in improved methods of analyzing
biomedical images, leading to potential improvements in medical diagnosis.
