The 2016 Gordon Conference on Correlated Electron Systems: New Kinds of
Electronic Order in Quantum Materials will focus on current and emergent topics
in condensed matter physics (CMP), spanning topics from frustrated magnetism to
high temperature conductivity and materials from iridates to heavy fermions. The
meeting will enable wide discussion of recent results and emergent prospects in
the areas of CMP research, covering both experimental aspects as well as the
theory, with a notion that novel approaches are needed in the theory of
correlated systems.
