9401424 Lee The research is concerned with the modeling and investigation of
solution techniques for nonlinear-objective combinatorial optimization problems.
Three basic solution techniques are to be investigated. These techniques are (1)
a combination of linearization and polyhedral methods, (2) combination of
eigenvalue bounding methods with polyhedral and Lagrangian methods, and (3)
model assessment through geometric methods. Three classes of problems are
identified as sources of problems to be used in testing the models and their
solution methods. The application areas for which the algorithms will be tested
are network design problems with inter-link costs, fixed charge facility
location problems, and experimental design problems. The outcome of this
research are the development of (1) more general methods for tightening integer
programming formulations of difficult discrete planning problems with nonlinear
objective function, (2) techniques for integrating algebraic bounding methods
for planning problems with nonlinear objective functions, and (3) general
principles for the design of branch-and-cut procedures for integer programming
based approaches for discrete planning problems with both linear and nonlinear
objective function. Other outcomes of the research will be the development of
understanding similar to those of planning problems in network design and
experimental design problems.
