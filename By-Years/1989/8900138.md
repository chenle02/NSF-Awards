This project will attempt to understand the long term (150 year) behavior of the
auroral oval, and by extension, of the solar wind by examining and analyzing
historical auroral observations. The sources of data include Greenland
meteorological observations, ship logs from polar exploration cruises, books and
articles form Arctic and Antarctic expeditions and Canadian and American
stations. The principal Investigator is the leading U.S. researcher of
historical geomagnetic effects. It is possible that the results of this study
will be useful in designing future systems, such as satellite communications
systems, that are effected by auroral phenomena. The project is jointly
supported by the Division of Polar Programs and the Division of Atmospheric
Sciences.
