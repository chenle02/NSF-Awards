This award will fund the building of two Integral Field Units for the Wisconsin-
Indiana-Yale-NOAO (WIYN) 3.5 meter telescope. These Integral Field Units will
permit a wide range of science programs to be carried out with the existing
spectrograph at the telescope. These include spectral-spatial measurements
suitable for understanding the origin of ionized gas line-widths and their
correlation with luminosity, dynamical mass, and asymmetry in nearby galaxies
and the dynamics and stellar populations in nearby galaxy cores. In addition to
these specific science programs, the instruments will be available to the entire
astronomical community and the project will also allow for student training for
development and use of spectroscopic instruments. &lt;br/&gt;
