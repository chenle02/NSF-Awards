PROJECT ABSTRACT

Iowa Lakes Community College's Infinity Scholars program is designed to unify a
diverse group of talented STEM students with academic preparation for a
successful transition to a university or the workforce. Each year, up to 30
scholarship recipients are to engage in career exploration conferences,
undergraduate research with a capstone event featuring participant research,
professional portfolio development, membership in the Iowa Academy of Science,
and a STEM Exploration Trip. Additionally, faculty mentoring and cohort study
table activities are planned to increase student retention to degree
achievement. At graduation, Iowa Lakes' Infinity Scholars are well-prepared to
become leaders and innovators in technical areas of national need. Intellectual
Merit: The program builds upon Iowa Lakes' first S-STEM program in which 144
participants maintained an average GPA of 3.50, well above the college average
of 2.76. Experienced Principal Investigators plan to expand this success through
the addition of more intensive career exploration, participation in goal-focused
cohorts, and professional networking. The Infinity Scholars program success is
to be measured against eligible, non-participant student baseline data for Iowa
Lakes and STEM degree programs in a project database.

Broader Impacts: The Infinity Scholars program is to advance learning and
discovery through participant travel, professional networking, and opportunities
for undergraduate research. Iowa Lakes' designation as the Northwest Iowa STEM
Hub is to allow program information to be quickly disseminated to gifted
students throughout the region and the state, and will be an effective means for
recruiting individuals from underrepresented groups.
