This project will fund a Ph.D. student at Big Bear Solar Observatory to
establish an automated early warning system of filament eruption. A computer
program, developed to automatically recognize the structure of filaments, will
broadcast their disappearance to researchers via electronic mail. Broadcast
information will include the time of eruption and the coordinates and size of
the filament. The student will establish a filament index based on the list of
filament eruptions recorded by the automated program. This index will account
for frequency of filament eruption, size of filament, and disk location, and
will be compared with indices of geomagnetic activity.
