One of the major questions with respect to volcanic activity in all settings is
the relationship between the geometry of magma supply at depth and the patterns
of eruption of lavas at the surface. This project is an interdisciplinary study
of Kilauea's Puna Ridge and mid-oceanic ridges. It will compare petrological,
morphological, side-scan sonar, and photographic data in order to compare magma
supply patterns and magmatic and structural organization in these two settings.
