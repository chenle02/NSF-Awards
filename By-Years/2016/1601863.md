This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of graduate students and
postdocs attending the "Nineteenth Riviere-Fabes Symposium" that will be held
from April 15-17, 2016, on the campus of the University of
Minnesota.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This annual conference, of which the 2016
meeting will be the nineteenth rendition, honors the mathematical legacies of
the late Nestor M. Riviere and Eugene B. Fabes by focusing on recent
developments in analysis, especially in the field of partial differential
equations. The 2016 program will feature four principal speakers (Andrea
Bertozzi, Fanghua Lin, Jonathon Mattingly, and Roman Vershynin), each of whom
will deliver a two-hour lecture. The program allows ample time for informal
discussion among the participants.
