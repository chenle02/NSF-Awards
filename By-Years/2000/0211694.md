This dissertation investigates how gender-based asylum policies have developed
and been administered by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). In
1995 the INS created a category of gender-specific types of persecution.
Examples of gender-based persecution are rape, sexual abuse, genital mutilation,
forced marriage, forced sterilization, and domestic violence. The United States
is one of only three nations to implement a 1991 United Nations call to
recognize gender-based persecution. The history and administration of this
policy will be investigated by interviews with INS officials, administrative
hearing officers, immigration attorneys, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs),
human rights activists, and asylum seekers. Observation of hearings and NGO
meetings will also provide information on how the policy is being implemented.
In addition, archival materials such as INS and UN documents, attorney case
files, and NGO reports will provide background information on the history of the
policy and its administration.
