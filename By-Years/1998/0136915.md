CAMDA (Critical Assessment of Microarray Data Analysis Techniques) was founded
to initiate a community-wide critical assessment of different techniques used in
analysis of microarrays. It provides a forum for a cross-section of research
looking at a common data set and applying innovative analytical techniques. The
conference aims to establish the state-of-the-art in microarray data mining, as
well as identify progress and highlight the direction for future effort. CAMDA
is a functional genomics successor of other experiments such as GASP in genome
annotation and CASP in protein structure prediction. Over 250 scientists
attended the first meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two data sets will be made
available for analysis. The conference also includes oral and poster
presentations. Abstracts will be published electronically and links will be made
for the analytical tools. Attendance of students is particularly
supported.&lt;br/&gt;
