This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project will
develop a conceptual design for a context-based reflex-controlled prosthetic
hand. This work would set the stage for full development of a dexterous
prosthetic hand in which the reflexive hand motor control would be implemented
locally on the prosthetic based on a suite of sensors, including pose,
proximity, finger-torque, and myo-electric sensors. This would free the user to
focus on higher-level functional control in a natural and intuitive way. The
research objectives of this project are (1) to select optimal kinematics,
trading off dexterity with cost, weight, and durability, (2) to develop the
reflex control algorithm, and (3) to propose a complete conceptual design that
can be further developed and tested in Phase II.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of prosthetics
for use by people with upper limb amputation and congenital birth defects.
Development of a prosthetic hand promises to improve the quality and normalcy of
life for the roughly 10,000 patients of upper-limb amputation annually in the
United States alone as well as the thousands more suffering from congenital
birth defects that leave the person without a hand. The international community
will likewise benefit as well.
