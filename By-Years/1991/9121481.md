This project involves studies of sputtered multilayer films of spin glass (SG)
materials, typically CuMn-based SG alternating with (generally thicker) layers
of a non-magnetic metal. These samples are used to study finite size effects,
critical behavior, and dimensional cross-over (3d-2d) in both static and dynamic
properties of SGs. The work also includes anisotropic superconductivity studies
when the non-magnetic metal is a superconductor. An additional effort is devoted
to investigations of 1/f noise in SG ordering, and in a mesoscopic single
crystal of a semi-magnetic semiconducting SG.
