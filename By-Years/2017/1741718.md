This conference project at the Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network
will coordinate and oversee two workshops and a series of webinars about
research on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education
for faculty from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Workshops
will focus on enhancing the ability of faculty to focus on preparing proposals
for the rigorous study and broad dissemination of the critical pedagogies and
culturally sensitive interventions that contribute to the success of HBCUs in
educating African American STEM undergraduates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
workshops will involve a minimum of 90 STEM faculty from HBCUs. Webinars for pre
and post workshop activities are expected to involve up to 500 faculty. Critical
to this capacity-building effort will be a focus on understanding the current
research context and expectations for competitive participation in STEM
education opportunities, such as proposals for the Broadening Participation
Research, EHR Core Research and Faculty Early Career Development programs
offered by the National Science Foundation. Workshops and webinars will provide
intensive training to help faculty from HBCUs to fully participate in and
contribute to national STEM education goals. This aligns with the Foundation's
strategic direction for broadening participation in STEM through innovation and
research. Project-related materials will be made available online to ensure
broad dissemination of information.
