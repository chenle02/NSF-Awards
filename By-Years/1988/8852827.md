This award provides funds to purchase equipment for the revision of a non-
medically oriented introductory microbiology course and 2 advanced electives,
microbial ecology and marine microbiology at The City College of CUNY. The
laboratory experience will be a broad one, making students more active
participants in the learning process. Wherever possible students will be
challenged to think and interpret their results. For example, they will do a
classical mating experiment with a polyauxotrophic F strain and a streptomycin
sensitive prototrophic Hfr strain. They will be asked to determine the linkage
and direction of the transfer of the genes. In the complement fixation test they
will be asked to determine which patient has antibodies against the antigen in
the test. The grantee institution is matching this NSF award with funds from
non-Federal sources.
