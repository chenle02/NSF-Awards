This proposal partially supports a workshop on stochastic programming scheduled
for October 9-10, 2004, at the University of Arizona, in conjunction with the
tri-annual conference of the Committee on Stochastic Programming of the
Mathematical Programming Society October 11-15. The idea is to leverage the
presence of leading researchers at the conference to offer a tutorial symposium
that will inform and attract Ph.D. students to the field, including overviews of
recent progress and opportunities for future research.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Stochastic programming was once so computationally challenging that
it existed only in textbooks, but recent progress has made it possible to solve
model of application scale. Methods are now used routinely in design and
financial planning activities involving major risk and uncertainty. This
progress has reinvigorated researcher interest, but the unique synthesis of
optimization and stochastic branches of operations research required to conduct
research in this area makes it difficult for Ph.D. students to enter. This
symposium will contribute to overcoming these hurdles, by exposing promising
students to several of the best minds in the field.&lt;br/&gt;
