The Power systems course and the associated laboratory are required courses for
all electrical engineering students. The effectiveness of the course depends
significantly on how the laboratory program translates the theoretical
principles of the course work to practical experiences. For the future of the
power systems curriculum, it is also important that both the course and
laboratory subject matters reflect technology trends. The increasing dependence
of power systems engineering on computer systems, control systems, and power
electronics has made it more apparent that the classical power systems
engineering program is inadequate for future power systems engineering needs. It
has become necessary to emphasize these influencing areas in the power systems
curriculum. This project blends computer, control, and power electronics
concepts and principles into the power laboratory curriculum.
