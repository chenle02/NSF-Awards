This award will support a U.S.-Mexico scientific collaboration between Professor
Juan Sanchez of the the University of Texas, Austin and Professors J. L. Moran
Lopez and F. Mejia Lira of the Physics Department of the University of San Luis
de Potosi, Mexico. The purpose of this collaboration is the characterization of
magnetic interactions and of planar defects, such as surfaces, on alloy phase
stability. Several real and model alloy systems will be investigated using the
cluster variation method of statistical mechanics, from which accurate
configurational free energies may be calculated. The collaboration builds on
previously successful efforts initiated over five years ago working on alloy
phase stability. As a result of these prior efforts, the researchers have
identified the following areas of common interest and mutual benefit: phase
equilibrium in magnetic alloys; surface phenomena in close-packed structures;
ordering phenomena in superconducting ceramics; and thermodynamics of small
metallic clusters.
