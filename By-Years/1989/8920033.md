This research program is being funded by the Organic Synthesis Program. Dr.
Fraser-Reid will explore the synthetic potential of a new method for controlling
the chemistry of the anomeric center in carbohydrates. It will provide an
important new tool for carbohydrate research. This will lead to new routes to
the complex carbohydrates that nature uses at cell surfaces as recognition
elements. During the earlier work, a serendipitous observation was made, while
synthesizing the ansa chain of Streptovaricin A, which led to a study of the
chemistry of n-pentenyl glycosides (NPGs). It was shown that halonium ion-
induced reaction of NPGs provides for specific activation of the anomeric center
enabling the hydrolysis of glycosides under neutral conditions. Coupling to
sugar alcohols afforded higher saccharides, and the fact that a C-2 ester
"disarms", while a C-2 ether "arms" the NPG, provided a ready protocol for
controlled synthesis of oligosaccharides. However, it was also found that,
depending on the inorganic source of halonium ion, the disarmed ester can be
made to react readily. Thus, NPGs offer the potential for promoter-specific
and/or substrate-specific reactions, thereby allowing great flexibility in the
assembly of complex oligosaccharides. Studies aimed at developing this
methodology will be undertaken. Pursuant to the above, it was also found that
protection of a cis-diol as a cyclic acetal causes an NPG to react more slowly
than protection as benzyl ethers. This will also be examined as an alternative
armed/disarmed strategy. A study to rationalize these various reactivities will
be undertaken and will take advantage of results of MM2 and ab initio
calculations. The reactions of NPGs have been found to eject a
(R)-1-halomethylfuran with about 80% enantiomeric excess. Ways to optimize this
value and to prepare complex furanoids, such as insect pheromones, will be
investigated.
