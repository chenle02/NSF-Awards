The "Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems Workshop" will take place on April 3--
6, 2014 in the Department of Mathematics at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill. The workshop has also received financial support from the
Department of Mathematics and the College of Arts and Sciences. The workshop
focuses on several key topics in ergodic theory: specifically ergodic theory
applied to actions of non-amenable groups and a study of Lyapunov exponents. The
keynote speaker is Professor Benjamin Weiss from Hebrew University who is an
expert in the field of ergodic theory with a research portfolio spanning over 40
years.

The NSF funding for the workshop will provide support for younger researchers
(graduate students, post-doctoral researchers and assistant professors),
especially those from under-represented groups. Young researchers are given
ample opportunities to speak, to talk and to participate in the conference
activities. This workshop also strives to have a global impact in the
mathematical community. Throughout the existence of the workshop, participants
have come from around the world. The organizers have purposefully recruited
participants and speakers from Africa and more recently from Latin America.
Additionally, the workshop will continue to serve as a successful platform of
recruitment at U.S. institutions for graduate students from developing
countries.
