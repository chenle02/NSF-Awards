----------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Animals that form
social groups are among the most successful species on the planet. Over the past
50 years, mathematical and theoretical models have improved our understanding of
some of the mechanisms favoring the origins of social behavior; however, we
still lack a clear understanding of the genetic and physiological processes
underlying variation in social behavior. This research uses halictid bees to
study the molecular and environmental processes that can lead to changes in
social structure within and between species. Halictids are an excellent model
system for these types of questions because, unlike honey or bumble bees (which
are all highly social), halictids encompass both solitary and social species.
This work focuses on a single species (Lasioglossum albipes) with remarkable
variation in sociality: bees from different populations are either solitary or
social. This project harnesses this variation to study the mechanisms underlying
changes in social behavior, and combines methods from genomics and ecology to
identify some of the key genetic and environmental mechanisms underlying changes
in social structure in this species. Comparisons with other species will be made
to determine whether the same factors underlying variation within L. albipes
also underlie variation in social behavior across bees in general. When
completed, this work will provide an in-depth assessment of some of the key
genetic and environmental components underlying social behavior. The integrative
nature of this work creates an effective platform for education and outreach,
including: (1) a collaboration with the Harvard Museum of Natural History to
produce a presentation on social insects for museum visitors, (2) online
teaching materials with activities on behavioral biology that can be
incorporated in classrooms, (3) creation of a professional development program
on animal social behavior for museum staff and (4) training of undergraduate and
graduate students.
