This award supports the participation of graduate students in the Summer
Research Conference in Statistics and Biostatistics, held in Carolina Beach,
North Carolina on June 7-10, 2015. The meeting is the 51st in a series of annual
conferences sponsored by the Southern Regional Council on Statistics (SRCOS).
Its purpose is to encourage the exchange of current research ideas in statistics
and biostatistics and to give motivation and direction to further research
progress. The conference series focuses on young researchers, providing
excellent opportunities for interaction among junior researchers and leaders in
the field. The meeting features talks on current research topics together with
dedicated time for clarification, amplification, and further informal
discussions in small groups. Under the travel support provided by this award,
students will attend and present their research in posters to be reviewed by
more experienced researchers.

The Southern Regional Council on Statistics is a consortium of statistics and
biostatistics programs in the South, stretching as far west as Texas and as far
north as Maryland. It currently has member programs at 45 universities in 15
states in the region. The 2015 Summer Research Conference in Statistics and
Biostatistics sponsored by SRCOS is particularly valuable for students and
faculty from smaller regional schools within driving distance, affording them
the opportunity to participate and interact closely with internationally-known
leaders in the field without the cost of travel to distant national or
international venues. It will strengthen the research of the statistics and
biostatistics community as a whole, and particularly in the relatively
underdeveloped southern region. More details are available at the conference web
site http://www.uncw.edu/src2015/.
