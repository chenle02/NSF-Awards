This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the
state of the art in forecasting the demand for spare and service parts, which is
typically "intermittent" and difficult to forecast. Intermittent demand is
characterized by a high percentage of zero values, interspersed with random
nonzero integer demands that often have high variance. This project moves beyond
the conventional one-item-at-a-time approach toward a new methodology based on
identifying and exploiting clusters of parts which respond to common drivers.
The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be improved demand
planning and inventory management for companies with large inventories of spare
or service parts. These are the second largest item on the balance sheets of
many companies, and spending on them amounts to roughly 8% of the U.S. Gross
Domestic Product. With so much capital invested, minimizing inventory becomes a
priority. On the other hand, with shorter cycle times and greater competition
across all sectors, maintaining sufficient inventory to meet service level
commitments is also essential. These twin pressures require accurate demand
forecasts in order to determine the inventory "sweet spot".
