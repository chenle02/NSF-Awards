The Geological and Geophysical Sciences Department is configuring and adapting
newly developed portable digital seismometers (PASSCAL) for use in a variety of
undergraduate laboratory experiences ranging from introductory laboratory to
upperclass laboratory to Junior and Senior Independent Work (thesis). Five
portable three-channel systems are being used to deploy small (&lt;500m) arrays
of geophones in one or two dimensions, and with at least one three-component
seismometer for study of shear waves. Students are using the equipment in: 1)a
local array for study of small earthquakes (active region); 2) a local linear
array for refraction or reflection studies; 3) a engineering seismology
demonstration of tomography; 4) a engineering seismology demonstration of
building resonances; and 5) seismic station operations for earthquake
monitoring. Each deployment mode is suitable for introductory labs, upperclass
labs, or upperclass research, depending on the extent to which the students are
given independent responsibility for conduct of the work.
