Phylogenetics is the branch of mathematical biology concerned with
reconstructing evolutionary relationships among species. While phylogenetic
analyses are widely used throughout the biological sciences, there remain
fundamental questions about how to reconstruct trees most effectively under a
host of increasingly complex data scenarios. This project addresses fundamental
scientific challenges in phylogenetics using a range of mathematics tools from
probability, combinatorics, and geometry. One main goal of the project will be
to develop better methods for reconstructing evolutionary histories. The project
will further develop STEM infrastructure by training graduate students in
mathematical methods in biology.

This research develops tools from probability, combinatorics, and geometry to
solve problems in phylogenetics, that area of mathematical biology concerned
with reconstructing evolutionary histories between collections of species. The
particular problems to be addressed include the development of new algorithms
for alignment free phylogenetic tree reconstruction, the study of the
distribution of maximum agreement subtrees for random trees, and the development
of geometric tools to better deploy distance-based phylogenetic algorithms. The
implementation assuming alignment free phylogenetic tree reconstruction will be
the first statistically consistent method that takes into account both
substitution and insertion/deletion processes. The project on maximum agreement
subtrees makes connections to longest increasing subsequences and related tools
from combinatorial probability. The project on distance-based methods will use
tools from polyhedral combinatorics and tropical geometry to better understand
the comparison between greedy algorithms procedures and the underlying
approximate optimization procedures.
