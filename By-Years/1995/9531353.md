An REU Site will be continued in the Physics Department of Florida International
University. Students will be recruited from the Greater Miami area and Florida,
with an emphasis on attracting those in groups presently under- represented in
physics. Approximately ten students will be accepted each summer, and each will
be involved in one of the on-going research activities of the department.
