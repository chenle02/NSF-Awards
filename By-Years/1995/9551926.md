Across the Curriculum An Integrated Sequence of Laboratory Modules The aim of
this project is to develop integrated experimental sequences that will hold the
interest of students across a number of laboratory courses. We are developing a
series of laboratory experiments, using materials chemistry as a central theme.
The students are synthesizing and characterizing organic and inorganic
materials, the syntheses being carried out in the general chemistry and organic
chemistry laboratories and the characterization of these materials are being
performed in the upper division analytical, physical, inorganic and polymer
laboratories. The ceramic material alumina is synthesized by sol-gel methods and
characterized by X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. A conjugated
polymer, capable of electro-luminescence is being prepared by condensation
polymerization in aqueous media and characterized by viscometry,
thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and luminescence
spectroscopy.
