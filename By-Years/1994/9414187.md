The growth in size and complexity of modern computers is matched by the need for
more accurate models of their internal wiring structure. The task of modeling
this complexity is ideally suited to a recent development in statistical physics
called the re- normalization group. It has the power to attack the wiring
optimization problem because it takes this one very difficult problem and breaks
it up into a very large number of much simpler problems. Rather than attempting
to attack the entire range of partitioning and placement requirements from the
transistor level to the back-plane, an optimization procedure need only be found
for a highly restricted wire length range. Once this has been derived, the
procedure is renormalized for all other length scales in a manner which
generates a system-wide solution. This project will investigate how such an
approach may be used to develop much better estimates of interconnect-limited
system performance and how this theory leads to new optimization algorithms. In
contrast to other theories the predictions made by this technique will grow ever
more accurate as the systems grow larger and more complex.
