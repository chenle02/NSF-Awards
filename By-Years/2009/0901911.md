The last few years have seen tremendous progress in the field of Geometric
Functional Analysis (also known as Asymptotic Geometric Analysis), which is the
mathematical study of geometric objects of many dimensions or many parameters.
The conference The State of Geometry and Functional Analysiwill focus on the
present achievements and future directions of Asymptotic Geometric Analysis, and
related fields.

The conference The State of Geometry and Functional Analysis will be held at
Tel-Aviv University (3 days) and at the Dead-Sea (2 days) in the last week of
June 2009. This proposal seeks funding for US participants of this conference.
The conference will be an opportunity to attract some of the leading
mathematicians of our time and also to create an environment in which students
could profit from the interaction with such top experts.
