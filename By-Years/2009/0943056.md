This project focuses on the application of collaborative virtual environments
(CVEs) used to support virtual work. A metric of the quality of a CVE is the
degree to which it creates a sense of virtual presence (a sense of "being
there") by the user. Designers of VEs consider presence to be a desirable
attribute and goal, coupled with a longstanding belief that it is related to
performance. However, there is limited empirical evidence to support these
views, particularly in relation to collaborative decision processes. The link
between presence and performance in a CVE is particularly relevant in a
corporate context because many enterprises have yet to determine if there is
sufficient return on the financial and human resource investments required to
develop or license CVEs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project first seeks to
theoretically define the foundational construct of collaborative virtual
presence (CVP). Then, via a series of team-based experiments involving two CVEs,
the project aims to develop and validate a scale to perceptually measure CVP and
correlate it to physiological data. Finally, the project aims to assess the
relationship between CVP and performance. Understanding the role of presence in
collaborative processes in CVEs is an important foundational step toward the
development of revolutionary technologies for enabling effective team
interactions that are fundamental to innovation and education.&lt;br/&gt;
