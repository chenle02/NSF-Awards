at the Santa Fe Institute. The focus of the research is the study of complex
adaptive systems in different areas of science, ranging over the biological,
social, physical, mathematical, and computational sciences. Researcher from a
number of institutions and areas of study will conduct collaborative research
both at the Santa Fe Institute and at their home institutions. In addition,
partial support will be provided for the annual Complex Systems Summer School.
