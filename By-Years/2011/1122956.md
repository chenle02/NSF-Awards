Computational thinking and creative thinking are two core competencies which are
essential for STEM students. Computational thinking provides students with
competitive skills to do well in today's increasingly data-intensive industries.
Creative thinking is flexible, imaginative, innovative thinking which draws on
all of one's skills and experience. Combining these skills in STEM curricula
strengthens their impact by expanding students' ability to solve complex, ill-
defined and interdisciplinary problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
extend an existing suite of online learning modules that introduce computational
thinking in introductory computer science courses. The enhancements will
introduce creative thinking through interactive exercises. Each module contains
a brief tutorial to introduce a topic, interactive exercises to reinforce the
concepts and a series of questions to assess student
learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assessment is partially automated by using
embedded data collection tools, online quizzes and web-based surveys. The long
term goal is to promote computational and creating thinking in a variety of STEM
disciplines.
