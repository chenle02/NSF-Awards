This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
Program, is concerned with elucidation of the mechanisms of excited state
relaxation in square planar, four- coordinate complexes of platinum(II) and
copper(II). The work is based upon earlier observations that the lifetimes of
excited states of such compounds are strongly affected by secondary interactions
of the complexes with their environments. As a result they have potential as
molecular probes and sensors. Specific studies will include characterization of
the photochemistry of platinum(II) terpyridine and copper(II) porphyrin
complexes both in fluid media and intercalated into DNA, and attempts to
increase the excited state lifetimes of the former complexes by modification of
the terpyridine ligand through substitution. Techniques to be employed will
include luminescence, absorption and CD spectroscopies in conjunction with
quenching reactions and temperature dependent measurements. Absorption of
electromagnetic radiation generates excited electronic states that may revert
(relax) to the ground state by non-irradiative (heat generating) or irradiative
(emission of light) pathways. A great deal of information can be obtained about
the electronic structure of compounds that undergo irradiative relaxation by
studies of their emission spectra. Irradiative relaxation can be highly
dependent upon the environment in which the molecule resides and under favorable
circumstances the observation of an emission spectrum can be used as a probe of
the molecular environment. This project has as its major objective the
development of a better understanding of the ways in which relaxation of excited
states of certain transition metal compounds occur and how these are determined
by the molecular environment. There are many potential applications in a number
of areas including photosensors, photodynamic cancer therapy, and molecular
electronics.
