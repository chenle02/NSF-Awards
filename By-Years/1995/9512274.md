This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at SUNY Binghamton acquire a time-domain electron
paramagnetic resonance spectrometer (TD-EPR). The research activity to be
supported includes: (1) room- and low- temperature TD detection of short-lived
excited states and electron transfer intermediates in surface
photoelectrophotochemistry, (2) TD-EPR at low temperatures to detect
paramagnetic photoexcited states of CH-bond activating carbonyl complexes and
SS-EPR studies of Cubenzimidazole complexes in microelectronics, (3) SS-EPR of
bis- ethylenedithiolotetrathiofulvalenes, etc. and varaible temperature TD-EPR
of spin relaxation to characterize conductivity-relevant phenomena, (4) TD- and
SS EPR of transition metal impregnation of solid-state materials for storage
battery development, (5) EPR of carbenes in cyclodextrins and zeolites, (6) SS-
and TD-EPR in solution and frozen solution of intermediates in tetraphenylborate
photochemistry, (7) temperature dependence of TD-EPR T2's in spin probe models
to characterize reactant molecular motion in zeolites, clays, porous silicas and
carbonaceous materials, TD-EPR spin relaxation of natural free radicals in
carbonaceous materials to characterize radical motions and interactions. An
electron paramagnetic resonance (ER) spectrometer is an instrument used to
obtain information about the molecular and electronic structure of molecules. It
may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals
which are often essential for the initiation of tumor growth and/or a variety of
chemical reactions.
