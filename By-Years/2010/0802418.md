The National Center for Telecommunications Technology builds on its regional
partnerships to develop an Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
Community of Practice (CoP) - bringing together an expanding group of academic
and industry experts who are interested in creating a quality and industry
relevant education for students in ICT enabled curricula. The CoP is a means to
engage quality subject matter experts with faculty to keep the content and
pedagogy of courses current and to quickly share and disseminate the insights
nationally. Semi-annual conferences, blogs, webinars and podcasts provide
opportunities for faculty professional growth. The CoP develops and validates
ICT skill standards and curricula and provides an interactive workspace and
dynamic library to make them available to others. The capacity of the present
consortium of 14 regional partners working with 70 industries is to be expanded.
The CoP also encourages participation by students and faculty underrepresented
in the telecommunications field.
