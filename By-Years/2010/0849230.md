Light is one of the most important environmental factors influencing plant
development, controlling seed germination, growth, greening, and many other
plant developmental processes in addition to driving photosynthesis. A central
question in plant science concerns how, at the cellular level, the plant
responds to light? Certain proteins are known to act as light receptors while
others act as inhibitors of light responses. In darkness these proteins are kept
separate within the cell but, upon illumination, arrive at the same destination,
the nucleus. The receptor proximity somehow destroys the inhibitor through the
action of a third, previously unidentified, mediator protein. This research
seeks to clarify the identity of the mediator and investigate how it influences
the stability of the inhibitor. It is anticipated that isolating the inhibitor
protein from plant cells engineered to possess greater than usual amounts of the
inhibitor protein, and exposed to light, will simultaneously isolate the
mediator protein due to their affinity for one another while the converse will
also be true. These in vivo protein-protein interactions will be demonstrated
using antibodies against both proteins. This interaction will also be visualized
using fluorescently tagged inhibitor and mediator proteins that are visible only
when the inhibitor and mediator proteins are in physical contact. Visible signal
should be generated only following exposure of the plant cells to light and this
signal should then attenuate over time as the inhibitor is destroyed. A post-
doctoral collaborator will be supported by this award as they spearhead efforts
to elucidate this facet of the plant response to light. A greater understanding
of light perception at the cellular level should provide opportunities to
engineer crop plants for faster germination, greater stand establishment in the
field, and potentiate the alteration of plant stature and structure. &lt;br/&gt;
