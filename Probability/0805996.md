A classic example of a discrete combinatorial structure is a graph, and graph
theory, including its enumerative aspect, is one of the most developed parts of
combinatorics. Back in the sixties, in a series of pioneering papers Erdos and
Renyi created what is now known as random graphs theory, a fast growing research
area remarkable for fruitful interplay of enumerative combinatorics and modern
probabilistic models and techniques. While Erdos-Renyi random graph process is
based on assumption that a new edge location is chosen uniformly at random, it
has been recognized that in some applications (internet networks) a more
realistic assumption is of a bias toward more "popular" vertices (nodes), a so-
called preferential attachment hypothesis. The proponent has proved that in this
counterpart of the E-R process the random graph undergoes a rapid
transformation, from a sea of small components (clusters) to a giant cluster in
a sea of small clusters. The proponent plans to study the subsequent phases of
the graph process, such as formation of a k-core, and the moment the graph first
becomes connected. The proponent will study vertex and edge percolation
processes on random graphs with a given degree distribution, and solvability of
the random Boolean equations based on his previous studies of the E-R process at
the critical stage. The program includes joint research with Alan Frieze
("mixing" time of a random walk on an incipient giant component of the E-R
graph), and Nick Wormald (directed version of the E-R process). Among other
problems are (i) a detailed asymptotic study of the expected coalescing time for
a "m balls into n boxes" combinatorial scheme, motivated by problems in
population genetics ("most recent common ancestor")and computer science
("coupling-from-the past" algorithm by Propp and Wilson);(ii) enumerative-
probabilistic study of "sorting networks"; (iii) probabilistic study of "hard-
to-solve" combinatorial problems, such as integer partitioning problem and a
k-SAT problem, on satisfiability of a random Boolean function with clauses of
length k > 2.

Importantly, besides its intrinsic mathematical value, the proposed research
program is motivated by problems arising in related areas of operations research
(two-sided labor markets), probabilistic modeling of growing information
networks, percolation processes in statistical physics, and average case
analysis of combinatorial algorithms. Some of these problems seem particularly
suitable as research topics for the proponent's partnerships with PhD students.
The past beneficiaries of such a collaboration were Adam Hammett and Craig
Lennon who successfully defended their PhD theses on problems from the program
funded by the NSF in 2004&#8722;2007. The proponent is confident that systematic
interaction with his current students, John McSweeney and Jia Yeum, will lead to
solving two problems included in the proposed program, one on the expected
coalescing time for the allocation model,and another on probability of
solvability of the random equations.
