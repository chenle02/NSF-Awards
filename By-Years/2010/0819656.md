This symposium explores the role of creativity in scientific discovery and how
computational tools help us understand and increase scientific creativity. The
symposium brings together researchers from a number of disciplines, who study
science and creativity from different perspectives but who share a commitment to
the computational metaphor. In addition to fostering interdisciplinary
discussions, the participants in the symposium address the following questions
at the intersection of creativity and scientific reasoning. &lt;br/&gt;- What
role does creativity play in different facets of the scientific enterprise, and
how can computational tools help in each context? &lt;br/&gt;- When does
scientific creativity manifest as a systematic search through a problem space
and when does it involve altering the problem representation? &lt;br/&gt;- When
does background knowledge aid creativity in science and when does it interfere
with the discovery of creative solutions? &lt;br/&gt;- How should we structure
computational discovery aids to encourage scientific creativity? &lt;br/&gt;-
What is the appropriate tradeoff between constraints and flexibility in
creativity-support tools? &lt;br/&gt;- When do interactions among scientists
increase creativity and how can computational aids for interaction support this
process? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
