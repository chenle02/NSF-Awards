9403071 Diver Dr. Steven T. Diver has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Diver received his doctoral degree from the
University of Wisconsin-Madison under the supervision of Professor Edwin Vedejs.
Dr. Diver will continue research at Harvard University under the sponsorship of
Professor Stuart Schreiber. His postdoctoral research will target the total
synthesis of resinaferatoxin. In the course of the work he will develop skills
in 2D-NMR, flow cytometry, gel electrophoresis, protein separation and
purification and radioisotope labelling. Longer term he will study the
stabilization of DNA-topoisomerase II "cleavable complex" by UCT4B. This
research, important to the understanding of why DNA double strands break, will
require the total synthesis of UCT4B as well as some analogs. The Postdoctoral
Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching. ***
