9313751 Newman Partial nucleotide sequence information will be obtained for
approximately 36,000 randomly selected anonymous cDNA clones from Arabidopsis.
The clones will be from a normalized library constructed from mRNA representing
leaves, roots, etiolated seedlings and shoots (stems, flowers and developing
seeds). Approximately 450 base pairs will be obtained from the 5' end of each
cDNA clone by automated sequencing. It is estimated that this will provide
partial sequence information for 85% of the genes in Arabidopsis. The sequence
information will be deposited on a regular basis in a public access computer
database. ***
