Galaxy clusters are the largest self-gravitating structures in the universe,
sometimes containing thousands of galaxies. On the largest scales, matter in the
universe - galaxies, gas and dark matter - is distributed in a vast cosmic web
of interconnecting filaments. Galaxy clusters are believed to form at the
intersection of these filaments through accretion – gas funneled through the
filaments onto the cluster – or through mergers of smaller galaxy clusters. A
team from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, will use high resolution
computer simulations to better understand observational signatures of merging
and other dynamical events on the intracluster medium (ICM). Such features
include shocks, turbulence, and cold fronts. In addition, they will carry out
high resolution simulations of the effect of radio jets – jets of plasma emitted
from black holes that reside in the centers of galaxies – on the ICM. The
Principal Investigator (PI) will continue training students in high performance
computing and will create videos to be used by the the Bell Museum of Natural
History and Planetarium. In addition, he will continue his work with the Radio
Galaxy Zoo citizen science project. The proposal includes a collaboration with
the Hewlett Packard Enterprise High Performance Computing
Team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aims of this project include; applying novel
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to better understand the interaction of
radio jets and the ICM; modeling the physics of non-thermal particle transport
and acceleration needed for reliable links between non-thermal, cosmic ray
emissions and ICM dynamics; conducting cosmological, MHD cluster assembly
simulations in order to better relate observed ICM structures to the dynamical
state and history of a given cluster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
