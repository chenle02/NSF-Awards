In Dabob Bay, Washington, the annual cycles of phytoplankton standing stock and
production rate exhibit spectacular increases (phytoplankton blooms) in the
spring and the autumn, indicating a lack of control by the grazer populations.
Yet virtually all of the phytoplankton production is ultimately consumed by
grazers. Dr. Frost has developed a conceptual model hypothesizing the identities
of the micro- and macro-zooplankton grazer species and postulating a mechanism
for the annual balance between phytoplankton growth and grazing. This research
will field test the hypothetical model. The seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton
standing stock and production rates will be established during four extended
cruises and budgets of chlorophyll and carbon will be constructed. Grazing rates
will be experimentally measured in the field.
