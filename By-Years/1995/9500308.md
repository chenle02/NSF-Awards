9500308 Voiculescu Free independence , the noncommutative independence based on
free products instead of tensor products and the corresponding free probability
theory will be used to study the type II factors of free groups . This will
especially involve free entropy, free harmonic analysis and asymptotic random
matrix models. Other problems considered , will be in the hyperfinite context
and will be about the approximation approach to dynamical entropy (as a non-
commutative substitute for Mc Millans theorem ) and the role of the Macaev ideal
in the connection between entropy and perturbations of operators . Operators are
infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices. There is a natural
multiplication and addition of operators and, consequently, some collections of
operators can be considered as mathematical structures called operator algebras.
This project involves the interface between these non-commutative operator
algebras and concepts from an emerging field of non-commutative probability
theory. Further connections between operator algebras and invariants that arise
in dynamical systems will be investigated. ***
