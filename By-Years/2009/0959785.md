This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This Major Research Instrumentation-Recovery and Reinvestment (MRI-R2) award
funds a set of plant growth chambers for Wilkes University. The chambers can be
set for different temperatures, humidity, photoperiods and CO2 levels, and will
have a direct impact on the research of faculty and will also see extensive use
in several courses. The chambers will support research in screening Arabidopsis
mutants with DNA insertions in non-coding RNAs recently identified by high-
throughput sequencing. The ability to screen for altered responses to
temperature, photoperiod, CO2 or other factors in parallel rather than in series
will greatly speed the research. Other studies will focus on both rare native
and invasive plant species, as well as revegetation of abandoned minelands, so
the ability to evaluate the effects of altered temperature and other
environmental factors on these species will greatly enhance the studies. The
ability to compare the growth of plants under a variety of conditions will also
enhance several courses, including the second semester of introductory biology
and upper-levels including plant physiology, plant form and function, and
ecology. It will also enhance the opportunities for independent and senior
research projects. The ability to conduct more sophisticated plant research in
sub-disciplines ranging from molecular biology to physiology and ecology will
improve the training of Wilkes students and enhance the appeal of plant biology
to the Wilkes student body. Acquisition of this equipment will also enhance
interest in plant biology at the local community college and strengthen the
collaboration with this college to recruit minority students into the program by
providing them with opportunities to participate in workshops and research at
Wilkes. Finally, it will enhance interest in plant biology in local high
schools, since Wilkes has outreach programs with local high schools, some of
which provide opportunity for students to be directly involved in research
projects at the University. Data produced from these activities will be
disseminated through peer-reviewed journal publications, and by student and
faculty presentations at regional and national meetings.
