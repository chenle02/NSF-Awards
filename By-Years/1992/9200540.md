In Phase I both total optical isolation and efficient guide to guide coupling
were accomplished for the first time in silicon. Based upon these achievements,
parallel arrays of electronically phase-modulated waveguide structures will be
fabricated in Phase II, configured to spatially dissect an incident coherent
planar waveform, and used to rotate the output light-beam through constructive
interference effects in the far field. A two dimensional array of phase-control
channels would allow scanning the beam over the entire image plane. Initial
efforts will be focused on fabrication and testing of a one dimensional,
horizontal array of rigid waveguides placed over a single buried SiO2 layer;
this device has potential as an Optical Spectrum Analyzer for de-multiplexing
sets of nominally 1.3 um laser signals running simultaneously in a single fiber
communication system. Later, a double buried SIMOX structure with two silicon
cores will be constructed to demonstrate the highly novel concept of vertical
beam steering. Integration of the two sets of guides into a two dimensional
structure will allow rapid agile steering in both directions.
