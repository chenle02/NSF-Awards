Planning activities towards establishing of an independent research center in
the area of fast switching devices will be undertaken. In particular, two-
dimensional modulation doped pseudomorphic hetrostructures as very attractive
candidates for fast switches will be analyzed and designed. Appropriate
laboratory and computing facilities shall be utilized.
