Ordinal categorical data occur extensively in medical diagnostic tests, and
attitudinal surveys. Investigation will be carried out on fitting the Rasch
model which describe these types of data well. The work will provide an unified
structure for analyzing sociological data. A study of the properties of the
estimators using geometric analysis is expected to yield insightful results. A
computer code will also be developed to facilitate the numerical fitting.
