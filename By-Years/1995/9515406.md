Authorship is central to the recognition and reward system of science, yet the
meaning of authorship has changed profoundly as science has changed from the
avocation of individuals to a professional occupation characterized by
increasing collaboration. Indeed, in some fields, such as experimental high-
energy physics or fusion research, papers may be routinely authored by dozens of
researchers. The goal of this conference is to analyze patterns of change in
scientific authorship by examining different institutional structures,
disciplinary practices, genres of scientific literature, socio-political
contexts, techniques of communication, and patterns of organization and
responsibility. It is important and timely, as authorship lies at the core of
contemporary concerns about intellectual property and scientific misconduct.
Further, the advent of electronic publishing will pose a further challenge to
conventional notions of authorship. The proposed conference would draw together
leading scholars in science studies to present papers on various facets of this
topic and to participate in extensive, open discussion of emerging issues. The
conference has already attracted partial support from the Mellon Foundation and
from the host institution, Harvard University.
