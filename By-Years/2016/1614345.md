This study seeks to improve our understanding of the interaction of weak wind
flow in the lowest layer of the atmosphere and generation of turbulence in
gently sloping terrain. An improved understanding of weak-wind boundary layers
could potentially lead to more accurate modeling of the formation of cold pools,
damaging frost (including impact to local vineyards), fog formation, and
dispersion of contaminants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study seeks to
investigate weak-wind boundary layers using detailed spatial-temporal
measurements. These boundary layers demonstrate non-stationarity and the
turbulence in them is generally in a non-equilibrium state with the mean flow.
Previous studies of such boundary layers were mostly limited to temporal data at
fixed locations, and therefore could not take into account hysteresis when
investigating scaling properties. This study analyzes detailed spatial-temporal
data to form a more complete picture of boundary layer structures. The evolution
of the structures and the impact of the sub-mesoscale motions will be
investigated.
