This research is focussed on an aircraft experiment to be carried out as part
of the FIRE phase II intensive field observational program that is planned for
the November/December 1991 time frame in Kansas. The primary platform for the
proposed research is the NCAR Sabreliner aircraft equipped with radiation,
microphysics, air motion and flight level meteorological sensors. New radiation
instruments will be installed on the Sabreliner both to obtain spectrally
detailed information about solar radiation and more accurate broadband flux
measurements. The ultimate goal of this research is to incorporate new
observational results into numerical models of cirrus cloud that vary in scale
of interest and complexity with the ultimate purpose of testing
parameterizations of cirrus for use in large scale climate models. This research
is important because it addresses questions relevant to issues of global climate
change.
