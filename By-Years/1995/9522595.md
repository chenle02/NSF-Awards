This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at CUNY-City College acquire a Digital
Equipment Corporation Supermini Computer. This equipment will enhance research
in a number of areas including the following: 1. compute properties of molecules
on a variety of non-biological surfaces, 2. molecular modeling using Gaussian 92
or its updated versions to interpret SERS Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy
data, 3. semi-empirical theoretical approaches to interpreting spectroscopic
data on small molecules interacting with proteins, 4. Monte Carlo simulations on
water in pores, with biological and non-biological applications, 5. molecular
mechanics and numerical electric field calculations to understand the behavior
of small molecules in a binding site, and 6. detailed quantum mechanical
electronic structure calculations to interpret data on small metal clusters. A
workstation of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the
computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a computer network also serves as
a developmental environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides
state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities and supports research in
state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing. f8 Û-ª þ + Ûª? ÑOh ª'
