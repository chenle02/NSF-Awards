Brassinolide is a steroid found in many plants. It stimulates the growth of a
wide variety of crops, including rice, wheat, beans, potatoes, radishes, and
lettuce. However, the use of brassinolide or an analog to improve crop
production has been hindered by a lack of readily available materials.
Furthermore, the lack of radioactive brassinolide has also hindered research
towards understanding the biochemical mechanism of its action and the
development of new uses for the compound. The present proposal is based on the
procedure for synthesizing brassinolide designed by Dr. Trevor McMorris. The
specific objectives are: 1) improve the synthetic procedure, 2) prepare gram
quantities of brassinolide and 3) demonstrate the synthesis of radioactive
brassinolide. An inexpensive brassinolide has excellent potential as a growth
promoter for high value vegetable crops and certain field crops.
