A conference on environmental engineering education is conducted. The focal
issues of this conference include the integration of air, water, and land
considerations in the practice of environmental engineering; the increasing role
of computers in education, engineering practice, and research; and the
incorporation of matters relating to design and operation of environmental
engineering facilities and systems into education and associated research. The
conference has been planned jointly by the Association of Environmental
Engineering Professors and the American Academy of Environmental Engineers and
is the fifth in a series initiated in 1960.
