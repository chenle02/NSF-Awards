0136546/Tandon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will compute the diapycnal
fluxes due to surface mixed-layer processes in the Southern Ocean. The resulting
fluxes are important inputs needed for such applications as the estimation of
the three-dimensional circulation of the Southern ocean using inverse box models
and hydrographic data. The approach that will be used is to force a mixed-layer
model with surface flux fields with high temporal resolution, obtained from
meteorological analysis products. This model will be used to determine mixed-
layer buoyancy, depth and entrainment rates. These properties, when combined
with buoyancy gradients determined from hydrographic data, can be used to
determine the diapycnal flux across the base of the mixed layer associated with
deepening and small-scale mixing. The diapycnal flux associated with stirring by
mesoscale eddies will also be estimated and a net diapycnal flux determined. At
present, there is significant uncertainty about the size of upper-ocean
diapycnal fluxes in the Southern Ocean. It is anticipated that more robust
estimates of these fluxes and their variability will enable investigators to
gain a much clearer picture of the lateral and overturning circulation in the
Southern Ocean from data collected during the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
