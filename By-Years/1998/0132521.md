The objectives of this multi-campus research Center are 1) to explore, conduct
research and to bring about innovation and practical solutions by focusing on
the industrially relevant research needs; 2) to foster collaborative research
projects between industrial and academic engineers and scientists; and 3) to
promote interdisciplinary and intra-university research activities and to
nurture students through testbed and collaborative
projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center proposed four key program areas,
namely 1) production equipment e-monitoring and e-maintenance systems; 2) web-
enabled industrial systems management and optimization program; 3) smart
business to devices technologies program; and 4) web-enabled development tools
for e-maintenance application systems&lt;br/&gt;
