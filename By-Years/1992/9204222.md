This proposal requests funds for an Environmental SEM (ESEM) for the Cornell
Materials Science Center (MSC) Electron Microscope Facility. This instrument
provides the special ability to observe a sample in gas atmospheres with typical
pressure between about 1 to 20 Torr while the electron gun remains at high
vacuum. This instrument will enable the Cornell materials community to perform
research requiring the in-situ observation of samples during the experiments
with environments having well controlled temperature and gas atmosphere. The
research projects currently planned to use this SEM involve different materials
such as ceramics, electronic materials, metals, and polymers. This instrument
will be maintained by the MSC and made available to all interested users.
