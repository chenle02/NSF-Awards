This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has two primary
objectives: to continue the research and development of clustered software radio
technology begun in the Phase I project, and to use that technology to extend
current waveform implementations to a fully functional base station. A high
impact application of clustered software radio is for cellular telephone base
stations, changing them from fixed hardware devices into flexible software
devices that can support multiple commercial standards and also public safety
needs. This Phase II project will develop a clustered software radio base
station that interoperates with commercial GSM mobile units and switching
centers. The goal is a base station sufficiently functional to be deployed in a
field trial, which is the necessary next step in commercializing the technology.
The project will include innovative technology development in timing control,
wideband synthesis, and intra-cluster data transport.

In the telecommunications industry, many foresee that base stations for third-
generation wireless systems will be software radios or software-defined radios.
The development of clustered software radio technology by Vanu, Inc. for this
market will improve interoperability, improve service to underserved rural
areas, enable more efficient use of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum, provide
substantial public safety benefits, and increase the pace of technological
innovation in the wireless communication marketplace. Moreover, the firm's
computing architecture has broad application to signal processing problems
outside the wireless industry.
