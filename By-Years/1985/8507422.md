Research is performed on an innovative modification of a process for removing
substances of pollutional significance from water and wastewater. Granulated
activated carbon in fixed beds has been shown to be effective in removing
organic substances. Prior modifications of this concept have included pulsing
the beds of carbon and suspending the granulated material in reactors. In this
modification, the investigators plan to investigate the comparative performance
of carbon in fixed beds and in a semi-fluidized physical state. They plan to
develop a mathematical model that can be utilized in engineering design based on
theoretical considerations, and compare the predicted performance of the process
to that observed in the laboratory.
