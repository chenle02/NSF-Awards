This grant supports a program of experimental research in nuclear physics by a
group at George Washington University. Experiments are carried out at NIKHEF,
LAMPF, Saclay. Detector development for the experiments already under way has
been done on-campus at George Washington University, and additional development
work is supported under this grant for detectors for use at CEBAF.
