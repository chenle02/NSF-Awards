The National Academy of Engineering has classified widespread electrification as
one of the greatest engineering achievements of the 20th century, but a 2006
study estimated that the national annual cost of power interruptions was about
$79 billion dollars. The power flow equations are at the heart of all tools used
by power system engineers to maintain reliable, economically operated power
systems. These equations have variability, and our team of engineers and
mathematicians will address in this project how this affects their solutions.

These equations model the nonlinear relationship between voltages and active and
reactive power injections in a power system and can be represented by
multivariate quadratics. The goal now is to introduce uncertainty into the
coefficients of the polynomials (the susceptances) and to investigate how their
number of real solutions varies, bound it, and obtain practical algorithms for
finding all these solutions under that uncertainty. The distribution of numbers
of real solutions is known for general polynomial systems under assumptions such
as that the coefficients are iid Gaussian but the power flow systems appear to
have fewer real solutions than those results would predict. The group intends to
generalize this work to our special systems, understand the phenomena, and then
apply them to actual power systems.
