Flooding caused by torrential rains is one of the most severe meteorological
natural hazards that effects almost all countries. In order to facilitate
international exchange of information, the World Meteorological Organization in
conjunction with the State Meteorological Administration (PRC), the American
Meteorological Society, the Japanese Meteorological Society and others, will
host an International Symposium on Torrential Rains and Floods in the PRC. Under
this grant, travel support will be provided for US university scientists who
will be joined by other US participants from Federal Agencies such as NOAA,
NASA, USGS and FEMA. The Symposium will be a unique opportunity to bring
together scientists, operational forecasters and emergency management officials
from various countries.
