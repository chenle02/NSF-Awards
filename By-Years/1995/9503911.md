9503911 McNamara This project connects Fremont Newark Community College District
to the Internet. This connection provides faculty and staff access to the
resources available on the Internet (including, but not limited to e-mail and
educational LISTSERV discussion groups) and provide students access to the
resources available on the Internet. These connections provide operations
management and information services and give the college a 56 thousand bits per
second connection to the Internet. The benefits of this connection include
e-mail between local and remote researchers and educators, file transfer
capability and the ability to use remote computer resources. Also the college
obtains the ability to investigate innovation in educational resources and
incorporate them into their curricula.
