This project will enable the Bureau of the Census to perform a response
evaluation of a sample of approximately 100 respondents to the annual NSF Survey
of Industrial Research and Development. The Bureau of the Census proposes to
interview the industry officials who complete the annual questionnaires so that
the companies' data can be reported more completely and consistently. In
addition, information acquired in this project will allow NSF to evaluate the
current survey instrument and improve it and its instructions. As a result,
survey responses from all companies should be more complete and consistent in
future years. The survey, a vital element in NSF's efforts to measure scientific
and technological activities in industry, collects data on dollar volume of
research and development, sources of financing, employment of R&D scientists and
engineers, and other economic characteristics of industrial performance. The
survey data provide policy makers with a broad range of statistical information
for industrial research and development spending and employment. Therefore, the
Foundation desires to maintain, through this response evaluation, the high
quality of the data collected and tabulated in the survey.
