The quality of undergraduate engineering education at this institution is
improved through the acquisition of state-of-the-art Computer Integrated
Manufacturing (CIM) equipment. An already existing CIM laboratory is enhanced
through the addition of a pneumatic robot, an automated storage and retrieval
system, loop conveyor, programmable conveyor, CNC mill, servo robot controler,
vision system, bar code reader, computer interfaces and associated software.
This enhanced laboratory permits the teaching of CNC machine programming,
application of vision in manufacturing, principles of programmable logic
controllers, integration of materials handling in manufacturing, local area
networking, and human aspects of automated manufacturing. This award is being
matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
