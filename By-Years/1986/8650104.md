This project will create a student workbook and teacher's guide that will enable
ninth and tenth grade teachers to incorporate science fiction films into their
teaching of general science. Begun in 1984 with NSF support, the teacher's guide
provides an analysis of science fiction films with respect to physical
principles that are either illustrated or violated in the films. The current
project will improve this guide in preparation for publication and will develop
accompanying student materials. The potential use of science fiction films in
science classrooms is enhanced by the availability of many of the films on
videotape and by the wide availability of videocassette players both in the
schools and in homes. Preliminary evidence suggests that student attitudes
toward science are affected positively by use of the materials and that
students' motivation to continue studying science is increased.
