The goal of this research is to develop a method for producing composite
coatings with strong compositional gradients. Such coatings have proven
extremely useful because their physical properties change continuously with
depth. Composite coatings thus provide a smooth transition between disparate
materials such as metal and ceramics. The method to be explored combines
electrolytic codeposition with pulse reverse current (PRC) electroplating. By
careful control of the waveform, it is proposed to demonstrate that electrolytic
PRC codeposition can both enhance and depress the ratio of particle to metal
deposited over that found from codeposition by means of direct current plating.
This innovation has the potential to produce novel and improved coatings in the
electroplating industry.
