9407607 Abstract The project will be a study of a key protein required for a
site- specific recombination reaction in yeast, Flp. The mechanism of the
reaction has been studied and a number of mutants isolated that block the
reaction at different stages. The work will involve characterization of the
mutants to identify protein domains involved in specific sub-reactions. Of
special interest is the substrate recognition domain which determines which DNA
sequences will be recombined. Site-specific recombination systems are extremely
useful tools for genetic engineering of complex genomes including potential uses
with plants and humans. *** In some organisms, two different DNA molecules can
be joined to one another at very well defined sites, that is specific base
sequences, which exist in the two molecules. This is an important reaction for
cells in many different ways. Expression of some genes is regulated by this
mechanism, viruses are able to maintain long-term infections of host cells via
the process, and generation of antibody molecules and related proteins depend
heavily on site- specific recombination. The Flp system from yeast is a model
system for studying this process using both biochemical and genetic approaches.
In this project, mutants in the Flp recombinase will be characterized to
understand how the sequences of DNA are selected for recombination and also how
different domains of the protein affect different aspects of the process. %%%
