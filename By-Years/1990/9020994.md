The project concerns the study of the dynamical properties of weakly coupled
superconducting systems in order to understand the transport properties. The
study will be by numerical and analytical methods. Also, the project is
concerned with the study of the nonlinear optical properties of granular
materials. Existing theories will be extended. Some effort will go into studying
linear optical properties of composites in specified geometries.
