This research will form a theory of robotic cutting and manipulation of soft and
irregularly shaped objects. Applications of the results are leading to more
skillful dexterous robots geared for a range of industrial applications,
improving safety risks, and increasing reliability and consistency.

The technical goal of this project is to understand in depth about manipulation
of delicate, flexible, and slippery items, handling of tools with skills,
coordination among robotic arms and hands, and motion planning and control based
on multi-modality sensing and deformable modeling. The project consists of two
phases. The first phase develops strategies for basic maneuvers of cutting
devices, tackling issues that include vision-guided hand placements, large
deformable modeling in real time, pickup and stabilization, and dexterous
grasping and re-grasping. The second phase investigates coordination of two
robotic arm-hand pairs to carry out cutting, and synthesizes trajectories and
controls to implement different cutting skills. Technical issues to address in
this phase include material viscoelasticity, contact detection, cut planning and
execution on the fly, arm and hand trajectory planning, and fusion of visual and
force data.
