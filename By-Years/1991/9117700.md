Late Carboniferous (Stephanian B-C) collections at Ohio University include over
7,000 three-dimensional, cellularly preserved plant fossils from North American
midcontinent cyclothems. This is the best preserved and most stratigraphically
complete collection of Stephanian plant fossils in the world. The plants from
each cyclothem are preserved in offshore marine shales and constitute an
assemblage from a diverse suite of terrestrial environments. Systematic analysis
using thin sectioning, peel techniques and scanning electron microscopy to
document the cellular features will determine which Stephanian plant groups are
present and identify new taxa. Typically, very few offshore marine units contain
well preserved terrestrial plant debris. The taphonomic constraints influencing
preservation of these Stephanian plants deposited in cyclothem beds of middle to
outer shelf offshore marine environments have not been fully determined. Marine
organism interaction with the transported plant debris and an understanding of
the depositional conditions will resolve the taphonomic pathways involved. This
combined research on plant systematics and marine taphonomic constraints is
significant because it allows the first extensive documentation and analysis of
terrestrial floras in the offshore marine environment. This data base will allow
detailed comparison with rare Stephanian floral communities from coal swamps and
the drier upland environments.
