The broader impact potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase II project is improved global solar panel manufacturing. To date,
conventional solar panel manufacturing technologies are still expensive, but the
market, estimated at $40 B, offers significant potential. The proposed
technology will simplify the manufacturing process at industrial scales. It will
reduce all-in solar manufacturing costs by 25% and the overall capital intensity
of solar manufacturing by almost 50%. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project enables a commercial pilot of a
single crystal wafer manufacturing technology. This novel technology can produce
drop-in silicon wafers for solar panels in one step at 50% lower cost than the
incumbent seven-step wafer technology. The project will extend the current
production capabilities from a few wafers per batch into continuous production
consistent with industrial use. Tasks include developing the subsystems to
continuously feed raw silicon feedstock into the machine and controlling
material properties to critical specifications for long production
runs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
