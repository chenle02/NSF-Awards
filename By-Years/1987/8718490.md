The objective of this project is to fabricate a frictionless bearing from High
Tc ceramic superconductors which would operate above 77 K. Rare earth magnets
with a magnetic flux density of approximately 1 Tesla will be used to provide
levitation pressures of approximately 0.1 MPa (1 bar). Rotation speeds of 3,000
to 10,000 RPM will be attempted, although speeds upto 100,000 RPM may be
possible. The research will include several tasks. The important ones being the
processing of the ceramic housing from yttrium barium cuprate superconducting
ceramic by the superplastic sinter-forging method, and the design and
implementation of the cooling system.
