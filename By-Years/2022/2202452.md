This grant supports US-based participants, especially junior researchers and
graduate students, who attend either the 36th Summer Topology Conference
(SUMTOPO) meeting hosted at the University of Vienna, Austria, from July 18-22,
2022, or the Prague Symposium on General Topology and its Relations to Modern
Analysis and Algebra (TOPOSYM) held July 25-29, 2022, in Prague, Czech Republic.
Because of their close geographic and temporal proximity and disjoint lists of
plenary speakers, these meetings provide a special opportunity for US
researchers to participate in one or both and to meet colleagues in Europe,
share their research, start new collaborations, and continue old ones. The
primary goal of these conferences is to aid in the dissemination of knowledge of
experts in the field of topology. In addition to this, collecting such a group
of experts at a meeting will inevitably lead to new collaborations and the
furthering of basic research in the field of
topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUMTOPO is an annual conference in its 36th
installment, which has been hosted both in the US and abroad in recent years,
including in South Africa, Ireland, and England. The TOPOSYM conference is held
in Prague, Czech Republic in a five-year cycle since 1961. Both meetings have
long served as a geographic and intellectual meeting point, and both have a
large attendance from both North America (the US in particular) and from Europe.
Both conferences cover a broad range of topics on the more analytical side of
topology: general and set-theoretic topology, descriptive set theory, continuum
theory, topological dynamics, topology in functional analysis and algebra, and
categorical topology. They will feature plenary lectures by many leaders in
these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information can be found on the
