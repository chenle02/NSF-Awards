The university is establishing a Cooperative Multimedia Computing Laboratory to
support undergraduate education in the Department of Computer Science. The
laboratory is using state-of-the-art equipment to create a new multimedia
curriculum based on three courses: Software Engineering, Computer Graphics, and
Computer Networks. Laboratory assignments are being designed to allow students
to gain experience with large-scale, real-world applications involving
multimedia software, multimedia interfaces, and multimedia communication.
Initial laboratory sets are being drawn from environmental science, computer-
assisted medicine, and automated manufacturing. The faculty involved in the
establishment of the proposed laboratory have extensive experience in these
application areas and in developing laboratory exercises that expose students to
new technologies and computing methods. The Department of Computer Science, the
College of Engineering, and the university are very committed to this project.
Funds have already been allocated for a preliminary, small-scale version of the
laboratory, summer salaries and course reductions for the three principal
investigators, laboratory space, supporting personnel, and long-term maintenance
of the equipment.
