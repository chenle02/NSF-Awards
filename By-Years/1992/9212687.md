An intensified CCD (Charged Coupled Device) camera will be purchased with this
equipment grant; initially, this system will be dedicated to experiments on the
study of mixing and combustion in supersonic flow environments. When coupled
with a dedicated pulsed dye-laser system, this equipment will allow non-
intrusive Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) studies of concentration,
velocity, temperature and pressure in an existing large-scale facility designed
for fundamental studies of supersonic combustion, allowing first-time non-
intrusive fundamental measurements of the nature and mechanisms of mixing and
combustion in compressible environments over a broad range of flow conditions.
Such results will be used for comparison with ongoing numerical simulations and
for development and validation of compressible mixing and combustion models.
Supersonic mixing and combustion processes are of major interest for a future
generation of supersonic/hypersonic propulsion systems. There are numerous
critical processes/problems associated with this combustion mode; accurate
experimental characterization of flow velocities, pressures, temperatures, and
species concentrations are needed for development of an understanding of these
phenomena and definition of approaches to achieving efficient fuel utilization
under supersonic combustion conditions. There are numerous open questions in
this area which this facility will be uniquely suited to investigate.
