A major focus of Science and Technology Studies (STS) has been the interplay
between the design of technological systems and the sociopolitical conditions
they reflect and influence, with particular attention to Western democracies.
This project looks at the struggle over the use and design of technologies in
non-democratic contexts. Today, digital technologies are central to how pro-
democracy movements build strength and how authoritarian regimes respond. The
dynamic of mobilization and repression has been transformed by the use of new
media and other technologies and, as this project demonstrates, is also affected
by their continuous and contested reshaping. The analysis unpacks the practices
of technological innovation that are not limited to Western industries, the role
of IT talent in pro-democracy activism, and the impossibility of conducting
sustained activist work in contemporary settings without attention to the design
of technologies. The analysis has implications for a wide range of societies and
political systems. The findings will be disseminated through high-impact
scholarly publications and public-facing media. Using in-depth case study
analysis, this project considers what technologies emerge as central for
mobilization and repression â€“ and how their use and design have been reshaped,
under what conditions, by whom, and with what goals and effects. This research
uses qualitative, inductive, grounded theory-based analysis of chronologically
organized media data to reconstruct the struggles over the use and design of
critical technologies between pro-democracy mobilization and the forces that aim
to repress it. The analysis will contribute to new media studies, STS, and
related fields, by documenting the contested and ongoing reshaping of
technologies as part of the broader struggle and by offering an in-depth case
study analysis of the situated practices of the reshaping of technological use
and design.
