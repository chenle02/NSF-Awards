The goal of this proposal is to develop a computer-based visual display to teach
articulation to hearing impaired children. Speech will be analyzed to
discriminate phonemes, and then the phonemes will be encoded to provide pleasing
and interesting feedback to the subjects. Psychophysical experiments will be
conducted to determine to what extent speech can be discriminated and identified
based on the display. The project should contribute to speech analysis, and if
successful, it will also have a significant impact on the training of hearing-
impaired children.
