REVIEW SUMMARY Form 7 The International Brain Research Organization (IBRO) was
founded in 1960 to bring together neuroscientists from many different countries,
and provide some means of fostering international collaborations in the area of
brain research. IBRO supports symposia, workshops and visiting lectureships
around the world, and holds a quadrennial Congress to highlight the frontiers of
international neuroscience research. This award supports the continuing
international dues payment and its administrative costs for the U.S. National
Committee, as a part of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, to represent the
United States neuroscience community to IBRO. This support will have an impact
on fostering the international relations that can lead to fruitful
collaborations in all areas of neuroscience research and training.
