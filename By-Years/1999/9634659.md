This award is for support for the operations and maintenance of the U.S.
National Ice Core Laboratory, hereinafter called "NICL" a government-owned
facility for storing, curating, and studying ice cores recovered from the ice-
covered regions of the world. NICL provides NSF- and USGS-funded investigators
with the capability to conduct examinations and measurements of ice cores while
preserving the integrity of these cores in a safeguarded environment. NICL
fosters the utilization of these cores for scientific research by handling
inquiries from scientists interested in obtaining samples of ice cores, by
making inventory listings easily available through electronic distribution, by
acting as an information resource to the scientific community and by improving
current technologies for ice core analysis in accordance with the needs and
requirements of their client base. NICL is located at the Denver Federal Center
in Lakewood, Colorado and is housed administratively within the USGS Office of
the Central Regional Geologist, Geologic Division.
