The focus of Dr. Banerjee's work is VLSI CAD tools which run on a class of
message-passing architectures, such as hypercubes. In this research he will
investigate algorithms for tools which perform the task of circuit extraction
from VLSI mask layouts. The technical approach is to flatten the hierarchical
description into a mask description consisting of rectangles, and perform the
extraction at this level. The new multiprocessor algorithms will be used for
speedup and accurate, fast-circuit extraction. The algorithms will use region
queries in parallel on a data structure distributed over the parallel processor.
It is anticipated that this procedure will avoid the boundary effect problems
that may arise when splitting a VLSI layout area into regions.
