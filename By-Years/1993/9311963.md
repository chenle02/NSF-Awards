9311963 Strand Funds are provided to defray costs of young scientists and
invited participants to attend the 1993 Summer Neuropeptide Conference to be
held on June 20-24, 1993 at Edgartown, Massachusetts. The field of neuropeptides
have burgeoned over the past ten years. This meeting will bring together
outstanding scientists from all areas of neuropeptide research to present state-
of-the art lectures in sessions devoted to (1) molecular biology of recently-
cloned neuropeptide receptors; (2) biochemistry of peptide processing enzymes;
(3) pharmacology and molecular biology of its receptors; and (4) neuropeptide
release. The final session is devoted to strategies for the development of
neuropeptide-bases therapeutics which will examine how basic fundamental
research may eventually contribute to treatments of some major neurodegenerative
disorders. These are fundamentally important questions in an field that is
rapidly advancing and changing. Moreover, this conference offers an informal
setting for interactions of some of the most brilliant investigators with young
scientists. ***
