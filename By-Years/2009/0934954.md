The Institute for Mathematics and Education (IM&amp;E), the Department of
Mathematics at the University of Arizona (UA), and a consortium of key
stakeholders including high-needs schools and districts, university departments
and programs, local educational agencies, non-profits and businesses are engaged
in planning to develop a Master Teaching Fellows proposal. The AZ-MTM Consortium
is bringing together a wide group of stakeholders interested in the retention of
mathematics teachers in low-income schools through the development of teacher
leaders. Participants in the planning include high needs schools and districts
(Tucson and Sunnyside Unified School districts); experts in mathematics
education and professional development (CRR, IM&amp;E, and Arizona Teacher
Initiative (ATI).); and regional education and business agencies: the Office of
Pima County Schools, a State Education Agency (SEA), and Tucson Values Teachers,
a regional business/education partnership working to provide incentives,
internships and professional development opportunities for teachers. During the
planning period the consortium is designing a comprehensive program for the
Arizona Master Teacher Program for Mathematics (AZ-MTM), making use of existing
professional development opportunities, identifying and securing commitments for
matching funds, and developing a comprehensive evaluation plan. Planning
activities include establishing a timeline and process for a needs assessment
regarding teacher shortages as well as an action plan for designing the AZ-MTM
program including protocols for recruiting teachers, courses and professional
development and comprehensive program evaluation. The Institute for Mathematics
and Education (IM&amp;E) which has acquired a national reputation for bringing
together mathematicians, educators and teachers for effective collaboration, is
coordinating the planning year. The program will build on courses being
developed under a NSF Math Science Partnership grant, the Arizona Teacher
Initiative (ATI).
