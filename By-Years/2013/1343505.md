The proposed project will optimize the fabrication of an ankle foot orthosis
(AFO) to address the needs of drop-foot patients. These patients are unable to
dorsiflex their foot because of impaired muscle activity around the ankle. The
project team has developed a prototype orthosis using a shape memory alloy (SMA)
wire actuator. The actuator captures and releases energy during walking to
provide dorsiflexion motion, which drop-foot patients' lack. The proposed
research includes performing methodical study toward achieving super-elastic
behavior in shape memory parts created using selective laser melting and
developing a proof of concept shape memory hinge to capture and release energy
to the ankle without the need to external sources of energy.

If successful, the proposed research could have a significant impact on the
advancement of active ankle foot orthosis. Every year a large number of
individuals experience a loss of ability to dorsiflex the ankle due to disease
or traumatic injury to the lower extremity that resulted from automobile
accident or work-related causes. Of particular note, these last two conditions
associated with foot drop (traumatic brain injury and traumatic lower extremity
injury) are very common among soldiers.
