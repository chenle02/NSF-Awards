This award, of $390,000, is for the development of a dynamic curriculum for
opto-electronics and communication by training senior undergraduate and first-
level graduate students in photonic areas. The existing photonic engineering
courses will be restructured, with an emphasis on hands-on laboratory work,
problem solving, systems design and testing, computer-aided analysis and design,
and information exchange on newly developed photonic topics. The program will
strengthen the follow-up independent study course and the summer research
project. Students will participate in active research environments by measuring,
analyzing, and attacking state-of-the art problems with a purposeful experience
to encourage young engineers in their professional growth.
