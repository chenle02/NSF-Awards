9705182 Pokrovsky The PI of this grant is a senior distinguished theoretical
physicist from the former Soviet Union with a series of honors (Lenin Prize) and
a number of accomplishments to his credit. In this grant he is planning to work
on a variety of problems in statistical mechanics of superconductivity and
magnetism. There are three different projects: One project concerns with the
PI's long standing interest, a general theory of topological phase transitions.
A second project concerns the properties of high frequency plasma resonance in
layered superconductors. Finally a third project is to study the role of steps
and other defects in the magnetization of thin magnetic films. %%% The PI of

role of defects and microstructures in the thermodynamic properties e.g. phase
transitions and in the electromagnetic response. The work has applications in
the general area of the properties of superconductors and magnets. ***
