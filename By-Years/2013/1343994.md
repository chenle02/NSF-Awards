This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will perform
proof-of-concept development and testing of a novel, safe, and effective
treatment option for onychomycosis (nail fungal infection). The device would
offer patients and doctors a reliable method to treat nail fungal infections
without toxic side effects. Over 35 million Americans suffer from onychomycosis,
which carries a direct cost of over $4 billion in the US healthcare system.
Current treatment options include surgical removal of the nail, oral medications
that may cause liver damage, or topical creams and lasers that have low or
unproven efficacy.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project beyond providing a safe,
effective cure for 35 million Americans suffering from nail fungal infections,
will be to enhance the treatment of other fungal and bacterial infections of the
body and material surfaces. This would include healthcare uses such as skin and
wound disinfection, decontamination of teeth and gums (oral hygiene), and the
sterilization of medical instruments and implanted devices. Outside the
healthcare field, the knowledge acquired in this fungal nail system development
would have sterilization and decontamination uses such as in commercial
equipment, food, and water sterilization.
