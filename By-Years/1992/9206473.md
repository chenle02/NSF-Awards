This research is to measure shear-wave splitting in western North America to
infer alignment of olivine in the mantle and associated mantle flow patterns.
These patterns have implications on lithospheric deformation, absolute plate
motion and associated earthquake hazards. In this continuation of an ongoing
study, an improvement in the ability to handle two anisotropic layers will be
made by inverting a suite of seismograms directly for the anisotropic
parameters. The derived thicknesses can then be compared with those
independently determined by means of teleseismic P and S time residuals. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
