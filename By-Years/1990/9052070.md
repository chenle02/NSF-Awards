The geology and biology departments at Middlebury jointly run a Marine Sciences
program, and teach basic oceanographic and limnological courses that use Lake
Champlain to demonstrate physical and biological phenomena. They are acquiring
new instrumentation for installation on their research vessel, which allows for
upgrading instruction in introductory and upper division courses, as well as
student research projects. The equipment includes an integrated navigation
system, a CTD profiling system, fish and plankton nets, an underwater remotely
operated vehicle (ROV), sediment sampling devices, and an atmospheric monitoring
system. With this new equuipment, they are able to instruct students in modern
research techniques using computer assisted data acquisition and analysis.
Additionally, students will be able to contribute to the data base on Lake
Champlain. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
