We are requesting $72,000 from the National Science Foundation to purchase the
Applied Biosystems ProciseTM Protein Sequencing system from Perkin Elmer. This
will replace the Applied Biosystems 470A Protein Sequencer, now at the end of
its useful life, and allow us to use the 477A Sequencer either as a backup
amino-terminal sequencer or as a carboxyl-terminal sequencer. The ProciseTM
Sequencer will give the Molecular Genetics Instrumentation Facility here a
sequencing capacity equal to or greater than the present capacity even if both
current instruments are retired. This will allow undiminished sequence
determination for all users of the facility, particularly for sequence
determination of proteins from hyperthermophiles, proteases and inhibitors
involved in protein processing and development of diseased states, proteins
involved in methane and C02 metabolism and in degradation of cellulose, proteins
employed as redox carriers in microbes and proteins involved in mammalian
fertilization. The carboxyl terminal sequencing capacity will enable us to more
easily obtain complete sequences of proteins using PCR technology, confirm
sequence changes near the carboxyl terminus of site-directed mutagenized
proteins, help elucidate the specificities of proteases and their inhibitors,
help identify peptides in terms of their sequence position and help complete
sequencing of peptides and proteins.
