This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pursue the
full development of a novel system design architecture for thermoelectric
generation (TEG) to recover exhaust waste heat from engines and convert it to
electricity. The effort will build upon Phase I achievements, which included a
successful feasibility demonstration of a fractional proof-of-concept prototype
and development and validation of a computer model, thereby proving the
viability of this new system technology platform. The technology enables
efficient performance within a very compact and cost-effective form that also
can easily scale in capacity. The Phase II effort will involve improving
subsystems and designing, modeling, fabricating, and testing a full TEG system
for a passenger car application. Furthermore, scalability will be explored by
applying the TEG to a larger vehicle platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;the
broader/commercial impact of this project lie in the fact that industry has
found it very challenging to develop a TEG system design that meets market
metrics of performance, reliability, compactness, and low-cost, particularly for
automotive applications. The proposed TEG system architecture, which includes a
novel exhaust gas heat exchanger uniquely integrated into the remaining system,
shows strong potential for meeting such metrics, and thereby achieving
significant reduction in vehicle fuel consumption and emissions. By penetrating
the large passenger vehicle market, initial market introduction could easily
range in the 100,000s and much more if the cost of the product is extremely low.
Broader opportunities to recover exhaust waste heat for transportation include
medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which may also be addressed by this scalable
technology. Other adjacent markets include stationary and mobile generator sets,
solid-oxide fuel cells, and potentially, aircraft propulsion systems. This
commercial impact would greatly support national energy independence and
greenhouse gas reductions.
