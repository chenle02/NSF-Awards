The Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division supports this award to
University of Arkansas to study the basic mechanism and method of nanoparticle
crystal growth using size- and shape-dependent optical properties of these nano-
particles. With this award, Professor Xiaogang Peng will develop green
chemistry-based methods for the large scale synthesis of nano-sized cadmium
selenide crystals from the less toxic precursor cadmium oxide, and these methods
will be quite different from the presently used methods with precursor dimethyl
cadmium, which is toxic, unstable and expensive. The award will help to develop
new methods for the large-scale synthesis of semiconductor nanocrystals of
uniform size and shape for applications in electrooptic devices. Both graduate
and undergraduate students will greatly benefit from the training and research
opportunities provided by this award in materials
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, nanoparticle crystal growth
will be studied using size- and shape-dependent optical properties of these
crystals. Nano-sized cadmium selenide crystal will be prepared in large scale
using cadmium oxide as the precursor. This green chemistry-based method will be
cost effective, and used less toxic and much more stable precursor. Both
graduate and undergraduate students will greatly benefit from the training and
research opportunities provided by this award in nano-crystal growth and
characterization.
