DMS-9626708 Ivo Herzog This project concerns the connection between (1) the
model theory of modules and (2) the use of functorial methods in the
representation theory of rings. In recent years this connection has been
developed with an eye to algebraic applications of first order methods to
modules, and in particular to artin algebras. The present project will expand
this approach to include the model theory of modules with an endomorphism, or
equivalently - the model theory of modules over the ring of polynomials. Also to
be considered are (1) first-order variants of the Brauer-Thrall conjectures for
an artin algebra, and (2) a theory of homology for positive-primitive formulas.
This research involves the connection between logic and algebra. Logic provides
the context in which one can study the expressive power of mathematical
language; as such it is an essential tool in computing. Algebra provides a
vehicle for understanding notions such as symmetry and mappings, and finds
application in sciences and manufacturing. Professor Herzog's research takes
place in a part of algebra called module theory, which is akin to, but broader
than, linear algebra. The problems which arise are similar to solving systems of
linear equations. By forging the relationships between logic and algebra, his
research will provide new understanding of modules.
