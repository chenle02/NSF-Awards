Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown superior performance in enhancing driving
safety in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). State-of-the-art deep
neural networks (DNNs) achieve high accuracy at the expense of increased model
complexity, which raises the computation burden of onboard processing units of
vehicles for ADAS inference tasks. The primary goal of this project is to
develop innovative collaborative AI inference strategies with the emerging edge
computing paradigm. The strategies can adaptively adjust cooperative inference
techniques for best utilizing available computation and communication resources
and ultimately enable high-accuracy and real-time inference. The project will
inspire greater collaborations between experts in wireless communication, edge
computing, computer vision, autonomous driving testbed development, and
automotive manufacturing, and facilitate AI applications in a variety of IoT
systems. The educational testbed developed from this project can be integrated
into courses to provide hands-on experiences. This project will benefit
undergraduate, master, and Ph.D. programs and increase under-represented groupsâ€™
engagement by leveraging the existing diversity-related outreach
efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A multi-disciplinary team with complementary
expertise from Rowan University, Temple University, Stony Brook University, and
Kettering University is assembled to pursue a coordinated study of collaborative
AI inference. The PIs explore integrative research to enable deep learning
technologies in resource-constrained ADAS for high-accuracy and real-time
inference. Theory-wise, the PIs plan to take advantage of the observation that
DNNs can be decomposed into a set of fine-grained components to allow
distributed AI inference on both the vehicle and edge server sides for inference
acceleration. Application-wise, the PIs plan to design novel DNN models which
are optimized for the cooperative AI inference paradigm. Testbed-wise, a vehicle
edge computing platform with V2X communication and edge computing capability
will be developed at Kettering University GM Mobility Research Center. The
cooperative AI inference system will be implemented, and the research findings
will be validated on realistic vehicular edge computing environments thoroughly.
The data, software, and educational testbeds developed from this project will be
widely disseminated. Domain experts in autonomous driving testbed development,
intelligent transportation systems, and automotive manufacturing will be engaged
in project-related issues to ensure relevant challenges in this project are
impactful for real-world applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
