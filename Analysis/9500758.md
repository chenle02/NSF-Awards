9500758 Li Li will investigate several problems in complex analysis, including
the Corona problem in several complex variables; the theory of function spaces,
such as Hardy spaces, Bergman spaces, and Lipschitz spaces, on domains in
complex Euclidean space; and operator theory on function spaces. He will also
study the boundary value problem of complex non-linear differential equations.
Several complex variables arose at the beginning of the century as a natural
outgrowth of studies of functions of one complex variable. It became clear early
on that the theory differed widely from it predecessor. The underlying geometry
was far more difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more affinity
with partial differential operators of first order. It thus grew as a hybrid
subject combining deep characteristics of differential geometry and differential
equations. Many of the fundamental structures were defined in the last three
decades. Current studies still concentrate on understanding these basic
mathematical forms.
