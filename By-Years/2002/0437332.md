0437332 Israel Wachs

This U.S.-Argentina award will provide support for collaborative research
between Dr. Israel E. Wachs, Lehigh University, and Dr. Laura E. Briand,
University de la Plata, Eduardo A. Lombardo, National University of the Coast
and Dr. Maria J. Yanez, of the National University of the South, all of
Argentina. The objective of their work is to obtain S-free products from
catalytic selective oxidation of thiol molecules and to determine the
fundamental reaction mechanisms of oxidative desulfurization. There is little
known about such reactions, and the removal of sulfur by this means could have
important application to fuel cells.

This international research collaboration maximizes the unique expertise of the
research group in each country. The Argentina side has experience in the
synthesis and characterization of bulk mixed metal oxides, and the Lehigh lab
has expertise on the supported metal oxides. The collaborative effort between
these two groups will give access to a broad range of catalysis skills and
instrumentation to increase our understanding of these reactions.
