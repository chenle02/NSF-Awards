ABSTRACT 9320466 Garden, Rognvald This project will build mid-infrared
(828um)imaging Fabry- Perot interferometer use with a variety of infrared
telescopes, including the ITRF, UKIRT, and the new Keck I &amp; II telescopes.
The instrument will facilitate diffraction- limited (&lt;0.5 arcsec/pixel)
imaging at high spectral resolution (103 /105) in a variety of important ionic
and molecular spectral lines. The design is suited for studying the dynamics of
extended, optically obscured regions of ionic or warm molecular gas. Such
regions include, but are not restricted to,(1) HII regions associated with young
OB star clusters, (2) molecular cloud shocks associated with young stellar
outflows, (3) photodissociation regions, (4) the Galactic Center, and (5)
galactic nuclei and extragalactic HII regions. The major components of the
interferometer consist of a pair of carefully matched cryogenic Fabry-Perot
interferometers and a large 128 128 mid-infrared detector array. The limiting
noise-equivalent-line flux at the highest spectral resolution will be comparable
to that of similar instrumentation planned for SIRTF. Furthermore, the
instrument will be built in two phases. In the first phase, the design will be
optimized for operation in the 813um window. The second phase will involve the
design and construction of additional hardware to extend the operation into the
relatively unexplored 1624um window. ***
