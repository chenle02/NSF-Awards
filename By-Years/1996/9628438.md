A comprehensive program of research on congestion avoidance in high-speed
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks is proposed. The seven congestion
issues that will be addressed in this project include: response to bursty
traffic (with rate control), coexistence with higher priority VBR and CBR
traffic, fair bandwidth allocation, large number of low rate sources, RM cell
policies, queue control, and interaction with higher layer protocols. In order
to ensure that the research results are adopted by the industry, the
investigator will continue to work closely with ATM forum Traffic Management
Group during the definition phase of the problem and its solution.
