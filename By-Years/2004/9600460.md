9600460 Mumby This grant is for support for a FASEB summer conference on protein
phosphatases. This conference includes sessions on phosphatase structure,
phosphatases in signal transduction, genetic studies, and the role of
phosphatases in cell adhesion. The addition and removal of phosphatases are
important in many signaling pathways, but the research emphasis has been greater
on the phosphorylation studies. This is one of the few meetings devoted to
phosphatases, and the topics are current and address new interactions. The
format of the meeting is conducive to interchange of ideas among participants.
