This research concerns relations between the spectral theory of the Laplacian
on a compact Riemannian manifold and the dynamics of the geodesic flow. The
first project concerns a restriction of the isospectral problem: an assumption
that the Laplacians are intertwined by a unitary Fourier integral operator.
Broadly interpreted, this restriction includes almost all known examples. The
second problem concerns the pair correlation function of the Laplacian. This
function measures the distribution of gaps between eigenvalues on the scale of
the mean consecutive gap. This function is determined by the qualitative
dynamics of the geodesic flow. Recently the principal investigator determined
the first known pair function on certain Zoll surfaces. This work will be
continued. This project is in the area of geometric analysis and deals with the
interface between spectral theory and dynamical systems. This research may have
profound applications to physics and geometry.
