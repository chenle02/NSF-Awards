It has become increasingly feasible to deploy wireless devices, systems, and
networks at low cost for diverse applications such as data communications,
sensing, and inference. Given the variety of complex wireless systems with
different purposes operating over randomly fading channels, the question of how
to compare the performance of these systems arises. System analysis and design
can benefit from a unified approach to comparisons of such systems. This
research uses the notion of stochastic ordering to provide such an approach. The
results aid in performance analysis, and design of wireless systems across a
wide range of random propagation conditions. The educational component of this
research involves design of educational software modules to illustrate basic
concepts in probability and communications using performance comparison of
sensing systems through stochastic orders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unifying
performance metrics also enables comparisons of complex wireless systems
operating over fading channels. This enables performance comparisons of a vast
range of systems on the basis of the analytical properties of the performance
metric such as monotonicity, convexity, or complete monotonicity. When systems
are combined, we can determine the conditions under which ordering of the
constituent parts preserves the ordering of overall system performance. Specific
topics of application include stochastic ordering of generalized relay networks,
introduction of new stochastic orders induced by performance metrics of wireless
systems, applying the theory of stochastic ordering of point processes to order
wireless sensor network performance, and stochastic ordering of systems with
multiple (possibly correlated) random channel coefficients such as MIMO systems,
or systems operating over frequency-selective channels.
