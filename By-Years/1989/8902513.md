Professor Thomas G. Spiro is supported by a grant from The Physical Chemistry
Program to provide travel support for graduate students and postdocs to attend
an International Conference on Time-Resolved Vibrational Spectrosocpy. The
conference will be held on The Princeton University Campus from June 11 through
June 15. Several outstanding international scientists in the area of time-
resolved vibrational spectroscopy have accepted invitations to provide overview
lectures. It is estimated that approximately 200 scientists will attend the
conference. The funding provided by this NSF grant will be used to provide 10
travel grants for graduate students and postdocs to attend this conference.
