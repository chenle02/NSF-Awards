The Division of Natural Sciences and Mathematics at Bard College is utilizing
funds for the purchase of computer workstations, networking equipment, and
analytical software. Half of these machines are being used to create a networked
computer classroom for teaching advanced computing applications, the rest are
being installed in the individual departments of the Division.These facilities
are used in a variety of courses in the Division, as well as in faculty and
undergraduate research. The immediate plans are to expand and enhance the
existing offerings for majors in Data Analysis and Numerical Methods, to provide
a computing resource for advanced science work, and to develop quantitative
courses for non- majors. The workstations allow a sophisticated combination of
calculational, statistical, graphical, and symbolic treatment of quantitative
concepts and methods. This allows a raising of the level of quantitative work in
classes and in student research projects.NSF grant funds are being matched with
funds from non-federal sources.
