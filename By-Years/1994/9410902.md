9412316 SARAT This project supports a summer institute for interdisciplinary
training in sociolegal studies. Thirty new entrants to the field, some of whom
are advanced graduate students and some new Ph.D's, will participate in a four-
day institute with a faculty of distinguished scholars from the law and social
science field, including sociologists of law, psychologists of law,
anthropologists of law, political scientists, criminologists, and academic
lawyers. Primary attention will be on crossdisciplinary collaboration and on
interdisciplinary ways of thinking about research on the nexus between law and
society. The grant will support travel and subsistence for thirty participants
and ten faculty, as well as the publication of some curricular materials
prepared specifically for the institute. ***
