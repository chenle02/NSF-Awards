9725536 Magistrale This research involves the construction, in a forward sense,
of a 3- D seismic velocity model of the Imperial Valley, California, based on
existing geologic and seismic surveys. Previous inversions for the velocity
structure of the Imperial Valley, although done with extensive data sets, were
difficult due to the large seismic velocity variations over short length scales,
for example between crystalline rocks surrounding the basin and shallow
sediments within the basin, the poor resolution of inversion at shallow depths,
and the lack of accounting of model errors during the inversion. With the
geologic information integrated in a forward model, it will be possible to
estimate the model uncertainties, and properly account for those uncertainties
during inversion. An improved model of faulting and crustal structure should
result. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program. ***
