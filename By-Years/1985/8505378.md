One of the technical problems of the chemical industry is designing and scaling
reactors under such conditions where reaction rates and yields can depend upon
both the chemistry and the mixing. The problem is particularly difficult because
mixing is usually turbulent, micromixing as well as macromixing is important,
and turbulent micromixing is neither well understood nor easy to measure. Since
rational design and scale-up require knowledge of both the mixing and chemistry,
there is a need for a simple convenient tool for measuring mixing. The goal of
this research is to develop and validate an indicator probe which is based on
chemical indicators. The probe is used to characterize mixing in terms of
probability density functions.
