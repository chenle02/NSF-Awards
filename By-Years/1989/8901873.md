This research is concerned with the structure of certain noncommutative
algebras. The main concern is the structure of algebras which arise as
deformations of fixed rings of the Weyl algebras. The techniques used to study
these algebras involve the intertwining of ideas from the theory of Lie algebras
and algebraic geometry. The principle investigator will also pursue the study of
enveloping algebras, focusing on the problem of calculating the K-theory of
primitive factors of the enveloping algebra of a semi-simple Lie algebra.
Noncommutative ring theory represents the study of an algebraic structure
possessing an addition and a noncommutative multiplication. K-theory represents
the evolved algebraic theory of vector spaces and linear mappings. This project
is concerned with the structure, K-theory and state-space of certain
noncommutative rings.
