This award will support an observational project that will address how close
binary stars form and evolve. Various formation scenarios lead to differing
expectations about whether the spin axes of the stars are aligned with the
orbital axis (for example, the Earth's spin axis is about 23 degrees away from
the orbital axis.) The project will perform a statistical analysis on 50
eclipsing binaries discovered in the Kepler survey, and will conduct detailed
time-series spectroscopy of a dozen brighter systems. The latter will make use
of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, which produces changes in the observed
spectra of one member of a binary system as the other star passes in front of
it. Careful measurement of the effect can determine the projection of the spin-
orbit axis misalignment on the sky.

The research project is expected to help interpret the recent discoveries of
exoplanets on highly tilted orbits. Integrated with this research program are
training opportunities for students and a postdoctoral associate, as well as
efforts to increase the public understanding of science.
