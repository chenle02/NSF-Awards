Security-based interventions have become increasingly common in impoverished
urban spaces, although little is known about how these programs affect the
relationship between the state and targeted communities. This project helps to
address that gap by examining the impact of militarized state responses on
opportunities for political engagement and governance.

The study employs a mixed-methods approach, which includes a multi-sited
ethnography and secondary data analysis of news articles and public speeches.
Ethnographic research takes place in geographic, virtual, and political spaces.
This project contributes to an increasingly important conversation about the
benefits and limitations of employing state security forces to combat violent
gangs and promote social development in poor urban areas.
