Educators and learners in the field of secure quantum communications and quantum
networking face a unique challenge. In order to be proficient in these areas,
one must draw from a broad set of disciplines. Effective training in such
interdisciplinary emerging areas poses several structural and pedagogical
challenges. The limited availability of educational resources in these areas
often requires educators to collect and curate materials from several sources.
Manually developing courses and identifying relevant student learning objectives
(SLOs) can be a considerable burden for educators. In addition, learning from
courses created this way can be challenging for students. Traditional approaches
are not adequate for teaching interdisciplinary areas, since they do not provide
the hands-on learning experiences needed to study interactions among
disciplines. This project will address the above challenges by developing and
disseminating a state-of-the-art experiential learning-based platform, QUINTET:
Quantum internet education and training synthesizer.

The QUINTET platform will include: (1) Eight course modules on classical and
quantum networking, networking algorithms, quantum internet components and
quantum routing, classical and quantum cryptography, and classical and quantum
network security; (2) A Learning Objects Repository (LOR) consisting of learning
objects that meet SLOs, including modular interactive widgets, relevant text,
videos, exercises, and quizzes and tests to synthesize lessons; (3) Use of
Kolbâ€™s four phases of experiential learning, including hands-on, virtual quantum
network experimentation and universal design for learning, which offers multiple
equivalent representations of the same concept for inclusive and accessible
learning; (4) New assessment methodology that uses data collection embedded
within lesson plans and qualitative assessments that allow instructors and
learners to review their performance through reflection zones and active
experimentation; and (5) A design in alignment with FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Inter-operable, and Reusable) principles and instrumented with a rich set of
metadata that allows efficient retrieval and customization of course modules for
a variety of learning experiences.

This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC)
program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in
this case specifically cybersecurity education. The SaTC program aligns with the
Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National
Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the growing social and
economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security and privacy.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
