This project will investigate problems of signal processing from radar receivers
in a nonstationary noise environment. It will investigate adaptive techniques
which aim at achieving a constant false alarm rate (CFAR). In particular, it
will focus on robust CFAR detectors, utilizing distributed structures within one
radar and concept described in "Decentralized CFAR detection," by Barkat and
Varshney, forthcoming in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems.
The goal is to achieve a detection performance which is insensitive to
correlation among the received pulses. Receiver performance will be made even
more robust by extending the space diversity scheme to monitor the same volume
in space; i.e., the receiver above will be extended to the case of multiple
sensors.
