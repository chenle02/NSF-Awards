The goal of the project is to establish an undergraduate communication science
laboratory. A network of Macintosh computer workstations will interface with
already existing transducers permitting students to compare source movements,
resulting air disturbance and acoustic outcomes related to speech and hearing.
Students will also assist in the design of HyperCard programs for self-directed,
interactive instruction in speech and hearing science. The project will: 1)
provide undergraduate experiences in basic science that are critically tied to
speech and hearing; 2) lead to the development of interactive, instructional
computer programs in speech acoustics; 3) provide research mentoring early in
students' academic careers; and 4) help to promote speech and hearing careers
for women and minorities.
