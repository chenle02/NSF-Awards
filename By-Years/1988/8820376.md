During the past several years, scanning transmission x-ray microscopy has
become a reality. The objective of this project is to develop auxiliary
equipment, and the required knowledge base, to make this form of microscopy
useful for biological studies of whole cultured cells. This work is intended to
make it practical to view whole, wet, unstained cells with a spatial resolution
ten times finer than that of the light microscope. The cells may be either alive
or fixed. This new kind of microscopy has broad significance for researchers in
cell biology and neurobiology, particularly those studying the relation of
cellular ultrastructure to function. We will develop a specimen system
appropriate for imaging live cultured cells. Prototype images will then be
obtained to determine the extent to which the natural contrast of unstained
specimens reveals their ultrastructure. Immunostaining techniques for whole
fixed cells will also be characterized. Studies of radiation damage effects will
be made to define the acceptable range of exposures for maintaining both short-
term and long-term integrity of live cells and fixed specimens. A modified
system optimal for imaging specimens smaller than whole mammalian cells, such as
bacteria or myofibrils, will also be developed.
