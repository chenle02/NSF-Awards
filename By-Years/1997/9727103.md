The electrocatalytic oxidation of small organic molecules forms the focus of
the research of Professor Korzeniewski at Texas Tech University. This project,
supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses the
kinetics of formation of intermediates in the electrocatalytic oxidation of
methanol using chromatography coupled with small volume electrolysis methods.
The activation of water in these electrolytic processes is probed by monitoring
the effect of the activation on the oscillatory voltammetry of CO on the
platinum electrode. Information from these studies will enable the improved
design of direct methanol fuel cells as well as the use of electrocatalysis for
the destruction of organic contaminants in groundwater. A detailed understanding
of the electrocatalytic oxidation of small organic molecules is important to the
development of fuel cells and processes for remediation of contaminated
groundwater sources. This research project studies the mechanisms of these
processes using a combination of chromatographic detection of reaction
intermediates and voltammetric probes of electrode kinetics.
