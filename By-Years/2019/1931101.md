This project is to support student travel and participation in the 2019
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Conference on Connected Health
(CHASE) in Washington, DC. CHASE provides a supportive scientific forum for
students focusing on computing and engineering research associated with the
multidisciplinary field of connected health. CHASE provides a forum for expert
and peer critique of students' research with the goal of improving their
science. Twenty five student participants will also have the opportunity to
receive networking support and career advice from internationally-recognized
experts. Overall, the travel support brings together people who might not
otherwise engage with one another and engage in multidisciplinary research in
fields involving connected health. These connections should enhance the quality
of their science, as well provide networking opportunities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports 25 doctoral students by providing a
Student Research Forum focused on encouraging students to examine technologies
from multiple perspectives to understand how innovative technology, advanced
analytics, persuasive computing and biomedical expertise and information combine
to make the most impact. In addition, the Career Panel enables students to see
different career paths for researchers in this area. The CHASE conference
exposes participants to different scientific disciplinary approaches, supports
networking with conference attendees and is designed to support the development
of the next generation of scholars in connected
health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
