Robert M. Solovay's current project in the foundations of mathematics has two
parts, one in set theory and one in models of arithmetic. The work in set theory
will attempt to show that some unresolved questions concerning C*-algebras are
actually independent of the customary axioms of set theory, the so-called
Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms. This would mean that they could be settled only by
adopting additional axioms, such as the desired answers themselves. Since
C*-algebras are an important object of study in modern analysis, this part of
the project would have a wider audience that most projects in foundations. The
other part, concerning models of arithmetic, is somewhat more technical, likely
to have an enthusiastic but more restricted audience.
