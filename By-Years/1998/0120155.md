&lt;br/&gt;SGER: Application-Oriented Object
Architecture&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SGER
project studies the feasibility of an application-oriented object architecture
(AOA) to revolutionize the way computer systems are built and drastically reduce
the problems of obsolescence and reengineering. The proposed 2-layer
architecture consists of an application unit (AU) and an application object
(AO). The two form a substrate-software pair with all software functionality in
the AO: no additional software is needed and the AU is optimized for the
particular AO. This architecture is demonstrated by using an existing computer
system such as a desktop and a commonly used resume document application, using
a simulation environment prototype for the AU. The work is exploratory in nature
and intends to lay the groundwork for a more substantial project. The project
intends to make significant contributions to computer systems development and
redefine the roles of traditional software, hardware, and applications,
providing a new foundation for computer systems based on applications instead of
environments.
