High Speed Signal Processing is an important application of special purpose
numerical processor designs. These digital processing systems involve
interconnecting complex integrated circuits or a large self-contained VLSI
design; both implementations contain dense electronic structures susceptible to
internal temporary and permanent failures. Such systems are difficult to protect
sufficiently by classical fault-tolerant computer design methods even though
these systems also process numerical based data. This research examines new
methods for introducing efficient fault- tolerant design methods in linear
signal processing systems without degrading high speed performance. The approach
is based on block and convolutional codes used in communication applications for
error detection/correction in data sequences. Four specific research topics are
addressed in this work. One topic involves the study of new design and
modification options for real block and convolutional codes, while another
examines the coverage for this type of algorithmic fault-tolerance. Practical
CAD implementations are made to provide a basis for assessing overhead
complexities. Software tools to aid designers in incorporating fault-tolerance
easily within practical systems are also developed.
