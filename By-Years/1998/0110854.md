Life science data is valuable and hard to produce; it is important to share it
in order to promote discovery. Effective database interoperability will
facilitate the way life science data is accessed, retrieved, analyzed, and
combined with other data. The original effort with focus on life science data,
specifically databases concerned with four organisms, a plant, an animal, an
insect and a simple eukaryote. General purpose databases of sequence and
structure will also be integrated. The provision of methods for integrating
proprietary data as well as public data will enable collaborations with
industry. The system is based on a mediator-wrapper approach, which will be
automated through wrapper induction, by using a domain ontology and independent
source data models. The system will help overcome the scalability, maintenance
and upgrade challenges in many life science databases.
