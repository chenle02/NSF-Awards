Professor Theodore R. Williams and other members of the Chemistry Department of
the College of Wooster are being supported to continue a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1990-92, nine (9)
students will spend ten (10) weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of
research projects. Projects range from developing methods of analysis for water
in ocular tissue to investigation of conformational behavior of substituted
alkanes. Students will be required to present two seminars and prepare a journal
quality report of their summer progress.
