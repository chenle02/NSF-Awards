Partial support is requested for a US contingent to participate in the
International Workshop on EulerHydrodynamics, to be held in Assois, France, June
18-23, 2007. Fourteen junior and six senior participants, one-third of them from
under-represented groups, will be supported. Euler equations are broadly
applicable, and open mathematical questions about the behavior of their
solutions persist. It is expected that the broad mix of research scientists
invited to the Workshop will encourage cross-fertilization, and stimulate major
progress in the theory and application of Euler's equations.
