Scandinavian settlers colonized the islands of the North Atlantic 500 years
before Columbus. They introduced European economies and culture into fragile
Arctic terrestrial and marine ecosystems and over time suffered the consequences
of ecological damage, human population decreases and extinctions. The Nordic
archaeological, historical and ecological data on these human impacts is unique
in the circumpolar world and highly relevant to our understanding of global
change. This five year project seeks to coordinate, integrate and, through case
studies, analyze the complex multi- disciplinary data from the North Atlantic
region. This effort will greatly enhance the value of individual research
projects in 10 countries, and is of direct relevance to applied studies of
fisheries and agriculture in the north.
