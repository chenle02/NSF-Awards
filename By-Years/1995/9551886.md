A particle transport/separation flow system is currently under construction and
allows the laboratory investigation of particle technology and separation
concepts to be introduced for the first time into the existing undergraduate
curriculum in the College of Engineering and in the Department of Chemical
Engineering. New instruments, a stack analyzer, pressure transducers, a particle
characteristics tester, and a data acquisition board are being incorporated with
the particle transport/separation system through this project. This enables labs
on cyclone separation of powders from air, particle characterization, flow
regime identification for gas/solid transport, and hopper operation to be
incorporated into classes. The pneumatic transport/separation system has been
completely designed and constructed undergraduate students and has served to
begin to introduce particle technology and environmental separations to a small
number of self-selected students. This project integrates particle technology
into a number of the undergraduate classes, thus enabling all engineering
undergraduates to become aware of the importance of the knowledge of particles.
Additionally, all chemical engineering students can learn the various concepts
pertinent to the transport and separation of particles in their existing
undergraduate courses. The new instrumentation can result in a number of
experiments of varying learning objectives on particle technology, which is a
vital area of knowledge that has previously been neglected in chemical
engineering education. Classes such as Process Control, Fluid Dynamics,
Exploring Engineering, and Transport Phenomena will integrate the experiments to
affect over 1,500 students in the next 5 years of use.
