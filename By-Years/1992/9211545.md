The major goal of this project is to study the membrane mechanisms involved in
signalling thermal stimuli by nerve cells in the trigeminal ganglion which
receives information from the face. A novel, miniature thermal stimulator is
being developed which will apply highly localized and well-controlled heat
stimuli to these trigeminal sensory neurons which are maintained in a cell-
culture environment. This new instrument is based upon a commercially available
miniature thermometer which utilizes a temperature-dependent change in the rate
of decay of fluorescence emitted by a phosphor coating at the tip of a
fiberoptic probe. The tip of the temperature probe functions as a black-body
radiator by covering it with a layer of gold. A new optical assembly couples the
optical fiber to both a xenon flash light and an infrared laser diode. Injection
of both infrared and blue radiation into the optic fiber will make it possible
to simultaneously heat the front of the probe and measure its surface
temperature. By utilizing the temperature signal in a feedback loop and pulse-
modulating the output of the infrared laser diode, it is possible to accurately
control the highly localized heat stimuli. This new instrument should have many
important applications in biological research.
