This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I research proposal will
demonstrate a novel, inexpensive, nano-crystalline based metal oxide
semiconductor sensor array that will provide a new technology platform for the
real-time early detection of the presence of molds found in commercial office
buildings, schools, hospitals and homes, before their presence can cause
problems. The aim is to develop a new low-cost detector for mold that operates
in real-time with exceptionally high sensitivity and selectivity to discriminate
the marker Microbial Volatile Organic Compounds (MVOCs) specific to harmful
strains of mold. This novel approach uses a highly active nano-crystalline metal
oxide semiconductor material to achieve the necessary sensitivity and to
establish high selectivity to MVOCs through the use of temperature of operation,
introduction of catalysts and dopants into the semiconductor oxide film, and by
control of the material's morphology. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;MVOCs are
associated with mold growth in problem building environments. The proposed
research will lead to the development of an inexpensive sensor array that is
capable of real-time detection of the presence of mold. This unique detector
would be a new and innovative product for the Heating Ventilating and Air
Conditioning (HVAC) industry and for building control manufacturers. &lt;br/&gt;
