With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Doyle will design new chiral
rhodium catalysts that will be used to generate carbenoids from diazocompounds.
Intramolecular cyclization reactions of these carbenoids that lead, e.g., to the
formation of lactones and lactams are expected to display exceptionally high
enantioselectivities. It is likely that significant new, synthetically useful
methods for asymmetric synthesis will result from this work. The reactions to be
studied include chiral intra- and inter- molecular cyclopropanations,
cycloadditions to aromatic systems, and carbon-hydrogen insertion processes that
result in the formation of lactones and lactams. These studies will consist of a
combination of: (i) catalyst preparation and characterization, (ii) mechanistic
investigations, and (iii) synthetic applications.
