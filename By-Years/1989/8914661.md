This award will support cooperative research between Dr. Gary Blanpied and
colleagues at the Department of Physics, University of Carolina and Dr. Jean-
Pierre Didelez, Institute of Nuclear Physics, University of Paris-Sud, Orsay,
France. The research will focus on the study of pi and eta meson production ny
nucleons and high energy gamma rays. Electromagnetic probes are becoming
increasingly important in intermediate energy nuclear physics. The two groups
have col- laborated in the design and construction of the lead-glass based high
energy detector used in the detection of neutral pi mesons. The investigators
propose to complete this program and to expand and reconfigure the spectrometer
for detection of eta mesons. The experience and expertise developed with this
detector will have application in the US at CEBAF, the US flagship
electromagnetic nuclear physics facility, in a program of photo- and electro-
meson production studies. The project will benefit from the complementary
expertise of the two groups: the US group will have primary responsibility for
the electronics and the data acquisition systems, while the French will be
responsible for the engineering, fabrication, and assembly of the detector and
for the design of the trigger logic.
