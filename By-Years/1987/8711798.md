A primary emphasis in the study of oceanic crustal rocks has been to develop a
quantitative geochemical characterization of the upper mantle. Such information
is important in understanding both the sources and processes which lead to the
formation of the oceanic crust. Additionally, the geochemistry of the upper
mantle and its homogeneity/heterogeneity place important constaints on models
for convection of the mantle and evolution of the planet earth. The objective of
the present award is to continue studies of the lead, strontium, and neodynium
isotope composition of basalts dredged from Pacific ocean seamounts. Initial
work on this project has been important im documenting the source of magmas to
seamounts on the East Pacific Rise and to "hot spot" produced seamount chains in
the western Pacific. Work to be supported during the next two years will
include: 1)continued analysis of samples from the western Pacific, 2)initiation
of studies on samples from the Hawiian Ridge,and 3)analysis of samples from
seamounts near fracture zones. The principlal investigators are highly qualified
to undertake the proposed study.
