The project will enable students to defray the costs of traveling to and
attending the 41st International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA-41),
to be held June 14-18, 2014, in Minneapolis, MN. ISCA is a premier forum for
presenting, discussing and debating new and innovative architectural ideas and
techniques for advanced computing and communication systems.
This&lt;br/&gt;symposium brings together researchers in fields related to
processor architecture, compilers, chips, and systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will have two primary broader impacts. First, the ISCA conference will
be strengthened as a result of the greater attendance that this travel support
will enable. Second, those students receiving travel support will personally
benefit from the opportunity to interact with peers and experts, as well as
establish connections that will help their professional careers. More broadly,
we expect additional indirect impacts. First, the available support will be
widely advertised in order to attract women and under-represented minority
groups (through postings on computer architecture web-sites and mailing lists).
Second, by focusing on students, the project will help foster the mentoring of
subsequent generations of computer architects.
