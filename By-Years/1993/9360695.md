9360695 Keenan This is a proposal to design a system of interactive video
technology for assessing team leadership skills. The intended users of the
technology are companies who want a better means to assess existing and
potential leaders of self-directed work groups as part of their effort to
improve quality and productivity in their firms. Vignettes portraying important
dilemmas confronting self-directed work team leaders would be presented in a
life-like way via laser disk, with individual reactions to those dilemmas
recorded and used to select further vignettes to be viewed and responded to. Use
of interactive video technology will make it possible to develop a leadership
assessment system which is both realistic and standardized, objectives which
heretofore have seemed contradictory. This project will contribute to a growing
effort to improve the quality and performance of American firms, and thus to
enhance national competitiveness. It will also contribute to the effort to
develop practical applications from social science research. ***
