Rational simple connectedness is an algebraic notion which is to simple
connectedness as rational connectedness is to path connectedness. Just as a
topological fibration over a 2-dimensional base with simply connected fiber
admits a continuous section, also an algebraic fibration over a surface with
rationally simply connected general fiber admits a rational section (under
suitable additional hypotheses). This project investigates the theory beyond
this result, just as topological obstruction theory is the theory beyond the
quoted topological result. The first goal is to determine how the obstruction to
"weak approximation"(approximation of power series solutions by polynomial
solutions) decomposes into a local obstruction and a global obstruction. The
second goal is to investigate the obstruction theory where it is not yet known
by determining precisely which algebraic fibrations over a surface of a
specified, simple type admit a rational section.

Systems of polynomial equations are ubiquitous in mathematics, science and
engineering. In studying the collection of all solutions in complex numbers,
i.e., the variety, associated to such a system, there is one special phenomenon:
the system is "rationally connected" if for every pair of solutions, there is a
polynomial map taking values in the variety and whose values interpolate between
the given pair of solutions. This special property is often satisfied in
practice. Surprisingly, a system of polynomial equations depending algebraically
on 1 extra parameter (often thought of as time) always has a family of solutions
varying as a polynomial of the parameter so long as the system for a fixed
general choice of the parameter is rationally connected. There is now an
analogous theorem for a 2-parameter system, but with very strong constraints on
the system. The goal of the project is to weaken the constraint condition, and
thus make the advance more widely applicable, by using notions analogous to
those in topology, i.e., "rubber-sheet geometry".
