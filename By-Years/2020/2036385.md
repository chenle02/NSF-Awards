The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) project lies in an innovative antiviral coating to improve
personal protective equipment (PPE). Given the high transmissibility of
COVID-19, it is critical to manage contagion though substantive improvements to
PPE, especially face masks. The proposed antiviral composition will
significantly reduce spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, starting with
surgical face masks. This can help reduction of other surface-based pathogens as
well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a
formulation that exhibits antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and can be
applied to N95 masks without disrupting filtration requirements. To accomplish
this, the company proposes to develop fourteen optimized formulations that will
be tested on N95 masks using the companyâ€™s ultrasonic spray coating technology.
Eight formulations that exhibit acceptable spray coating parameters will be
tested in viral challenge studies with H1N1 flu virus. The four formulations
with highest antiviral activity will be further tested with relevant viruses,
including SARS-CoV-2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
