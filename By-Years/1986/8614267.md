This project is designed to establish two distinct facilities to obtain, process
and enhance polar orbitting satellite imagery of Antarctica. One system will be
located at McMurdo Station Antarctica where it will obtain, and record real time
imagery from the TIROS-N and DMSP series satellite for use in weather
forecasting in support of Antarctic inter and intra continental aircraft flight
operations. In addition, this system will provide investigators who deploy to
Antarctic an opportunity to preview imagery tapes prior to further analysis at
the facility to be established in the U.S. In conjunction with the McMurdo
facility, a complementary computer system will be established at the Scripps
Institute of Oceanography. Its function will be to archive the tapes collected
in Antarctica via the image receive system, and will provide the capability to
manipulate the data digitally to enhance the specific remote sensing information
embedded in the imagery obtained from the sensors onboard the satellites. These
facilities are unique in their provision of Antarctic remote sensing data to the
operational as well as the science research community.
