Although stable-isotope ratios inform a wide range of environmental processes
and are used increasingly in earth-system research, effective strategies for
learning about challenging stable-isotope concepts has lagged in the
undergraduate curriculum. Recent advances in instrumentation for rapid, high-
precision, and more-affordable measurements of stable isotope ratios provide an
opportunity to address this challenge. The project is developing, implementing
and evaluating student-led investigations of stable-isotope systems in upper-
division geoscience courses. The active, inquiry-based approaches are engaging
students in this important but abstract content area and leading to deeper
conceptual learning of stable-isotopic systems, with specific applications to
watershed processes and to oceanic records of ancient climate change. Hands-on
investigations, combined with concept-mapping and jigsaw approaches to pedagogy,
are being assessed through a comprehensive and multi-faceted effort, involving
both quantitative and qualitative methods. The curricular and pedagogical
approaches, as well as relevant isotopic data for teaching, are being shared
with other institutions through a web portal and conference workshops.
