Our current model for the content and structure of our Universe appears
incapable of jointly explaining the vast array of observations made possible by
current state-of-the-art telescopes. Intriguingly, these discrepancies might be
the first hints that our current cosmological model is missing something
fundamental. This project will explore the most promising areas where new
physics could potentially play an important role in shaping the evolution of our
Universe. In particular, it will focus on the possible role that “dark matter”,
“dark energy”, and neutrinos could play in resolving the current discrepancies,
as well as their possible interconnections. As part of this research, training
will be provided to a graduate student and the principal investigator will also
collaborate with a technologist to create an immersive interactive experience
aimed at the general public that helps visualize the importance of dark matter
to our Universe. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Motivated by current tensions between
different cosmological data sets, this team will perform a systematic study for
the presence of new physics in the dark matter and neutrino sectors, their
potential connection to each other, and their possible relation to a dark
energy-like scalar field sector. Focusing exclusively on models that have
natural particle physics realization and using analysis techniques that are
robust to the introduction of physics beyond the standard Lambda Cold Dark
Matter model, this project will determine whether well-motivated new physics
related to dark matter, neutrinos, or dark energy could be the cause of the
current tensions in cosmology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
