AWARD ABSTRACT

In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Rodrigo B. Andrade of Temple University (Department of
Chemistry) is studying the development of new chemical reactions to quickly
build complex nitrogen-containing molecules. An overarching goal is increasing
the efficiency of making complex molecules having broad societal impact by
minimizing the overall number of synthetic steps. An overwhelming number of such
molecules are biologically active, and can be employed in molecular biology to
understand biochemical pathways or directly applied in medicine to better
understand disease on a molecular level. The chemical insight can then be
applied in therapeutic regimes. To test the scope of these new methods, several
complex molecules derived from nature are being prepared in the laboratory.
During the development and application of these new methods, undergraduate and
graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, are being
trained in the discipline of complex molecules synthesis.

This project systematically studies and applies a novel domino Michael/Mannich
[4+2] annulation method to the synthesis of complex molecules. In Aim 1, the
nucleophilic and electrophilic components of the method are being examined to
determine the reaction scope. In Aim 2, the method is applied to the asymmetric
total syntheses of the Aspidospermatan-type alkaloids (+)-epi-condyfoline,
(+)-condyfoline, (+)-lagunamine, (+)-epi-lagunamine, (+)-condylocarpine,
(+)-isocondylocarpine, and (+)-tubotaiwine. In Aim 3, the method is used to
develop the asymmetric total syntheses of the bis-Aspidosperma alkaloids
(-)-conophylline and (-)-conophyllidine.
