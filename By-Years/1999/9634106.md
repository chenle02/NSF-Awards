OSCAR is a computer-based architecture for an artificial rational agent, based
upon a general-purpose automated reasoner. The objective of this project is to
develop a decision-theoretic planning system within the OSCAR architecture.
Existing automated planning systems tend to make unrealistic assumptions about
the planning environment, the most serious being (1) that the planner has a
fixed knowledge base that does not change over time, and (2) that it is known
with certainty what the result will be of taking any relevant action in any
describable situation. This project is aimed at relaxing these assumptions by
making use of innovative features of the OSCAR architecture. The automated
reasoner upon which OSCAR is based is capable of more sophisticated reasoning
than has been available in the past to automated planners. This will culminate
in an automated planning system capable of operating in richer environments than
has been possible in the past, and will be useful for diverse tasks ranging from
automating manufacturing to launching a space shuttle.
