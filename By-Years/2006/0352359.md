It is widely acknowledged that the Arctic Ocean plays an important role in
regulating global climate. However, there is a striking paucity of paleo-climate
records for this sensitive area. Funds are provided to core and investigate
selected seafloor targets in the Arctic Ocean as part of a trans-Arctic crossing
by the Swedish icebreaker, Oden and the USCGC Healy in 2005. This research will
establish a pan-Arctic stratigraphic and paleoclimate record back to, at least,
the last major interglacial, with special emphasis on the Chukchi region north
of Alaska. Acoustical surveys will permit locating sites with high sedimentation
rates. The initial post-cruise work will focus on core characterization. Data
will be shared with European colleagues funded through other agencies.
