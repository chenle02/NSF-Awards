Professor Rustem Ismagilov of the University of Chicago is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry program to model a complex biochemical reaction
network using chemical reactions in a microfluidic device. The biochemical
system to be studied is hemostasis -the series of eighty or so reactions of
soluble proteins, surface-bound proteins and platelets in the body leading to
blood clotting. Three modules corresponding to initiation, inhibition and
precipitation will be constructed and linked to each other. The reactions will
be maintained away from equilibrium using continuous flow inside the
microfluidic device. Quantitative experimental and theoretical methods will be
used to analyze the ability of the system to repair itself as a function of the
shear rate of flow, the size of the damaged patch, the details of fluid flow and
geometry of microfluidic channels. The methods will be useful for generating and
testing hypotheses describing the function of hemostasis and evolution of
circulatory systems. The PI is involved in making demonstration kits that
explain the value of chemistry, complexity and microfluidics available to the
public through work with the Museum of Science and Technology in
Chicago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Functional biochemical reaction networks are
complex and difficult to understand because properties of the system arise from
the interactions of individual reactions. Models must include effects such as
nonlinear reaction dynamics, compartmentalization, diffusion and flow. Recent
advances in microfluidics, in which chemical reactions are run in narrow
capillaries on a chip, permit the detailed investigative modeling of these
complex systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
