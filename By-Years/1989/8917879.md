Myc family oncogenes share a similar gene organization, encode DNA binding
nuclear phosphoproteins, possess similar oncogenic activities, and are expressed
in a distinctive temporal and spatial manner during normal murine development.
The differential or coordinate expression of myc family genes may influence the
processes leading to cellular commitment and differentiation. To better
understand the biological functions of myc family oncogenes in mammalian
development, Dr. DePinho will characterize the developmental role of c-, N-,
L-myc gene products in several well defined in vitro differentiation systems and
in the developing mouse embryo. In vitro systems he will examine the biological
impact of forced or absent myc expression on cellular differentiation. Altered
myc activity will be achieved with the help of constitutive myc expression
constructs and with the help of inducible antisense constructs. To study the
normal role of myc in the developing animal, Dr. DePinho will produce mice which
are inactive at both L-myc alleles. Gene disruption will make use of homologous
recombination and embryonic stem cell techniques to produce germ line chimeras.
The experiments proposed will provide further insight into the biological
significance of c-, N-, and L-myc in normal mouse development. %%% Genes, called
oncogenes, were first discovered due to their ability to cause transformation to
malignant phenotypes in cultured cells.. These genes have since been shown to be
involved in the normal development of an embryo. This study proposes to
determine what the role of one of these gene families plays in normal
development.
