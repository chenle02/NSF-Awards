9452593 Perkowski This project involves the use of a Programmable Active Memory
(PAM), the commercially-available prototype of the inexpensive hardware
emulator/reconfigurable computer built in lookup-table FPGA technology. This
allows the enhancement of topics already present in the curriculum. Moreover, it
allows the introduction into several undergraduate classes the new topics of
hardare emulation, reconfigurable computing, systolic processors, cellular
automata, and their high-level hardware description in language VHDL. Fast
prototyping technology allows students to concentrate more on the conceptual
phases of design and not mundane ones. Students are motivated to learn to build
more sophisticated systems of practical use. These curricular topics are taught
to all Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering majors through laboratory
demonstrations, regular experiments, and projects in the freshman, sophomore and
junior years. Students wishing to specialize in digital design (particularly
robotics) and communications, may take respective senior course sequences and
associated capstone design projects and use the fast system prototyping
technology to implement more advanced systems.
