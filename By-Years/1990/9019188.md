The interpretation of light emitted by atmospheric atoms and molecules provides
an important means for understanding the behavior of the atmosphere. The
accuracy of the interpretation depends upon the accuracy of basic knowledge of
the detailed behavior of the atoms and molecules involved. This grant aims at
providing new and better basic data for interactions important in atmospheric
research. A scattering theoretical formulation of molecular spectroscopy is used
to interpret spectroscopic data and to construct a potential matrix that
reproduces the observations. The matrix is then used to make reliable
predictions of the cross sections and rate coefficients of molecular processes
that are important in the upper atmosphere. Examples where spectroscopic data
exist are molecular oxygen, nitric oxide, the hydroxyl radical and its parent
ion. Calculations will be carried out of the quenching of metastable oxygen and
nitrogen atoms in collisions with oxygen atoms. The radiative association of
oxygen atoms will also be investigated and the emission spectrum obtained. The
quenching of metastable oxygen ions and the excitation of metastable oxygen by
proton impact will be explored.
