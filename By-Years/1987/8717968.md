In recent years, there has been a growing amount of research interests on the
finite-dimensional variational inequality and nonlinear complementarity
problems. Among the many algorithms applicable for solving these problems, one
particular algorithm stands out as the most promising. This is Newton's method.
Despite the successes this method has achieved in practice, the method is
intrinsically a locally convergent algorithm in the sense that unless the
initial iterate is close to the solution, convergence is, in general, not
guaranteed. It is the objective of our research to attempt to enlarge the domain
of convergence of Newton's method. The approach is based on the classical idea
of continuation for solving systems of nonlinear equations, and makes use of
some recent results of sensitivity analysis for the variation
inequality/complementarity problems.
