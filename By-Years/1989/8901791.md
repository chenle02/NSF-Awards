This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Matthew Barth of the
University of California, Santa Barbara, to conduct collaborative research with
Dr. Saburo Tsuji for ten months at Osaka University in Japan. They will apply
Dr. Barth's Real-time Attentive Sensing (RAS) strategy for speeding up robotic
sense-data processing to mobile robots. RAS is intended to overcome the common
robotic problem in which the processing of sensory data is often slower than the
speed with which the robot must accomplish its task. RAS first processes simple
features rapidly and in parallel, all across the senory field. It then "zeroes
in" to do detailed processing only on the features relevant to the task. The
mobile robot capabilities developed in Dr. Tsuji's laboratory will complement
Dr. Barth's experience with this processing technique and will facilitate the
verification of the technique.
