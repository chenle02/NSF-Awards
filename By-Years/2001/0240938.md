The importance of legitimacy lies in the argument that people more willingly
comply with legal authorities when they trust them and view them as entitled to
be obeyed. This willing compliance is an important supplement to traditional
deterrence-based approaches to compliance, and facilitates more effective and
efficient policing. Further, the importance of encouraging public cooperation
with and support for the empowerment of the police is increasingly being
recognized as equally central to the success of policing efforts to manage crime
and urban disorder and legitimacy also encourages cooperation and empowerment.
Hence, legitimacy is a key attribute for authorities such as the police.
However, there is evidence that police legitimacy is low, particularly among
minority group members. This research addresses this issue by exploring the
psychology of legitimacy to provide a better picture of what sustains or
undermines public trust and confidence in the police. The project builds upon a
recently completed study of a diverse sample of 1,650 New Yorkers, interview
about their views on the New York Police Department (NYPD). These respondents
will be recontacted and, where possible, reinterviewed one year after their
initial interviews to create a panel design. This dataset will then be used to
explore the dynamics of legitimacy on two levels: personal and organizational.
On the personal level, the panel data will be used to more rigorously test the
arguments about the nature of the dynamics of legitimacy during personal
experiences with legal authorities. The panel data also are used to more
effectively examine the psychological dynamics influencing legitimacy. In this
case, however, those dynamics involve the influence of legitimacy on everyday
compliance and cooperation, as well as on the willingness to empower legal
authorities. In addition, a panel dataset will allow the influence of procedural
justice on legitimacy to be more effectively modeled. These analyses explore the
role of legitimacy in the authority dynamics underlying the relationship between
community residents, the police, and the law. In addition, they test the
potential for managing those dynamics via process-based strategies of
regulation. Hence, the study will have both theoretical and policy-related
value.
