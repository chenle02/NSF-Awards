9502901 Sierks This project is on research to develop a methodology for the
selection of catalytic antibodies with specific protease activity. This research
combines a new technology of phage display for generation of a large number of
antibody sequences with a novel selection methodology employing peptidase
deficient auxotyphoic strains of s. typhimuvium where only those cells
possessing antibodies having the desired protease activity will grow. The
results of this research could have important applications in medicine and in
industry. ***
