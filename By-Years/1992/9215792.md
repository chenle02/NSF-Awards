This work attempts to actively engage the academic community in Engineering
Metrology, an area vital to manufacturing. Engineering Metrology forms the
backbone of interchangeable manufacturing. This characteristic combined with an
increasing need to manufacture to tighter tolerances, in the recent past,
dictates that a scientific approach to the issues that impact this area is
needed. Projects that will be addressed include development of methodologies for
ultra-high accuracy two dimensional stage metrology for lithography
applications, basic work in engineering metrology for threads, and development
of calibration procedures, methods and standards for atomic scale measurement
instruments. This work is critical to a variety of industries in the
manufacturing sector. The problems to be addressed in this research includes the
mechanical and micro-electronic industries. The results of this work will
provide leading edge technology to these industries and enhance their
competitiveness.
