Abstract 9320879 Forbes This project continues the study of long-period (&gt;2
day period) atmospheric planetary waves near the antarctic mesopause
(approximately 95 km altitude). The effort has 2 facets: 1. The principal
investigator (P.I.) will continue his analysis of existing radar wind
measurements made from Mawson, Molodezhnaya, and Scott Base in Antarctica and
comparison with similar measurements made from Fairbanks, AK and Heiss Island,
Russia. 2. The operation at South Pole for one year of a meteor radar to obtain
mesospheric wind data set. The radar unit will be provided by the P.I.'s Russian
collaborators, and a Russian scientist will install and operate the instrument.
