The research objective of this project is to create new knowledge, methods and
analytical tools for such auctions as the FCC's incentive auction, in which
television broadcast rights worth billions of dollars will be reassigned among
broadcasters, and Internet advertising auctions, which are the main revenue
source for many modern Internet-based companies. In the first of these
applications, there are hundreds of thousands of radio-interference constraints
that limit the combinations of rights that may be granted to broadcasters. These
constraints make this the most computationally challenging resource allocation
problem ever managed using an auction. In the second application, the hard
challenge is one of adverse selection, which arises when different bidders have
access to very different information. For example, in Internet advertising,
advertisers who benefit directly from clicks on their links are much better
informed than brand advertisers who benefit by increasing consumer awareness for
purchase decisions in brick-and-mortar stores. In this project, the PI's team
will analyze new auction mechanisms to overcome the challenges of computation
and adverse selection, and new game theoretic methods to analyze the likely
outcome of alternative auction designs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first three
tasks to be undertaken in this project are these: (1) to develop and prove
theorems about the FCC incentive auction mechanism, which involves solving an
NP-complete resource allocation problem, and to characterize how the
computational challenges affect the efficiency of the allocation, as well as the
incentives, cost, and simplicity of the auction mechanism, (2) to characterize a
new, adverse-selection free auction mechanism for Internet advertising auctions
and evaluate its performance in a variety of environments, and (3) to develop a
new game-theoretic equilibrium refinement that is both well-founded in
fundamental principles and also powerful for eliminating implausible Nash
equilibria of a class of auction games.
