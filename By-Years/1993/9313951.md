9313951 Darensbourg The primary purpose of this U.S.-Hungary research project
between Dr. Donald J. Darensbourg of Texas A&amp;M University and Dr. Ferenc Joo
of Kossuth University, Debrecen, Hungary, is to explore the special effects
which should be considered when water is used as a solvent in organometallic
catalytic processes. To do this, the researchers will study the use of aqueous
solutions as media for reactions catalyzed by organometallic complexes with
sulphonated tertiary phosphine or phosphaadamantane ligands. Four areas will be
examined in detail: 1) hydrogen transfer reactions; 2) reactions of water-
soluble phosphines with aldehydes and olefins; 3) reactions of carbon dioxide in
aqueous solutions; and 4) new reagents for organometallic chemistry in aqueous
solutions. Results are expected to improve our understanding of the properties
of catalyst recovery and recycle-ability afforded by catalytic chemical
processes carried out in aqueous solutions. This project in organic chemistry
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
leading experts in the U.S. and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents
and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
