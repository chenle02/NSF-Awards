When programming massively parallel computations, programmers must specify large
numbers of processes and their interactions, efficiently map their logical
structures onto disparate hardware structures, and debug in the absence of
reproducibility and consistent global states. Some of these activities can be
supported by extensions of sequential tools, but most require development of
novel techniques specific to parallelism. This development is made even more
challenging by the diversity of target architectures, the relative lack of
experience with parallelism, and the range in degree and granularity of
available parallelism. This research focuses on support for message-passing
architectures. During the funding period, work will continue on parallel program
specification and debugging, and begin on programming support specific to the
Connection Machine. The abstractions provided by a programming environment
determine a programmer's effectiveness in implementing and debugging algorithms,
yet few abstractions support massive parallelism. A graph grammar- based editor
can facilitate the concise, scalable specification of parallel programs as
annotated graph families. Specification, however, is not enough. Program graphs
must be available to other tools - such as debuggers, animators, and mappers -
within the environment. This work will investigate the applicability of existing
techniques, to design methods of partial visualization, and determine the
feasibility and utility of lazy graph generation. It is intended to explore the
adaptation of these graphical specification techniques for the Connection
Machine.
