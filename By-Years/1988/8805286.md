The major objective of this REU Site is to provide hands.on experience in
active research to eight undergraduate students in mechanical engineering,
including four student from schools with limited research opportunities. The
undergraduate students will carry out research under a senior professor in each
of four major research areas: vibrations/acoustics, internal combustion,
biomechanics, mechanisms/design. A special feature of the ecperience is that
during summer semesters the students will be able to work in industrial research
labs of collaborating firms. The selection procedure promotes involvement of
minority blacks and women. Student growth and independence in research work will
be encouraged through regular guidance, including weekly discussions and
thorough evaluation of objectives and summaries of work accomplished. A peer
review system whereby students provide constructive criticism to improve work of
other students will also be employed.
