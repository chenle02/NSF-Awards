With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Eastern Oregon State College will acquire an ion-trap
gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including a) development of analytical techniques
to determine changes in fatty acid composition in fish during smolting; b)
determination of the effects due to heat and light exposure on sex pheromones
used by the US Forest Service; c) weed ecology, especially allelopathy; and d)
isolation and structural eludication of biologically active naturally occurring
compounds from plant and invertebrate sources. This equipment will also be used
in advanced undergraduate courses.

Gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS) is an extremely
powerful technique used for the separation and analysis of complex mixtures.
This instrument will substantially strengthen scientific research within the
multidisciplinary program at Eastern Oregon State College and will have a
significant impact in biochemistry and environmental chemistry.
