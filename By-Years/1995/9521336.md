9521336 Steckler In the Cenozoic many margins underwent major changes in
morphology and evolved from carbonate ramp to prograding clastic shelves, while
the world climate changed permanently from a hothouse to icehouse conditions. On
NJ margin the switch from carbonate ramp to siliciclastic shelf occurred in the
early Oligocene. On the Angola margin the Eocene-Oligocene boundary time
evidenced a major erosional event. My Miocene both margins were dominated by
siliciclastic progradation and margins evolved to the modern continental margins
with flat shelves and shelf- slope breaks. This pattern is also observed at
other margins and require an increase in sediment supply from Oligocene to
Miocene. By mid-Oligocene the carbonate factory had shut down over the
previously dominant carbonate ramps. The siliciclastic shift occurs at the same
time as the development of the icehouse conditions, a long-term lowering of sea
level and increase in terrigenous sediment supply due to enhanced continental
seasonality and erosion. The study will reconstruct the African margin to
understand the shift in continental margin morphology and stratigraphy from
seismic data. Backstripping or forward modeling of the margin will be performed
to determine the approximate tectonic subsidence. ***
