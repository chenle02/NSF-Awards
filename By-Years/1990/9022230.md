Description: The PI and his collaborator at the Geological Survey of Sierra
Leone will undertake a detailed field sampling and attitude measuring program of
igneous rocks from the Freetown layered complex. The samples will be analyzed in
the U.S. for their concentrations of the platinum-group elements and other
related elements, in order to develop geochemical criteria for distinguishing
barren from mineralized rocks. This research will improve understanding of the
processes that control the concentration and dispersion of platinum-group metals
in the Freetown layered complex. Scope: This project will enable the
collaborating PI and his institution to develop skills for mineral resources
evaluation based on field mapping and rock geochemistry. Eventually, this
research will contribute to a much broader study, to include a characterization
of the magmatic framework of the Freetown complex and a greatly expanded
geochemical data base. This project is relevant to the objectives of the Science
in Developing Countries (SDC) Program with regard to strengthening scientific
and engineering infrastructure in developing countries and increasing
cooperation between U.S. scientists and engineers and their counterparts in
developing countries.
