The principal investigator will probe the connection between Heegaard Floer
homology and Khovanov homology, two theories, inspired by ideas in physics, that
have transformed the landscape of low-dimensional topology during the past
decade. The project will focus on one partially-understood connection--namely,
the relationship between Khovanov theories of tangles and Heegaard Floer
theories of their double-branched covers, first discovered by Peter Ozsvath and
Zoltan Szabo and later reinterpreted, using Andras Juhasz's relative version of
Heegaard Floer homology for sutured manifolds, by the principal investigator and
Stephan Wehrli. The naturality of the connection under various TQFT-type
operations suggests a path for developing Khovanov-type invariants for a wider
class of objects in low-dimensional topology which should, in turn, yield new
applications.

The broad aim of the present project is to improve our understanding of the
topology of 3- and 4-dimensional spaces, i.e., the properties of these spaces
that remain unchanged under stretching and contracting (but not under tearing
and gluing). Topological ideas underpin the development of efficient computer
chips and information networks. The shapes of molecules and proteins determine
their electrical properties and biological functions. Basing quantum computing
algorithms on large-scale features of a quantum system minimizes their
susceptibility to random error. Moreover, knot theory, the study of loops
imbedded in 3-dimensional space, has become increasingly important in our
understanding of how DNA behaves in cells.
