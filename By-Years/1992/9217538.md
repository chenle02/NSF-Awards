This award supports an investigation of Cretaceous and Tertiary decapod
crustaceans (crabs and lobsters) from southern South America and a comparison of
these fossils to similar faunas from Seymour Island, Antarctica. In late
Cretaceous to early Cenozoic time, South America, Australia, New Zealand, and
Antarctica formed a contiguous landmass in the southern Circum-Pacific region
and so dispersal of faunas was presumably unimpeded. Work in these regions so
far suggests that the southern high latitude region played an important role in
the evolution and dispersal of new species. However, details of evolutionary
centers and dispersal patterns remain tentative, in part because of insufficient
field studies in the Antarctic Peninsula and southern South America. This work
will alleviate part of the geographical gap in knowledge by collecting and
describing decapod crustaceans from known Cretaceous-Tertiary stratigraphic
sections in southern Chile and Argentina. Comparison of decapods from southern
South America with those known from Australia, New Zealand, and the Antarctic
Peninsula is an essential part of a paleoecological model of the entire southern
hemisphere. In addition, this work will help to define the paleogeographic
context for the unique Cretaceous-Tertiary fossils assemblages that have
recently been described from Seymour Island, Antarctica.
