This award covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics Research by a group
at the University of Washington in collaboration with other NSF and DOE
supported scientists. The group will continue studying pi and K-meson production
and decay and Mu-meson scattering at Fermilab. They also will study the
properties of proton-proton collisions at the highest attainable energies at the
Superconducting Super Collider.
