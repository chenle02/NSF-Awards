The recent establishment of a new Department of Engineering Education (DEED) at
Purdue University has laid the solid foundation of planning for a sustainable
four-year, pedagogically supported, multidisciplinary curriculum that gives
students rich, scholarly interconnections and builds bridges among disciplines.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is implementing a new multidisciplinary
engineering (MDE) program of study, housed in DEED. It comes at a time when
fast-moving, global multidisciplinary industrial environments require graduates
to have not only the traditional technical knowledge of their predecessors but
also a new and broader skill set. The MDE program will allow flexible and
sustainable responses to emerging technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core
curriculum of the newly developed MDE courses is focusing on multidisciplinary
themes, integrating research and teaching, and emphasizing team skills.
Innovative core courses are being devised around research themes that cut across
traditional discipline boundaries and systematically exposing students to
emerging research. Classes are being taught by teams of leading research faculty
in the signature areas of emphasis for engineering at Purdue and are
incorporating critical findings by experts in learning, pedagogy, and assessment
fields to build a solid educational foundation.&lt;br/&gt;
