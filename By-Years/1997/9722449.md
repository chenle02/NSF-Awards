9722449 Magasanik This U.S.-Mexico award will support a research workshop on
nitrogen metabolism in Ascomycetes, to be held in San Jose Vistahermosa, Mexico.
Organizers are Prof. Boris Magasanik of MIT and Prof. Alicia Gonzalez, from the
Cellular Physiology Institute of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico
(UNAM). The purpose of the workshop is to bring together scientists from the
United States, Europe, Australia, and Mexico to discuss the diverse mechanisms
whereby information on nitrogen abundance or lack thereof in the growth medium,
leads to the expression of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism. The meeting
will consist of one hour talks by each of the invited participants followed by
round table discussions of the topics under discussion, with emphasis on the
particular environments of the different organisms under study, their evolution,
and significance of results for higher plants and animals. Abstracts of talks
will be made available to all participants as well as to all interested
scientists. * * *
