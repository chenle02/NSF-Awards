This project will develop a fast, affordable, and miniaturized microscopy system
to image the fine ultrastructure of cells, with minimal photodamage or
photobleaching of fluorescent probes. Success of this proposal will
significantly advance the field of microscopy, specifically super-resolution
fluorescence imaging. The development of high-performance, fast, compact and
affordable microscopes will impact medical diagnostics such as cancer and
Alzheimer's disease. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator
will develop the next generation of stimulated emission depletion (STED)
microscopy for high-performance, fast, compact and affordable STED microscopes.
The PI will integrate metallic nanolaser arrays into STED systems which will
greatly improve imaging speed and reduce the size and cost of the
equipment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
