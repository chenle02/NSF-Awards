9451148 Glick This project is establishing a laboratory in the area of
bioremediation. Bioremediation involves the use of living organisms to reduce
the concentration of environmental pollutants in contaminated soils and
wetlands. It is also a relatively new field which presents excellent
opportunities to impart new concepts and laboratory techniques to undergraduate
students. A series of experiments is being developed, beginning with site
assessment and concluding with the study of the most efficient conditions under
which bioremediation occurs. Students are introduced to new concepts in both
biology and chemistry courses. The project also departs from traditional
teaching in that it illustrates the usefulness of microbes and their potential
for rehabilitating the environment. New areas of exploration provide learning
opportunities for undergraduates, and students will gain practical experience in
lab techniques using equipment which may not have been available.
