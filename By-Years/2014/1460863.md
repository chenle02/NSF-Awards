NON-TECHNICAL PART: This project continues the Interfaces and Surfaces REU site
at Clemson University focused on providing student researchers the opportunity
to conduct research that will improve current scientific understanding of
materials interfaces and surfaces. The research and program activities have been
designed to help participants have a positive research experience, and to
encourage them to pursue graduate studies and research oriented careers. The PIs
will focus on recruiting a diverse group of students to apply for and
participate in the program. Each accepted student will have an obtainable summer
research goal that is embedded within their faculty mentor's established
research program. All REU students will also participate in a workshop series
designed to enhance their laboratory experience by focusing on professional
skills and knowledge: navigation of scientific literature, laboratory
documentation, and career path options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL PART: The
Interfaces and Surfaces REU site has four clearly defined programmatic goals:
(1) providing students with the opportunity to conduct independent research with
an obtainable summer research goal using state-of-the-art characterization tools
and testing equipment commonly used in materials science graduate school and
research careers, (2) improving student awareness of the importance of
developing a research network and identifying career mentors, (3) providing
students with the training and guidance to present their work in a professional
manner at a well-attended poster session, and (4) encouraging students to
consider research careers and find a graduate program that fits their interests
and goals. Faculty mentors have been selected based on their technical research
merit and their demonstrated commitment to mentoring undergraduate researchers.
Program assessment will focus primarily on the program's impact on participants'
career plans.
