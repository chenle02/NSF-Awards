9634165 INCZE Recent studies indicate that interannual differences in
circulation processes can substantially impact retention and recruitment of fish
eggs and larvae on Georges Bank. Strong year classes of cod and haddock are
hypothesized to be associated with a relatively high degree of retention on the
Bank. This project will undertake an interdisciplinary field study along the
southern flank of Georges Bank, as part of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic
Field Studies Phase II program, to clarify the relative importance of dispersive
and advective processes affecting retention/loss, feeding, growth rates and
nutritional conditions of larval cod and haddock. The project implements a
three-dimensional circulation model that will be used in near real-time to
conduct the field program. A hindcasting model will be utilized to integrate
physical and biological observations in coupled circulation-trophodynamic
simulations. ***
