Empirical findings from the same data set can change drastically when the
underlying statistical assumptions are changed. This is because many econometric
procedures can give misleading results when an incorrect model is assumed. One
class of models, where it has been demonstrated that the empirical findings can
depend on arbitrary statistical assumptions, is models where the variable of
interest is the duration of some event such as length of time unemployed. The
purpose of this project is to carefully study the structure of commonly used
econometric duration-models, in order develop estimation strategies that are
robust in the sense that few auxiliary assumptions have to be made for them to
have desirable statistical properties. To study the usefulness of the estimation
strategies, data will be generated from a variety of models. Then estimators
will be constructed and applied to the data to see whether the true underlying
model can be determined. This project is mainly theoretical, but it will also
have important implications for empirical economic. When a model is estimated,
it is often necessary to make arbitrary assumptions in order to make the
estimation computationally feasible. It is then important to understand to what
extent the results are driven by these assumptions, and whether the results can
be expected to be robust to changes in the assumptions. The methods developed in
this project will help empirical researchers perform this task for econometric
duration-models.
