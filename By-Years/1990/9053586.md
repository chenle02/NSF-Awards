This project is a 30 month program sponsored by the Council for Basic
Education. The funds will provide stipends for 150 outstanding high school
teachers of science who wish to do an independent research project on topics
which connect science with other fields such as history of science, science and
society, science and ethics and science and the environment. The teachers will
be selected through a competitive national search process, provided summer
stipends and paired with a mentor who has done scholarly work in the proposed
field of study. Fellows will be selected on the basis of a submitted plan which
describes the topics to be explored, explains the strategy for applying the
results across disciplines and shows evidence of a collegial relationship with
fellow teachers in other disciplines so that the likelihood of disemination will
be enhanced. The independent study project must satisfy the criteria required by
the Council for Basic Education for academic rigor and cross-disciplinary links.
The Council for Basic Education will monitor each Fellow's progress throughout
the study period and evaluate the effectiveness of the fellowship project in the
classroom. The NSF grant of $600,000 will be matched by $406,029 from the
Council for Basic Education. This is a matching amount which exceeds 67%.
