This project will be designed to educate participants to become aware of how
different teaching methods affect student understanding of selected science
concepts. Building on teacher interest in doing classroom research, the STAR
model will bring teachers to a summer workshop where they will become part of a
classroom research team. In order to study how teaching methodology effects
learning, the middle school teachers in this project will need to acquire a deep
understanding of the science topics to be investigated, strategies for teaching
for conceptual change, and methods for determining levels of student
understanding. The first year's inservice and academic year follow up will deal
with selected physics topics and the conceptual change teaching model. During
the second year, leaders from twenty-five school systems will receive
instruction so that they can conduct similar projects in their own systems.
Years three and four will involve expanding the model to the life and earth
sciences. During year five, a guide for developing such inservice programs will
be produced and disseminated.
