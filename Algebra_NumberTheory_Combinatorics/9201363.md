The principal investigator on this award will consider the following local
questions in commutative algebra. (1) Is the symbolic algebra of a monomial
prime P(a,b,c) finitely generated? (2) Is there a solution to the Riemann-Roch
problem for high powers of a nef divisor on a nonsingular projective variety of
dimension greater than or equal to three? (3) Suppose that R and S are regular
local rings with the same quotient field K, and V is a valuation ring of K such
that V dominates R and S? Is there a regular local ring T such that T can be
obtained from both R and S by sequences of monodial transformations, and such
that V dominates T? This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of
the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary
flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origins, it treated figures that
could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.
Nowadays, the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from
analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as
well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.
