The research activity of this Presidential Young Investigator Award includes the
area of structural mechanics, with an emphasis on the application of advanced
analytical and numerical techniques to the study of problems in materials
characterization and structural response. Research includes fracture mechanics,
plasticity, fatigue analysis, micro-mechanics, and nonlinear dynamics, both in
academic and industrial contexts. Specific areas of research include the
following: fatigue life predictions for rolling and bearing elements, including
effects of impurities; mechanics of joints and interfaces in wood and composite
structural elements; and, global dynamics of hysteretic nonlinear dynamical
systems, with an emphasis on structural applications.
