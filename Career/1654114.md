The United States electrical grid is an example of what mathematicians call a
large graph, consisting of vertices (ex. homes, power plants, laundromats, etc.)
connected together by edges (ex. power lines). The immense size of the graph can
make it hard to study, but in some situations one can get around this by
randomly choosing a vertex (say, a house) and then analyzing only the part of
the graph that lies near that vertex. If one so samples the graph enough times,
useful information can be deduced about it without ever dealing with the whole
graph in its entirety. In this NSF funded CAREER project, the PI will apply a
similar philosophy to the study of more general geometric shapes: by randomly
sampling the geometry at different points, conclusions about global structure
can be derived. Early-career mathematicians, such as undergraduates, graduate
students and postdocs, will be heavily involved in the project. With the help of
other leading researchers, the PI will run two summer schools and three small
research groups with the aim of exposing young mathematicians to newly
developing fields. The PI will also continue to advise graduate students, to
sponsor undergraduate research, and will complete his online book "Geometry in
Two Dimensions," which presents a modern, rigorous introduction to Euclidean and
non-Euclidean geometry without many of the usual prerequisites.

Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, proved by Perelman in 2003, states that
every closed, orientable three dimensional manifold M can be cut into pieces,
each of which admits one of eight types of homogenous metrics. Of these pieces,
only the hyperbolic three-manifolds have not been classified. The Geometrization
Theorem also includes topological conditions that characterize when M itself
admits a hyperbolic metric. Mostow's Rigidity Theorem implies that any such
hyperbolic metric is unique up to isometry, so it is natural to try to extract
concrete geometric information about it from the topology of M. This program is
referred to as effective geometrization, and has been studied by the PI, Brock,
Canary, Minsky, Namazi, Souto, among many others. Much of this project can be
considered as part of this program. Measure theory plays a central role in many
of the projects proposed. Adapting a notion of local convergence from graph
theory to Riemannian geometry, the PI will bring new measure theoretic insight
to the growth of rank, Heegaard genus and Betti numbers, drawing inspiration
from the fields of measurable group theory, graph limits, and foliations.
