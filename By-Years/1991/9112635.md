Partial funding is provided for the acquisition of a two-station thin film X-ray
diffractometer for the study of synthesized polycrystalline and epitaxial thin
films. The equipment will be part of a central facility which performs general
structural characterization for a large number of research projects in surface
engineering, tribology and micromachining.
