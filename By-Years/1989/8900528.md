Symbiotic dinoflagellates are single-celled organisms that inhabit a variety of
invertebratre hosts (e.g., coelenterates). Dinoflagellates belong to a diverse
and poorly understood assemblage of unicellular organisms known as protists.
They are also important indicators of water quality, which makes them important
to ecologists and physiologists. Dr. Robert Trench is a leading researcher on
the life cycles and ecology of dinoflagellates, and he proposes to widen his
research by learning to analyze the RNA sequences of symbiotic dinoflagellates
in order to reconstruct their evolutionary relationships. Dr. Trench will learn
these techniques in the lab of Dr. Clifford Brunk of the University of
California, Los Angeles, who uses molecular techniques to study other protists.
The proposed research will equip Dr. Trench to pursue an unexplored aspect of
dinoflagellate evolution. The results of his studies will address the ways in
which symbiotic organisms come to inhabit their hosts, a question of wide
interest to biologists. The collaboration between Drs. Trench and Brunk will
energize the current efforts to understand the evolution of protists, among
which the ancestors to multicellular life will be found.
