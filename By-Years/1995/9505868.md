The focus of this research will be the synthesis and study of the reactivity of
four interesting structural types of trivalent and pentavalent iodine.
Perfluoroalkyl iodonium salts, alkyl mono-and diiodonium derivatives, cyclic
iodinanes and derivatives of pentavalent iodine will be sought during the course
of this project which also involves the training of undergraduates. With this
Research in Undergraduate Institutions award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Viktor V. Zhdankin of the Department of Chemistry
at the University of Minnesota - Duluth. Professor Zhdankin will focus his work
on extending and improving the basic knowledge on structure and reactivity of
polyvalent iodine compounds.
