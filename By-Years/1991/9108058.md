Many operations in engineering and resource management encounter optimization
problems, that is, mathematical problems of choosing optimally several factors
that affect a productivity index. These are problems of considerable
computational difficulty that have been extensively investigated in the last
three decades. This project focuses on several such problems that have a network
structure, and it relates to a class of recently proposed methods called auction
and relaxation algorithms. The problems to be addressed range from the classical
assignment, transportation, transshipment, and shortest path problems to some
new types of multiassignment problems. These problems arise very often in
practice and their size is often very large. Methodological improvements for the
solution of these problems will have significant practical impact. The
investigation will aim at the understanding of the performance of existing
network algorithms and will develop algorithms with improved performance based
on auction and relation ideas.
