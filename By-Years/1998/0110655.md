This project has as its objectives the exploration of supramolecular chemistry
with special emphasis on supramolecular photochemistry. One facet of this
exploration involves the changes in properties of molecules when they are
contained within -- and interact with the interior surface of -- zeolites. An
extension of this concept to the area of radical polymerization draws upon the
analogy of the chain-end radical being contained within a polymeric vessel.
Electron spin resonance and other spectroscopic techniques will be employed to
charactersize these radicals and to measure their rate constants of addition to
monomers. These investigations will provide knowledge concerning the crucial
polymer chain propagating steps, which are of fundamental importance to critical
issues in the field of free radical polymerization. Starburst dendrimers will be
employed as probes inside DNA and liposome supramolecular containers, giving
insight on the ability of some dendrimers to assist in the transfection of DNA
into cells.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its
support of the research and educational activities of Professor Nicholas J.
Turro of Columbia University. Professor Turro's research is in the area of
suprameolecular chemistry, wherein smaller molecules are contained within or
otherwise interact with larger molecules with attendant alterations in their
properties. These principles are likely to have important practical consequenses
in the areas of polymer chemistry as well as DNA transfection technologies. In
addition, one is able to gain knowledge about the properties of molecules as
discrete, individual entities. These studies provide important multidisciplinary
educational and training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students
of chemistry as well as for postdoctoral associates.
