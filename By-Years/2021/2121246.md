This project examines the competing visions of practices aimed at improving soil
health, called regenerative agriculture. This project will focus on a set of
recently launched company-sponsored soil health and carbon farming initiatives
in the Great Plains and New England, both regions with well-established
regenerative agriculture movements. Drawing on the perspectives of diverse
stakeholders – farmers, companies, scientists, and community members – the
project aims to understand how their visions of regenerative farming shape both
on-the-ground practices and broader debates about the future of U.S. agriculture
and its role in addressing climate change. The project’s findings will be widely
disseminated through both scholarly and public channels, and will be of interest
to agricultural decision makers, agricultural practitioners, companies,
researchers, and community members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project starts from
the premise that competing visions of regenerative agriculture can be understood
as emergent sociotechnical imaginaries. This project will employ semi-structured
interviews, participant observation and document analysis to examine a) the
origins of these emergent imaginaries, b) how they shape ongoing regenerative
agriculture initiatives; c) how these initiatives evaluate progress, and d) how
farmers and other key publics view and experience those initiatives.
Conceptually, the project will enrich the framework of sociotechnical
imaginaries by incorporating insights from social scientists’ analyses of human-
soil relations as well as from agrarian studies scholarship. It will show how
these imaginaries both draw on and inform the ways that people work with and
otherwise experience the more-than-human world. It will also consider how
visions of desirable agrarian futures are shaped by larger histories of settler
colonialism and capitalism. The project will thus call attention to how efforts
to realize and scale up such visions may build upon and potentially replicate
prior scale-making projects. Empirically, this project will undertake the first
study of corporate regenerative agriculture initiatives. It will thus advance
agri-food studies and corporate governance scholarship. By examining recently
launched corporate projects in tandem with pre-existing movements, the project
will also bring to Science and Technology Studies scholarship a fuller picture
of sociotechnical imaginaries in-the-making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
