With this award the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division is
funding Professor Jin K. Cha of the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State
University to explore the utility of the titanacyclopropane intermediates
(Kulinkovich reagent) in organic synthesis. Particular emphasis is placed at the
generation of metal keto homoenolates from cyclopropanols, along with subsequent
cross-coupling reactions. These routes offer attractive alternatives to existing
methods, as high convergency is possible to achieve segment coupling.
Additionally, the requisite reagents are inexpensive and environmentally
benign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study involves the development of
enabling technology in C-C bond formation for the preparation of useful
compounds that can be used in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry,
materials science and biology, and hence has potential for broad scientific
impact. The educational broader impact lies in the training of synthetic
chemists expected to contribute to the future workforce in science.
