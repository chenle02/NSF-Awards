The goal of the Rutgers University Camden S-STEM project is to build a
sustainable pipeline of STEM students who enter, stay, and graduate from the
university. This project is achieving this goal by: 1) increasing the number of
STEM majors through a proactive recruitment campaign, utilizing STEM
scholarships as a recruiting tool for academic talented STEM students with
financial need, 2) creating a learning community that participates in a
comprehensive program designed to improve student retention, promote academic
success and build career preparedness, 3) partnering with area high schools and
middle schools to enrich math and science education at these schools, 4)
leveraging existing strong relationships with alumni to mentor and counsel STEM
students about workplace expectations and career opportunities and to cultivate
opportunities for internships and student employment.
