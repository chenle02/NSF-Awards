9523260 This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project will
investigate the long-wave radiation environment of the antarctic marine
atmosphere in the austral winter. Specifically, the sky radiance in the five to
twenty micron wavelength region will be observed in conjunction with cloud and
surface conditions, solar radiation, and the atmospheric temperature and
moisture profile, in order to produce a high quality data set to validate
radiative transfer models that predict the total radiation field, and quantify
the partitioning of energy among the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean. The
observational phase of the project will take place on the oceanographic research
ship Nathaniel B. Palmer, in July and August of 1995. ***
