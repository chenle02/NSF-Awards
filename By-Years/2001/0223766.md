Recent advances in telecommunications, materials nanotechnology and biology have
potential implications in the area of control. The purpose of this workshop is
to define the generic methodological research needs pursuant to these advances
as: (1) they will involve a more detailed description of nature, down to the
cellular and molecular level, and (2) the next set of engineering systems will
be of a larger size and their complexity will be far greater than in the past.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is for support of a multidisciplinary workshop
that will address the research needs in the areas of Modeling, Dynamics, Control
and Monitoring of Complex Engineering Systems. It will take place in Anchorage
Alaska on May 11 and 12 following the American Control Conference. By scheduling
it to follow immediately after the ACC, the cost will be substantially lower
since most of the participants will already be on site and the meeting rooms on
Saturday will be free. The organization of the workshop aims to avoid the
segregation of issues and challenges along the traditional Engineering
disciplines. A systematic effort will be undertaken to consider issues that are
common to all engineering fields and breakout sessions will have participants
that cover all engineering disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;
