The purpose of this collaborative project is to extend the Batemen-Foust 1860
data set by collecting data for the same townships from the manuscripts of the
1880 Census of Population and Agriculture. These two data sets will then be
linked across households between the two census dates to provide a large scale
cross-section/time-series database on families, households, individuals, farms,
and communities in the second half of the nineteenth century. The resulting
composite database promises important new insights into the development of the
American economy at a critical period in its history and offers long term
research material for economic historians, demographers, rural sociologists and
scholars from other disciplines. It is also of potential interest and relevance
for contemporary research since the late nineteenth century witnessed the
structural change of America from a rural, agricultural country to an urban-
industrial one, a change analogous to the on-going shift from manufacturing to
services.
