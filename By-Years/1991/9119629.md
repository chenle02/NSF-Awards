Lisa McElwee-White of the Chemistry Department of Stanford University is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program for
continued investigation of the reactions of photochemically-generated
organometallic radical cations. Metal carbyne complexes of molybdenum and
tungsten, which also contain cyclopentadiene, carbonyl and phosphine ligands,
are the starting materials. Depending on reaction condition, the radicals
produced undergo ligand substitution or carbyne ligand rearrangement reactions.
The rearrangement reactions produce organic products stereospecifically. In this
study, the mechanism of the rearrangement reaction will be studied using
spectroscopic and isotopic labelling experiments,and a variety of carbyne
ligands will be tested. The goal of the research is to develop new methods of
organic synthesis, especially for desirable stereospecific products. %%% In this
fundamental research project, light will be used to induce the production of
organic molecules of specific symmetries. The reactant molecule, which contains
a carbon-carbon triple bond, is originally bound to a metal complex. Upon
irradiation, it rearranges in a specific way and is released to form the
product. The project will develop new methods of synthesis for various organic
products.
