A cooperative investigation will be undertaken with New Zealand scientists to
better understand the changing nature of deformation across the exposed,
subaerial portion of the forearc region of the eastern portion of the North
Island of New Zealand and compare these findings with data from a similar
tectonic setting in California. The New Zealand study area will be a transect
from Hawkes Bay westward to the Ruahine Range. California study sites will be
along faults of the San Andreas fault zone to the east and north of Cape
Mendocino. Specific investigative techniques include detailed mapping of
selected fault segments and analysis of fault-related fractures to determine
fault style, strain ratios, and axes of principal strain. Results will further
the understanding of the spatial distribution of strain across the forearc
region in such settings. Mapping may also identify additional active faults in
this moderately populated part of New Zealand. Findings will perhaps add further
insight into deformation associated with northward migration of the San Andreas
Transform Zone in California.
