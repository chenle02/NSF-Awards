9315857 Poliakoff In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division, Erwin Poliakoff of Louisiana State University will
pursue highly resolved studies of resonant photoionization using synchrotron
radiation as the excitation source. The deposition and partitioning of energy in
the product ions will be determined from dispersed fluorescence. Highly resolved
data are thus accessible over a broad electron energy range to help elucidate
the photoejection dynamics. These data will be applied to systems which are
vibrationally resolved for polyatomic targets and rotationally resolved for
diatomic molecules. %%% In the experiments performed in this project, the
motions that electrons make when molecules dissociate under the influence of
high energy light will be correlated with the motions of the nuclei. The light
used in these studies will come in part from a synchrotron radiation source at
Louisiana State University. The data acquired in these studies is inaccessible
by other techniques and will be used to guide and shape theoretical models for
these processes. ***
