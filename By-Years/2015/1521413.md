The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation (SBIR)
Phase I Project is the demonstration of metal nanomeshes as a disruptive new
technology. This innovation has the potential to exceed the performance of
indium tin oxide, the industrial standard transparent conductor. The key
features of the proposed technology are that it can be processed atmospheric
pressure and low temperatures, the metal nanomeshes feature high durability,
which may enable new touch screen applications, and the metal nanomeshes exhibit
uniform performance over micron length scales. Opportunities are anticipated in
touchscreen devices. Additional opportunities may emerge in organic light
emitting diode displays, lighting and solar cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop new
metal inks and metal patterning techniques to print metal nanomesh structures
with high transparency and low sheet resistance. The key advantages of the new
metal inks are that they decompose at low temperatures, solidify into pure
metals with high conductivities, demonstrate high conductivity at sub-micron
film thicknesses, bend and flex without cracking, and exhibit versatility in
variety of industrial printing processes. Simulations studies will be utilized
to understand how to design nanomeshes with high transmission, low sheet
resistance, and low haze. New additive printing processes that pattern sub-
micron features from metal inks will be developed. Metal nanomeshes are expected
to exhibit high durability under bending and deformation.
