PI: Murfee, Walter Proposal Number: 1159300

Since 1987, the senior capstone design course in the Department of Biomedical
Engineering at Tulane University has been focused on designing technologies for
persons in the community with disabilities. Over 700 students and 180 clients
have benefited from this design experience. This proposal requests support for
team project supply costs that will enable the continuation of this course. In
conjunction with their coursework in the sequence BMEN 4030-4040 Team Design
Projects, biomedical engineering undergraduate students will form
multidisciplinary teams to address the needs of individuals with disabilities in
their therapeutic, work, home, or school environments. The teams, working with
their client directly or working with their client's institution will design,
construct, evaluate, and deliver a technology or device that solves an immediate
client need. The primary objectives of our senior design course are to provide a
meaningful design experience for biomedical engineering students, enhance the
professional development of Tulane biomedical engineering students and provide
assistive technologies or devices that are not otherwise available to
individuals with disabilities or institutions serving them.

The intellectual merit of the program includes facilitation of the transition of
biomedical students from school to practice and the development and
dissemination of new knowledge. Students will apply formal knowledge learned in
courses to real engineering problems that require the ethical perspective and
conduct required of the engineering profession. Throughout the year long course
and related design process, student teams will communicate their progress via
formal reports, presentation of prototypes at a design show, design contest
entries, potential patents and publication of abstracts and papers.

The broader impacts resulting from this work include the enhancement of
education infrastructure, providing a benefit to the society, and advancing
discovery and understanding while at the same time promoting teaching, training,
and learning. The student design projects will directly enhance the lives of
individual clients. Clients will receive technologies that solve real problems
limiting their daily function. In addition, design projects will be disseminated
to enable a wide audience to use these solutions. The guided interactions
between students, instructors, therapists, and clients will permit the sharing
of knowledge from multiple perspectives and areas of expertise. The student
participants will also gain greater awareness of the problems of individuals
with disabilities and the ability to communicate with and about people who have
disabilities.
