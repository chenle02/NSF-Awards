9418323 Reid The origin of Th-Pb isotope variations in mantle lithosphere
beneath the western USA will be investigated by examining basalts from three
areas: the Western Great Basin (WGB), Snake River Plain (SRP), and western
Colorado Plateau and its transition zone. These areas highlight complementary
and contrasting processes that may have exerted significant control on the
ultimate Th-Pb characteristics of the lavas including lithosphere formation and
mineralogy (all areas), subduction-related metasomatism of mantle sources (WGB
and SRP), and plume-related enrichment of mantle sources (SRP). Result obtained
to date reflect a limited sampling of two of these areas but show that Th
isotope disequilibria can be related to processes of partial melting and to
characterizing mantle reservoirs and their origin. Th isotope data will be
obtained for late Pleistocene to Holocene basalts from tectonomagmatic provinces
in the western USA selected for their likelihood to yield important constraints
on the nature and evolution of mantle lithosphere. In addition to Th, these
basalts will be characterized for their Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope compositions.
Within the framework of complete major and trace element and isotope analyses,
disequilibrium in U-Th isotope systematics will be used to consider the
conditions of partial melting and possible origins for lithospheric signatures
in basaltic magmas.
