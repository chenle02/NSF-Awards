This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The VCU Noyce Initiative is a
collaborative project between Virginia Commonwealth University's School of
Education and its College of Humanities and Sciences, in partnership with
Richmond City, Henrico County, Chesterfield County, and Hopewell City Public
Schools. The project is supporting and preparing 32 undergraduate students to be
effective secondary science teachers in high-need schools. Undergraduate
students are recruited in their junior year and initiated into teaching through
an internship program at a summer enrichment camp for middle school students
from high-need schools. Throughout their academic training, students are
mentored by university faculty. During their senior year, they participate in
undergraduate research that focuses on the scientific process and develop
accessible, low-cost experiments that are disseminated to all NSF Noyce
Scholars. The program prepares 18 "master science teachers" (Noyce Teaching
Fellows) using the research-based Santa Cruz New Teacher Center mentoring model
to work with Noyce Scholars during the year-long residency and critical first
years of teaching. Focused efforts are made to attract and support a diverse
group of participants. The long-term goals of this VCU Noyce Initiative are to
recruit top science students to teaching, to decrease turnover and stabilize
secondary science teaching faculties in high-need schools, to facilitate
partnerships between science and education faculty, and to enrich community
partnerships.
