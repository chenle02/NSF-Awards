The research objective of this award is to study a service provider facing an
arrival stream of delay-sensitive, strategic customers. The "type" of a customer
consists of her valuation for service and her delay sensitivity (waiting cost).
While the distribution of customer types may be known, or partially known, an
individual's customer type is not known. The research approach is to study a
continuum of customer valuations (rather than a finite number), enabling the
analysis of infinitely many price/delay combinations. The deliverables of this
research will include a revenue-maximizing incentive-compatible menu of prices,
where a customer pays a higher price to receive higher queuing priority, and
hence lower delay. Additionally the research will deliver modeling and analysis
tools and revenue and welfare comparisons under different customer
types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will solve a timely
problem: how to allocate and price service priority to customers, where the
customers are heterogeneous in their valuations (available funds)and in their
delay sensitivities and are willing to lie about these. The award will produce
simple closed-form optimal price menus that charge different prices for
different priority levels, so as to optimize profit for the service provider.
The research is made possible by a combination of two very different research
areas: incentive-compatible pricing and queuing theory and contributes to a
long-term ongoing international collaboration in pricing and queuing between
Carnegie Mellon and the TUE/EURANDOM Institute in the Netherlands. The
mathematics developed will also help train graduate and undergraduate students
as well as Math Olympiad K-12 students in the Western PA ARML team and will
contribute to the SWAN program on optimal adoption placement.
