ZELMANOV, 97-04132 We focus on a number of longstanding open problems in algebra
and topology that are related to the Burnside Problem. A secondary topic is the
study of narrow groups and Lie algebras, in particular, we consider the
classification of the so called superconformal algebras and of pro-unipotent
groups of maximal class. The area of proposed research is Combinatorial Algebra.
Combinatorial Group Theory appeared about a hundred years ago as a study of
certain infinite groups that arise in Topology. Throughout these years it has
more or less focused on the following three mainstream problems : (i) groups
presented by generators and relators, (ii) growth, (iii) the Burnside Problem.
Starting with 1940s similar problems have been considered and intensively
studied for infinite - dimensional associative and Lie algebras. This extension
of scope of research was motivated (a) by the intrinsic needs of Algebra and in
particular of Combinatorial Group Theory, (b) by applications to Functional
Analysis, Representation Theory, Number Theory and (increasingly in recent
years) by Mathematical Physics.
