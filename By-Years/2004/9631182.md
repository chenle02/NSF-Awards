Theoretical research will be carried out in cosmology and astrophysics, and its
relations to elementary particle physics. The focus will be on phase transitions
which may occur in astrophysical settings. Topics will include the effects of
such phase transitions on symmetries of nature, the phase transition which may
produce a condensate of `strange` particles in neutron stars, and the
possibility of reheating about a phase transition (occurs during cooling in the
universe. All these topics are important to our efforts to understand the
evolution of the universe.
