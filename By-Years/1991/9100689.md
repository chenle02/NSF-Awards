This project will develop the optics portion of an upper- level physics major
laboratory course. Undergraduate physics majors will play an important role,
under the guidance of the Principal Investigator, in developing the actual
experiments and then in preparing the manuals and syllabi. This involvement of
undergraduates will bring in an important point of view. The results will be
shared widely with other schools.
