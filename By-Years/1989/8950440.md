This project will improve early computer science education at City College by:
(1) providing hardware and software that are very much better suited to teaching
elementary computer science than existing equipment; and (2) building early
courses in which lecture theory and laboratory practice reinforce each other,
leading to faster progress and deeper understanding. Both parts are essential:
improved pedagogy would be very difficult using existing equipment and software,
and new equipment without innovative pedagogy would be wasteful. With the new
equipment they will develop course presentation methodology that makes the
lectures more meaningful by immediately applying the ideas in a laboratory
setting. Conversely, issues raised by prepared assignments in the laboratory
experience will stimulate thinking about issues in such a way as to make
subsequent lectures more meaningful.
