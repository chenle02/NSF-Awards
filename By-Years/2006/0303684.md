NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0303684&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences: Singularly
Perturbed Convection-diffusion

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will establish establish sharp pointwise
bounds on the derivatives of the solution of a singularly perturbed convection-
diffusion problem in a polygonal domain, with an emphasis on the interaction
between boundary layers and corner singularities and under the assumption of
arbitrary smoothness of the data. The work will also develop applications of
these bounds in numerical algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
investigates some differential equations of the type used in modeling fluid flow
and transport. Emphasis is placed on properties of solutions with rapid
transitions arising from boundary layers and corner singularities. These
properties relate to the underlying solution structure, the competing effects of
diffusion, convection and boundary irregularities (corners) contributing to this
structure, and the resulting numerical approximability of the solutions. The
award supports travel for collaborative research between Martin Stynes,
University College, Cork, Ireland, and Bruce Kellogg, University of South
Carolina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
