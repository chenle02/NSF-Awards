The proposal seeks to support participation of US-based mathematicians,
especially those in the early stages of career, at the international conference
"Finite Dimensional Integrable Systems 2023, to be held at the University of
Antwerp, Belgium, on August 7-11, 2023. The conference will bring together
leading experts, early-career researchers, and graduate students in this far-
reaching and fast-growing area of research. The conference web site is

The conference focuses on recent progress in the study of integrable systems
with a finite number of degrees of freedom, a subfield of the theory of
completely integrable systems that grew out of the now classical work of
Lagrange, Jacobi, Kovalevskaya, Noether, Poincare, and others. In the second
half of 20th century, KAM theory, due to Kolmogorov, Arnold and Moser, revealed
new perspectives on integrability problems, stimulating progress in the area and
the development of powerful techniques that bridge mathematics and physics.
These have resulted in the discovery of new kinds of integrable systems, broader
applications in physics and geometry, and solutions to long-standing open
questions. The conference will survey recent progress in the field, present new
directions of research and applications, and foster collaborations.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
