Three faculty, two research associates and four graduate students will continue
their research in elementary particle physics. The university based effort uses
facilities at Fermilab, one experiment at the Tevatron Collider (E740 at the D0
interaction region) and the second an experiment with neutrinos, in the final
stage of completion. The Collider experiment is a large collaborative effort to
study proton- antiproton collisions at the highest energies available at
accelerators. The group has had responsibility for major subsystems of the
detector, the fast trigger system, the implementation of the cosmic ray shield
and the overall management of the test-beam program at Fermilab. The collider
experiment will explore the high energy frontier of particle physics, an unknown
arena at the limit of applicability of the current theory of particle physics.
