This action funds Henry Lo of the University of Massachusetts Boston to conduct
a research project, entitled "A graph-based road model for plotting GPS
trajectories," during the summer of 2012 at Tongji University in Shanghai,
China. The host scientist is Professor Weian Wang.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in advancing GPS
information extraction, the production of a general graph model for
understanding trajectories, and developoing a framework from which further data
mining techniques on spatio-temporal sequences can be developed. The research
involves merging GPS and road data into a network model to understand traffic
flows and trajectories and developing algorithms that quickly and correctly
extract interesting patterns from the model.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a
first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
