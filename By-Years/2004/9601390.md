Founded at the height of the French Revolution, situated at the world's premier
institution for the study of natural history, the menagerie of the Museum
D'Histoire Naturelle in Paris was conceived to have not only great scientific
potential but also significant social, political and moral potential. This
history of the first fifty years of the menagerie's existence aims to illuminate
several related topics: (1) the functions originally conceived for the
menagerie, and how these functions were realized, revised or reformulated; (2)
the animals included in the menagerie and how they influenced scientific and
popular understanding of animal nature; (3) the problematic role living animals
played in French zoology and in the life of the Museum; (4) the character of
scientific research practice as displayed in the studies of animal behavior
conducted at the menagerie by Cuvier.
