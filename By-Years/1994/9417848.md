This award is for support for three years of funding to perform physical and
visible studies of ice cores from the Siple Coast drainage of West Antarctica,
for paleoclimatic and ice-dynamical purposes. The visible inspection will help
to assess the utility of visible annual layering for dating purposes of ice
cores from West Antarctica and studies of an ice core from Ice Stream C will
provide a calibration of passive seismic measurements being made by another
group on Ice Stream C. The results of this study should provide essential
information for dating of the ice cores planned from West Antarctica and should
lead to a better understanding of the processes controlling fabric development
and flow of ice.
