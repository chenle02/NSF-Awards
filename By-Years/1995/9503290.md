9503290 Khoshnevisan Abstract The N-parameter Brownian sheet is a mean zero
Gaussian process which is obtained by integrating standard white noise on
N-dimensional rectangles with two sides on the axes. The investigator and his
colleagues propose to investigate some of the probabilistic and analytical
properties of this process. This process locally exhibits many features of the
solutions to a class of stochastic partial differential equations. As such, our
proposed analysis would have ramifications in the study of hyperbolic stochastic
partial differential equations. Also considered will be the properties of the
graph of the Brownian sheet viewed as a non-smooth random surface. The problems
of interest include certain questions involving transport problems on some
random erratic fractures and surfaces. Idealized versions of such objects appear
in recent investigations in the engineering and physics literature. The proposed
research involves a systematic study of a class of random processes which arise
in several areas of mathematics as well as in physics and engineering. Such
problems include but are not limited to transport problems, wave phenomena and
turbulence. The underlying common theme in many such problems is a mathematical
object called the Brownian sheet. With only a few exceptions, the geometry of
the Brownian sheet is a largely unexplored area; primarily due to the fact that
there are not many general methods for its study. Among other works, it is the
goal of this proposal to make some attempts at remedying this situation.
