This project concentrates on nearly-integrable nonlinear wave equations, that
is, integrable partial differential equations and their perturbations. One of
the goals is to use a complement of pure mathematical theory, perturbation
theory, and numerical experiments to describe, understand, and predict the
behavior of these systems. A second goal is to apply these tools and concepts to
study specific systems that arise in nonlinear optics. A third goal is to use
nearly integrable systems as a model for formulating questions of a statistical
nature about the physics of nonlinear interactions and nonlinear mode selection
mechanisms. The theme here is to focus on solutions, first the exact integrable
solutions and then their behavior under perturbations. The integrable theory
yields explicit solutions and the full set of parameters for each N-mode
solution, stability within the integrable system, and the nearby solutions that
result from unstable solutions. Then numerical experiments on the perturbed
systems test whether nearly-integrable dynamics can be approximated by modulated
N-mode integrable solutions. If so, the corresponding perturbed equations are
derived. These tools are brought to bear on specific applied projects.
Integrable systems of partial differential equations often have solutions whose
properties can be exactly established. This is quite unlike the usual case for
nonlinear partial differential equations. What is important here is that often
the properties remain when the system is perturbed. Thus one can tell a great
deal about otherwise intractable problems. Such problems arise in nonlinear
optics (for example, in the design of long-distance communication networks using
fiber optics and the design of optical cavities for very fast switches), in the
motion of waves in nonlinear acoustic media, and in flows around thin wings.
