*** 9760568 Sherman This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I program will
demonstrate the ability to fabricate a low cost titanium foam structural
material. The resulting syntactic foam will offer improved structural efficiency
without the limitations of currently available honeycomb core sandwich
structures by improving the properties (primarily shear) of the core material
and the care/facesheet bond. The primary objectives of the proposed program will
be demonstrating improvements in structural efficiency and design flexibility
that can be achieved using a titanium foam core sandwich panel, while,
eliminating current sandwich panel design limitations. Powdermet will
demonstrate the fabrication of syntactic titanium foam with 50-80% microsphere
loadings using metal encapsulated ceramic microspheres prepared using chemical
vapor deposition and consolidated through either sintering or a modified OSPREY
process. The end result will be a low cost, high strength and structurally
efficient syntactic titanium foam composite material. Aside from the obvious
airframe applications of sandwich panels (a multibillion-dollar market),
commercial spinoffs in spacecraft, sporting equipment, robotics, medical
implants, automobiles, and other critical stiffness-driven material
applications, as well as other specialized markets including filters and noise
suppression structures, represent tremendous commercial potential for a reliable
foam core sandwich structure. ***
