This engineering education research project seeks to understand different
mechanisms of integrating engineering content and standards into K-12
classrooms. The project will use a mixed methods design incorporating multiple
case studies and data sources to elucidate the strategies teachers use and the
obstacles they encounter in addressing engineering standards in the K-12
classroom. The project seeks to provide theoretical understanding of various
methods of integrating engineering content into classrooms by working closely
with teachers in custom-designed teaching laboratories.

The broader significance and importance of this project are to understand
various ways of integrating STEM content into K-12 classrooms and thus
potentially broaden the pipeline into college STEM programs and STEM careers. As
more states integrate engineering into K-12 content and standards, this study
which will elucidate effective means to support this integration has potentially
broad impact. The projects rigorous focus on a diverse cross-section of schools
may help to make the results broadly generalizable.
