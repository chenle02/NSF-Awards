This award provides funds to upgrade the Vertebrate Embryology (ZY 302)
laboratory in the Department of Zoology and Wildlife Sciences at Auburn
University. The money will be use to re- orient the course toward a more
"developmental" approach to the subject of embryology. Specific experiments that
consider gene activity and the differentiation of cells will be developed. Light
and UV-epifluorescence microscopy will be used in conjunction with dissected and
fixed tissues from different opisthobranch and insect embryonic and larval
stages. These developmental stages will have been incubated with appropriate
stains or fluor-labeled antibodies such that gene activation and cell
differentiation can be demonstrated. Students will obtain first-hand experience
with state-of-the-art microscopical equipment and histological and
immunofluorescent techniques. Their experience will include consideration of
monoclonal versus polyclonal antibodies for developmental immunohistochemistry
and discussion of cellular mechanisms involved in differentiation. Laboratory
reports characterized by an analysis of their photographed experimental results
will enhance the student's understanding of the developmental phenomena
considered. Choices of equipment for this project have been based on quality,
cost, durability, and compatibility with existing equipment. It will be possible
for the equipment to serve additional use in undergraduate Special Topics
courses (ZY 498) related to Developmental Biology. The grantee is matching the
award from non-Federal sources.
