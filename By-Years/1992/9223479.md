The purpose of this research is to develop models for child care for estimating
the effect of regulation on the quality of care children receive and the price
that families, government, and employers pay for care. Hedonic models are
developed which provide a means of incorporating the pervasive heterogeneity of
child care services. Knowledge of the effect of regulation on the price and
quality of care is valuable for informing the public and private debate
regarding child care policy and may allow adoption of child care policies that
more efficiently achieve quality care for children. To estimate the models,
national data collected by the 1990 National Child Care Survey and the Profile
of Child Care Settings are used.
