The objective of this project is to supplement classroom presentations of the
fundamentals of mechanical vibrations with classroom demonstrations and
laboratory measurements by students. Equipment and instrumentation are needed to
excite and measure mechanical system response. Various spring-mass systems (with
and without dashpots) will be built for use by instructor in the classroom and
by students in the laboratory. The spring-mass will be simple models of one,
two, and many degrees of freedom and will be designed to interface with theory.
Equipment is needed to excite these systems in a controlled manner.
Instrumentation is needed to measure the excitations and system responses. Major
equipment includes a shake table, modal analysis system with fast Fourier
transform analyzer, PC computer with printer and plotter, and accelerometers.
Eight laboratory experiments are designed to support fundamental mechanical
vibration theory. The project is significant because it gives a physical
dimension to complex theory and exposes students to modern vibration measurement
and analysis techniques.
