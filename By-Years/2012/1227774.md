ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;03 August 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1227774&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Miami&lt;br/&gt;PI: R.
Kniffin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests two Shipboard Scientific
Support Equipment (SSSE) items for the R/V WALTON SMITH which is operated by the
University of Miami; namely a new reverse osmosis water maker and engineering
evaluations of the aft deck cranes for compliance with emergent UNOLS Research
Vessel Safety Standards. These items will either improve safety or enhance the
vessel?s science support capability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The
R/V WALTON SMITH supports federally funded scientific research in the southern
Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico in order to expand human knowledge of the
ocean environment. During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and
undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography. Pubic outreach is also achieved
through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, open house events,
and educational cruises. The WALTON SMITH is scheduled to complete approximately
40 NSF sponsored days in 2012.
