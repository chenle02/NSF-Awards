Hargraves 9400669 With scientific, political and public concern about effects of
coastal pollution and global climate change on marine species biodiversity,
there is an urgent need for accurate identification of phytoplakton. Currently
used manuals for identification of plankton diatoms of the northeast U.S. coast
are inadequate to fill this need for several reasons: outdated taxonomy;
inadequate inclusiveness of taxa; insufficient descriptors and/or illustrations;
and limited geographic applicability. This research will permit completion of an
identification manual for plankton diatoms, to include general aspects of diatom
biology (habit, ecology, life cycles, morphology, biogeography) and a complete
flora of and key to verified species (taxonomic history, detailed illustrations
of morphology, interspecies comparisons and regional distribution). New and
recent samples (Bay of Fundy to Chesapeake Bay; estuarine to continental shelf)
will be collected to supplement an existing data base of about 1100 microscope
slides and 1600 liquid preserved samples. There is currently no such manual in
existence for the northeast U.S.. In addition to a printed manual information
will be incorporated into the Linnaeus computerized identification program. The
data will also be entered into a suitable data management system compatible with
those at the ANSP (Philadelphia) and the CAS (San Francisco), and as much as
feasible with the ARC/INFO GIS system at the University of Rhode Island. It is
expected that the manual and data will be: usable by non-specialists;
stimulating and adjunct to a variety of marine biological/oceanographic studies;
accessible via printed and electronic media; and able to maintain its usefulness
on a decadal scale.
