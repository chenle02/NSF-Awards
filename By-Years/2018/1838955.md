The investigators will bring together diverse researchers who work in the field
of collective and emergent behavior. Collective and emergent behavior is the
study of complex biological and social systems, ranging from bacterial colonies
to human groups. The hackathon-style workshop draws researchers around
identifying best practice mechanisms for sharing data, communicating methods of
data analysis, and reusing publicly available data. The investigators propose a
series of two workshops where teams of 2-5 participants work on a specific
project during the duration of the 3-day event. An objective of the workshop is
to foster novel collaborations between researchers in biology, data science,
mathematics, computer science and physics, all of whom have an interest in
collective behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
