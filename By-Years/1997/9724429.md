This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at Eastern Michigan University to acquire a multi-angle
laser light scattering spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a
number of areas including the following: (1) determination of accurate molecular
weight of novel polybenzotriazoles, (2) study of the laser photothermal surface
lensing effect, (3) studying the photogenerated thiols for epoxy curing, (4)
metal-catalyzed thermal decomposition of synthetic lubricants, and (5) probe of
the changes in the molecular shape of proteins and RNA of known molecular
weight. A laser can provide important information about chemical reactivity. Its
use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of
reactivity and non-reactivity of molecules..
