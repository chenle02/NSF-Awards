Many realistic image synthesis algorithms have been devised, but unfortunately
they tend to be very inefficient, often requiring hours or days of calculation.
As a result, the visual cues provided by these algorithms (shading, shadows,
transparency, reflections, etc.) still have not been used routinely by
applications requiring visualization, primarily because they are not supported
in real-time on current generation graphics workstations. However, both
increased performance and greater functionality can be expected in future
generation workstation. This research project develops efficient high quality
image synthesis algorithms. The project will attack several specific areas.
Continuing to develop the theory behind rendering so that it has a sound basis
in physics and mathematics continuing the development of fast hierarchial
algorithms based on wavelets for solving the rendering equation. Investigating
various hybrid algorithms that combine the best features of the finite element
and Monte Carlo approaches. Finally investigating various issues that result
from the need to handle very large, complex environements. The algorithms will
be implemented in an experimental image synthesis system that is being developed
and they will be tested on a variety of different scenes and environments.
