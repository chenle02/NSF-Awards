9629066 Delfyett Research activities are being undertaken in the area of ultra-
high speed photonics. Potential applications include networking and
communications, advanced instrumentation and signal processing. The research
undertaken contains three major components: 1. semiconductor laser device
development of a high repetition rate mode-locked semiconductor laser; 2. the
development of a new optical amplifying media from Cr4+ :LiAI02 and V3+ :LiGaO2
provide gain at communications-relevant wavelengths and; 3. applications of the
forementioned components in an ultrafast hybrid WDM-TDM slotted ring all optical
network. Students will be trained in the technically vital areas of optics,
communications and signal processing. Fundamental processing, packaging and
manufacturing skills will be obtained by participating undergraduate and
graduate students. ***
