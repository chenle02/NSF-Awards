Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A two-dimensional phase Doppler
particle analyzer is required. This is used in an investigation of fuel sprays
and air mixing in lean direct-injection four-stroke spark-ignition engines; a
study of fuel/air mixing in a cold-start port-injected spark-ignition engine;
the development of an understanding of how oxygenates blended in diesel fuel
impact in-cylinder spray combustion characteristics and pollutant formation;
experiments on and modeling of port injection processes including spray/wall
impingement, backflow, microexplosion, and particle dispersion; and an
experimental study of particle dispersion in the turbulent wake of a
cylinder.&lt;br/&gt;
