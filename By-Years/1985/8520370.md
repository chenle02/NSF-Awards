This study investigates the mechanisms that are involved and development of
quantitative criteria in the segregation of food powders. One of the major
findings of the investigation so far is the phenomenon o migration of already
adhered fines to particles of another powder. This migration depends on a
selective surface affinity and can be used to remove dusts from particles and
equipment by a dry process. The same phenomenon, however, can also have an
adverse effect on the appearrance of powders having absorbed colorants or
influence the type of distribution of fines within ordered mixtures in general.
Whether there exist distribution coefficients that depend on the particle's
chemical species and surface properties has not yet been established nor has the
kinetics of such processes been quantified. Attrition experiments have produced
a large body of data and quantitative information on the process and its
kinetics. It is planned to use this information, as well as data from the
literature, for testing the applicability of mathematical models and computer
simulation methods.
