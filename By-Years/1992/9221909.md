The central theme of the research program is to study how the nuclear activity
present in luminous quasi-stellar objects (QSO)and powerful radio galaxies is
related to their environments and what physical mechanisms are the cause of
these phenomena. The studies will include an intensive study of the inner
structure of QSO host galaxies at low redshifts, an imaging and spectroscopic
investigation of a complete sample of radio galaxies, and a program to determine
morphological properties of rich clusters associated with QSOs by identifying
specific galaxies at QSO redshift to faint limiting magnitude. The Principal
Investigator is regarded as a world leader in this research area.
