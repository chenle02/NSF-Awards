Emergent macrophytic halophytes from salt marshes of the Atlantic coast of the
U.S.A. will be surveyed throughout the year for epiphytic fungi. Specimens will
be cultured and examined using both light and electron microscopy. Collections
will be accessioned in the Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS) Herbarium
(University of North Carolina). Isolates will be deposited at the American Type
Culture Collection. Specimen data will be entered in an already established
database at IMS. A species list will be published.
