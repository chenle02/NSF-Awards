Energetic materials is a collective name for a group of materials that are
capable of releasing energy by chemical reactions. The group includes
explosives, propellants, and pyrotechnics, as well as other chemical materials
that can react and explode if improperly used or handled. The industrial use of
energetic materials for military and industrial purposes is increasing. New
technology is opening up new applications beyond the uses in metal forming, oil
recovery, mining, etc. Industry's increased usage and interest in this area
represents an opportunity for an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Energetics Materials. This project is studying the feasibility and viability
for an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Energetic Materials
at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. Alternative organizations,
policies, and operations for a center are being studied. The research interests
and needs of industry in this area being determined. The potential for the
envisioned center to become self-sufficient with industry support is also being
determined.
