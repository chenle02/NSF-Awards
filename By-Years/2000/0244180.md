The University of Arkansas continues operating a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) Site. Ten undergraduate students are recruited nationwide
every year for a ten-week summer research experience, with a recruitment focus
on undergraduates from Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the
region. The theme of the REU Site is Modern Optics and Optical Materials.
Undergraduate students participate in research projects addressing synthesis,
characterization and modeling of glasses, semiconductors, and other optical and
laser materials. In addition to participating in individual research projects,
REU students attend lab tours and professional development
seminars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site is supported by the Department of
Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
