The Geography Department is establishing a Digital Earth Sciences Laboratory
(DESL) for use by sophomores, juniors, and seniors in Botany, Geography,
Geology, and Zoology courses. The students are utilizing the DESL to obtain
information about Earth's biosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere
via acquisition of data from the field observations and from remote sensing
methods. By integrating information from both the biological and earth sciences
the students are able to model an ecosystem's response to natural or human
caused environmental changes.
