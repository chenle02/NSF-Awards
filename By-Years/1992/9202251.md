This study will develop methods for inferring the emplacement conditions of
submarine lava flows based on their surface morphology and texture, using
laboratory simulations, modeling and mapping of undersea flows. Laboratory
experiments will use polyethylene glycol in tanks of cold sucrose to simulate
silicate lavas. Dredge samples will be used to estimate eruption rates of flows
from their crystal content and rheological properties. The results will
ultimately lead to constraining models of ridge evolution.
