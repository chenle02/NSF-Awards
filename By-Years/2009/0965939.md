Twenty undergraduate students are receiving S-STEM scholarships in the pursuit
of either an Associate or Baccalaureate degree in Chemistry or Biochemistry in
the Department of Chemistry at Idaho State University (ISU). Of these
scholarships, eight are four years and are designed for in-coming freshman;
twelve are for an average of two years, targeting previously enrolled students
and transfer students. This project focuses on undergraduates from a region of
the country with a disproportionate number of economically-disadvantaged
students. This effort links with other ISU assets, including both an American
Chemical Society-supported Project SEED program and specialized on-campus
recruiting staff that works with under-represented students and facilitates
their academic success after receiving a scholarship. With proper financial and
academic support, student retention and placement of students upon graduation
will be enhanced. The project's objectives are to provide support services to
ensure a retention rate of at least 70% among scholarship holders; and that
after obtaining a degree, to have at least 90% of scholarship recipients either
continue their education or enter into STEM careers.
