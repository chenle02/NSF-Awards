9224748 deBoor This project focuses on optimal approximation and interpolation.
The work expands on recent research on approximation orders in the quadratic and
supremum norms. It is expected that the approximation order of the intermediate
Lebesgue spaces will remain constant. In addition, work will be done on finding
the dimension of box spline approximation spaces in three dimensions. Efforts
will be made in seeking a Fourier analysis approach to solve approximation order
questions in seeking a more general approach applicable to any scale, whether
local or not. Further research will be carried out on shift-invariant spaces
using shifts of radial functions as suitable approximants or restricted families
of functions. New approaches to the wavelet construct, the multiresolution
analysis, has led to an expanded nonstationary wavelet which may have practical
benefit. Related to this will be a close study of the stability of shifts of
solutions of dilation equations in terms of their Fourier transforms. Continuing
research on approximation of surfaces and the problems of blending patches of
surfaces will continue. At the present time, blended patches are only
satisfactory when the given surfaces are relatively flat. Better understanding
is needed to tell whether a given surface can be well represented by a few
blended patches. Approximation theory combines techniques of special functions,
numerical analysis and functional analysis to analyze complex problems in which
closed form or simple solutions are not feasible. By its very nature, such
research carries an implicit goal involving application to questions of the
physical world, although some of the work can be highly theoretical. ***
