This workshop will be convened to examine and discuss current theoretical
understanding of the interaction of very high-intensity short-pulse laser light
with electrons and atoms, and to assess the possibilities for experimental
studies of new theoretical predictions. The focus of the workshop will be on new
aspects of single-electron phenomena in strong and super-strong laser fields.
