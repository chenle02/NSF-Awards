This award funds the research activities of Professor Jeffrey A. Harvey at the
University of Chicago.

There are four known forces in nature: the force of gravity, the electromagnetic
force, and the weak and strong forces which play a role in nuclear physics. The
framework of quantum field theory gives us a mathematical description of all the
forces except for gravity, and string theory is a promising, but experimentally
untested, framework for unifying gravity with the other forces of nature.
Quantum field theories and string theories are not fully understood. One way to
unravel their structure is to focus on certain parts of these theories which
constrain their structure. This project will uncover new approaches to these
theories by studying the algebraic structure of special states known as "BPS
states" and will also study the precise nature of the symmetries of these
theories. This research advances the national interest by increasing our
understanding of nature at its most fundamental level --- an understanding that
in the past has eventually led to concrete applications in improved technology
and medicine. The broader impacts of this research include training for postdocs
who will become future scientific leaders and will involve presentations of
their research in seminars and public lectures.

At a more technical level, Professor Harvey will study the algebra of BPS states
in both quantum field theory and string theory and its consequences for weak-
strong coupling duality. He will also assess whether symmetries in string theory
are always gauge symmetries, and if this turns out to be correct, will study how
one can construct the co-dimension-two defects in string theory which are
implied by the existence of gauge symmetries. Other aspects of his research will
include a search for exceptional or sporadic rational conformal field theories.
