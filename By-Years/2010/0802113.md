Proposal 0802113 -- Abstract: (248 words)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of
this project is to improve the efficiency of random medium access control
protocols. The approach is to employ efficient scheduling to amortize the high
control overhead of medium access over a longer sequence of data frames. Fully
distributed protocols will be developed to implement this
approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This proposal outlines a
research and education plan focusing on the theory and system design of
efficient random access protocols. The theoretical and algorithmic thrust
includes: (i) developing a general analytical framework, (ii) exploiting multi-
user diversity under fading channels, and (iii) extension to multi-hop and
multi-channel wireless networks. The experimental thrust includes (i)
formalizing the protocols and prototyping open source device drivers, and (ii)
testbed experiments. The proposed approach has the potential of solving the low
throughput problem many wireless networks suffer, as demonstrated in our
preliminary studies. The proposed theoretical study will provide underpinning
for the proposed protocol as well as existing standard components. The proposed
field experiments will yield useful experimental experience and insights under a
realistic wireless network setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:
Integration of education and research is an important goal of this project.
Graduate students will gain useful theoretical and experimental research
experience from this project. The PI will actively involve undergraduate
students by advising senior projects and participating in the NSF Research
Experiences for Undergraduate program. Research outcomes will be incorporated
into the curriculum of Auburn University?s Bachelor of Wireless Engineering
program, the first Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology-accredited
program of its kind in the nation.
