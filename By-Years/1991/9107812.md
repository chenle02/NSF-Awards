This project seeks to answer several basic questions about the natural history
of wild mushrooms by using classical and modern methods of genetic analysis. The
population biology and genetics of the oyster mushroom will be studied, in order
to understand how natural populations are established and maintained. The unique
life history of mushrooms makes it possible to carry out a variety of genetic
analyses aimed at identification of wild strains and their relatives. A primary
aim of the study will be to develop and test methods for identification of
population pedigrees through the use of genetic markers (such as DNA
fingerprinting). The high level of resolution offered by molecular methods makes
it possible to identify single strains of oyster mushrooms, as well as their
immediate parents and progeny. Oyster mushrooms are also important as a
commercial food crop and source of important enzymes for breaking down plant
material; the genetic markers developed for this study should also be useful for
crop development and biotechnology.
