The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will be to improve cybersecurity. Thousands of open-source software
(OSS) packages containing purposefully harmful software (malware) have been
reported across popular language ecosystems (e.g., Python), which have been
downloaded millions of times. Such attacks are highly damaging as the malware
may find its way into apps, potentially compromising the privacy of millions of
users; moreover, OSS is the de facto standard way to build modern applications
and services.This project will develop a novel large-scale automated vetting
infrastructure to analyze millions of OSS packages and mitigate OSS supply chain
attacks. This will enhance productivity for the OSS developer community across
the cybersecurity spectrum, including malware analysis, exposing undesired
behavior in untrusted third-party OSS code, maintaining developer trust and
reputation, detecting hidden software vulnerabilities, and enforcing security of
OSS ecosystems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase I project will advance state-of-the-art research techniques as well
as explore novel practical approaches for detection and mitigation of Open-
Source Software (OSS) supply chain attacks â€” a direct cybersecurity threat posed
to developers and organizations when adopting untrusted third-party OSS code.
This project will: 1) create novel automated techniques for exhaustive code as
well as metadata analysis of OSS projects, and 2) develop an extensive set of
robust characteristic profiles for effective detection of malicious
code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
