0923043&lt;br/&gt;Geiss&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) grant will support the acquisition of a vibrating sample
magnetometer (VSM) to determine magnetic hysteresis parameters of iron-bearing
minerals in geological samples and thereby infer magnetic grain-size
distribution. The VSM will support research and research training in the
Department of Physics at Trinity College, an undergraduate institution. North
American midcontinent climate reconstructions will be aided by rock magnetic
investigations of Canadian Arctic lake sediments and Midwestern paleosols.
