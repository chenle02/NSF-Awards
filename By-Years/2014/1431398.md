Under the supervision of Susan K Jacobson, at University of Florida, Ph.D.
student Nia Haynes will analyze the influence of two national internship
programs on racial and ethnic minority youth perceptions about natural resource
careers, using a framework based on social cognitive career theory. She will
also conduct a quantitative survey of current students in natural resource
fields.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will help promote diversity in the
natural resource career fields and will result in the co-PI completing
theoretically driven research using social research designs, methods and
analysis. The researchers will build partnerships with natural resource
institutions and agencies that will encourage future collaborations. Research
results will be disseminated through presentations at stakeholder meetings, an
international conference, through manuscripts submitted to peer-reviewed
journals, and a report to natural resource agencies, non-government
organizations and academic programs.
