Professor Anderson intends to work on several problems in the area of boundedly
controlled topology and its applications. This work will build on the
foundations of this subject that he has developed in joint work with Professor
Hans Jorgen Munkholm of Odense University, Denmark. The problems are of three
types: Some lie solely within the confines of boundedly controlled topology and
are intended to develop further the foundations of that subject; some are
designed to explore more exactly the relationship between boundedly controlled
topology and the epsilon-controlled topology developed independently by
Professors T. A. Chapman and F. S. Quinn III; and some involve applying the
methods and results of boundedly controlled topology to other areas, for example
to the study of group actions.
