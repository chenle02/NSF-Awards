This research is directed toward understanding the means by which gene
expression is regulated in the cells of higher organism. The enzyme, RNA
polymerase II is responsible for synthesizing the RNA that serve as messages for
protein synthesis. The process of initiation by thus enzyme is intricate but can
be broken into a series of simpler, more easily analyzable steps. The components
of the transcriptional machinery that act at each of these steps will be
identified. Eventually it is hoped to determine how the function of or
requirement for these proteins is altered in a cell undergoing a change in its
pattern of gene expressions.
