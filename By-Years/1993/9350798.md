The University of North Carolina at Charlotte is developing an undergraduate
cognitive science laboratory which is functioning as a center for student
research projects. Upper division students enrolled in independent research are
working on a research team under the joint guidance of faculty from several
disciplines (Computer Science, Psychology, Philosophy, Linguistics) and
participating in a cognitive science seminar. Since cognitive science is a new
discipline and there is no formal coursework in this area, the independent
research project with a monthly seminar is one way that students can gain an
interdisciplinary perspective. The laboratory is equipped with 5 student
workstations so that students can use procedures with extensive symbol
manipulation and become involved with multimedia projects. This research
experience is of particular benefit to those interested in graduate work in
cognitive science. After majoring in one of the participating disciplines for 2
years, students are ready to embark on complex issues which require a
combination of interdisciplinary knowledge and powerful computers. The Cognitive
Science Laboratory is exposing students to a high level of problem-solving
mastery. This laboratory is also enriching the curricula of all of the
participating departments.
