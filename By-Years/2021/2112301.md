The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes providing a high-throughput system for
recycling critical metals like cobalt to reduce the conventional energy-
intensive mining and refining processes used to produce materials for
manufacturing today. Most importantly, this project will help secure a supply of
critical materials, reducing the United Statesâ€™ reliance on foreign supply
chains and guaranteeing a secondary source of battery materials. A new, domestic
supply will also reduce the social and human health impacts associated with
artisanal mining, and significantly reduce the environmental impact of batteries
and electric vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II project proposes
to (1) validate novel electro-extraction nanotechnology based separations
technology in the battery recycling and cobalt mining space, and (2) validate a
new, value-added product (a battery cathode precursor material) for this rapidly
growing market, rendering the conventional refining stages unnecessary. The
proposed electroextraction process utilizes flow-through water electrolysis to
produce high local concentrations of hydroxide to precipitate transition metals
as metal hydroxides. This understanding will allow tuning the device operating
conditions for metal or mixed-metal specific precipitation, for example, the
precipitation of Ni-Mn-Co hydroxides at battery stoichiometries or highly
selective precipitation of individual metals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
