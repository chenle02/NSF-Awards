The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) has been awarded a grant to expand
and continue development of the TIGR Plant Gene Indices
(http://www.tigr.org/tdb/tgi.shtml). Sequencing of Expressed Sequence Tags
(ESTs) has provided a first glimpse of the collection of transcribed sequences
in many organisms, and significant additional information can be obtained by a
thorough analysis of the EST data. The total indices currently represent more
than 60 species: 19 plant species, 22 animal species, 13 protists, and 7 fungal
species. The continuation of this project will allow TIGR to continue to provide
these databases and resources to the community (free of charge) and to continue
development of additional features that will enhance the annotation currently
provided, including the identification of SNPs, prediction of a collection of
70-mer sequences for microarrays, and the creation of a plant version of the
Resourcer tool. These databases are produced using highly refined and accurate
computational protocols designed to reconstruct transcripts represented by the
data, to assign preliminary annotation to those reconstructed sequences, to map
them to an increasing number of completely sequenced genomes, and to identify
orthologous genes. The results are provided through an easily accessible web-
interface and that presents additional analysis, including the identification of
putative orthologous genes. As such, the TGIR indices provide a valuable
resource for the research community and providing analysis of ESTs for many
ongoing projects funded by the NSF and other federal agencies.
