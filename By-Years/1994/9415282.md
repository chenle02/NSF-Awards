This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program will
provide partial support for the International Conference of Carbon Dioxide
Utilization (I.C.C.D.U.) to be held at the University of Oklahoma, April 30-May
4, 1995. Dr. Kenneth M. Nicholas is co-chair of the organizing committee and a
member of the international scientific committee administering the conference.
Two meetings on this topic have been held previously, one in Italy and one in
Japan; this is the first meeting to be held in the United States. Approximately
250 scientists, engineers and students will exchange the latest research and
development findings pertaining to the utilization of carbon dioxide. New
developments in this area are essential for such long-term goals as the use of
carbon dioxide as a feedstock for industrial chemicals production, new
technologies for carbon dioxide fixation, utilization of supercritical carbon
dioxide as an environmentally benign solvent, and improved methods for reducing
carbon dioxide atmospheric emissions.
