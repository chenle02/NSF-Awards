This proposal is directed to understanding metal-ceramic interfacial reactions
and how they are influenced by chemical segregation and defects at the ceramic
surface. Initial focus is on alumina and silica surfaces and use of dopants to
modify surface properties. Bonding to both reactive and noble metals are
examined; examples include titanium, gold and platinum. X- ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) is used to study composition and chemical states at the
surfaces.
