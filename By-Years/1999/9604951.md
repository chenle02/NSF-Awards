Working with others, we developed biospecific self-assembled monolayer (SAM)
chips that increased, by more than an order of magnitude, the sensitivity,
accuracy, and range of measurements made with surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
instruments. We have extended the strategies developed for our biospecific
nitrilotri-acetic acid (NTA) SAM chips to the development of a DNA presenting
monolayer chip. This new chip should extend the sensing enhancements
demonstrated by the NTA-SAM to the study of DNA-protein complex interactions. We
will also explore how a highly ordered surface of known structure might be used
to probe macromolecules of unknown structure. SPR determined kinetic
measurements will be calibrated against solution based measurements obtained
with fluorescence anisotropy. As with the development of the NTA-SAM, we will
employ the power of genetics to assess the accuracy of our experimental
surfaces. We have available arrays of well characterized proteins and variants
thereof, whose activation potential can be measured in vivo, so that the
relevance of in vitro measurements can be ascertained.
