This project involves a cultural anthropologist studying European members of
parliament in Brussels and Strasbourg as they debate and develop a new political
philosophy combining "Green", regional, and ethnic-based constituencies and
federal opportunities and constraints. Using in-depth interviews and observation
of political meetings the investigator will assess the importance of these
social and political values as they are enacted in the evolving political
landscape of Western Europe. This research is important because Europe is
developing in ways that will dramatically change the modern political world
system. Increased understanding by U.S. scholars of the social and cultural
dynamics underlying these changes, which this sort of in-depth study provides,
will help policy makers deal with the new world system.
