This project aims to create a community of practice among the five pilot
projects funded under the Geoscience Opportunities for Leadership in Diversity
(GOLD) program. The proposed work will create a website portal for all the GOLD
projects. The website portal developed will allow for linkages between the
various GOLD projects, as well as serve as a platform for discussion and
communication among the teams. Repositories for background reading on diversity,
success stories, evaluation reports and publications will all be components of
the website portal. This project will also create the opportunity for
professional development and support to the PIs engaged on GOLD Projects.

The support of GOLD PIs and participants continues the development of diversity
leaders within the geoscience community. Specifically, the goals for the project
support are to 1) establish a community of practice, 2) provide skill and
professional development opportunities, 3) provide customized project support,
4) promote individual and team reflection, 5) foster ownership and integrate
change through collaborative outcome identification, and 6) provide consultation
resources from customized follow-up.
