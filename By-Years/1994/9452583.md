9452583 D'Alessandris The main goal of this project is to improve the learning,
retention, and application of physics concepts and principles by students
enrolled in physics classes at Monroe Community College (MCC). This will be
accomplished by developing a comprehensive, four-semester physics laboratory
sequence based on the physics education and cognitive research based curriculum
of Real-Time Physics. This curriculum relies upon the integration of
microcomputers into the laboratory to perform data collection, analysis, and
graphing, as well as to construct, execute, and display simulations of physical
phenomenon. However, some units of Real-Time Physics are not yet commercially
available and, even when completed, Real-Time Physics will not provide a
comprehensive laboratory curriculum. Therefore, aspects of other curricula,
including Workshop Physics, Tools for Scientific Thinking and Spreadsheet
Physics will be integrated with Real-Time Physics into a four-semester
laboratory curriculum. This project will encourage students to continue study in
physics or engineering, help prepare MCC physics courses for the next century,
and to stimulate other colleges, both two-year and four-year, to adopt this
approach.
