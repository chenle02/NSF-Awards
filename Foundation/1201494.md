Larson proposes work on five related topics, all centering around the extent to
which the absoluteness results and detailed analysis of inner models of
determinacy in the context of large cardinals can be lifted to larger models
satisfying larger fragments of the Axiom of Choice. One topic is the so-called
universally measurable sets, where the fundamental open question is whether all
such sets can have the property of Baire. One topic concerns the fragment of the
Axiom of Choice which holds when a model of determinacy is expanded by adding a
Ramsey ultrafilter. Another concerns lifting to the third uncountable cardinal
Woodin's results on getting forcing axioms at the second uncountable cardinal by
forcing over a determinacy model. The fourth concerns application of techniques
from set theory to Shelah's study of Abstract Elementary Classes. Finally,
Larson proposes to study ideals on the first uncountable cardinal from the point
of view of certain inner models satisfying a small fragment of Choice.

The standard axioms for set theory, the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, serve as the
commonly accepted foundations for mathematics, though as mathematics becomes
more abstract, more and more issues arise which are not resolved by these
axioms. Many of these issues are studied by set theorists, in hope of finding
the right extension of these axioms. Developments in the study of such possible
extensions have had a dramatic foundational impact in the last thirty years,
affecting many areas of mathematics, and even philosophy. The PI works on the
border between some of the more technical, inward-directed areas of set theory
and more classical areas with connections to other fields. Much of his work
consists of finding applications of these more technical areas, and exposing
them to a wider audience.
