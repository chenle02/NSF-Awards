IBN- 9412118 Gilbert, Ryan and Deinert Abstract Darwin originally proposed two
types of selection that could affect animals. Both are complicated phenomena
that we continue to struggle to understand fully. In this doctoral dissertation
research, Gilbert, Ryan and Deinert have identified a system in which the
evolutionary dynamics of both types of selection can be studied in detail. A
series of experiments on competition between males and on mate choice by males
will further our knowledge of how different types of selection interact in the
evolutionary process.
