This proposal develops and deploys comprehensive support for the Web Services
Resource Framework (WSRF) for the Windows environment. The resulting WSRF.NET
environment will be an open source platform providing an integrated execution
environment for running grid-enabled computational jobs. Combined with NMI
software, WSRF.NET will be deployed at UVA to create the UVA Campus Grid
(UvaCG).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact - While
client-side support for Grids exists for the Windows environment (e.g., the Java
CoG), first-class client-side and server-side support on .NET is necessary to
integrate Windows machines, including the supporting Windows tools such as
Visual Studio .NET into Grid computing. The proposed project will deliver an
open-source, maintainable software package for the .NET environment, greatly
expanding the capabilities of Grids, particularly those in the Campus
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
