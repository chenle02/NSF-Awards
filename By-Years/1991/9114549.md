The ice cover in the Arctic Ocean plays an important role in the global climate
by controlling exchange of momentum and heat between the atmosphere and the
ocean. Ice distribution defines not only the heat balance but it also influences
the oceanic density distribution through the brine rejection during the cold
season, and ice melting during the warm season. The strong processes of
exchanging moisture and heat between atmosphere and water occur at the pack-ice
openings. This project is part of a systematic study of the Arctic environment
and its role in global change which is promoted by NSF's Arctic System Science
Program. It is a two year project to utilize data sets existing in the Arctic
and Antarctic Research Institute, St. Petersburg, Russia with existing and
refined models of increased sensitivity to evaluate the effect of tides on ice
production and ice-ocean interaction. This research will investigate four basic
tidal constituents, with space resolution of about 20 kilometers, and the role
of tides in sea-ice lead formation.
