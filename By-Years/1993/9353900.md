ABSTRACT 9353900 Stanley Most instructional materials in classical science
assume a strict cause and effect relationship. More recent research in many
disciplines demonstrates that macroscopic randomness leads to macroscopic
patterns. Examples, drawn from physics, chemistry, biology and earth science,
include natural patterns in nerve cells, lightning, river deltas, tree branches,
galaxy formation, ruggedness of coast lines and growth of materials - to name a
few. Each discipline-related workbook incorporates hands-on activities,
prediction and hypothesizing activities, laboratory experiments, computer
simulations, data analysis, modeling and assessment instruments which are based
on previous work in research in teaching and learning. The materials confront
students' preconceptions while introducing important concepts underlying the
study of patterns in nature. Students learn to think like scientists.
Preliminary research demonstrates that this approach is particularly attractive
to women, minority students and those who have not mastered the mathematical
skills necessary to comprehend the traditional presentation of scientific
concepts. The projects are designed to encourage students to work in cooperative
groups and to encourage teachers to provide cognitive apprenticeships - modeling
the student behavior, providing scaffolding as needed and fading as the students
learn the skills. Publication of modularized student booklets, and associated
software and videos is through Springer Verlag. | ~ ! ! ! F 8 CG Times (WN)
