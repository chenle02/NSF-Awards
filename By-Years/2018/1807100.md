As a satellite activity to the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians in
Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), August 1-9, there will be a K-theory conference in
Argentina, consisting of two parts: a School at the University Nacional de La
Plata (in La Plata, Argentina) during July 16-20, followed by an international
Workshop on K-theory at the University of Buenos Aires (Argentina) during July
23-27, 2018. This award supports US-based graduate students and young
researchers to participate in the School and the Workshop. The meetings aim to
catalyze research and disseminate new techniques that will allow researchers to
better understand how mathematics fits together. The results will be published,
both in on-line archiving sites and in published form in scientific
journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The School will consist of 6 mini-courses,
covering combinatorial aspects, relation to conjectures in algebraic topology,
homotopy invariance, applications to physics, and classification of
approximately finite-dimensional algebras. The Workshop will allow researchers
to share their recent discoveries about how K-theory helps us understand a wide-
ranging family of mathematical structures and their
invariants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The web page for this conference is&lt;br/&gt;w

award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
