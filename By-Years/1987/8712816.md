Selected undergraduates in the Southeast region will participate in an ongoing
research program in software measurement and evaluation at Clemson University.
This year round program provides the opportunity for participants to progress
from more closely supervised tasks, such as administering tests to subject, to
more independent work, such as designing experiments. Students will develop
skills which prepare them and motivate them for continued empirical scientific
research. Eight students will be assigned to one of the current projects, which
include: 1. the development of a measure of the comprehensibility of programs,
and 2. evaluation of the usability of software. An award of $30,000 is high
recommended for this meritorious project under the REU program.
