Growth of finitely generated groups is an important notion. It allows one to
measure and compare groups on a large scale and has numerous applications in
geometry, topology, analysis, probability, dynamics and other areas of
mathematics. The growth of a group can be polynomial, exponential or
intermediate between polynomial and exponential. The class of groups of
intermediate growth is mysterious. Milnor's question as to whether this class is
empty was open for more than 15 years. In 1983 the PI constructed uncountably
many groups of intermediate growth with different types of growth. This led to
the first construction of uncountably many quasi-isometry classes of 2-generated
groups and gave the first explicit construction of a Cantor subset in the space
of marked groups. Despite these successes in the study of groups of intermediate
growth, there are still many fundamental open problems. The main open problems
include: the question about the existence of finitely presented groups of
intermediate growth, and the question (Gap Conjecture) about the size of the
"gap" between polynomial growth and intermediate growth. Among other important
problems are the questions about the existence of hereditary just-infinite
groups and of simple groups of intermediate growth. This proposal addresses
these and other related questions. The PI has a reduction of the Gap Conjecture
to just-infinite groups, which includes the consideration of the above two
classes and the class of branch groups. Techniques include group actions on
rooted trees and the methods of dynamical systems.

Growth of finitely generated groups is related with the theory of random walks,
the geometry of fractals, crystals and quasi-crystals, coding theory, formal
languages, dynamics of finite automata and cellular automata, modeling of
communication networks, Kolmogorov complexity and many other topics. Results
obtained as a part of the current research have potential implications for these
areas, and for the scientific and technological understanding of communication
networks, cryptography, and transportation systems. Schreier graphs and fractals
constructed on the basis of self-similar groups of intermediate growth may be
relevant for our understanding of some processes studied in biology, chemistry
and demographic studies. Algorithms arising from the study of groups of
intermediate growth are different from those used before, and have applications
in science and technology. In mathematics, the notion of growth is important not
only for Geometric Group Theory, but also for Operator Algebras, Topology,
Geometry, Dynamical Systems, Functional Analysis, Probability Theory, Discrete
Mathematics, Differential Equations and other fields. The subject of growth is
very suitable for graduate and even undergraduate courses, since it touches on
many relevant topics in modern mathematics. The PI will disseminate the results
of this research through peer reviewed publication and by giving seminar and
colloquium talks, invited lectures and presentations to various types of
audiences both domestically and internationally.
