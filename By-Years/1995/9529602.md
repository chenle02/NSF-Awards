9520602 Manning Title: The roots of hydrothermal systems at fast spreading
centers: constraints from Hess Deep The circulation of seawater through the
oceanic crust occurs at various temperatures, along complicated pathways, and
results in chemical and mineralogical changes to the crust itself. This proposed
research is to determine how the physical processes of deformation and
fracturing of the crust are related to the chemical processes of reactions
involving seawater. Characterization of the geometry and patterns of fracturing,
linked with mineralogical and chemical changes recorded in the rocks, should
form the basis for a more comprehensive understanding of how seawater interacts
with the oceanic crust.
