This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site project is in the
chemistry of materials. For a three-year period, beginning in April 1989 twelve
(12) undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks engaged in materials
chemistry research, under the direction of eleven (11) senior faculty members
from both Syracuse and SUNY at Potsdam. Four very closely related areas of
chemical research in materials science will be investigated. The first aspect
involves the design, synthesis and characterization of new organometallic
compounds with enhanced properties for use in thin-film depositional techniques
such as organometallic vapor phase epitaxial (OMVPE) and molecular beam
epitaxial (MBE) processes. The second aspect is the preparation and
characterization of new materials from the organometallic precursor compounds
described above. The third aspect involves the study of the physico-chemical
properties of these new materials. The final aspect deals with the chemical
applications of these new materials to a variety of problems.
