0125939&lt;br/&gt;Klypin&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Anatoly Klypin and
students from New Mexico State University in a collaboration with Stefan
Gottloeber of the Astrophysical Institute in Potsdam, Germany. The project will
focus on expanded computer modeling of the formation of galaxies and other large
objects in the expanding universe. Specifically, the research will investigate
the nature of dark matter, which defines the process of formation of such
objects as well as their structure. Both sides of the collaboration bring
specific and complementary expertise, skills, and resources to bear on the
problem. The US side will provide computer codes for running and analysis of
simulations, while the German side will develop new methods of analysis in order
to study the results of the modeling. The project will also compare model
results with actual observed data. The work plan provides for extensive
participation by graduate students in the international travel and
research.&lt;br/&gt;
