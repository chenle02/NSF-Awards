Over the past several years, Stevens Institute of Technology has constructed a
modern centralized facility for microstructural characterization. Matching funds
are provided to the Institute to purchase a field-emission scanning electron
microscope. With this instrument, approximately 50 graduate students 10 faculty
at the Institute can attack research problems that they could not address
previously. A significant fraction of materials research at the Institute
concentrates on ceramics and polymers. Some current problems are the synthesis
of nanocrystalline silicon carbide whiskers, the tribological properties of
silicon nitrides and the interphase structure in fiber-reinforced polymer
composites and in polymer blends. These involve 3-D structures where information
gathered by imaging surfaces using scanning electron microscopy is essential.
Because they are poor electrical conductors, however, ceramics and polymers do
not lend themselves well to high-resolution electron-optical imaging.
Morphological information is limited by artifactual structure introduced by
conductive specimen coatings. Problems associated with specimen charging can be
significantly ameliorated, however, with a field-emission electron-optical
system. A field-emission source has a brightness several orders of magnitude
greater than traditional thermionic sources and a smaller incident electron
energy spread. These features enable SEM imaging of uncoated specimens at low
accelerating voltages (-lkeV) while preserving very good resolution (approx. 4
nm). At higher voltages (approx. 30 keV) the resolution can be as high as l nm.
