This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Columbia University acquire upgrades for a 300 MHz
and a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. The research activity to be supported includes:
designing, synthesizing, and analyzing the reactivities of synthetic analogues
of such molecules; synthesizing inorganic, organic, and organometallic materials
whose structures and properties are novel, and analyzing new photochemical and
metal-mediated processes. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the
most powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure
of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies are useful in areas such as polymers and
catalysis, and in biology.
