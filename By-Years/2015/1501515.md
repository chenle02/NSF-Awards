This project focuses on the subject of dynamics and rational solutions to
several polynomial equations. Polynomial equations over the rational numbers are
among the oldest topics in all of mathematics; indeed, they are often called
"Diophantine equations" after Diophantus of Alexandria, who was one of the first
to study them, in the 3rd century AD. Many of the most important questions have
been solved, at least partially, in the case of one and two dimensional systems
of equations, but there is much that is unknown in dimensions three and up. One
of the primary goals of this award is to use dynamics (simply the repeated
application of a function) to solve an open question about solutions to certain
types of three-dimensional systems of equations. Another goal is to develop a
good notion of what it means for tuples of points to be in "dynamically special
position", which means loosely that the points don't interact upon repeated
application of a function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important conjecture of Zhang
asks that if f is a self-map of an algebraic variety X defined over a number
field, then under reasonably general conditions, there should be an algebraic
point of X whose orbit under f is Zariski dense in X. We seek to prove this
conjecture in the case where f is an automorphism and X has dimension 3. The
chief tool here is the p-adic parametrization of orbits, which may be thought of
as a more general dynamical version of Skolem's method for treating linear
recurrence sequences. Another goal of the project is to prove that if n is
larger than 1, then given n distinct points in C and a list of n preperiods and
periods, there is a polynomial of degree n+1 in normal form such that each point
has the desired period and preperiod.&lt;br/&gt;The methods here are a
combination of diophantine approximation over function fields and the "unlikely
intersection" techniques pioneered by Masser, Zannier, Baker, DeMarco, and
others.
