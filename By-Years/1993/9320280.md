9320280, PI-Pilkey: This project will produce two books outlining the multiple
geologic hazards of Alaska and Puerto Rico. A series of 16 state specific Living
With The Shore books has been produced by the Study of Developed Shorelines at
Duke University. The shore series has been mainly funded by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The new books signal the expansion of the
shore series into the realm of multihazards. The multihazard volumes will
consist of compilations of available knowledge on local geologic hazards plus
field observations to provide the basis for site specific hazards maps with
hazard risk ratings. The elements of mitigation for both property damage and
personal risk will also be discussed (including considerations of earthquake and
high wind construction codes). The goal of the project is to further the
dissemination and utilization of scientific and engineering knowledge on
hazards. The volumes are intended for public consumption. This activity is being
funded cooperatively by NSF and FEMA.
