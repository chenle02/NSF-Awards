The principal investigator will continue his research on the quantitative
aspects of geometric convexity. In particular he will study the Brunn-Minkowski
theory of mixed volumes which is at the core of quantitative convexity. This
award will support research in the general area of integral geometry. The
geometry of a set may often be analyzed and described by a decomposition of the
set into slices. The geometry of the slices is often fairly simple and easy to
describe. The main difficulty in the analysis is usually the reconstruction of
the underlying geometric features of the entire set from the geometry of the
slices. One well known application of this area of mathematics is the CAT scan.
