Dr. Jon Jacklet is doing research on biological rhythms at the cellular and
molecular levels. He is asking fundamental questions about neural circadian
pacemakers: How do specific genes contribute to the pacemaker? What is the
function of the "period" gene product? How is circadian clock information
transmitted to the central nervous system, to the contralateral paired ocular
pacemaker? What transmitters are used? How does efferent innervation modulate
the pacemaker? These questions are being addressed by appropriate experimental
approaches and testing specific hypotheses using the circadian pacemaker neurons
found in the eyes of invertebrate species (Aplysia and Bulla). Dr. Jacklet uses
in vitro organ culture in which the circadian rhythms are expressed very clearly
for experimental purposes. This work is important for the fundamental
understanding of how the body takes in light-dark (visual) cycle information and
codes it for ever changing body functions.//
