0203145&lt;br/&gt;Fleming&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Fraser Fleming and a
student from Duquesne University in a collaboration with Paul Knochel of the
Institute for Organic Chemistry at the University of Munich, Germany. The
project will focus on a fundamentally different approach to functionalized
Grignard reagents with potential for significantly advancing knowledge of
bifunctional reagents. Three new amide-containing Grignard reagents will be
examined where deprotonatin and silylation is used to mask and unmask the
carbonyl group in situ. The collaborative project provides an excellent
opportunity for Fleming and the graduate student to pursue new ideas, cultivate
creative solutions to significant problems, and learn new skills. The project
also provides an opportunity to establish a long-term relationship with the
German group with the possibility of continued exchange of students. The
students will be able to experience the smaller, more personal environment of
Duquesne University, and then perform research at the larger, research-intensive
University of Munich, where they will also garner international experience and
contacts.&lt;br/&gt;
