The plasma sheet varies from a thin stretched configuration during substorm
growth phase to a broad dipolar configuration during substorm expansion phase.
Magnetotail electric currents flow primarily from dawn to dusk through the
plasma sheet. Part of this cross-tail current is diverted to the ionosphere,
where auroras are produced. The overall goal of the proposed project is to
obtain a better physical understanding of how magnetotail current is carried by
individual particles under a variety of conditions. Special emphasis will be
placed on the inner tail. The current carrying ions will be studied by tracing
individual particle orbits. Several types of ion trajectories are found in
different regions of the magnetotail. Adiabatic orbits characteristic of the
ring current and radiation belts are present at low altitudes. Chaotic, quasi-
adiabatic, and trapped orbits alternate farther out, in the region of most
interest. Quasi-adiabatic orbits usually dominate in the distant tail. Electrons
behave adiabatically in all the regions that will be studied. The first stage of
analysis combines these groups of particles to generate a series of self-
consistent plasma sheet models, each applying to a small region of the tail. In
a self-consistent model, the charged particles must carry the electric current
that generates the magnetic field in which the orbits were traced. The local
models then will be coupled in order to study current diversion and larger scale
mangetotail structures. Finally, the structures must be mapped and coupled to
the ionosphere.
