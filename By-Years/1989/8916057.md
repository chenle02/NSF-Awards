This award supports the production of a monograph synthesizing the Proterozoic
and early Paleozoic geology of the Transantarctic Mountains. Within the last
decade various breakthroughs have occurred in our understanding of the
Proterozoic and early Paleozoic geological history of the Transantarctic
Mountains: the recognition of terranes in Northern Victoria Land, the
recognition of a new pre.Beacon deformational episode in the Nimrod Glacier
area, and a questioning of the distinction of the Proterozoic Nimrod and
Beardmore Orogenies as separate events. No tectonic model for the development of
the pre.Beacon of the entire Transantarctic Mountains, incorporating these and
other recent findings, has yet been presented. The Principal Investigator has
had a continuous research program investigating the Proterozoic.early Paleozoic
geology of the Transantarctic Mountains since 1970. The monograph will be
written during the P.I.'s sabbatical leave at the British Antarctic Survey,
Cambridge, U.K.
