Numerical simulations will be carried out to predict organized vortex structures
in three dimensions relevant to plane wakes and round jets. Issues to be
addressed are stability mechanisms and three-dimensional interactions for these
vortex structures. The numerical procedure is based on Lagrangian vortex
dynamics. These methods do not introduce numerical grid effects. The focus is on
mechanisms which might ultimately be used to control the stability of wakes and
jets.
