9711750 Houghton The PIs will conduct focused studies to advance our
understanding of climate variability in the extratropics. The primary emphasis
will be on the seasonal variability in the atmospheric annual cycle. The
seasonal variability research will focus on large-scale aspects for the onset
and ending of the fall and spring transition seasons, length of the seasons, and
other relevant variability in the annual cycle. Description of seasonal
variability and understanding of the relevant dynamics that will be gained in
this research is essential for advancing knowledge of the ocean-atmospheric
climate system in aspects such as: Understanding transitions in atmospheric
circulation states Giving a basis for developing seasonal forecasting in the
extratropics Understanding the net atmospheric events on the ocean over the full
annual cycle (i.e., forcing of interannual and decadal variability signals).
This research is important because it has the potential to advance the
understanding of seasonal climate variability, its causes and physics.
