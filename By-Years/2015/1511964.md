Recent studies have shown that large-scale open fires emit a previously
unrecognized form of soot particle-superaggregates (SAs), in quantities greater
than 70% by number and mass concentration. These particles could have previous
unaccounted-for impacts on human health and the environment. The objective of
this research is to generate, in a controlled manner, soot SAs that mimic those
from large-scale open burns, and investigate the particle formation mechanism
and the emitted particle properties. Undergraduate and graduate students will
participate in the research effort. The PI will also conduct teachers training
workshop for twenty school teachers over the summer.

The conventional view holds that mobility diameter (Dm) less than or equal to
700 nm, aerodynamic diameter (Da) less than or equal to 300 nm, and fractal
dimension approximately 1.8 is the end-point morphology of freshly-emitted soot
particles. Preliminary investigations indicate that Dm and specific surface
areas of soot SAs are ten and three times greater, respectively, than those of
conventional soot particles. The unusually large Dm values render soot SAs
undetectable using aerosol mobility sizing instruments. Alternatively, Da of
these particles, which is used for estimating the probability of deposition
within lungs, are similar to those of conventional soot particles. These
contradicting observations of soot SA properties have left several fundamental
questions unanswered: How does the superaggregate growth kinetics in a flame
depend on the process parameters such as particle volume fraction, residence
time, sooting index of the fuel, fuel/air flow rates, and temperature? How is
the aggregation kinetics different in a positive gravity (upward rising) flame
system? How sensitive are the superaggregate particle morphologies and
properties to changes in the flame process parameters? This project proposes to
answer these questions, which will bring about a potentially transformative
understanding of soot SA's growth kinetics and their microphysical properties.
