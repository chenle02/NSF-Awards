This project will develop numeric measures and real-time graphical procedures
for diagnostic use with regression models, generalized linear models,
multivariate data and other structured data. Graphical methods will combine
parametric estimation and kernel smoothers to make these methods useful and
intuitively sensible beyond the linear model case. Numeric case diagnostics will
be based on multiple subsetting of the data to extend the sensitivity to
outliers beyond the single outlier-simple random sample case. When analyzing
data by fitting models, one of the most important tasks is to check for failures
of the model to describe the behavior of the data. For linear models, for
example multiple linear regression models, both numerical and graphical
diagnostics successfully identify aberrant individual observations or
"outliers." This research will develop diagnostics for the much larger group of
models which are used appropriately for more highly structured or more
complicated situations.
