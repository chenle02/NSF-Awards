This project continues a long-term effort in the area of language learning, a
problem of great scientific and applied importance. The same formalisms that are
used to describe natural languages such as English are being applied in a wide
range of areas from physics to biology enhancing the general applicability of
results. A characteristic of these language-like formalisms is that their
learning takes place on both a structural syntactic plane and a semantic plane,
and these are both integral to the system. Although this research started from
first principles in biology, linguistics and computation, intermediate results
of practical importance are being produced. The research now seeks to overcome
some of the limitations that have been uncovered in the original problem
formulation, using a more utilized previously. A new approach to meaning
representation involves active components, in combination with the more static
visual scenes previously used. If successful, this continuing project will
provide the first scientifically coherent theory of human concept formation and
language learning that covers the full range of essential issues.
