A major limitation to the realization of the wide range of applications of
microdevice technologies is the lack of a suitable thin film material. Absence
of internal stress, high hardness and low coefficient of friction are some of
the many characteristics required for an ideal thin film material. All the
materials experimented with, to date, show major limitations. The unique
combination of properties of diamond like nanocomposite materials make them
excellent candidates for the synthesis of microdevices. The use of these coating
is expected to provide a major step in the advancement of microdevice
technology. The fabrication of microsensors based on these coatings will also
render them biocompatible. Further, the potential resolution of the microflow
sensor suggested in this proposal is several orders of magnitude better that
achieved with presently available sensors.
