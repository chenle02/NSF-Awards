Nitrogen is an essential element for growth of a living cell and it has been
shown that nitrogen availability controls both the mitotoic and meiotic cell
cycles in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisae. A novel class of yeast mutants
(aat1-3) has been isolated which have a range of growth phenotypes (inability to
grow on rich media, sensitivity to amino acid analogs, heat shock sensitivity)
that are only evident when the cell also requires a particular amino acid for
growth; prototrophic strains containing an aat mutation grow normally. Amino
acid transport is misregulated in these strains and there is genetic evidence
for a close relationship between Aat proteins and the products of the growth
controls (RAS /cAMP) pathway. A complete genetic analysis of these mutants is
proposed to elucidate their function in the control of amino acid transport and
to establish if the Aat proteins have a role in the control of cell growth and
division by nutrients availability.
