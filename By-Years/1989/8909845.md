A Key problem in solar flare physics is the manner in which protons and other
particles are accelerated in a few seconds as evidenced by impulsive y-ray
emission. The most widely accepted models in explaining this acceleration are
shock acceleration and stochastic acceleration by Alfven or magnetosonic waves.
Neither of these models has developed self-consistency or has direct
observational verification. This grant will permit the consistent development of
a single-loop Alfven wave stochastic acceleration model as the topic most likely
to allow a close interaction between theory and observations. A half-loop is
divided into 3 coronal sections attached to a model chromosphere and
photosphere. The coronal sections include the source where primary acceleration
occurs, a section beyond the source where further acceleration occurs and a
transport section in which protons propagate diffusively. Unlike previous work,
it will be a complete model for nonrelativistic energies including a nuclear
interaction calculation. Thus , it will be possible to study the effect of
changing the spectrum and/or power of turbulence in the source, the loop size,
etc., throughout the whole loop. In short, it will be possible to put the
stochastic acceleration model to a very thorough test. Observational
consequences in prompt y-ray emission come from the nuclear interaction part of
the calculation. A radio diagnostic of the low-frequency turbulence in the
source will be developed to provide an observational means of verifying its
existence. These results will increase understanding in this important area of
research. The overall aim is to improve current understanding of particle
acceleration at the sun. These particles form part of the earth's environment
and, therefore, this work is important to S/T relations. //
