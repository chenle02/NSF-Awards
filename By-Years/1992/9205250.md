The cut locus is a large Drosophila gene that controls differentiation of a
variety of tissues. Mutations of the gene transform the external sensory organs
into chordotonal organs and prevent differentiation of particular wing margin
bristles as well as the insect kidneys. Expression is also required in the head
for the occurrence of cuticle expansion, a programmed behavior. Mutations
upstream of the transcribed portion of the gene interfere with proper
regulation. Many of the upstream mutations are insertions of the retrotransposon
gypsy, which may interrupt expression by acting as a barrier between the
promoter and enhancer elements. The interactions of cut with other genes and
gene products in the process of regulation that leads to differentiation of cell
type will be examined. The cut regulatory elements will be identified by their
ability to regulate a reporter gene, and experiments will be carried out to test
specific genes to discover what genes are required for cut expression in
particular tissues and which ones encode proteins that bind directly to the cut
regulatory elements. The localization of the cut regulatory elements will also
demonstrate clearly whether the gypsy transposable element acts as a barrier
between enhancers and promoters.
