The research will develop performance analysis tools and methodologies for
congestion control protocols in computer networks. The work includes a detailed
study of a Fokker-Planck system, developed by the principal investigator in
previous work, using finite difference schemes to solve the Fokker-Planck
equations more efficiently and accurately. The study will include delayed
feedback in the system, a detailed study of time series models of the Internet
round trip delays. It will also include an investigation of statistical models
correlating round trip delays with network congestion, a mapping of the real
world network parameters, and a comparison of alterative flow control protocols,
including both rate based window based algorithms. The rate based algorithms
planned for this study are the Dynamic Time Window Protocol, dynamic version of
the Leaky Bucket Protocol and the Packet Pair Protocol. The switch schedules
will be varied across Fair Queueing, Virtual Clock, Generalized Virtual Clock.
Non-work- conserving versions of Generalized Virtual Clock, FCFS Drop Tail and
FCFS Random Drop.
