The primary objectives of these studies on flower form and function are (1) to
establish how floral organs grow and how their growth is modified in the
evolution of new forms; and (2) to determine how pollen tubes grow in the style.
Specifically, Dr. Lord is continuing the surface growth analyses begun on lily
floral organs, extending them to the leaf and to the tobacco flower. She will
continue to screen for and select out established floral mutants of Arabidopsis
that show modifications in floral form that appear heterochronic in nature,
affecting the perianth and androecium form and mimicking the developmental
patterns exhibited by both dimorphic flowers of cleistogamous species and those
of inbreeding species. Dr. Lord will determine whether differences in protein
composition between the dimorphic flowers of Collomia correlates with the
histological divergence observed in the anthers and corollas of these two floral
types. In the area of pollination, she will continue studies of the interaction
between the pollen tube and the stylar medium establishing whether a matrix-
driven translocation of pollen tubes occurs in compatible pollinations. %%% The
flower is determinate in its growth, producing a serial progression of different
parts from embryonic tissue, each showing discrete stages of differentiation,
making it an ideal system for studying morphogenesis and growth of plant organs.
