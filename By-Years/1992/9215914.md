Three related investigations are to be conducted in the area of environmental
fluid mechanics, in particular density stratified turbulent flow. The approach
is essentially experimental. The three topics are: mixing between turbulent
layers of different properties separated by a laminar region, the horizontal
outflow generated near the ground by heavy descending air masses, and mixing and
internal wave generation in a variable properties stably stratified turbulent
shear flow. The research is relevant to oceanic mixing, pollutant transport in
the atmosphere, and wind shear due to microbursts.
