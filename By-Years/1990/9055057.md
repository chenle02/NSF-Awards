The Department of Oral Biology of the State University of New York at Buffalo
will initiate an eight-week, commuter Young Scholars project in the
Biological/Biophysical Sciences for 12 students entering grade 12. Each student,
with two students per laboratory, will be provided a "hands-on" research
experience with one of six established investigators working in the areas of
bone cell physiology, bacterial molecular genetics, structure/function
relationships of macromolecules, cellular and humoral immunology, bacterial
physiology, or immunochemistry of proteins. A seminar series will also be
arranged for the students to present their work to their peers and mentors and a
poster preparation/ presentation of data will be a component of the project.
