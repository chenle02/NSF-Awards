&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award to the Polar Research
Board is to establish a Committee on Frontiers in Polar Biology. The Committee
will examine the opportunities and challenges of using modern technologies and
methods of biology for conducting research on Arctic and Antarctic organisms.
The committee will seek to identify the most important research questions that
can be addressed using the new approaches and to recommend ways to facilitate
and accelerate the transfer and use of genomic technologies to answer
fundamental questions about Arctic and Antarctic organisms. &lt;br/&gt;The
Committee's work will result in a consensus report with conclusions and
recommendations that will highlight the potential of these new areas and provide
guidance about research opportunities.
