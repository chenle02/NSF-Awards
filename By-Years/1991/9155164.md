The Canyon Ferry Limnological Institute, Montana Office of Public Instruction,
and Montana State University will offer a four week summer training workshop in
aquatic ecology for teachers that reside along the Missouri River. This project
will introduce teachers to the process of scientific investigation through a
multi-year limnological study of the Missouri River. A network of over 100
teachers along the Missouri River from Montana to St. Louis will be developed
and will involve their approximately 10,000 students per year in simultaneous
sampling and assessment of the Missouri River's water quality. Over the three
year funding, July 1, 1992 - June 30, 1995, approximately 150 teachers and
50,000 students will participate in the project. There will be an approximate
cost-share of 32%.
