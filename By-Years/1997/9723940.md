The million of specimens contained in biological collections (natural history
museums and herbarial) represent extensive, high-quality documentation of the
Earth's biota. Collection data are stored, however, in different data structures
under different database management systems, and are consequently different to
synthesize. In this project, museum data specialists computer scientists are
collaborating to build a federation query server from a web-accessible schema
library and an extensive suite of scientific management tools (developed by the
OPM Project, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories). The schema library
documents the structures of individual collection databases and a reference
model of shared concepts. The data management tools use inter-schema mappings to
transform queries and data between the reference model and local databases.
Biological collections data can be used to determine species distributions;
multi-species patterns of distribution and diversity; and how distributions are
influenced by environmental factors (e.g., climate) and land-use practices. This
project will make collections data more accessible by automating the repetition
and complexity of querying different collection databases, and will help deliver
collection data into the emerging National Biological Information
Infrastructure. The query server will complement the analysis, visualization,
and prediction tools that are being developed at the San Diego Supercomputing
Center (for the US-Organization for Biodiversity and our understanding of global
climate change. This work is supported by the Database Activities program in the
BIO directorate.
