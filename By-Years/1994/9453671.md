9453671 Kleiman This project focuses on two current issues in American
education: reform in mathematics education led by the NCTM Standards and the
need to serve a linguistically and culturally diverse (LCD) student population.
The implementation of the unit Languate of Numbers developed by EDC under NSF
award number ESI-9054677 is evaluated in schools served by the California Middle
School Mathematics Renaissance of the California State Systemic Initiative. This
unit, designed for sixth grade, includes material on number representational
systems, multiple representations of numbers, and number representational
devices. In addition, it focuses on investigation, invention, symbolization, and
communicating mathematically. The evaluation consists of classroom observations,
individual and focus group interviews with teachers, students, administrators
and parents as well as review of student work. The outcome is general principles
for the design and implementation of instructional materials for LCD students
and guidance for teachers implementing similar instructional materials.
