The PI continued study of the geochemical and structural evolution of gabbro-
hosted magma-hydrothermal systems during crustal rifting between Greenland and
Eurasia and formation of the N. Atlantic ocean basin. Four specific topics will
be addressed: (1) relations between vein systems and magmatic and structural
deformation of gabbro bodies, (2) what controls mass transfer associated with
hydrothermal alteration, (3) what is relation between mineralogic and isotopic
alteration, and (4) what are sources of hydrothermal solutions and when did sea
water become an important component of these fluids. A variety of field,
petrologic, mineralogic, and theoretical methods will be used to answer these
questions.
