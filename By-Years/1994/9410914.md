9410914 DeGrandpre Research will be undertaken in response to a one-time Program
Announcement (NSF 93-101) for the Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP) Coastal Air-Sea
Chemical Fluxes pilot study. The NSF/CoOP Study will augment and collaborate
with the ONR-sponsored Marine Boundary Layer (MBL) Advanced Research Initiative
(ARI) project scheduled for 1995 off the coast of Monterey, California. The
overall scientific project is interdisciplinary, with the NSF/CoOP efforts
addressing chemical and biological parameters, while the ONR study focuses on
physical oceanographic and meteorological parameters. This project focuses on
concentrations of pCO2, O2 and noble gases in relation to the interdisciplinary
framework of biological, chemical, physical, and meteorological experiments to
be conducted by other scientists during the MBL ARI. Air-sea gas exchange
mechanisms and upper ocean gas dynamics will be studied by measuring multiple
gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe) at different depths in the water column. This
suite of noble gases will enable the investigators to discern air-sea gas
exchange from other physical processes such as advection and heat exchange.
Also, by making measurements at different depths, the effects of vertical mixing
on surface concentrations can be directly estimated. Complementary
meteorological, physical and chemical data to be taken during the MBL experiment
will be used to ultimately determine the physical forcing and constraining
mechanisms on air- sea chemical exchange in the coastal region.
