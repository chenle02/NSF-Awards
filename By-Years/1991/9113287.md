This award provides funds for a Research Training Group in Animal Behavior that
will be initiated in conjunction with a new Center for Animal Behavior at the
Davis Campus of the University of California. The faculty group consists of 15
junior and senior investigators from the Departments of Zoology and Psychology
and from the Regional Primate Center in Davis. The funds awarded will provide
stipends for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees, will support research
during the summer by undergraduates, and will defray part of the cost of the
trainees' research. In addition, funds will be used to purchase specialized
research equipment to be used by trainees and to bring investigators from other
research and academic institutions to the campus for seminars and, in
particular, for an intensive workshop to be held at the time of spring break
each year. The study of animal behavior both requires and provides new insights
into the study of animals as organisms. Increasingly, multidisciplinary
approaches that recognize the interaction of genetic, developmental,
physiological and environmental determinants are playing an important role in
the analysis of behavior. Among the research topics represented by the training
group's faculty are the development and neurophysiology of animal communication,
the analysis of the evolution of behavior using invertebrate models,
physiological sources and consequences of social dynamics and reproduction, and
proximate mechanisms in social behavior and socioecology. These varied research
activities, coupled with an intensive program of seminars by resident and
invited faculty will expose trainees to the newest techniques and ideas while
equipping them with a solid foundation in established methodologies and
concepts.
