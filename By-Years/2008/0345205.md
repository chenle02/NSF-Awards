The University of California at Riverside is awarded a grant to start research
into the theoretical development of new statistical methods for optimal
utilization of established genomic databases for genetically dissecting complex
traits. The statistical method to be used is the Bayesian method, which will be
implemented via the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Specific areas to
be studied include development of optimal statistical methods and computational
algorithms for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) with epistatic effects
(interaction between loci) using markers of the entire genome. The methods are
clearly in contrast to the conventional methods of genome scanning in that the
latter are one-dimensional searches that often result in low power of gene
detection and difficulty in interpreting the results. These problems can be
avoided by using a single unified multiple effects model.
