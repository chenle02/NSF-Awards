This project will examine the possibility of using ground-based magnetic field
measurements near the magnetic equator to determine when a change in the
interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) orientation hits Earth's magnetopause.
Knowing exactly when an IMF polarity change hits the magnetopause is important
for understanding the exact timing of events related to the initiation of a
magnetic substorm. Currently there is no reliable way of knowing exactly when
the polarity change encounters the magnetosphere because the only direct
measurements are made by spacecraft located in the solar wind upstream from the
magnetopause. Models for the propagation of the observed IMF from the spacecraft
position to Earth are very inexact and potentially error prone.

If the proposed method of using the equatorial electrojet can be demonstrated to
be a robust method of determining the actual impact of the IMF on the
magnetosphere the method has the potential to transform the way IMF controled
phenomena are investigated. This would have significant impacts on our ability
to specify space weather conditions.
