This research enables an economist and a philosopher to examine a key issue of
equity linked to global climate change. What do people living now owe to future
generations? This project will analyze these issues from two perspectives. There
will be a philosophical analysis of obligations to future generations and to
preserve the environment. There will be an economic analysis of the impact of
various distributive policies. Findings from both perspectives will be applied
to models of climate change. The research is intended to deepen our
understanding of concepts of intergenerational equity, and how these concepts
are linked to philosophical justifications and economic consequences. These
findings may provide useful input to the ongoing debate on controlling global
warming.
