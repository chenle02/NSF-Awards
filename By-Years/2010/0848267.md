The College Board proposes to convene a group of experts in undergraduate
computer science education in order to begin a conversation about the ideal,
future, Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science course and its impact on the
discipline. This re-envisioning of the AP CS course is happening in the context
of cutting edge changes occurring in computer science undergraduate programs.
Building on an existing NSF-funded project ? From Research to Practice:
Redesigning AP Science Courses to Advance Science Literacy and Support Learning
with Understanding ? the new course design will use best practices in pedagogy
and it will aim to engage and excite all students, including those at low income
and minority serving schools. This award will bring together experts who will
function in an advisory capacity, providing direction to the larger project.
