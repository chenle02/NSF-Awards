The University of Illinois at Chicago and its partners, the National Center for
Supercomputer Applications (NCSA), the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and
Ameritech will provide an operational interconnection point at the Ameritech
Network Access Point (NAP) that will enable international connectivity and
interoperability of the cutting edge US research networks (e.g., vBNS, Internet
2, Next Generation Internet components) and high performance networks of other
nations. This project is a key piece of infrastructure for high performance
international Internet connections to the vBNS. It will complement the
forthcoming NSF solicitation for High Performance International Internet
Services (HPIIS), and it will support the G7 Global Information Infrastructure
project "Global Interoperability of Broadband Networking" (GIBN) by providing a
common interconnection point with staff support and performance monitoring. The
Canadian Network for the Advancement of Research, Industry and Education
(CANARIE) has already connected to the vBNS through the Ameritech NAP in an
initial proof-of-concept test.
