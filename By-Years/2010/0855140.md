In response to a strong demand from its users, the PLT infrastructure project
aims to equip the PLT Scheme software infrastructure with four key components.
Objective one is to reduce the running time of PLT Scheme object code; the PIs
intend to accomplish this with the addition of a just- in-time compiler. The
second objective calls for an enhanced ability to embed foreign code into PLT
Scheme and vice versa; the plan calls for the implementation of a dynamic
foreign function interface that allows programmers to develop and embed C code
in an incremental manner. The project's third objective is to integrate a web
repository for software libraries directly into the programming language.
Objective four is to assist educational users (middle schools, high schools,
colleges, and some graduate courses) with additional teaching libraries; to this
end, the PIs are designing a framework for plugging special-purpose functional
languages into the PLT Scheme framework.
