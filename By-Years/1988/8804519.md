An REU site will be established to pursue important research opportunities in
electrical engineering by undergraduate students. The research projects include:
microwave acoustic materials and devices, robotics and computer vision,
semiconductor material and device properties and measurements, motion control,
application.specific computer architectures, and high speed digital transmission
over telephone lines. Ten students wil be selected: six will be from
institutions where research opportunities are limited, and at least three of its
ten will be minority, women, or handicapped students. Efforts will be made to
place REU students in appropriate research groups throughout the academic year.
In the case of the on.campus student, the REU program includes the University
Honors Program, undergraduate thesis or special problems course to provide the
student with a stimulating and challenging experience.
