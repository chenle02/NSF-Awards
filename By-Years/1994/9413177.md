9413177 Pillsbury In this project, the principal investigators will deploy three
arrays of current meter moorings along 20 degrees South in the Indian Ocean and
make related Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) stations, as part of the
Indian Ocean Expedition of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
Objectives are to describe water characteristics, velocity structure, and
transport of the three systems of deep western boundary currents postulated to
exist in the region. The observations will provide the foundation for the first
direct measurement of the meridional overturning rate in the Indian Ocean - a
measurement needed for assessment of the role of the ocean in climate
prediction.
