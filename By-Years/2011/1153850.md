CLEAR Scholars in Engineering is an S-STEM program for undergraduate engineering
students in the School of Engineering and Technology at Indiana University-
Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). Each year up to 12 economically-
disadvantaged and academically-prepared rising sophomore students are selected
as CLEAR scholars. The program provides support to this diverse population of
urban students from the sophomore year through graduation, with the goal of
decreasing time spent in extracurricular employment, time to graduation, and
indebtedness upon graduation; and increasing engagement with high-impact
practices for academic and post-degree success. Leveraging existing academic and
support services, CLEAR Scholars participate in a set of activities that promote
retention, achievement, and persistence to graduation through: community-
building through a cohort model; leadership and career development; engagement
with industry; advising through mentoring; and resources for academic success.
This program connects scholars who have similar financial challenges, and who
share educational and career aspirations to help them integrate more fully into
the academic culture through mentoring, leadership and career development, and
other activities that support student success. The sophomore level is chosen as
the point of intervention because students will have already completed freshman-
level engineering coursework, demonstrating preparedness for engineering study
as well as a continued need for academic, social, and financial support. The
program actively engages campus and community stakeholders, including school
administrators, faculty, and industry partners. Lessons learned from CLEAR
Scholars inform other initiatives to improve the undergraduate experience for
all engineering students at IUPUI.
