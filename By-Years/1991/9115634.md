The objective of this research is to develop a comprehensive constitutive theory
for granular material based on concepts of statistical micromechanics, taking
into account the contact properties and interaction between particles. The focus
will be on probabilistic nature of the material structure, and mechanism of
particle deformation. Computer simulation will be conducted to aid the
development of the theory. Experimental results for sands obtained from the
literature will be used to validate the theory.
