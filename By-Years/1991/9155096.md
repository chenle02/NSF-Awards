The University of Missouri @ St. Louis will initiate a six-week, commuter,
multidisciplinary Young Scholars project offering science enrichment activities
for 24 precollege students entering grade 12. The Engelmann Student Research
Program provides high-ability high school students with the opportunity to
conduct research projects in mathematics and science under the supervision of a
faculty mentor. Participants apply various problem-solving strategies to their
independent projects, write technical reports and present the results in oral
presentations. They are provided with formal instruction on technical
communication skills. Career confabs and industrial field trips expose them to a
wide variety of job possibilities. Eight follow-up meetings are held during the
academic year to increase student career awareness and to help participants
carry on independent research projects in their high school setting.
