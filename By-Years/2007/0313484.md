Since it is widely expected that hydrocarbon resources will be in short supply
in the near future, it is vital that researchers develop chemical processes and
chemical products based on alternative renewable feedstocks such as
carbohydrates. This research will focus on fundamental scientific catalysis
research for the conversion of biorenewable resources to valuable chemical
intermediates. The reactivity of supported Ru-Cu bimetallic catalysts will be
investigated for the conversion of glucose and sorbitol to oxygenated chemicals
such as polyols (ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, butandiol).
Kinetic measurements, in situ catalyst characterization, and theoretical quantum
chemical calculations of reaction pathways will be performed. This work is an
extremely important direction for future catalysis research. The researcher is
well recognized for prior work on bimetallic catalysts and has already made
important contributions in this area. The prospects for successful kinetic
measurements and EXAFS experiments are very high. Other aspects of the research
involving infrared spectroscopy will be challenging. Collaborative interactions
involving theoretical calculations are well within the expected capability for
the researchers at the University of Virginia. An excellent program involving
under-represented minorities is also already in existence and there has been a
solid level of accomplishment in educating graduate and undergraduate students.
Dissemination of the research results through publications, workshops, and
annual meetings is an important part of the proposed work.
