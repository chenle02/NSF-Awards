Professor Thomas Keyes is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies on liquid state
dynamics. Keyes has developed a new technique for performing dynamical studies
of the liquid state which depends on harmonic normal mode analysis. This new
methodology has been applied to supercooled liquids where existing dynamical
theories have shown limited success, and it is capable of yielding an Arhhenius
activation energy for self diffusion. The technique will be developed further to
treat several other dynamical quantities including rotational diffusion,
spectral linewidths, and the identification of the region of cooperative
rearrangement. A secondary topic which will be studied is the computer
simulation of laser ablation of silicon and diamond. These ablation simulations
will lead to a more detailed picture of the energy redistribution within these
materials, and the mechanism for thermal and nonthermal laser action. %%% The
focus of this project is the dynamics of motion in the liquid state. The
research has an important bearing on the dynamical factors which control
chemical reactions in the liquid state or in solutions.
