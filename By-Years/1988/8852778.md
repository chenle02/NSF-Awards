This project will upgrade and expand instruction in color science in nine
associate and baccalaureate degree programs at the Fashion Institute of
Technology (F.I.T.). F.I.T. is a specialized community college of the State
University of New York. The understanding of color in scientific terms is an
essential part of the professional education of a growing number of full and
part-time students at F.I.T. who prepare for careers in fashion and its related
industries and professions. Beyond the need for professionally relevant
education, the college is committed to the importance of providing hands-on
experimentation in up-to-date laboratories to enable a wide variety of students
to understand, first-hand, the rigors, creativity, and excitement of modern
scientific inquiry. The acquisition of a computer- driven spectrophotometer with
appropriate software and plotter, portable colorimeters, and dyeing equipment
will upgrade laboratory instruction, reducing student frustration with failure
of old equipment and increasing the range of experiments students will perform.
This project will strengthen the F.I.T. model of integrating professional
education with relevant instruction in basic sciences, mathematics, and liberal
arts
