Information leakage to malicious adversaries is a fast growing concern affecting
computer users. Among the various forms of information leakage, side- and covert
channels have particularly gained notorious attention. Side channels are
information leakage channels where an adversary silently observes the activities
of a victim process to infer its secrets. Covert channels are even more
dangerous because a malicious insider trojan process intentionally colludes with
the attacker to exfiltrate secrets. Such information leakage channels can
exploit the abundance of shared hardware resources in current multi-core
hardware, and result in compromising sensitive user information. A thorough
understanding of the impact of such information leakage channels on computer
system security and their consequences can immensely benefit our national cyber-
security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project organizes a workshop to gather
leading researchers and experts who have spent considerable effort and time in
studying side and covert channels, as well as security researchers with strong
experience in computer systems and their security needs. The workshop narrowly
focuses on hardware side and covert channels, in order to create a unique forum
for studying a cross-disciplinary challenge in a focused manner, namely the
threat of side-channel and covert-channel leakage in computing, with the
participation of different communities: computer architects, hardware designers,
and cryptographers. The workshop participants identify potential improvements to
existing computer design methodologies and strategies to minimizing and
potentially neutralizing information leakage. A comprehensive workshop report
then summarizes the findings and discussion on the current state of the art and
projection in terms of detecting, mitigating and defending against side- and
covert channels.
