The principal investigator and his colleagues study several problems of
nonlinear elasticity for thin structures and solids, with applications to multi-
phase lipid bilayer vesicles, wrinkling of highly stretched sheets and
damage/fracture of solids. The main goals of the work are: (1) provide classes
of rational, accurate models for understanding the often exotic behavior of such
systems under various loadings; (2) systematically find their locally stable
equilibria (corresponding to local minima of the total potential energy) as
loading and/or composition parameters vary, particularly as small parameters
like thickness, inter-facial capillarity, etc., asymptotically approach zero.
Goal (2) is inextricably linked to (1). The investigator employs rational
continuum models, characterized by general constitutive functions, to study
questions of existence, thresholds of bifurcation and instability, and the
structure of local energy minima. The work is highly interdisciplinary,
requiring tools and perspectives from several areas of mathematics as well as
biophysics and materials science.

The investigator undertakes fundamental modeling and mathematical analysis
enabling a quantitative, predictive characterization of the behavior of certain
structures and solids under applied loading: lipid-bilayer membrane vesicles,
thin films and the nucleation and progression of damage/fracture zones in
solids. Each of these has direct and important connections to basic science and
technology -- especially biotechnology and materials and manufacturing. For
example, lipid-bilayer membranes are ubiquitous in bio-molecular systems;
understanding and predicting their mechanical behavior is crucial for
understanding cell function. The project focuses on understanding the behavior
of man-made membranes or liposomes under changes in osmotic pressure,
temperature, or composition. The future promise of liposome vesicles (closed
membranes) as vehicles for drug delivery demands a fundamental understanding of
their multi-phase mechanical behavior under loading and change of composition.
Associated with this, but also of more general interest, is the wrinkling of
thin films, which also shows up in the design of many thin devices or coatings,
fabric-like structures, in the behavior of human skin, etc. The investigator
studies the onset and development of wrinkles in very thin structures in highly
stretched environments. Finally, the fracture of solids, a well-known culprit
behind sudden and catastrophic failures in structures, is also currently of
great interest for purposes of harvesting natural gas. Predictive models, which
are especially lacking in this field, are addressed in this project. In
particular, he studies the onset and development of damage leading to fracture
of solids under loading.
