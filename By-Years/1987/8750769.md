Lebanon Valley College will strengthen its major degree programs in biochemistry
and biology by incorporating a new experiment into an existing genetics course
to demonstrate the principles of ultracentrifugation and its application to DNA
purification; introducing a new advanced course in molecular biology; and
implementing a new project-oriented sequence of experiments in an existing
biochemistry laboratory course. In order to carry out this plan, Lebanon Valley
College will acquire a Preparative Ultracentrifuge, Equipment for DNA
Electrophoresis, a Microcentrifuge, and a Biological Safety Hood. The increasing
importance of molecular genetics in both basic and applied biochemical research
makes the introduction of its concepts and methodologies into the curriculum
necessary.
