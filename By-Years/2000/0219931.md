For many practical reasons (e.g., hardware development cost,
power&lt;br/&gt;consumption, etc.), it would be attractive if we could increase
the&lt;br/&gt;effective performance of a computer system by simply adding more
processors&lt;br/&gt;to it. While it is reasonably straightforward to build such
systems that&lt;br/&gt;support "parallel processing", relatively few of today's
programs would&lt;br/&gt;enjoy any performance gain on such machines because
they were not written&lt;br/&gt;with parallel processing in mind. The ideal
solution for harnessing the&lt;br/&gt;potential benefits of parallel processing
without placing a large burden on&lt;br/&gt;the programmer would be for the
compiler to automatically transform a&lt;br/&gt;sequential program into an
efficient parallel program. While there has&lt;br/&gt;been progress on using
compilers to automatically "parallelize" regular&lt;br/&gt;numeric programs
(typically written in FORTRAN), there has been little&lt;br/&gt;progress in
automatically parallelizing broader classes of programs. The&lt;br/&gt;key
stumbling block has been that compilers have traditionally
created&lt;br/&gt;parallelism by proving that potential threads are always
independent. To&lt;br/&gt;circumvent this limitation, recent hardware prooposals
enable the compiler&lt;br/&gt;to optimistically create parallel threads without
proving independence. In&lt;br/&gt;this project, we plan to develop the compiler
technology necessary to fully&lt;br/&gt;exploit this new potential for
harnessing parallel processors.&lt;br/&gt;
