The objective of the research is to develop scheduling algorithms for electric
generation that account directly for system security requirements. Virtually all
algorithms in use currently do not optimize generating unit commitment decisions
against security requirements from the outset and yield, therefore, suboptimal
results when the commitment decisions must be adjusted to comply with these
requirements. Utilities can obtain significantly better results if they use
optimal scheduling algorithms that comply directly with security requirements.
While algorithms of this type had severe computational requirements, five-to-ten
years ago, recent advances in network programming have now made these algorithms
more attractive. The PI proposes to demonstrate the practical feasibility of a
new algorithm for solving the security-constrained unit scheduling problem. The
innovation of our approach is to capture the system security requirements within
a network flow subproblem that is solved in conjunction with the unit commitment
problem. In Phase One of this effort we will develop a prototype implementation
of this method by integrating a state-of-the-art network flow algorithm into an
advanced unit commitment algorithm. We will demonstrate the cost savings
possible with this algorithm on realistic test cases using representative
utility data.
