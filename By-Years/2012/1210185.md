This action funds Natalie Dolores Beckman-Ross of Colorado State University to
conduct a research project, entitled "Comparing natural wood transport in
mountain streams of Hokkaido and Colorado," during the summer of 2012 at the
Department of Forest Science Graduate School of Agriculture, Hokkaido University
in Sapporo, Hokkaido. The host scientist is Dr. Futoshi Nakamura.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to add to current
understanding of wood transport, log jam formation and carbon storage in
headwater streams by collecting and analyzing field data from sites in Hokkaido
and comparing it to previously collected data from Colorado's Front Range. The
research includes quantifying the relationship between instream wood and carbon
export from headwater streams, informing the management of stream ecosystems,
and determining the applicability of a statistical model based on physical
characteristics to a new stream and forest system. If similar factors are shown
to control the wood dynamics of headwater streams in Colorado and Japan, it is
possible that those factors can be used to remotely estimate stream carbon flux
for other mountainous areas.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
