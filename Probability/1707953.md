A central question in biology is to understand in detail how natural selection
affects the evolution of a population. When one individual in a population
acquires a beneficial mutation, that mutation may eventually spread to a large
fraction of the population, or even the entire population. Modeling this
phenomenon mathematically becomes particularly challenging when there can be
many different beneficial mutations in the population at a time. This research
project studies mathematical models of evolving populations that repeatedly
acquire beneficial mutations. Because, in these models, populations are assumed
to evolve in a random way, the theory of probability plays a central role in the
analysis. The research aims to provide mathematical insight into important
biological problems. Questions of interest include determining the rate at which
the fitness of the population increases as a result of beneficial mutations,
understanding the distribution of the fitness levels of individuals in the
population at a given time, and understanding how to describe the genealogy of a
sample from the population.

To model populations undergoing selection, the investigator will consider a
stochastic process called branching Brownian motion. Each particle dies at a
given rate, each particle moves independently according to one-dimensional
Brownian motion, and particles occasionally split into two. Here particles
represent individuals in a population, and the position of the particle along
the real line corresponds to the individual's fitness. It will be assumed that
the branching rate depends on the position of the particle, so that individuals
with higher fitness have more offspring. It is conjectured that in the long-run,
the empirical distribution of the positions of the particles is approximately
Gaussian. A proof of this result would provide a mathematically rigorous
formulation of the idea, well-established in the biology literature, that for
certain populations undergoing selection, the distribution of the fitness levels
of individuals in the population evolves like a Gaussian traveling wave. Because
branching Brownian motion can be used to model populations experiencing either
beneficial or deleterious mutations, this work could also shed light on a
phenomenon known as Muller's ratchet, which refers to the decrease in the
fitness of a population resulting from the accumulation of deleterious
mutations. The investigator will also consider some population models that
incorporate the effects of recombination, as well as a nested coalescent model
that describes the genealogy of a collection of individuals sampled from
multiple species.
