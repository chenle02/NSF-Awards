This proposal requests continuing support for a research program aimed at
achieving an understanding of the relationship between mineral crystal chemistry
and metamorphic grade and assemblage. Previously-supported work has demonstrated
that the ferric iron content and octahedral ordering in biotite vary as a
function of both metamorphic grade and co-existing minerals in a given
assemblage. Proposed work will expand on these results in two main directions:
by looking more closely at the other minerals which coexist with the previously-
studied biotites, and by examining other new suites of rocks over a range of
different oxidation conditions. Samples will be studied using transmitted and
reflected light petrography of phase determination, electron microprobe for
major element analysis, Mossbauer spectroscopy for iron redox and site
occupancies, and fast neutron activation analysis of oxygen. Our goals are to
provide a more comprehen- sive data base for several common solution phases by
modern approaches, to illustrate the effects of poor phase characteri- zation on
petrologic models (and suggest possible improvements to such models), and
finally, to derive "unique" cation substitution models for several of the
solution phases we will study.
