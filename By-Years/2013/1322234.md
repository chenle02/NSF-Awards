A request is made to fund new and replacement instrumentation on the R/V
Oceanus, a 177? research vessel operated by Oregon State University as part of
the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.

The R/V Oceanus is a general-purpose research vessel owned by the National
Science Foundation and operated by Oregon State University. The mission of the
ship is to support funded science research in the Pacific Northwest. RV Oceanus
completed 139 days in 2012, 111 (80%) of which were for NSF. In 2013, the vessel
is scheduled to sail has 182 days with 70% (127 days) of the schedule for NSF.
With this proposal, OSU provides technical descriptions and rationale for the
acquisition of the following Oceanographic Instrumentation: 1) Work Horse ADCP
Board Replacement: $8000 2) Slip Ring Upgrade: $10,500 3) CTD Connector Upgrade:
$26,500 Total: $45,000

Broader Impacts

The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two of the
Proposal Guidelines. They provide infrastructure support for scientists to use
the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded
oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by
the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and
operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any
US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.
