This funding supports the development of an integrated approach to teaching
circuits, signals, and systems courses in the undergraduate electrical
engineering curriculum. The lectures and laboratory are integrated through the
use of microcomputers as "smart textbooks". The student is guided interactively
through various phases of the laboratory experience, while keeping in focus the
fundamental theories and concepts that govern circuits and systems. The
equipment while primarily acquired for the circuits and systems courses, is also
available for design projects in the control, communication and digital systems
courses. This award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal
investigator's institution.
