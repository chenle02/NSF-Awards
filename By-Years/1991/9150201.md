This project will use computers to construct a new type of analytical chemistry
course at the freshman-sophomore level. It will focus on trace analysis of metal
ions and organic substances in a toxic waste site that can be "sampled" by
students to obtain uninterpreted analytical data via computer at many different
locations at the site. Students will carry out hands-on trace analyses with non-
toxic substances in order to develop their laboratory skills, and to see how the
analytical data from the "site" was obtained. Applications of high-end graphics
workstations throughout the lower-division laboratory courses, including the
analytical course, will also be central to this project. The uses will involve
among other things designing sequesterants for pollution abatement, exploring
host-guest interactions, and examining orbital interactions.
