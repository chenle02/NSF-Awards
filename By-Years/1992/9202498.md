The Fellow will examine the relationships between extreme hydrologic events on
continents and large-scale atmospheric and oceanic conditions in both modern and
paleoclimatic records. Studies will determine any relationships of El
Nino/Southern Hemisphere events (or the Asian Monsoon) on global weather and
climate. The Fellow will spend her fellowship tenure at the Pennsylvania State
University.
