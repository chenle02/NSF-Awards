This project enhances the student's ability to measure fluid motion by the
installation of a laser doppler anemometer flow system and by the construction
of a new wave tank. In the fluid dynamics laboratory, an introduction to the
application of lasers in the field of measurements is presented. The equipment
enables the students to measure the velocity profiles for different flows. The
laser doppler velocimeter allows a focused measurement of velocity and
turbulence in fluid flows, without disturbing the movement of the fluid
particles. Experiments illustrate such concepts as flow separation, stall,
vortex shedding, drag calculation, turbulence, and shear stress. When students
finish their fluid dynamics laboratory, they are ready to expand their
capability to conduct more experiments on flow phenomena in the coastal
environment using the new wave flume.
