This project in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division studies the fundamentals of solvation, the interaction of additives
with liquids. Solvation properties affect reaction rates and the course of
reactions. When two or more solvents interact, separation of components is based
on competitive solvation properties. Prof. Carr has been developing general
descriptions of solvation, and this work extends his earlier explorations.
Solvation properties are organized based on Kamlet-Taft scales of dipolarity,
hydrogen bond acidity, and basicity. Gas and liquid chromatography will be used
to measure solvation parameters, and then new chromatography columns will be
evaluated based on knowledge of the previously measured parameters. Extension to
characterization of reversed phase liquid chromatography will be made. Free
energy scales for solvation as a function of acidity and basicity parameters
will be established.
