9727663 Graedel The PI proposes Shared Funding for the Gordon Research
Conference on Industrial Ecology. Industrial ecology is an emerging field
focused on the environment which takes a systems view of industrial activity and
its external interactions. It takes selected approaches of biological ecology
(resource cycling, energy flows, food webs, etc.) and uses them to study such
topics as materials and energy cycling in industry. The goal is to decrease
impacts on the natural environment and to increase the sustainability and
efficiency of energy and materials use. It takes system-wide views and is
clearly multidisciplinary, involving (among others) chemical engineers,
industrial engineers, manufacturing engineers, physicists, chemists, materials
scientists, and operations researchers. Any emerging field lacks many of the
traditional mechanisms for the production and communication of research,
particularly periodic, broadly structured conferences at which the most recent
and exciting research can be shared and discussed. To begin to fill this gap,
the Principal Investigator submitted a proposal for a Gordon Research Conference
on Industrial Ecology. That proposal was accepted, and the first such conference
will be held in the summer of 1998. ***
