Through this project, the institution purchased an NMR to improve the students'
understanding of molecular structure, particularly of organic compounds. The
chemistry faculty revised existing experiments to take advantage of the
equipment, and they added new experiments emphasizing principles of molecular
structure such as applications of NMR to biochemical kinetics and cation
hydration constants by proton NMR. Facilities for undergraduate research were
greatly enhanced by the acquisition. In addition, the equipment was used for the
institution's "Saturday Seminar" program for high school teachers and students
and for junior college faculty and students in the area. The institution
contributed to the project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
