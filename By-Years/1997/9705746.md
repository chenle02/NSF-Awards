9705746 Oldfield The PIs on this proposal will use ab initio density functional
methods and a cluster of RISC work stations to computer parameter surfaces
relating spectroscopic observables and structure in silicate systems, for
example how the chemical shift or quadrupole coupling constant of a bridging
oxygen varies with bond length and bond angle. These can then be used to deduce,
e.g., the distributions of M-O bond lengths and M-O-M bond angles in disordered
and amorphous phases. They will focus their efforts on oxide systems based on
Si, Al, B, and P (including mixed heteroatom systems; e.g. aluminosilicates).
The NMR parameters can be calculated for all of these cations and for 17-O, and
for all of them there is a good experimental data base to verify the
calculations. The parameter surfaces will be the first of their type and will be
calculated at a sufficiently high level that they will be of general
quantitative applicability for a wide range of applications.
