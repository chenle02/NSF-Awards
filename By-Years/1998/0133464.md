Data mining is the process of automatically extracting useful information hidden
in large data sets. This emerging discipline is becoming increasingly important
as advances in data collection have lead to the explosive growth in the amount
of available data. This project aims to develop a wide-range of novel data
mining algorithms suitable for the characteristics of scientific data sets
arising in genomics and fluid dynamics. Our research will focus on developing
algorithms both for sequential datasets and for datasets that can be represented
by directed labeled graphs. The graph-based modeling enables us to capture in a
single and unified framework many of the spatial, topological, geometric, and
other types of relational characteristics present in scientific datasets. The
specific research tasks that we plan to address are: (i) Development of scalable
algorithms for finding frequently occurring patterns in graph data sets and
algorithms for finding patterns whose frequency decreases as a function of the
pattern-length. (ii) Development of scalable and high quality clustering
algorithms for sequence and graph data sets which operate directly in the native
feature space. (iii) Development of scalable and accurate classification
algorithms based on automated sequential or relational feature extraction
approaches. These algorithms will be validated by analyzing data sets
arising&lt;br/&gt;in genomic and turbulent fluid flow. The project integrates
the data mining research with an educational plan that focuses on initiating
undergraduate and graduate students to the various computational and data
analysis aspects of genomic research and developing a comprehensive
bioinformatics curriculum whose goal is to foster multi-disciplinary research
and collaboration. In addition, a comprehensive set of software tools will be
developed and made available that can be used both to train students in using
data mining techniques and to conduct novel research expanding the levels of
understanding in various scientific disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;
