The objective of this project is to study theoretical and practical issues in
the evaluation of general globel predicates and functions of distributed
software. As an application of the techniques of the research, the project will
focus on distributed monitoring systems for fault tolerance. An example of
detecting a global predicate arises in implementing the most basic command of a
monitoring system: `stop the program when the predicate is true`. To stop the
program it is necessary to detect the predicate q, which is not a trivial task
if q requires access to the global state. There are three components to the
project: theory, algorithms and implementation. There are two questions that
will be investigated in terms of theory. First, the class of global predicates
that are efficient to detect will be classified. This will also entail studying
the limits of efficient detection of global predicates. Second, a predicate
logic which is suitable for efficient detection of global predicates will be
developed. After developing the logic, efficient decentralized algorithms for
detecting occurrence of logic formulas will be designed. This work will be based
on the use of a centralized checker process developed by the PI. Finally, the
decentralized algorithm will be used to design an experimental distributed
monitoring system.
