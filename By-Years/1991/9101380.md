In this project the principal investigator will continue his research on the
asymptotic behavior of orthogonal polynomials and their zeros with respect to
general weights with compact support in the plane. He will also explore the
possibility of using potential theory to study orthogonal polynomials in
collaboration with faculty members at the University of South Florida. Finally
the principal investigator will study asymptotic questions related to the
support of the Christoffel function under fairly general assumptions. The study
of the properties of orthogonal polynomials is important in its own right and
for the light it sheds on various problems in approximation theory, numerical
analysis and differential equations. In this project the principal investigator,
in collaboration with experts at the University of South Florida, will continue
his valuable work on the asymptotic properties of orthogonal polynomials under
general conditions through the use of potential theory.
