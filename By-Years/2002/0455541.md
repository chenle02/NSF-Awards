&lt;br/&gt;Barnes 04-55541&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Toolik Field Station (TFS), in
the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, Alaska, has been a major site for
research in the North American Arctic since 1975. Much of what is known about
the structure and function of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of the Arctic
and the effects of climate change and feedbacks to global climate comes from the
long-term, process-based ecological research projects at TFS. TFS-based work has
also resulted in a showcase of discoveries on the adaptations of organisms to
the Arctic and population-level changes in animal and plant phenologies and
distributions. Because climate is changing most rapidly in arctic and boreal
regions and changes in the Arctic are predicted to strongly affect the global
climate system, continuing research into the causes, mechanisms of response, and
feedbacks to further ecosystem change is a high research priority. Along with
the ongoing strong interest for use of TFS as a research platform by scientists
from a broad array of disciplines, and a specific call for year-round studies of
arctic ecosystems, this high priority promises a steady demand for TFS-based
services into the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this agreement Toolik Field
Station will:&lt;br/&gt;o continue to support NSF funded research projects as
requested within the capacity of the station. &lt;br/&gt;o develop the station
infrastructure and capabilities to support evolving needs and scientific
approaches. &lt;br/&gt;o develop the educational opportunities, both formal and
informal, of the station both onsite and remotely&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
