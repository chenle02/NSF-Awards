This project focuses on the introduction of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
microscopy in the undergraduate materials engineering curriculum. The FTIR
Spectrometer and FTIR microscope have proven value as analytical tools in a wide
range of applications; however, the utility of the technique for materials
analysis and characterization has received little attention from engineers.
Several experiments have been developed to highlight basic principles such as
adsorption and corrosion on metal surfaces, covalent metallic bonding,
characterization of thin oxide films deposited on semiconductor metal surfaces,
characterization of integrated circuits, and characterization of polymers and
coatings.
