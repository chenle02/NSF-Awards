9307149 Liu This research is in the application of the theory of foliations to
power systems. More specifically the intent is to (1) Derive a new theory which
will integrate various dynamic mechanisms, including those governing the
frequency and voltage behaviors and their interaction. (2) Apply the theory of
foliations to develop a new method for power system dynamic analysis which
allows interaction of various mechanisms but can also be decomposed to direct
the focus on a specific phenomenon. (3) Develop controllability criteria and
control algorithms based on the foliations derived from the power system model.
