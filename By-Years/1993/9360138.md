9360138 Hollingsworth The recent observation of efficient visible luminescence
form nanometer sized silicon crystallites has generated a great deal of
excitement in the semiconductor community. The emission of light about the
bandgap of silicon is generally attributed to quantum confinement of carriers in
crystallites with dimensions less than 5nm. This research project will examine
plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition as a method of producing
nanocrystalline silicon thin films exhibiting visible luminescence. Heavily
doped micro crystalline films grown by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition
have been studied for many years for use in amorphous silicon photovoltaics. The
micro crystalline films consist of crystals with typical grain sizes less than
10nm surrounded by an amorphous silicon matrix. It has been shown that removal
of the amorphous matrix leaves nanocrystalline silicon with visible
luminescence. Undoped, p, and n type micro crystalline films will be grown by
plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition with subsequent etching of the
amorphous matrix to leave nanocrystalline research, with the ultimate goal in
Phase II of producing light emitting diodes on glass substrated for large area
flat panel display applications.
