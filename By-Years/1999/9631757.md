ABSTRACT Experimental Analysis of Alternative Male Strategies PI: SINERVO,
Barry IBN 96-31757 Three color polymorphism s of males are correlated with
distinct behavioral strategies in the side-blotched lizard, Uta stansburiana:
(1) orange-throated males are very aggressive and defend large territories with
many females, (2) blue-throated males tend to be monogamous and guard their
mates, but defend small territories, and (3) yellow- throated males do not
defend territories, but are sneakers and mimic the behaviors of females if
challenged by other males. Long-term field studies indicate that the three male
types are cycling in frequency within the population. Orange is replaced by
yellow, yellow males are, in turn, vulnerable to blue mate-guarding males, and
blue males are, in turn, vulnerable to ultra-dominant orange-throated males. It
is predicted that each morph has a fitness advantage when it occurs at a very
low frequency. Because throat color is heritable, the initial morph frequency
will be manipulated in small isolated subpopulations. When offspring mature, DNA
paternity analysis will be used to determine the reproductive success of each
male offspring in the three experimental frequency manipulations. In a final
experiment, blood testosterone concentrations will be manipulated to determine
if the high testosterone levels that have been observed in orange males is also
responsible for both their success against blue males, and their susceptibility
to the yellow male strategy.
