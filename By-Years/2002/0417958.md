The purpose of this study is to describe one permutation of the cultural logic
of modern socio-economic structures through the example of bankruptcy in the
United States. The PI will do so through a multi-site, multi-method approach,
combining interviews with attorneys working on bankruptcy cases for a large
Maryland firm, discussions with members of the U.S. House and Senate involved in
the passage of recent bankruptcy reform legislation, and historical/archival
research on bankruptcy petitions in the U.S. The result will be a fuller
understanding of the social construction of debtor identity, and a clearer
picture of the place of debt in the larger socioeconomic discourse.
