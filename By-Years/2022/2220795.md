This project will investigate the impact on research participants and staff of
participating in research about violence. The goal of the project is to inform
and facilitate ethical decision-making in research that involves asking about
violence. The project will result in the development of a best-practices
handbook that combines data and practical suggestions to minimize harm and
maximize benefits for participants when conducting research on political
violence. The project will build a network of scholars and practitioners for
advancing ethical practices across research sites, as well as a training module
for graduate students on ethical considerations for research on political
violence. The project will yield a useful resource for researchers, educators,
ethicists, policy makers, and public and private
organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to collect
evidence to inform standards and best practices for ethical decision-making in
data collection on the topic of violence. Specifically, the project aims to: i)
generate generalizable evidence on the harms, benefits, and regret associated
with participating in violence research for both respondents and interviewers;
and ii) develop new guidance for researchers across disciplines and other
research stakeholders for how to make informed decisions about the potential
costs and benefits of research on political violence. The project will include a
systematic review of the existing evidence on asking about violence, a multi-
site field experiment in diverse communities at risk for political violence, and
a survey of interviewers who routinely ask respondents about their experiences
with violence. The findings will be used to create a handbook of recommended
practices related to ethics in research on violence. The project will have
implications for how researchers and stakeholders, such as ethics boards and
journal editors, assess and maximize beneficence for violence research in the
social and behavioral sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project was funded
through the ER2 program by the SBE and the BIO
directorates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
