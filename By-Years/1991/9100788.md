This project will bring 12 undergraduate students to Utah State University for
8 weeks during the Summer of 1991 to do research in parallel processing. They
will receive formal instruction in parallel algorithms, fine grain versus coarse
grain parallelism, recognition of parallelism, debugging of parallel algorithms,
tools for dealing with parallel algorithms, and parallel algorithms in 3D
medical image technology. After the instructional phase students will be
involved in research projects from these areas.
