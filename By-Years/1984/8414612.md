Research is conducted in nuclear fuel menagement and electrical generation
dispatch through the use of supercomputers. The research utilizes the capability
of a supercomputer to provide for large-scale optimization of multi-cycle,
nuclear-reactor core-reload design. The research also involves electrical power
system intergration and generating unit reliability. An important objective is
to incorporate realistic core physics modeling into the optimization search
procedures. A sophisticated nodal code is to be converted to vector form for
this work. The objectives are pursued with the initial focus upon using
accelerated direct-search techniques for core-reload optimization. Also, fixed
absorber loading is to be an additional degree of freedom in the modeling.
Simplified utility system intergration and reliability models are incorporated
into the optimization procedure. A sensitivity study is also carried out to
learn the level of modeling detail that is significant for these parameters.
