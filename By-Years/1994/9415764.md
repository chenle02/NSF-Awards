This project will develop a realistic photochemical dynamical model for the 5577
angstrom oxygen green line emission. The model will couple the chemical
production and loss of the oxygen emission with dynamical wave advection to
establish the transfer function between the relative neutral density
fluctuations and the relative brightness fluctuations of the green line due to
internal gravity waves propagating into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere
region. It will include the effect of a realistic zonal, meridional winds and a
realistic non-isothermal atmosphere.
