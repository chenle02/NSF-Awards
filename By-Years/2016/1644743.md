This is a project from Texas A &amp; M University (TAMU) to create TAMU-iSite,
an I-Corps program that immerses engineering student teams in commercialization
training from development of ideas to startups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF
Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at
universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to
transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide
infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest
funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into
becoming I-Corps Team applicants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal describes
an institution and I-Corps Site implementation plan that are likely to result in
a successful Site. There appears to be good outreach to the community and a
likelihood that a Site will contribute to a change of culture at this
institution. The personnel are strong and experienced with the Lean Launch Pad
curriculum. There are specific plans for recruiting women and minorities. A plan
for sustainability was also included and the assessment plan was detailed. The
proposal presented a strong implementation plan, a solid management team,
excellent external partners, significant innovation resources and facilities on
campus, and a student body, comprised mostly of engineers, that will contribute
a pipeline of teams and projects to the Site.
