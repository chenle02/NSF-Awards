As part of the HERMES collaboration at the DESY accelerator facility in Germany,
Measurements of spin dependent deep inelastic scattering of high energy
electrons from nucleons will be carried out. Utilizing both a polarized electron
beam in the HERA ring and newly developed polarized internal gas target
technology this experiment will study in a complete and precise way the spin
structure of the nucleon. The experiment has been designed to minimize
systematic errors.
