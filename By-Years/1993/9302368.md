Technical Narrative: This proposed conference, organized by North Carolina
Central University and Cairo University, is scheduled for 24-28 May 1993 in
Alexandria, Egypt. The topic of the conference is the interaction of ergodic
theory with harmonic analysis. Participants will come from the Middle East,
Europe, and the U.S. Prior to the start of the conference (May 17-22), a series
of short courses in Ergodic Theory, Harmonic Analysis, and Number Theory will be
held in order to provide the necessary background for mathematicians who have
not been introduced to this new and exciting area of research. This proposal
supports the participation of approximately 10 U.S. mathematicians. Conference
participants will present papers that will be compiled and published as a
conference volume. This conference in mathematical sciences fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States, Egypt and elsewhere to combine complementary talents and present
research results in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. This
conference has an educational and outreach effort that has the potential for
generating new scientific activity and new international linkages.
