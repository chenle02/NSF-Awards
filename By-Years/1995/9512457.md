This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Colby College acquire a SGI two-processor power
challenge L desktop supercomputer and associated software. The research activity
to be supported includes: (1) Computer Aided Molecular Design program that
supports curriculum and student-faculty research programs (2) transition state
molecular orbital calculations for small organics and (3) molecular dynamics
calculations. A workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a
new way to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a
"computer network" also serves as a development environment for new theoretical
codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization
facilities.
