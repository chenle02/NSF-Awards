The moduli space of stable n-pointed curves of genus g, is endowed with vector
bundles having interesting positivity properties and connections to many
different areas of mathematics and mathematical physics. Over a point, the
bundles are naturally described as conformal blocks, vector spaces that arise as
basic objects in rational conformal field theory. The projects in this proposal
are focused on three general themes, aimed at developing our understanding of
vector bundles of conformal blocks bundles and their interplay with cycles on
the moduli space. The first project aims to show the Chern classes of so-called
"critical level bundles" are subject to ''strange identities'', given by
interchanging roles of level and rank. The second project explores properties of
conformal blocks divisors, including their corresponding morphisms, questions of
finite generation, and applications. The third project is concerned with cones
of positive cycles on varieties, illustrated for the moduli space of stable
n-pointed rational curves via conformal
blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moduli spaces of stable curves with
marked points occupy a unique and prominent position in the algebro-geometric
universe. As moduli spaces, they give insight into the study of smooth curves
and their degenerations, and as special varieties, they have played an important
role in developing general theory. Recent work has revealed that many
combinatorial aspects of the spaces are reflections of underlying geometric
structures embodied by vector bundles of conformal blocks. The projects in this
proposal aim both to use the features of these vector bundles to discover the
nature of the moduli spaces, and also to use the architecture of the moduli
spaces to reveal underlying relationships between the vector bundles.
