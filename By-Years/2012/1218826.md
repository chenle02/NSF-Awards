This project will create software infrastructure and sociotechnical mechanisms
that let agencies engage the efforts of citizens in order to gather data and
even take on small tasks in their local communities. Realizing this aim requires
filling significant technological gaps: (1) no robust software infrastructure
that enables a broad range of community activities, (2) no general set of
incentive mechanisms that organizers can use to attract and motivate citizen
participation, and (3) no software tools for organizers to monitor effectiveness
and make necessary adjustments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project takes on these
challenges through research on four central topics. First, it will create a
general ontology of tasks, coordination mechanisms, incentives, and user
interfaces for organizers to define goals. Second, it will develop algorithms to
match participants and tasks, and user interfaces for participants to find tasks
of interest. The third topic is automated mechanisms and visualization tools for
organizers to monitor progress and adjust parameters such as incentives or
participation qualifications. Fourth, it will create interfaces for participants
to visualize their contributions and view incentives they have earned or are
eligible to earn, based on techniques to model users based on their
participation. The technical results will be embodied in a software
infrastructure which will be deployed and used as a platform for empirical
evaluation of the developed algorithms and interaction techniques.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key scientific outcomes of this project will be a
general and integrated software infrastructure for social participation efforts,
a diverse catalog of incentive mechanisms and guidelines for use, a novel set of
task matching and participant recruiting techniques, automated and semi-
automated techniques to monitor and dynamically adjust progress, and empirical
knowledge of how these novel algorithms and interaction techniques work in
practice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The infrastructure developed through this
research has great potential for enabling local government agencies to gather
much more, accurate, and timely data to inform their decisions. It also can help
citizens to become involved with their communities, finding constructive tasks
to take on that require differing amounts of skill and time commitments. An even
broader potential impact is that the products of this research can help renew
the relationship between local governments and citizens, making government more
responsive to citizens and giving citizens greater faith in their governments.
