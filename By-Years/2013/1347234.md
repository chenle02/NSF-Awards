The National Science Foundation (NSF) is pleased to announce the selection of
Mung Chiang , the Arthur LeGrand Doty Professor of Electrical Engineering at
Princeton University, to receive its 2013 Alan T. Waterman Award. Dr. Chiang is
also an associated faculty of Computer Science and an affiliated faculty of the
Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics at
Princeton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Waterman Award is the National Science
Foundation's (NSF) highest honor. The annual award recognizes outstanding
researchers under the age of 35 in any field of science or engineering that NSF
supports. In addition to a medal, this year's awardee will receive a $1 million
grant over a five-year period for further advanced study in his
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Chiang, is the founder of the Princeton
EDGE Lab, which bridges over the theory-practice divide in networking through
collaboration across many disciplinary boundaries as well as the academia-
industry boundary. His team constantly re-examines the mathematical
crystallization of engineering artifacts in networking. His research
investigates an evolving set of projects spanning the modeling, analysis, and
design of networks, both technological and human ones. Prof. Chiang also
received the 2012 IEEE Kiyo Tomiyasu Award -for demonstrating the practicality
of a new theoretical foundation for the analysis and design of communication
networks', a U.S. Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers
in 2008, an Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award in 2007, and a
National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2005. He was named as an MIT
Technology Review TR35 Young Innovator in 2007, and was elected an IEEE Fellow
in 2012.
