9302545 Peskin This award will support computational studies of the heart, the
development of the immersed boundary method, and the production of software
involving the immersed boundary method for the biological community. The first
component of the project will be the creation of a computer model of the heart
that is efficient enough and realistic enough to be a practical scientific tool
for the computational investigation of cardiac function. One goal of the project
is to produce simulations of imaging modalities (e.g. color-Doppler flow, MRI)
that are used in biological experimentation so that the output from the computer
experiment can be directly compared to experimental data. This type of output
make possible a direct comparison between simulated and actual data. To the
extent that the two agree, this lends support to the validity of the model.
Another benefit from such comparison is this: if the model is valid \, then the
simulated data can be used to enhance the visualization technique. The software
component of this project will be develop in conjunction with the Pittsburgh
Supercomputing Center. The project is being supported by the Computational
Mathematics, the Physiology, and the Computational Biology programs. ***
