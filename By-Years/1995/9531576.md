9531576 Garity This REU site award provides support for eight undergraduate
researchers in mathematics working under the supervision of several faculty
advisors. The program will run for eight weeks. The principal investigator and
two additional faculty members from the Mathematics Department and the Computer
Science Department will supervise student research projects. The students will
attend a daily seminar and will be given information about various areas of
mathematics and computer science. the research projects that the students work
on will be designed so as to make the students familiar with the process of
mathematical research. Each student must complete a written report on their
research activities for inclusion in a proceedings of the summer program.
