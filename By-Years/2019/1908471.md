Emerging Resistive Random-Access Memory (ReRAM) may replace flash-based Non-
Volatile Memory (NVM) technology in future. Unfortunately, ReRAM technology may
introduce new security vulnerabilities. This proposal will investigate the
security implications of ReRAM-based NVMs in computing systems and how to
structure secure-by-design ReRAM-based memories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will investigate security implications of ReRAM, and develop
countermeasures against ReRAM side-channel information leakage. The project has
three thrusts. The first thrust aims to understand the potential information
leakage in such emerging technologies. The second thrust will focus on
innovating architectural support to eliminate potential side-channel information
leakage. The third thrust will concentrate on system software level
solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve training of graduate
and undergraduate students and will make an effort towards involving
undergraduate and minority students in research. Outreach activities are planned
through social media and the Orlando Science center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project data will be stored in repository maintained in
https://stars.library.ucf.edu/memristor-based-memories. The data, models, and
simulators will be maintained for at least five years after the project
ends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
