An experimental search for narrow resonances in pion production by protons on
nuclei near 350 MeV bombarding energy will be carried out. In addition neutral
pion production, double pion production, and radiative capture will be studied
using a new recoil facility being developed for use on the IUCF Cooler. Studies
of proton capture reactions with polarized beam will be feasible following
installation of a new high intensity polarized ion source at IUCF in 1992-93.
Studies will include single and double pion production, including polarization
experiment, to test new relativistic theories. ***
