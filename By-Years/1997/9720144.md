ABSTRACT OPP-9720144 MORITZ, RICHARD UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON MOORE, JAMES
UNIVERSITY COPERATION FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH This project is a key component
of a large, coordinated, multi-investigator program, Surface Heat Budget of the
Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean. The research program will be conducted for 14 months from
a ship frozen into the ice pack. The combined set of measurements in SHEBA will
allow refinement of climate models for the Arctic region. Those improved models
will lead to better predictions of the climate and the permanence of the Arctic
ice cap under a proposed global warming that could occur if atmospheric carbon
dioxide levels are increased above present levels. This project will project a
management office for SHEBA. The office will facilitate a set of core
measurements at the field site, coordinate investigator reporting/planning
efforts, and provide information both to the general public and other funding
agencies participating in joint research projects.
