This research is concerned with developing new modulation, detection, and
coding systems for increasing the density of reliable digital data storage and
retrieval on magnetic media. In order to design better and more efficient signal
processing systems a thorough knowledge of the signal and noise characteristics
of the storage channel must be obtained. Thus experimental data will be
collected to better characterize the input-output characteristics of the
channel. In particular, emphasis will be placed on measuring effects that occur
at high recording densities, e.g., signal nonlinearities. Based on these
measurements, mathematical models will be developed which describe the input-
output characteristics of the channel. These models will be used to suggest
improved modulation, detection, and coding systems. The performance of these
systems will be evaluated based upon these models and compared to alternative
systems.
