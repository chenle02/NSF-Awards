This project focuses upon the preservation and re-use of scientific and
engineering data. A computational platform is being developed to allow
researchers to organize, preserve, and share their data in more consistent and
reliable ways, to facilitate broader use by the research community and society
as a whole. The team plans to create a Modular Cyber-Platform (MCP) that would
be simple and reliable enough to minimize the costs associated with maintenance,
yet flexible enough to facilitate use in a large number of domains or
disciplines. The modular cyber-platform would allow communities to readily
publish systematically classified datasets, permit automatic long-term curation
of data, and create a cyberinfrastructure for dataset dissemination, validation
(crowd vetting) and collaboration. While the products of this project would be
relevant to a range of science and engineering communities, the emphasis of the
project will initially be on data related to civil infrastructure (bridges,
highways, buildings, pipelines, power distribution networks).
