This award provides partial support for purchase of analytical equipment to be
shared by six faculty and by student researchers, all of whom are participating
in a multi-disciplinary Initiative in Ecology and Evolution program at the
University. The equipment includes an elemental analyzer and autoanalyzer, a
digestion block and two computers to control and acquire the data from the auto-
and element analyzer. These will be used to analyze plant tissues, soils, soil
extracts and water samples for total nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon and soil
nitrate, ammonium, phosphate and silica. Research enabled by availability of the
equipment include studies of ecosystem-level nutrient cycling, carbon
sequestration, impacts of herbivory on plants, stoichiometry in terrestrial
ecosystems, limnology, paleoclimatology, and validation of remotely sensed
biomass indexes. In addition to its use by this group, the equipment will be
available to other researchers and graduate students working on various topics
within the School of Biological Sciences, Geology and the School of Natural
Resources and will be a key component of a new focus on ecology within the
University of Nebraska at Lincoln.
