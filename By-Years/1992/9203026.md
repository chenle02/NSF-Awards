This project will provide for participation in the creation and operation of
ALOMAR, an Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere Research. In
conjunction with other CEDAR and European lidar programs, the PIs will develop a
high-power laser providing sodium temperature and wind measurement capabilities
with ALOMAR. This research, when completed, will address a range of geophysical
processes occurring at high latitudes, but having global implications, using
unique capabilities among current atmospheric lidars.
