Park, PA 16802-1503 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Mathematics Title:
Undergraduate Statistical Laboratory This proposal will establish a Statistics
Lab at Penn State Eric. The Behrend College, consisting of 15 PC's and several
peripherals, all networked together. The lab will be used to effectively teach
advanced undergraduate statistics course make full use of modern teaching tools
for students in our newly created statistics minor program. When not scheduled
for classes, the facility will be used for undergraduate statistics research
projects and independent studies. The Lab will mostly use the free, public
domain software, Lisp-Stat, augmented with indigenously developed software to
provide a complete point-and-click interface. The lab will directly affect
courses in basic probability, regression, analysis of variance, multivariate
analysis and statistical simulation. The materials developed under this project
are also expected to have an impact in larger basic introductory statistics
classes. Dissemination plans include the use of statlib and the World-Wide-Web
for archiving newly developed materials besides publications in journals and
presentations at professional meetings.
