This project will study interactions between three distinct systems: (1)
photovoltaic molecules and/or membrane structures derived from green plants and
artificial photosynthetic systems, (2) micron-scale electrode arrays formed by
metal wires in microchannel glass, and (3) the retina. The proposed research
will provide a knowledge and technology base necessary to integrate these
systems towards the successful development of a novel, energy-efficient retinal
prosthesis with a micron scale spatial resolution. More specifically, these
objectives will be pursued: - Investigate interactions between natural and
artificial photoactive structures and microchannel glass electrode arrays and to
determine methods of attaching the structures to individual microwires. -
Develop methods for depositing conductors throughout the entire length of the
microchannels. - Determine the optimal size and shape for a retinal stimulating
electrode. - Test the biocompatibility of the microchannel glass and
photoactivated microchannel glass. Results of this research are likely to have
broader application through improved understanding of metal/molecular
interfaces, imaging technology, novel microfabrication techniques, and
biological interfacing and testing.
