The objective of this research is to determine the effective stress response of
a soil deposit beneath a gravity-type structure when subjected to water wave
loading. The research will develop analytical models to estimate wave-induced
sediment response and assess the stability of an offshore structure. A series of
laboratory experiments will be performed to verify the predictive models. The
stability of offshore structures and the bearing capacity of supporting seafloor
are highly dependent on the cyclic loading effects of sea waves and associated
dynamic response of soils. Recent advances in theoretical understanding of the
dynamic response of offshore structures require verified data and validated
models. This project has a good potential to make important contributions to
uderstand the soil dynamics of offshore structures.
