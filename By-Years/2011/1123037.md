There are many engineering concepts that, to an expert eye, are clearly related
to each other but seem quite disconnected to novices and students. The
Engineering Genome project builds on previous NSF work and is developing
learner-centered tools for linking these engineering concepts, thus enabling
students to better recognize the interrelationships of the concepts. It is
expected that by enabling students to recognize these relationships, students
will more quickly develop expert-like behavior and understanding. The
understanding of these relationships also serves to assist students as they
search for learning materials related to a subject they are studying.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analogous to Pandora, the internet radio search
application that relates and finds similar music using a music genome, the
Engineering Genome project will implement a search method for finding related
engineering concepts using the Engineering Genome. The project is developing the
Engineering Genome for a subset of engineering topics and is assessing the
efficacy of the genome for enhancing student learning.
