This action funds Adrian S. Johnson of University of South Florida to conduct a
research project, entitled "Learning anatomy in Chinese society via a natural
spatial augmented game environment (SAGE) projected onto the self," during the
summer of 2012 at the Institute of HCI and Media Integration at Tsinghua
University in Beijing, China. The host scientist is Dr. Linmi Tao.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is related to using computer
vision and augmented reality to create a more natural learning modality and user
experience.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
