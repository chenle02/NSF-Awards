Interactive multimedia instruction (IMI) is known to be an effective method of
delivering technical skill instruction to learners across many educational
areas. This project merges the Instrument Society of America's INVOLVE IMI
system with the current Electronics program to provide a specialized Associate
of Applied Science instrumentation curriculum. The principal aims of the project
are to increase the number of instrumentation career seekers, build education
pathways from high schools through four-year and higher education in partnership
with industry, train a more culturally-diverse and gender-balanced work force
and improve learning efficiency. The project will produce highly skilled
individuals able to track the process control industry's transition into the
evolving automated workplace of tomorrow.
