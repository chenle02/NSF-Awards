This project will study the life experiences, coping patterns and social
supports of individuals with neurofibromatosis (NF), a common chronic and
progressive neurological disorder. The individual with NF faces a lifetime of
dealing with a disfiguring and disabling chronic disease whose prognosis is
unpredictable. The project will study the local and national NF support groups,
and will document the ways in which the media-created image of "the elephant
man" as the personification of the dread and stigmatized disease has affected
the adaptation of individuals and their families to their condition. The
research will use indepth interviews and observation of individuals and families
and NF support groups. This research is significant because it will show how
individuals and families adapt to (organize, amd cope with) the complexities of
genetic and chronic illness, stigma and disability. This research will be shed
light on stigma as a social condition, and on the role of support groups in
dealing with dramatic, stigmatized and often unpredictable health conditions.
