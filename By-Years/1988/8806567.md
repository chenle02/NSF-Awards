Richard Matzner will investigate several interconnected fields having to do
with theories of gravity and tests of those theories using manmade satellites.
He will combine computer and analytical simulations to determine the utility of
Earth satellites like LAGEOS or the proposed LAGEOS III in determining the post-
Newtonian behavior of gravitational theories. Numerical studies will investigate
cosmological and astrophysical phenomena, including cosmic strings, (the study
of which requires large computational and graphics support) and cosmic
inflation. The behavior of radiation (neutrinos) as a cooling medium in neutron
stars with application to supernova evolution will be studied. Prediction of the
behavior of the cosmic background radiation in inhomogeneous cosmologies will be
carried out, as will theoretical studies of the nuclear abundances predicted in
hot big bang cosmologies. Other theoretical work will include more study of
inflation in cosmology, studies of gravitational wave propagation in cosmology
and also near black holes, and different approaches (Regge calculus and
computational field theory) to the study of gravitating systems.
