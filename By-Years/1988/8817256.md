Basin and range extensional tectonics has been the focus of considerable
geological and geophysical investigation, however, there are several major
problems remaining such as the relation- ship between extension and magmatism
and the rate of extension. This study will involve 40 Ar/39 Ar dating of
synextensional volcanic rocks and metamorphic rocks from east-central and
western Nevada and western Arizona. Results will address the question of strain
rates and whether extension was synchronous or diachronous across domains and if
magmatism was concurrent with extension.
