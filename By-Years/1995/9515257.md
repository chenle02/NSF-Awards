This award supports a three-year collaborative research project between
Professor Jeffrey H. Winicour, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University
of Pittsburgh, and Professor Nigel T. Bishop, Department of Mathematics and
Astronomy, University of South Africa (UNISA), Pretoria. In addition, a junior
investigator from the University of Durban-Westville, a historically
disadvantaged institution in South Africa, will participate in the project, as
well as a graduate student from the University of Pittsburgh. The investigators
will collaborate on research relevant to the Binary Black Hole `Grand
Challenge,` whose objective is to calculate the gravitational radiation that is
emitted during the in-spiral and coalescence of two black holes. The problem can
be divided into two parts: (a) the strong-field region near the black holes, and
(b) the outer region extending to infinity. The work to be undertaken concerns
part (b), as well as the interface between parts (a) and (b). The proposed
collaboration combines expertise in numerical computing and access to
supercomputers in the United States, while the South African side offers special
expertise in algebraic computing. The international collaboration will also give
new research opportunities to young researchers in both countries.
