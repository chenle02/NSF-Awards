0122615&lt;br/&gt;Dunne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This US-Mexico award will fund a
collaborative project between Dr. Gerald Dunne, of the University of
Connecticut, in collaboration with Dr. Christian Shubert of the Universidad
Michoacana in Morelia, Mexico. The researchers aim to study the development of
powerful new computational techniques in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and
quantum electrodynamics (QED), with the expectation that they will also apply to
physically important backgrounds, and to many other situations in quantum field
theory and gravitational theories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will
involve a blend of analytic and computer-based methods, providing a balanced
approach that is accessible to students. The collaboration will bring together
expertise on complementary aspects of the proposed research with the partner in
Mexico contributing his knowledge of the world-line method, while the US partner
contributes his experience with higher-order derivative expansions and symmetry
aspects of gauge theories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
