This project is for the support of undergraduate student participation in
ongoing research programs in the Department of Physics and the National
Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. The research areas included are
experimental and theoretical nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, and
accelerator physics. Students participate in a weekly meeting conducted by the
research staff and have the opportunity to take specialized courses. This
project is supported under the Program of Research Experiences for
Undergraduates to help ensure an adequate supply of scientists for the future.
