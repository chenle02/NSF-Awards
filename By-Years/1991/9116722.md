This research is to extend previous research on Hawaiian earthquakes and
tectonics to the north part of the island of Hawaii and to the rest of the
Hawaiian archipelago. These areas are less active seismically than those studied
thus far, and no tectonic models exist explaining the presence of earthquakes.
The previous study analyzed 250 fault-plane solutions for earthquakes in Kaoiki
(between the two volcanoes Kilauea and Mauna Loa), in Kilea (the meizoseismal
area of the great earthquake of 1868), and west Hawaii. The resulting estimation
of stress directions and tectonic models bear on the question of seismic hazard
in the Hawaiian island chain. This research is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
