The project will continue an ongoing study of deep connections between the
theory of combinatorial structures on a large finite set, such as trees,
forests, mappings, and partitions, and the theory of stochastic processes such
as Brownian excursion and Levy processes. Specific topics to be studied include
exchangeable coalescent processes, random Gibbs partitions and fragmentations,
coherent combinatorial structures, partial exchangeability, consistent systems
of fragmentations, continuum tree limits, occupancy problems and power laws for
random discrete distributions, and Bayesian inference. There has been a rich
interplay of ideas between these subjects in the last few years, and it is
expected that much more remains to be discovered as present models for the
asymptotics of various combinatorial structures are challenged by problems
arising in various application areas. One general theme is the rich variety of
models of random discrete distributions which arise when unit of mass
continuously distributed in the leaves of a continuum random tree is decomposed
in various ways, such as by projection onto a branch of the tree, or by cutting
with a Poisson point process of cuts along branches of the tree. Such
constructions lead to models for random discrete distributions with natural
interpretations in application contexts, for instance the Poisson cuts may
represent mutations in a phylogenetic tree.

Results of the project should provide deeper understanding of models for the
evolution of random partitions and partition-valued processes, particularly
processes of fragmentation and coagulation. Such results should be of value in
the numerous fields where such processes have been applied before, including
physics, astronomy, genetics, phylogeny, ecology, and document analysis. In
particular, the application of random discrete distributions with power law
tails to model the distribution of topics among scientific documents may provide
improved methods for classification and navigation of large bodies of scientific
literature.
