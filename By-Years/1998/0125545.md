The goal of this project is to make a fundamental contribution towards a
nationally shared understanding of the role and impact of a science center in
facilitating enhanced public understanding, attitudes and behaviors toward
science by means of informal learning activities. To accomplish this, this
research project will investigate the following questions: 1) What are the
specific long-term changes in science understanding, attitudes and behaviors
that result from visiting a science center exhibition? 2) What are the factors
that contribute to these long-term changes? 3) What is the relationship between
science center visits and subsequent reinforcing educational experiences? This
study will build on previous work conducted by ILI at the California Science
Center aimed at understanding how a science center impacts its community. These
studies are known collectively as the Los Angeles Science Education Research
Project (LASER). A sample of participants in one of the LASER studies has
expressed their willingness to participate in subsequent interviews. These
interviews will be designed to capture both small and large changes in science
understanding, attitudes, behaviors and other informal learning experiences
subsequent to the visit to the science center.
