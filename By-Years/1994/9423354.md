Recent historical approaches to science in the late seventeenth century are
beginning to reveal how nature and morals continued to be linked during the
scientific revolution, with important effects on scientific theory. This project
examines the issue for scientists dependent on patronage, ascertaining how the
interplay between scientific and moral values affected notions of conscience.
The method involves study of archives and rare book collections in France,
Holland, England and Sweden, to examine the life and work of scientists
associated with the Parisian Royal Academy of Sciences during the reign of Louis
XIV. By studying both public and private documents and records, the
investigation can identify opposition and its motives, in relationship to views
of cosmology, the theory of the soul and public issues of conscience. The
findings will clarify what moral lessons scientists inferred from nature; issues
of conscience that troubled them; how they handled disagreements with patrons;
the extent to which opposition could endanger a scientific career or scientific
achievements prevent punishment; to what degree scientific matters sparked
issues of conscience or abetted the fight for moral principle; and whether the
necessity of opposition affected either the scientific or the moral principles
that guided scientists' lives. These results will be published in articles and a
book.
