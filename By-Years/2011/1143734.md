Automated decision support systems help users make informed and intelligent
choices over a set of alternatives, taking into account user preferences and
trade-offs among multiple system attributes. In the software engineering domain
decision support systems are used to help in evaluating alternative design,
technical and managerial choices in terms of quantitative preferences and trade-
offs. Preferences over alternatives are evaluated either by directly soliciting
from the stakeholders a measure of the perceived utility/value of each
attribute, or by quantifying such utility/value based on past experience and
expertise. In most practical settings, however, preferences over attributes
cannot all be quantified. On the other hand, considering preferences only
qualitatively (specifying them as simple relative orderings between
alternatives) is also not practical. To overcome these limitations, the proposed
research focuses on developing a new paradigm for decision support systems,
where preferences are specified both in qualitative and quantitative
terms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main thrust of this work will be to: (a) develop
robust formalisms for representing and reasoning with quantitative and
qualitative preferences in an unified fashion, (b) investigate application-
domain specific extensions to the formalisms, and (c) identify implementation
strategies for practical application of the decision support system as a
preference analyzer. The anticipated results will help realize application-
specific robust decision support systems in multiple domains, including product-
line engineering, safety-critical system development, and goal-oriented
requirements engineering, by enabling improved automated reasoning about
preferences. This work will contribute to research-based training of a
postdoctoral scholar and a graduate student in techniques that cut across
software engineering, formal methods and artificial intelligence. Research
results will be disseminated through publications in journals and conferences.
