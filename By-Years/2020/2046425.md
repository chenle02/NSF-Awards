Highly personal information about individuals is collected and analyzed at an
unprecedented scale. The insights to be gained from such analyses have the
potential to transform medicine, social science, and technology. However, this
potential often goes unrealized when the custodians of data do not have the
tools to analyze it while safeguarding individual privacy. Differential privacy
provides a framework for guaranteeing strong individual privacy while enabling
the systematic design of privacy-respecting algorithms. For these reasons, it is
enjoying increasingly widespread adoption in both industry and
government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research confronts three broad classes of
challenges which will enable the wider and safer adoption of differentially
private technologies. The first is to understand which statistical inference and
learning tasks admit differentially private solutions, and at what cost in
computational resources. This research uses connections between privacy,
communication complexity, and online learning to give a unified characterization
of when privacy is achievable. The second is to develop new algorithmic
paradigms, based on computational heuristics and regression algorithms, that
will lead to practical solutions to high-dimensional statistical problems. The
final objective is to develop new mathematical tools for more precisely
understanding the guarantees of differential privacy and assessing its
downstream impacts. Such tools will form a critical part of the guidance that
the scientific community must provide to policymakers. This research is
integrated with an educational plan that includes course development, research
training for graduate and undergraduate students, and new K-12 experiential
activities around privacy for sensitive survey data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
