This award provides funds to the Division of Medical Sciences at Harvard
University to establish a Research Experiences for undergraduates SITE. The
Division supervises Ph.D. training programs of the Graduate School of Arts and
Sciences for students engaged in biological research in laboratories on the
Medical School campus. This program is for a 10 week summer research experience
for 9 undergraduate students who would work in the field of microbial
biochemistry and genetic regulation. A research- related course, a student-
faculty research seminar series, and a career development discussion series will
accompany the laboratory research. Students, who will be recruited from a
nation-wide pool with a particular emphasis on recruiting qualified minority
students and women, will have the opportunity to carry out projects in the
laboratories of any of 13 Division faculty who are participating in this
program. The undergraduate will also be provided with opportunities to meet
other majority and minority research faculty and graduate students.
