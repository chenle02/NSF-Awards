Biological diversity has been changing and continues to change in nearly all
habitats on earth and it is now well-recognized nationally and internationally
that there is an urgent need for research programs specifically on issues of
biological diversity. This projects supports the workshop on a Special Research
Initiative on Marine Biological Diversity and Systematics. The objective of the
workshop is to bring together leading biological oceanographers and marine
biologists to discuss whether there is an urgent need for this program in Ocean
Sciences and to define the nature and substance of such a program. The ultimate
goal is to include this research in the Long-Range Plan for Ocean Sciences.
Biological diversity, its causes, and the potential fragility of biotic systems
in the face of knowledge of the species comprising a system, and rigorous
species identifications require a healthy science of systematics.
