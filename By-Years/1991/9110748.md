This grant is a Career Advancement Award for Women Scientists and Engineers
made to a faculty member at Texas A. and M. University. Prof. Dutta will work
with Prof. Gene D. Sprouse at State University of New York at Stony Brook on the
development of a technique to detect nuclear polarization caused by optical
pumping of heavy radioactive atoms. The method will have applicability to the
measurement of nuclear spins, moments, and deformation for nuclear isomers and
nuclei far from the region of stability.
