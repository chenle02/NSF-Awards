Kalton, Casazza, and Montgomery-Smith will continue their research into the
structure of Banach and non-locally convex spaces, and their applications to
other areas of analysis, and applications of probability to Banach spaces. Among
the questions to be addressed are whether every infinite-dimensional quasi-
Banach space has a proper closed infinite-dimensional subspace, how to calculate
the expected value of the norm of the sum of a Rademacher series, and whether
the compact approximation property in the dual of a Banach space implies the
property for the Banach space. Banach space theory is that part of mathematics
that attempts to generalize to infinitely many dimensions the structure of
3-dimensional Euclidean (i.e.ordinary) space. The axioms for the distance
function in a Banach space are more relaxed than those for Euclidean distance
(For example, the "parallelogram law" is not required to hold.), and as a
result, the "geometry" of a Banach space can be quite exotic. Much of the
research in this area concerns studying the structure theory of Banach spaces.
