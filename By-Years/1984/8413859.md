Research is underway to develop an optical laser probe to measure drop size
distributions and velocities in two-phase extraction systems. These measurements
will be used ultimately to determine the effect of extraction column operating
conditions on the spatial variations of the drop size, drop velocity, and column
hold-up in extraction columns of different diameters and different internal
mixing devices. Of particular interest will be the assessment of the effect of
scale-up on the degree of dispersed phase backmixing and bypassing in various
types of commercial columns. A computer code for the prediction of the flow
patterns, turbulence characteristics, and the local droplet breakage and
coalescence rates in the individual stage of an extraction unit also will be
developed.
