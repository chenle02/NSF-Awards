This book was developed by OERI to help parents meet goal 4 of the National
Education Goals. It has some descriptive text, a number of activities that
parents and children can do together, and an extensive list of resources for
parents and children. The book has been very successful, and OERI has printed
150,000 copies and distributed them through the Consumer Information Center. The
copies being printed under this agreement will fill orders still being received
by the Consumer Information Center for free copies. The inside front cover will
indicate that these copies were printed and distributed by the National Science
Foundation. When we get ready to do a new edition, we will check with NSF to
assure that the Science in the book is current.
