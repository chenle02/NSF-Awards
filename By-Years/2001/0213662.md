Title: Constructing the Computer Science Pipeline: How high school structures
and norms narrow access to Computer Science for underrepresented minority
students

This ITR- and ITWF-sponsored research project seeks to understand the
institutional, contextual constraints and opportunities that affect
underrepresented minority students' decisions to study (or not study) computer
science at the high school level. The researchers will investigate how the
computer science pipeline gets constructed. "Technological portraits" for three
Los Angeles public high schools will be developed and in-depth interviews will
be conducted with approximately forty district-level technology administrators,
principals, counselors, computer science and math teachers, and technology and
magnet coordinators at these three schools. Each of these three schools has a
high numbers of African-American and Latino/a students.

The researchers will study the perceptions and thinking of those who help to
construct the pipeline-namely, state, district, and local educators. In
particular, they will focus on 1) educators' perceptions of what a computer
science curriculum should be for their students; 2) the courses and curriculum
sequences that these educators shape; 3) the criteria they use to judge which
students should study computer science and which are not capable of success ;
and 4) how these norms and structures that influence the construction of the
pipeline translate into educators' role in shaping students' course-taking
choices. Dissemination of findings is an important part of this proposal and the
investigators will hold on-going discussions with school educators about these
issues. Printed materials will be produced for distribution in the three
schools, and meetings/discussions will be held with the teachers about the
research findings. The findings will be disseminated nationally.
