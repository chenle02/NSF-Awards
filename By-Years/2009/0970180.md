The objective of the research proposal is to derive new strong valid
inequalities for capacitated fixed-charge networks and build computational
methods for their large-scale solution. The proposal suggests an innovative
approach for investigating the polyhedral structure of capacitated fixed-charge
network flow (CFNF). In particular, strong valid inequalities that exploit
detailed network substructures will be developed based on an effective use of
the submodularity of flows and the max flow-min cut theorem. This new approach
unifies previous work done on CFNF through a systematic study, which is more
generally applicable. Moreover, it allows the derivation of much stronger valid
inequalities than known to date, as it uses crucial structural information that
has not been exploited yet.

If successful, the fundamental development and solution methods that will result
from this project will improve the solvability of large-scale instances of a
broad class of logistics, supply chain, telecom applications that contain fixed-
charge network flow substructure. One of the immediate outcomes of the project
is the development of stronger cutting planes for mixed integer programming
software systems that utilize fixed-charge network substructures. These new,
strong inequalities can immediately replace the weak ones currently in use to
improve the performance of these software systems.
