Research on how people produce and understand language has usually focused on
situations with little social context, such as reading paragraphs and answering
questions in highly controlled settings. But humans use language in an immense
variety of social situations with others who differ from each other in factors
like age, race/ethnicity, social class and more. These factors affect how humans
use language. This award supports a special session at the 2024 meeting of the
Society for Human Sentence Processing (SHSP) that brings together psychologists,
linguists, neuroscientists and computer scientists to uncover how the human mind
makes sense of language in socially rich and diverse situations. SHSP is a
premiere scientific organization for the study of the mental processes involved
in language use, and this special session helps to attract a more diverse set of
scholars to the fieldâ€”scholars whose participation is crucial for advancing this
exciting science.

The session is anchored by keynote presentations addressing questions such as:
How does social information influence language understanding, production, and
acquisition? How can language processing researchers engage more directly with
language as it is practiced by and between socially diverse communities? These
and other activities broaden the impact of sentence processing research by
linking cognitive mechanisms, such as predictive processing and memory
retrieval, with new perspectives from more natural and diverse contexts. The
session promotes an expansion of the language varieties and language communities
under investigation, including minoritized varieties that are only beginning to
receive attention in language processing research. These efforts facilitate
interdisciplinary training for junior scientists attending the conference
through travel grants and outreach efforts to minority-serving institutions. The
special session also contributes to broadening diversity in the STEM pipeline;
centering research in diverse communities promotes the research of diverse
scholars, attracts more diverse students, and offers opportunities for
collaborations between scholars of different backgrounds.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
