ABSTRACT This research is toward developing mathematical models for material
behavior at a phenomenological level. The goal is a continuum-mechanical
framework for the study of materials that provides a basis for general theories
and leads to relevant problems. Proposed are studies involving incoherent phase
transitions, dislocations in the presence of atomic diffusion, and grain-
boundary motion.

The growing alliance of nonlinear continuum mechanics and analysis has led to
significant advances in the understanding of materials; important consequences
are new ways of understanding defects and microstructures and the ability to
predict macroscopic properties as well as detailed behavior at the microscopic
level. This project is meant to continue this thrust.
