2007 International Conference in Ouidah

The proposal is to provide support for the participation of US researchers and
a graduate student in an International Conference on variational methods,
operations research and dynamics to be held in Ouidah, Benin in September 2007.
The conference is being organized by the Institute of Mathematical Sciences and
Physics in Porto-Novo, Benin and with the help of the International Center for
Theoretical Physics based in Trieste, Italy.

The conference will feature senior participants from a number of European
countries, from Argentina, Brazil and Canada and students from many African
countries. It is hoped that it will help develop mathematical research expertise
in these countries by providing exposure to a number of currently active
research areas. This award is co-funded by the Office of International Science
and Engineering.
