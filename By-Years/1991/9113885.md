Many common compiler optimizations require precise analysis of the flow of data
within a program. This project will extend the data flow analysis algorithms to
apply them to explicitly parallel imperative languages. The basis for this work
will be the Static Single Assignment (SSA) form of a program, which was
developed for sequential languages. This project will use a nested graph
intermediate representation to describe the sequential and parallel parts of the
program. New constructs will be added to the SSA form to describe the
parallelism and nondeterminism that arises from explicitly parallel programs.
The algorithms for generating the SSA representation of a program will be
modified to handle the parallel constructs. New algorithms will be developed to
find potential anomalies in parallel code. A prototype compiler has been
developed (with prior NSF support) that recognizes the emerging ANSI standard
parallel Fortran syntax. All of the algorithms developed for this project will
be implemented in that system.
