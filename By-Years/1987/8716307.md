An investigation into the mechanism of action of the membrane-bound detoxication
enzyme UDP glucuronosyltransferase is underway. The specific aims of the study
are to i) elucidate the kinetic mechanism of the enzyme using alternative
substrates ii) probe the structure of the transition state of the enzymatic
reaction using specifically designed alternative substrates and linear-free
energy relationships iii) determine the effect of membrane or phospholipid
environment on the transition state of the reaction by observing their effects
on linear-free energy relationships iv) probe the topology of the active site of
the enzyme toward sterically hindered chiral phenols. Alternative glucuronosyl-
donating substrate having similar geometries but with leaving groups (e.g. UDP,
UMPCH2P, UMPCHFP, and UMPCF2P) of different pKa will be synthesized and used to
probe the amount and importance of bond-breaking in the transition-state.
Nucleophilicity of the aglycone will be varied by using the appropriately
substituted phenol to examine the degree of bond-making in the transition state.
The enzyme will be incorporated into different micellar or vesicular
environments to determine the importance of membrane stereoselectivity of the
enzyme and the equilibrium constant for glucuronidation of dihydrodiols is being
determined in the reverse (deconjugation) reaction. Finally, chiral phenols of
known stereochemistry will be used to determine the extent to which the aglycone
binding site can recognize chiral substrate surfaces.
