9803435 Stasheff This research is concerned with application of techniques
Stasheff developed earlier in his study of classifying spaces and rational
homotopy theory and involves his combining of those techniques with developments
introduced ad hoc by physicists. The current project is concerned particularly
with three inter-related classes of problems and aims at elucidating their
intrinsic structure as well as computation of significant applications: (I)
homotopy associative differential graded algebras and Lie and commutative
analogs, particularly as they occur in various physical field theories, (II) the
homological aspects of Lagrangian and more general exterior differential
systems, both classical and quantum, as embodied in the anti-field formalism of
Batalin-Vilkovisky and its generalizations, (III) deformation theory as giving
rise to higher homotopy algebra and as applied to physical systems. Specific
applications are projected to the problems of higher spin particles and of mixed
open-closed string field theory. Cohomological physics refers to that part of
mathematical physics, primarily gauge and other field theories, in which a
variety of cohomological techniques are seeing increasing application. Recently,
further development of these techniques within the physical context has begun to
have an effect on more purely mathematical research, for example, providing new
applications of the existing theory of ``higher dimensional algebra'' for which
1-dimensional diagrams are inadequate. Although defined in greater and more
abstract generality, such structures, as they occur in or are inspired by
mathematical physics, are the focus of this research. The results should aid in
deeper understanding of the mathematical structures essential to the physics
(especially of higher spin particles and of mixed open-closed string field
theory) and of the inter-relation of physical and mathematical concepts. The
results should also be of independent mathematical importance. ***
