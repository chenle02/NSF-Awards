Abstract

Award: DMS-0071625 Principal Investigator: Reyer Sjamaar

The principal investigator plans to study invariants of Hamiltonian Lie group
actions using methods from differential topology, Lie theory and geometric
invariant theory. Expected applications include: extensions and stronger
versions of classical inequalities in matrix analysis, and new results on moduli
spaces of parabolic vector bundles. The tools to be used include methods for
handling the singularities that inevitably arise from Hamiltonian actions
(desingularization, quantization), which were developed in a previous NSF-funded
project.

This project involves graduate student participation and collaboration with
researchers at other US and Canadian institutions. The type of question I seek
to answer is: given the singular values of two matrices (of the same size), what
are the possible singular values of their sum? In this form the question goes
back at least to H. Weyl, who early in the last century found a partial answer
and from this obtained his famous estimates for the eigenvalues of a Laplacian.
The question is not only related to such classical spectral problems, but also
to mechanics (classical and quantum) and to the representation theory of Lie
groups. Two ramifications of the problem which I particularly wish to pursue are
versions for noncompact groups and for the infinite-dimensional groups known as
Kac-Moody groups.
