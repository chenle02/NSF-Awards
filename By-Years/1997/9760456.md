*** 9760456 Wixom This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
develop advanced materials for lithium ion battery electrodes. These materials
will be processed to increase the reversible lithium storage capacity and
decrease the irreversible capacity through control of their microstructure. The
first task will be to systematically vary the process conditions applied to at
least two materials typically used in commercial batteries. The electrode
microstructures will be evaluated by diffraction and porosimetry, and changes in
the microstructure will be related to process conditions. Electrodes will be
fabricated and assembled into test cells using metallic lithium as the reference
and counter electrode. The cells will be cycled to measure capacity and
polarization. A process design will be developed to demonstrate economic as well
as technical feasibility. Phase II will transition from highly controlled
laboratory-scale processes to larger industrial processes presently used in
ceramic powder processing This project will improve the volumetric capacity and
operating times of rechargeable lithium ion batteries. The market for these
batteries is expected to grow to over $250 million by 2000. Operating time is
perhaps the single most important selection criterion for applications such as
camcorders, laptop computers, and cellular communication. ***
