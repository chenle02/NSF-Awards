This project investigates "order structures," that is, data structures for
maintaining total orders on dynamic data sets. Order structures are applicable
in surprisingly diverse settings. The PIs aim to answer fundamental theoretical
questions relating to order structures. The investigation takes place in the
context of two high-impact application areas: (1) tools for debugging parallel
programs and (2) data structures used in databases and file systems to organize
data on disk or SSDs. As part of the project, the PIs will develop publicly
available educational materials and reference implementations on order
structures to be incorporated into courses at their institutions and shared
openly on the web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The order structures addressed in this
project are order-maintenance data structures, sparse tables, and data
structures for incremental topological ordering. The investigation comprises (1)
new algorithms with good worst-case guarantees, (2) algorithms with strong
common-case guarantees, i.e., optimized for common input distributions, (3)
provably good concurrent algorithms, (4) algorithms that leverage randomization
in surprising ways (e.g., to achieve history independence), and (5) robust lower
bounds that also apply to the randomized setting. In the context of the target
applications, the PIs will design and use order structures to implement race
detectors, which uncover determinacy races in parallel programs. The PIs will
also use orders structures to build external-memory key-value stores to make
databases and file systems run faster.
