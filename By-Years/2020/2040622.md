Computational and quantitative approaches are a longstanding aspect of
neuroscience; however, recent advances in the ability to scale up data
collection, simulation, and analysis are leading to an even more central role
for computational thinking in this field. The goal of this meeting is to foster
interaction and collaboration among experimental and computational
neuroscientists. The meeting will highlight both the intellectual advances and
broader impacts of CRCNS awardees. A workshop will focus on machine learning for
large-scale neuroscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigators and
Co-Principal Investigators of grants supported through the NSF-NIH-ANR-BMBF-BSF-
NICT-AEI-ISCIII Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS)
program meet annually to report on projects; to discuss scientific, educational,
and program-related issues; and to develop a cohesive investigator community
representing many different approaches to computational neuroscience. This 16th
meeting of CRCNS investigators brings together a broad spectrum of computational
neuroscience researchers supported by the program, and includes plenary
lectures, oral and poster presentations, and panel discussions. The meeting and
workshop are scheduled for July 8-10, 2021 and will be hosted by New York
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
