9403592 Skelton This project develops analytical methods for predicting the
dynamic response of civil engineering structures, and new structure design
concepts to improve the dynamic response. The upper bounds on the dynamic
response for structures with some modeling uncertainties, and with some
uncertainties in the static and transient loads will be established. Safe
performance for a variety of design goals, including the ability to withstand
worst case wind loads and earthquake excitations, in the presence of a specified
set of component failures will be ensured. Finally, structure design with
control design as opposed to existing procedures which add control after a
structure is designed, will be integrated. This research will lead to a
systematic theory of design for civil engineering structures, complete with a
CAD workstation environment integrating identification, model reduction, control
design, and structure design. The improvements in structural design could be
significant when the two disciplines (structures and controls) are integrated
into a single design process ***
