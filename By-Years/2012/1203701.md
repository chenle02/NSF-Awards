This project will develop speleothem paleoclimate records from caves in the
Sierra Nevada in California. The researcher, a new Assistant Professor at
Vanderbilt University, will produce uranium-series dated records of stable
isotopes (oxygen and carbon) and metal/calcium ratios that are sensitive to a
variety of climate processes, but particularly precipitation. In addition, the
investigator will collaborate with colleagues on evaluating the records using
existing NCAR paleoclimate simulations and make an attempt to determine the
pathways of the moisture transport to the study area. The study will focus on
the time interval beginning in marine isotope stage 3 up to about 8,000 years
ago in the Holocene. Thus the records will include the abrupt changes during the
deglacial interval 21,000 to 10,000 years ago, the interval that experienced
changes in climate associated with ice sheet retreat and changes in the Atlantic
meridional overturning circulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project also
includes active participation in an educational program for disadvantaged high
school students in the Nashville area. The PI will develop interactive classroom
materials and host summer research opportunities for students. The PI is a
recent Ph. D. embarking on her research career in her first academic position.
