ABSTRACT DMS - 0204190.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator is
interested in concrete problems &lt;br/&gt;in classical differential geometry
and topology of curves and &lt;br/&gt;surfaces in Euclidean space, specially
those which involve some notion of convexity. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed
investigations include: (i) Certain nodal domains (shadows) cast on &lt;br/&gt;a
surface by vectorfields which correspond to natural transformations, and
developing &lt;br/&gt;the applications of these for surfaces of constant mean
curvature, and surfaces whose &lt;br/&gt;gauss map satisfies a two-piece-
property; (ii) Closed curves without parallel tangent lines&lt;br/&gt;(skew
loops) and their relation to quadric surfaces; (iii) Global properties
of&lt;br/&gt;locally convex surfaces with boundary, including connections with
Monge-Ampere&lt;br/&gt;equations, and a convex hull property which is dual to
that of minimal surfaces;&lt;br/&gt;(iv) Existence and regularity of certain
deformations of space curves (unfoldings)&lt;br/&gt;to study extremals of knot
energies and distortion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of curves and
surfaces has been the primary motivation&lt;br/&gt; for the development of much
of differential geometry and geometric topology, which in &lt;br/&gt;turn has
found significant applications in physical sciences. Notions of convexity have
&lt;br/&gt;often proved fruitful for solving problems in this area, specially
those which involve &lt;br/&gt;optimizing various quantities. Those aspects of
the principal investigator's work dealing &lt;br/&gt;with shadows on illuminated
surfaces is motivated in part by a study of soap films and&lt;br/&gt;may lead to
applications for computer vision. Further, the investigations on
knot&lt;br/&gt;energies may be of interest in studying the DNA. The primary
motivation of the&lt;br/&gt;investigator, however, is based on aesthetic
considerations and the intuitive&lt;br/&gt;visual appeal of low dimensional
geometric problems.&lt;br/&gt;
