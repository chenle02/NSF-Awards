This project provides annual scholarships of $10,000 to academically talented,
financially needy students pursuing a Master's of Science degree in a newly
created concentration in Biomedical Statistical Informatics, or to
underrepresented students in financial distress who are seeking general
admission to the bioinformatics and medical informatics (BMI) graduate program.
The scholarships are renewable for a second year.

Intellectual merit of the project lies in the enhanced experience for graduate
students in the first years of their studies, allowing more time and more
support to master the crucial skills which are essential for research in the
informatics field. The project also initiates a statistics track; an area that
has been in demand because of recent developments.

The broader impact of this project is that it reduces attrition and provides
more opportunities for underrepresented and financially disadvantaged students.
San Diego State University (SDSU) ranks eighth in the nation and fourth in
California for bachelor's degrees awarded to Hispanics. The BMI program has no
Hispanic students. A portion of the funds from this project is used as
scholarships specifically for Hispanic students in order to increase the
Hispanic student population within the major.
