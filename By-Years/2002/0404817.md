DMS-0404817&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P.I.: Jiaping Wang, University of Minnesota-
Twin Cities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Harmonic forms and topology of complete
manifolds&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed
project is about relating the analysis and topology on &lt;br/&gt;complete
noncomapct manifolds. In particular, it is proposed to search&lt;br/&gt;for an
extension of the de Rham-Hodge theory, and to relate the spectrum
of&lt;br/&gt;the Hodge Laplacian to the topology of
manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this project is to
describe some large scale&lt;br/&gt;structures&lt;br/&gt;of objects which are
high dimensional analogue of the unbounded surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;The approach is
to inspect the physical steady states of a
naturally&lt;br/&gt;defined&lt;br/&gt;energy on such objects. The results and
techniques are expected to be&lt;br/&gt;useful&lt;br/&gt;in describing more
complicated systems arising from physics, biology
and&lt;br/&gt;other&lt;br/&gt;branches of science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
