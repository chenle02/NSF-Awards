The investigator proposes to continue his research in the serial and parallel
solution of large-scale mathematical programs by successive overrelaxation, the
theoretical determination of computationally useful error bounds for constrained
optimization problems, the study of the theoretical properties and computational
applications of penalty functions and the investigation of some fundamentally
difficult (NP- complete) problems of mathematical programming.
