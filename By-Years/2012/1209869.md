This action funds Anastasiya N. Protasov (Romanovskaya) of Texas A&M University
to conduct a research project, entitled "Reducing computational costs of a model
in porous media using a hierarchical approach," during the summer of 2012 at
Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The host scientist is Dr. Viet Ha
Hoang, assistant professor in the Division of Mathematical Sciences.

The Intellectual Merits of the research project lies in its special approach to
solve only particular problems instead of solving the entire high-dimensional
system. The research includes the development of robust and inexpensive
hierarchical local-global reduced-order models and application of these
techniques to single-phase compressible flows that arise in real world problems.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
