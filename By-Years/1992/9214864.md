The application of advance polarimetric radar techniques to the remote sensing
of precipitation is our principal research focus. A project named CLEOPATRA
(Cloud Experiment Oberpfaffenhofen and Transports), to be conducted by DLR and
other universities and research organizations in Germany this summer, will make
available substantial in situ and other remote sensing radar data which will
validate and enhance the microphysical interpretation of the new polarimetric
signatures such as propagation differential phase, copolar correlation
coefficient and backscatter differential phase that can be measured with the
C-Band DLR radar. In addition, the project will have available one FALCON jet
operated by DLR, and two vertically pointing Doppler radars which will be
important for the studies proposed herein. The FALCON aircraft will have a chaff
release capability for the study of entrainment by tracking chaff using the
radar depolarization signature. Coordinated radar/aircraft datasets in a variety
of summer-time convective precipitation of the newer polarimetric signatures
(>DP, >HV, .) will be studied and compared with aircraft 2D-PMS images and the
vertically pointing Doppler data where applicable. Polarization transformation
techniques based on covariance will be "instantaneous" scattering matrix methods
which are already in progress will be checked by collecting further time series
data during CLEOPATRA. We will couple our already developed Mueller matrix model
to the DLR numerical cloud model (MESOSCOP) to study the variation in
polarimetric signatures with modelled storm kinematics and microphysics
products.
