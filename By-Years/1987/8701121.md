This project aims at solving the outstanding problem of the dimension and basis
for the multivariate spline spaces and applying the results to the most
effective surface interpolation and computer representation of three dimensional
objects via computer graphics. The structure of multivariate spline spaces is
vastly more complex than in the univariate case and fundamental questions are
still unanswered. Among these questions are the dimension, the construction of
bases, existence of a local basis, and application to interpolation problems.
The main tool of this research will be the symbolic manipulation language
"Reduce", which will enable the investigator to solve exactly the large linear
systems that arise from the smoothness conditions linking polynomials on
neighboring triangles. The investigator will blend the Bezier-Bernstein
techniques with the symbolic manipulation and will attempt to apply his results
to surface representation problems arising in engineering.
