Van Orman&lt;br/&gt;0337125 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diffusion plays a critical
role in many important mantle processes, including chemical exchange, solid-
state creep, seismic attenuation and electrical conduction. This study will
provide experimental data on cation and oxygen diffusion rates in the two most
abundant lower mantle minerals, perovskite (MgSiO3) and periclase (MgO). High-
pressure, high-temperature experiments on both minerals will be performed under
well-defined thermochemical conditions, with point defect concentrations
controlled by the addition of aliovalent cations. In periclase, diffusion
coefficients for oxygen and a broad range of monovalent, divalent and trivalent
cations will be determined at pressures between 1 atm and 25 GPa and
temperatures of 1200-2300 K. An important goal of these experiments is to
determine quantitative relationships between diffusivity and ionic parameters
such as radius, charge and polarizability. Experiments on perovskite will focus
on Mg and O self-diffusion at 25 GPa and 1700-2300 K. The study is designed to
gain a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms for ionic transport in
perovskite and periclase, and the influence of temperature, pressure and
composition on diffusivity. The work proposed will provide data that crosses
disciplinary boundaries between geochemistry and geophysics. The project will
also help support the research infrastructure at Case Western Reserve University
and allow the integration of research and education of graduate and
undergraduate students in this institution.&lt;br/&gt;
