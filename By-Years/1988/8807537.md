The recent successes of theoretical chemistry with improved programs and faster
computers have generated the need for still faster machines. Experienced users
wish to solve larger and larger problems of more and more relevance to the
experimental chemist. Similarly, experimental chemists, seeing these results,
are compelled to become new users. The acquisition of state-of-the-art computing
equipment is essential to the modern chemistry department carrying out frontier
research. The Department of Chemistry of the University of Washington will use
this award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program to help upgrade an
extant Convex minisupercomputer. Among the areas of chemical research that will
be enhanced by the upgrade are the following: 1) Ab-initio electronic structure
calculations of organic and organometallic compounds and reactions 2) The
tuneable wavepacket propagator 3) Generalized wavepacket dynamics 4) Atom-
imperfect surface collisions 5) Spectroscopy/dynamics of small polyatomic
molecules 6) Quantum simulation of van der Waals clusters 7)
Classical/semiclassical simulation of liquids 8) Quantum scattering theory
