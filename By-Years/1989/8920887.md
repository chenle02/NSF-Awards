The HF radar at Goose Bay Labrador, was originally built and used to study
processes relating to electron density irregularities in the E and F region high
latitude ionospheres, and to study the high latitude convection. It has recently
become apparent that the radar can also be used to study problems relating to HF
transmission which arrive reflected obliquely from the ground at large
distances. These include traveling ionospheric disturbances (TID's) which are
excited by propagation gravity waves. This proposal plans to study the
excitation and propagation of these high latitude gravity waves in order to
understand one form of energy coupling between the solar wind/magnetosphere and
thermosphere. They also propose to develop and achieve a data base of observed
gravity wave events.
