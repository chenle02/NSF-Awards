This award provides partial financial support for students and postdocs to
attend the conference entitled "Challenges in Theoretical Cosmology" to be held
at the Tufts European Center in Talloires, France from September 2nd to
September 5th, 2009. The conference marks the celebration of the Tufts Institute
of Cosmology's 20th anniversary and will bring together some of the world
leaders in cosmology as well as students and postdocs to discuss some of the
most important open questions in cosmology today. The conference will be
particularly focused on the following topics:&lt;br/&gt;- Cosmic strings and
other topological defects.&lt;br/&gt;- Eternal Inflation.&lt;br/&gt;- The
Landscape of string theory vacua.&lt;br/&gt;There will be around 90 participants
in total, with around 25 invited speakers. There will be a mixed group of
faculty, postdocs and students. The students will have the opportunity of
presenting their work, either in contributing talks or poster presentations. The
funds will be used to help support those students or postdocs who would not have
any other financial help from their home institutions and who would not
otherwise be able to attend to the conference.
