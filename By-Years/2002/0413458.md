Global climate change is already altering biological communities: plants are
flowering and leafing out earlier in the spring, birds are migrating and
breeding earlier, and species are shifting their ranges. Predicting how
biological communities will respond to future climate change and developing
methods to lessen the harmful impacts of these changes will require knowledge
about the responses of individual species. The Principal Investigator proposes
to use historical and current observations to examine the effects of climate
change on more than 700 plant species in Concord, Massachusetts. The
investigator will compare his current (2004 to 2006) observations of the
flowering times of plants in Concord with past observations of flowering times
made by three local naturalists from 1851 to 1993. One of these naturalists is
Henry David Thoreau, the well-known philosopher and author. From these
comparisons, the investigator will determine which species are most and least
responsive to climate change and which climatic variables are most closely
linked to variation in flowering time. The investigator will also document the
plant species currently present in Concord and their abundances, and compare
this information to the five previous records documenting the Concord plant
community to determine how the flora has changed over time. This
interdisciplinary study, involving both current observations and historical
records, will produce many unique publications from the shared viewpoint of
science and history. The project, bolstered by including Thoreau's observations,
is expected to generate extensive public interest, which will be supported
through publications in the popular press, public talks, and the incorporation
of volunteers and undergraduates in gathering and analyzing the data.
