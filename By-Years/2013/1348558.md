With the advent of the world wide web and the resulting technologies such as
social media, smart phones and sensor networks, the amount of data being
collected has increased tremendously in recent years. Managing, storing,
processing, analyzing and disseminating such massive amounts of data gives raise
to many security and privacy challenges. To address these security and privacy
challenges of managing and analyzing big data, an NSF Workshop on Big Data
Security and Privacy has been proposed. Specifically, the workshop explores
research topics including: policy management for big data; security and privacy
for big data management and analytics; secure infrastructures and secure storage
for big data; securing and analyzing massive networks; and big data analytics
for security problems. The workshop participants are expected to be from
academia, industry and government labs, consisting of interdisciplinary
researchers in the fields of higher performance computing, systems, data
management and analytics, cyber security, network science and policy and social
sciences. They will come together and determine the strategic direction for big
data security and privacy. Since research in big data security and privacy is of
growing importance, this workshop is expected to have very high broader impacts.
