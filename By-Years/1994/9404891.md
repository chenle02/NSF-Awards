9404891 Van Schmus This award provides one-half the funding necessary to upgrade
the counting system of a mass spectrometer purchased in 1986. The thermal
ionization mass spectrometer will acquire new Faraday cups and a new ion
counting system. The upgraded equipment will continue to be operated for
research and teaching purposes in geochemistry in the Department of Geology at
the University of Kansas. The University is committed to providing the remaining
funds needed to pay for the upgrade. Research applications include measurements
of uranium- lead, samarium-neodymium, and rubidium-strontium isotopic
systematics for dating and determining the origin of igneous rocks associated
with regional tectonic processes and crustal evolution. ***
