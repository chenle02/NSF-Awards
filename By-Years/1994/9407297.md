whole-community level. It is important to understand the role of keystone
species in trophic and other interactions between tropical organisms. This
project addresses the role of fig trees as keystone species in New Guinean wet
forests. The goals are to 1) describe the insect herbivore faunas associated
with ten local fig species and evaluate the food web connnections between these
herbivores and other members of the forest community, 2) contrast the
characteristics and community structure of associated herbivorous insects of
keystone and non-keystone fig species, and 3) develop predictive abilities about
the host-specificity and species richness of fig herbivores from easily measured
host variables. This research will improve our understanding of the function of
tropical forest ecosystems. The results will have application in conservation
biology, especially in the design and management of tropical forest reserves.
