Cockburn The investigator studies, both theoretically and computationally,
massively parallel, efficient methods for numerically solving problems in which
convection plays a major role. Of particular interest are the drift-diffusion
and hydrodynamic models for semiconductor devices, and the compressible Navier-
Stokes equations (with high Reynolds numbers) for viscous flow. The investigator
obtains new a posteriori error estimates for nonlinear scalar conservation laws,
independent of the numerical scheme under consideration, upon which adaptivity
strategies could be devised. He also studies a priori error estimates that allow
a deeper understanding of the numerical methods under consideration. The
objective of this research project is to develop, both theoretically and
computationally, ways to enhance the speed and the accuracy of massively
parallel methods for simulating several problems in which convection plays a
central role. Applications to the high-performance computing of simulations of
semiconductors and high-speed fluid flow are direct applications of the results
of this project. A deep mathematical understanding of the algorithms for this
type of problem is essential for efficiently obtaining accurate results, but is
unfortunately lacking. The investigator studies theories that provide such an
understanding to obtain the desired practical high-performance computing
algorithms.
