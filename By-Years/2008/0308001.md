The goal of this project is to systematically study and develop a semantic
summarization approach for data warehousing and online analytical processing.
The research consists of (1) development of semantic&lt;br/&gt;summarization
methods in data cubes; and (2) efficient implementation and utilizations of
semantic summarization cubes, including data storage, index and query answering.
Broader impacts: The results of this project will provide novel methods for
effective and efficient data exploration that supports decision making. They
will also bring benefits to some other related researches on advanced data
analysis, including data mining, data visualization and interactive data
exploration. The techniques developed in this project will be illustrated in a
research prototype, which will be used in the related courses and also made
available on the internet. A course on data warehousing and data mining will be 
developed.&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/jianpei/semolap&lt;br/&g
