The quantum mechanical tunneling of the total magnetization of small magnetic
particles of size 100A will be studied theoretically. The proposed work focuses
on dissipative couplings such as that between different grains in a geometry
involving many particles, to spin waves in a single particle, and to conduction
electrons in metallic particles. The calculations will be extended to finite
temperature, and realistic crystal anisotropy energies beyond the leading order
forms dictated by symmetry. A combination of path integral and perturbative
methods will be used, involving both numerical and analytical methods.
