The proposal attempts a microscopic description of collective modes in nuclei,
utilizing the method of successive boson expansions. When the procedure proposed
for removing the spurious states so generated works, the method will be applied
to a variety of realistic problems. Several outstanding problems that arise in
the context of the Interacting Boson Fermion Model of odd-mass nuclei will also
be investigated, as will several other problems of contemporary importance in
nuclear structure physics.
