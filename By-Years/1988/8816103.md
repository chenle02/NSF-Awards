Experimental studies will be run on the physical properties of silicate melts,
and on vapor plus melt magmatic emulsions and foams, as a function of shear rate
and temperature at atmospheric pressure. Other than the studies of Spera et al.
(1988) there have been no laboratory studies of magmatic emulsions and/or foams,
despite their ubiquity in nature. The information gained by this work will
significantly enhance our understanding of the movement of volcanic magmas.
