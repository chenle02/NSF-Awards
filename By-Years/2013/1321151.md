Mobility models are an indispensable tool in the design, testing, and evaluation
of wireless networks and their protocols. It is now widely recognized that
mobility models should account for both geographical features of the region
being studied as well as the social relations and interactions among users. This
project aims to develop a unified yet flexible mobility modeling framework that
combines both social and geography factors that influence how users move, and to
develop formal statistical learning methods to calibrate mobility models using
real mobility data. Additionally, an important deliverable of the project is to
develop software tools that implement our models and can be used by researchers
and practitioners to evaluate mobile systems and protocols.

This project is expected to have significant impact on the way network
researchers and practitioners design, test, and evaluate mobile networks and
their protocols. The project also has an important educational component:
students working on this research are expected to develop a crosscutting
research and academic and background. Research results from this project will be
disseminated through project Web site, and technical papers published in
conferences and journals. The mobility generation software tool will also be
freely available through the project's Web site.
