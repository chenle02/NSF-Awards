SPECIFIC AIMS The overall goal of this project is to understand the role of
membrane lipids in the organization and functioning of plant cells and
organelles. This project has the following specific aims: 1. To carry out the
lipid analyses and labelling studies required to characterize arabidopsis
mutants already selected. 2. To investigate the photosynthetic characteristics
of those mutants in which the fatty acid compositions of chloroplast lipids are
affected. 3. To construct double mutants with more extensive changes in
chloroplast fatty acid composition and to study photosynthesis in these also. 4.
To screen independent M2 populations for further mutants and alleles of existing
mutants. Results so far obtained indicate that these mutants can provide
considerable information on the enzymology of desaturation and on the control of
cellular lipid metabolism. More importantly the mutants provide a means of
directly addressing the question of how the fatty acid composition of thylakoid
membranes affects chloroplast structure and function.%%% Increased knowledge in
these areas is an essential prerequisite to intelligently manipulating membrane
lipid composition by recombinant DNA techniques. For example, because of the
possible importance of membrane lipid composition in the temperature responses
to plants, a detailed understanding of fatty acid desaturation and the genes
which control this process may make it possible to genetically modify
economically important crop species to better suit particular environmental
conditions.***
