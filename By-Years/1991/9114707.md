Using newly digitized rapid-run ionosondes, together with WORM drive digital
recorders, it is proposed to build a new data base of observations at an
existing close-spaced triangulation network at L 4.5 in western Quebec. From
this data base, continuous TID parameters are to be deduced, including the
vertical phase propagation constants of the causative gravity waves. Combining
the vertical and horizontal components, the 3-dimensional orientations of the
gravity-wave wave-fronts can be obtained and the source locations inferred. In
the second year, it is proposed to extend the data base by simultaneously
operating a second, existing, close-spaced triangulation network at L 3.3, 1000
km south of the northern network. Analysis of these simultaneous data sets is
expected to cast additional light on the source of the causative gravity waves
and on their propagation.
