This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports research on heterocyclyne complexes by Drs. Claire A. Tessier and Wiley
J. Youngs of the Chemistry Department, University of Akron. New complexes will
be prepared by incorporating heteroatoms such as Si, Ge, B, Al, Ga, In, P, As
and Pt into the cyclic structure of the complexes, and by associating transition
metals with available C-C multiple bonds in the ring. Special emphasis will be
placed on preparing rings containing two heteroatoms, on synthesis of dipocket
heterocyclynes that contain both a Lewis acid and a Lewis base, and on using
larger diynes to create larger pockets. The non-linear optical, conducting, and
liquid crystal characteristics of some platinum chain complexes will be
determined. Attempts will also be made to build complex tube-like polymer
structures that may have interesting electronic features. Multinuclear NMR is an
important analytical tool in this work. Heterocyclynes are cyclic polyalkynes
that, in addition to carbon, contain a different element, or heteroatom. The
system investigated here contains three alkynes linked together with three
spacers--one of which is the heteroatom--to form a planar 11-membered ring. The
cavity of this ring, or pocket, varies in size as the heteroatom changes. More
elaborate structures can be formed by linking heterocyclynes together, so that
they contain up to four pockets. The compounds can be made in a controlled way
and built up to larger structures that have conducting and liquid crystalline
properties.
