0104334&lt;br/&gt;Matson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Mexico Program award
will provide support for dissertation research by Mr. John Harrison, under the
direction of Dr. Pamela Matson of Stanford University. Mr. Harrrison will work
in Mexico with Dr. Ivan Ortiz-Monasterio on the Wheat Program at the
International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center (CYMMYT) in Obregon, Mexico.
The investigators will study the emissions of nitrous oxide from waters draining
the Yaqui Basin in Mexico. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nitrous oxide is a greenhouse
gas that is increasing globally and the fertilization of agricultural fields is
thought to be the single most important source of the observed increase. The
Yaqui Valley provides a unique opportunity to look at the interactions of
several kinds of anthropogenic change that are important drivers of
biogeochemical change. Results from this study should improve our basic
understanding of nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural drainage and the
factors that control them.&lt;br/&gt;
