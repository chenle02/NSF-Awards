Bronx Community College (BCC), working with industrial, governmental, and
academic partners, will develop an Associates of Applied Science degree in
Chemical and BioEnergy Technology for Sustainability. This degree program will
combine the disciplines of biology, chemistry, and engineering, and educate
community college students for careers in the emerging bio-economy and at the
interface of green chemistry and fermentation science. The project will leverage
ongoing projects at BCC, such as the Center for Sustainable Energy, the
Renewable Fuel and Sustainable Product Laboratory and the College Now program.
College Now will allow high school students to earn college credits towards
careers in this emerging field. Due to BCC's urban location in the City of New
York, many of the students who have access to this project will come from
traditionally underserved backgrounds.

The goals of this project are to prepare students for careers in emerging STEM
fields that address the need for cleaner, renewable energy and chemicals using a
biomass feedstock platform. The new degree program will educate community
college students in fields associated with biomanufacturing, renewable
transportation fuels, and green chemical feedstocks. This program will leverage
the principal investigator's current work in Bionic Liquids (NSF I-Corp Award
#1443859) and prior ATE awards made to BCC in pharmtech and chemtech (Award
#0202386 and #0936994). BCC is a minority-serving institution in the City of New
York that educates approximately 11,500 students annually. It is part of the 24
college City University of New York system and has significant interactions with
high schools in its service area. This will allow the project to impact a
sizable number of students underrepresented in the STEM fields and contribute to
the economic development of the region. The program will be a model for crossing
disciplinary boundaries to prepare students for STEM careers and developing
students' important middle employment skills. Project evaluation will focus on
the progress of the developing the program and measuring student performance
indicators such enrollment, success, and retention.
