The author of this SGER proposal aims to synthesize and characterize novel
molecular ferromagnets. Binickelocenium triiodide is the target molecule for
this synthesis project. It is an attractive candidate for molecular
ferromagnetism since the complex is mixed-valent, and the electronic structure
of this ferromagnet matches theoretically predicted electronic structure
configurations. Also, the solid state structure is predicted to be a stacked-
array with nearest neighbor contacts closer than other known molecular
ferromagnets. The project will include studies of the conductivity and magnetism
of binickelocenium as a function of concentration of dopants to include iodine
and arsenic pentafluoride.
