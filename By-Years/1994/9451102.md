9451102 West Acquisition of the electrochemical station will allow an expansion
and upgrading of the chemistry instructional program. This proposal requests
modern electrochemistry equipment for use in the following undergraduate
laboratories: Quantitative Analysis, Instrumental Techniques, Thermodynamics,
Kinetics, and Independent Study. The instrument will be used to determine
vitamin C, lead, and/or cadmium in student-provided samples in quantitative
analysis. We view this instrument as a tool to stimulate, excite and draw bright
students into careers in science. In Instrumental Techniques, the
electrochemistry equipment will be used to demonstrate how cyclic voltammetry
can be used both quantitatively to determine an unknown concentration of
acetaminophen in a Tylenol tablet, and qualitatively to obtain mechanistic
information on the oxidation of the drug. In the Thermodynamics Lab, it will be
used to determine thermodynamic properties and their relationship to structural
change, pH, solvent composition, and temperature. In the Kinetics Lab, it will
be used to study the kinetics of many different reactions, for example the
oxidation of benzoin. As time is available outside of the formal courses, the
instrument will be used by students doing various independent research projects.
