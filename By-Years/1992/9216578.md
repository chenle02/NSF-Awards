This research project will examine and model the way in which normal human
subjects visually track continuously moving targets. The way in which the smooth
pursuit and saccadic eye movement systems interact with each other to maintain
fixation on the target and reacquire it when imperfect tracking causes the image
to move off the fovea will be studied. In addition, the way in which subjects
develop an internal representation of repetitive target motion, which they then
use to predict the target's trajectory, will be investigated. The model
developed by this research will be useful in explaining the control of
biological systems and also in developing a biologically- based active vision
system.
