This project focuses on the synthesis of new perovskite related oxides by solid
state reactions for powder synthesis and the use of high temperature solution
reactions for crystal growth to yield new classes of oxide materials with
important chemical and physical properties. These chemical compounds can be
selectively modified to exhibit desirable physical and chemical properties.
Improved methods for designing and synthesizing these materials in desired
physical forms such as powders or as single crystals allow one to investigate
their electronic and magnetic properties, and to explore their utilization in a
variety of applications. To accomplish these tasks, undergraduates, graduate
students and postdoctoral researchers are being trained in cutting edge
techniques for synthesizing and characterizing these materials using state of
the art instrumentation such as high-temperature and high-pressure reaction
vessels, magnetometers and charge coupled device based single crystal
diffractometers. The strong educational aspect of this research assures that
highly trained men, women and underrepresented minorities can enter the
workforce to meet industrial needs for
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perovskite oxides are known for important and
interesting magnetic and electronic properties that include superconductivity,
ferroelectricity, and ionic conductivity, and also for compositional flexibility
enabling the development of new electronic devices, data storage materials,
battery components and superconductors. Undergraduates, graduate students and
postdoctoral researchers trained in these cutting edge synthetic and
characterization techniques will be very competitive for industrial and academic
jobs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
