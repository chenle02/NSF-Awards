Self-organization occurs in many complex living and non-living systems. It is a
great challenge to understand the basic principles of self-organization in these
systems and to distinguish phenomena in living systems that is shared with non-
living systems from phenomena that is generic only to living systems. The PIs in
this project will compare self-organization in granular and soft matter systems
to self-organization in a yeast cell population. Both systems seem to share
common principles of self-organization and the PIs will uncover the basic
principles of self-organization of yeast by comparing to the detailed knowledge
that exists of self-organization in granular materials. The PIs will engage
students to participate in computer simulations and train them in dynamical
systems theory and its diverse applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular
the PIs will study population dynamics combining experiments, computations and
theory. On the experimental side, the program is focused on three important
aspects: First, the PIs will measure the response of populations to genome
rewiring. Genome-rewiring is a perturbation exposing the complex cellular
dynamics beyond the specific fast relaxing responses observed under more
standard perturbations. Second, the PIs will measure the dynamics under
controlled conditions, at high temporal resolution over many cell generations
covering the wide dynamic range characterizing gene interactions and other
intracellular processes as well as population processes such as adaptation.
Third, the PIs will study the dynamic coupling between the population and the
environment. Their computational efforts will concentrate on constructing a
unique framework for population dynamics based on cellular random organization,
connecting the intracellular complex dynamics with population processes.
