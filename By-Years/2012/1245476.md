The project supports a series of experimental research studies designed to test
improvements in the calibration, reliability, validity, and efficiency of a
proto-type tool (Quickscore, a scoring algorithm) that facilitates the
examination of structured retrieval practice in learning fundamental concepts in
biology. The research systematically examines and tests specific characteristics
of structured retrieval practice that have the potential to enhance conceptual
learning under different conditions. Building and expanding on previous
findings, the project's working hypothesis states that guiding students to
practice active reconstruction of their knowledge enhances long-term meaningful
learning of complex science materials. While being developed for introductory
biology courses, the Structured Retrieval Practice program (software package) is
designed to be utilized in all STEM disciplines to enhance learning of
fundamental concepts in a discipline. The research contibutes to a growing body
of knowledge on the role of retrieval in concept learning. The series of
research studies starts under laboratory conditions and concludes with a field-
based research study in large introductory courses. An aim of the project is to
translate findings from basic researach studies on learning into providing
students with a research-based tool that enhances their conceptual learning.
