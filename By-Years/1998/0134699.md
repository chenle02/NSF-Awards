In this CAREER award funded by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
Program in the Chemistry Division and the Division of Chemical and Transport
Systems, Lev Gelb will develop novel methods for simulating the preparation of
sol-gel materials and other real-world substances. A multi-scale approach
integrating molecular and meso-scale descriptions will be used. The initial
focus will be on atomically realistic models of silica based porous materials
generated by sol-gel synthesis. Examples of such materials are controlled-pore
glasses, silica xerogels and silica aerogels. Later work will be extended to the
group of mixed oxides, non-siliceous materials, nanoscale thin films, and
templated gels. Sophisticated characterization methods will be used to compare
model and experimental materials, and these methods will be applied to new areas
such as thin films and templating. In the teaching component of this work Gelb
will bring molecular modeling ideas into the chemistry curriculum, both through
a course in molecular modeling and through efforts to incorporate these methods
and ideas into existing freshman chemistry and physical chemistry courses.
Specifically, he will develop a new "hands-on" course in computational chemistry
as well as sophisticated visualization tools for in-class demonstrations, and he
will invite undergraduate students to participate in his research
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of computer models and
algorithms for simulating nanoscale material structure is an important research
area. Such models have considerable value in understanding nanoscale phenomena
occurring in adsorption and catalysis, as well as in the context of materials
characterization. The characterization of the computer-generated materials
allows comparison of calculations with data from real materials and results in a
refinement of the simulation techniques. The application of these advanced
simulation methods to the rational design of sol-gel materials has implications
in chromatography, sensing, catalysis and separations. The educational component
of the project can be expected to impact chemistry students by improving their
knowledge of computational methods and exposing them to visualization
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;
