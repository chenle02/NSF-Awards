The objectives of this project are improvement of CCD fabrication technology to
make high quality, large CCDs more widely available to the University of
California Observatories (UCO) and to the general astronomical community;
improvement of UCO's capabilities to develop and use large CCDs and mosaics of
large CCDs, and; training in instrumentation and detector technology for
students at both the graduate student and post-doctoral level. CCD imaging
sensors would be fabricated by Loral/Fairchild and detailed testing and
characterization would be carried out in the new Lick Observatory Detector
Development Laboratory. The principal investigators would develop procedures for
enhancing the detector efficiency and would investigate methods for applying
anti-reflection coatings to CCDs. Some of the CCDs fabricated under this
proposal would be made available through the National Science Foundation to the
general astronomical community.
