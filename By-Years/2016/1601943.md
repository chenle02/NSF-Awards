This project lies at the heart of modern number theory, which has a deep
historical background as well as modern theoretical implications. The focus of
this award is to prove formulae for L-functions. In number theory, L-functions
are generalizations of the Riemann zeta-function. The relevant formulae are
usually bridges relating analysis to algebra, two different areas of
mathematics. The most elementary example of such a formula is Euler's formula
about the value of the Riemann zeta-function at 2. In plain terminology, it
asserts that the summation of the reciprocals of the squares of all positive
integers, is exactly equal to the square of (pi/2). Here pi=3.14159... is the
usual ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. Besides their
significant impact in mathematics, such formulae are also perfect topics that
can be used to popularize mathematics to the world.

The PI proposes to prove two formulae about L-functions in number theory. The
first one is the Colmez conjecture for CM abelian varieties, and the second one
is a formula for the modular heights of quaternionic Shimura curves. The methods
proposed by the PI are significant extensions of his previous joint works on the
Gross-Zagier formula and the averaged Colmez conjecture. They involve the
theories of automorphic forms, Shimura varieties and Arakelov geometry, and the
study of the formulae will enable us to better understand the profound
interactions of these areas.
