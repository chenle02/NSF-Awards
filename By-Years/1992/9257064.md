The goals of this research are to identify and describe molecular processes
governing the macroscopic properties of advanced catalysts, optical devices, and
polymeric solids. Emphasis will be placed on application of state-of-the-art
methods in NMR spectroscopy to describe quantitatively local bonding, symmetry,
and motions in partially ordered molecular sieve and polymeric systems.
