MIT PRIMES is a free, year-long research program for high school students at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The goal of PRIMES is to give talented
high school students a unique experience of real mathematical research, letting
them discover the joy and beauty of mathematical exploration; to inspire them to
pursue careers in the mathematical sciences; and to diversify the pool of
students interested in mathematics by providing additional opportunities for
promising students with underprivileged backgrounds. This project funds the
local Mathematics Section of PRIMES. PRIMES students will work on their research
projects during the academic year, aided by weekly meetings with their mentors
(MIT Mathematics Department graduate students) on the MIT campus. The projects
will be presented at annual PRIMES conferences, and final papers will be posted
on the Program website and disseminated through arXiv.org and academic journals.

This project will fund research by high school students and their mentors in the
following areas: quantum Schubert calculus, Ramsey multiplicity, the Richter-
Thomassen conjecture and related topics, signatures of Hermitian forms arising
in representation theory, structure of lower central series of associative
algebras, and properties of closed polygonal paths with steps being roots of
unity.
