This research will study the atmospheric and oceanic climate systems that are
thought to influence the rainfall characteristics over sub-Sahara Africa during
the summer monsoon rainy season. The investigation will focus on the pre-season
development of atmospheric pressure and circulation systems and their mutual
interaction with sea-surface temperature anomaly patterns in an effort to
identify predictors of the Sahelian drought. The primary vehicle of the
investigation is the GISS GCM coupled to a mixed layer ocean. This will be one
of the first (if not the first) studies to employ a coupled atmosphere-ocean
model to investigate the causes, maintenance, and predictability of the Sahelian
drought. This study is important as it is likely to significantly improve the
prospects of more realistic Sahelian climate simulation than has been possible
in the past.
