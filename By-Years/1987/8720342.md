This project incorporates notions of bounded rationality and measures of
complexity into economic analysis. The importance of bringing complexity
considerations into economic models is shown by the organizational structures,
social mechanisms, and data base systems designed for the purpose of simplifying
the process of decision making as well as simplifying implementations of
strategies. This need takes on an added importance now since economic agents are
beginning to relegate decisions and strategies to computers. Thus, studying the
effects of finite computational ability, computational costs, and computing
power in general becomes an essential part of the strategic analysis. In their
previous work the investigators demonstrated that the concept of an automaton is
a natural way of characterizing the needs for simplicity and the notions of
bounded rationality of players in the types of strategic games central to modern
economic analysis and other social sciences. This project continues to expand
existing results in several directions. It investigates automaton-complexity and
alternative notions of complexity in repeated games with emphasis on algebraic
(group theoretic) measures. It extends complexity results on repeated games to
stochastic games. This extension is especially important because stochastic
games are more useful to economists than repeated games. Complexity results are
extended to general extensive games with imperfect information.
