Many decision processes in science, including hiring, tenure, promotion, and
funding give considerable weight to citation-based metrics. It has in fact
become commonplace to equate the number of citations received by an article with
that article's "impact" or importance. Despite the plausibility of this
equation, there are many reasons that scholars cite past work and there is no
independent empirical evidence to support this fundamental postulate of
bibliometrics. This lack of independent verification calls into question the
meaning and purpose of the entire field of research, and is often used as an
argument against the validity of reliance on citation numbers in assessment
exercises. This project will test the feasibility and develop the methodology
necessary to generate the first large-scale set of data on "true" scientific
impact as actually perceived by scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Measuring the
true scientific impact of all articles will require surveying millions of
corresponding authors of scientific publications as part of the biggest survey
ever conducted in science. The main purpose of the present project is to
establish the feasibility of the requisite survey methods. The research will
survey small samples of authors to determine the optimal survey format necessary
to achieve the appropriate tradeoff between response rate, information, and
reliability. In particular, the research will explore variations in two basic
ingredients of the survey format: content and design. We will select papers from
different sample pools to quantify biases in participant preferences depending
on external factors such as authorship, journal of publication, and number of
citations accumulated. We will also consider different survey designs, and
determine the most effective one able to increase the response of the potential
participants and the amount of time that they will dedicate to the survey,
without degrading the quality of the data obtained from their answers.
