This is an award to the National Academy of Sciences for the operation of the
Committee on Geophysical Data (CGD). The CGD will give priority to the needs for
environmental data and information to support global change research. It will
work with the Interagency Working Group on Data Management for Global Change in
developing national and international plans and will continue activities related
to World Data Center-A and U.S. national data centers. The CGD has, over the
last two years, been deeply involved in defining the elements of a strategy for
global change data and information management. With a membership drawn from a
number of environmental disciplines, the CGD has attempted to represent the
views of a broad segment of the environmental science research community This
award will enable the CGD to continue its close liaison with the IWG and to put
a major emphasis on giving advice on the scientific aspects of global change
data management.
