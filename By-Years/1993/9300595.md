This award provides funds to Northern Arizona University to continue a
successful Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site. The project will be
sponsored by the three colleges at the University; Arts and Sciences, Social and
Behavioral Sciences, and Engineering and Technology. Under the guidance of
Faculty Mentors students will conduct research in the neural and behavioral
sciences. The total research internship integrates two major components. During
the year-long research internship, students receive training in research design,
statistics, reading complex scientific literature, introduction to advanced
technologies in research design and implementation, seminars in the history and
philosophy of science, and an integrated lecture- discussion series that covers
the range of research topics in neural and behavioral sciences. The program
combines this training phase with research experiences during the academic year.
Scientists from the Department of Biology and the Department of Psychology will
sponsor 10 research internships for undergraduates. The Department of Vocational
and Technological Education will provide training in advanced technologies,
including basic computer training (wordprocessing, graphics, statistics,
electronic communication) and training in the application of computer assisted
design systems for production of research software and instrumentation. The
Science and Mathematics Learning Center will provide coordination and
administrative assistance for the project, and also training in the basics of
experimental design, statistics, reading scientific literature, scientific and
technical writing, and collaborative learning. Scientists from all participating
departments will contribute lecture-discussion series on neural and behavioral
research.
