ABSTRACT DMS - 0204671.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator plans to
continue his work on global problems &lt;br/&gt;in differential geometry and
related areas. Special emphasis will be devoted &lt;br/&gt;to the pursuit of
global Riemannian geometry via additional structures. &lt;br/&gt;This includes
but is not limited to structures arising from the presence &lt;br/&gt;of
symmetries, and to structures arising from taking external or internal limits.
&lt;br/&gt;Our efforts concerning investigations of relations between curvature,
&lt;br/&gt;symmetry and topology is guided by the program set forth by the aim:
&lt;br/&gt;``Classify or describe the structure of manifolds with positive or
&lt;br/&gt;nonnegative curvature and large isometry groups". This area is
currently &lt;br/&gt;experiencing significant advances in various directions.
The project will &lt;br/&gt;also include investigations of structures arising
from the collapse &lt;br/&gt;of manifolds under a lower curvature bound, and of
metric invariants &lt;br/&gt;coming from investigations of the structure of
various spaces of finite metric spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
significance of the main part of the proposal is twofold. On the one
&lt;br/&gt;hand there are many geometric situations where no symmetries are
present &lt;br/&gt;from the outset, but where symmetries emerge non-trivially
from the geometry. &lt;br/&gt;Among such situations are rigidity problems and
collapsing problems under &lt;br/&gt;bounded curvature. General results achieved
through the work proposed can &lt;br/&gt;then be invoked and help solve the
original problem, where no symmetries &lt;br/&gt;were present. This method has
already been used successfully. &lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, the proposed work
provides a systematic approach for &lt;br/&gt;finding new examples of spaces
with positive or nonnegative curvature, &lt;br/&gt;arguably one the most central
and difficult issues facing global &lt;br/&gt;Riemannian geometry
today.&lt;br/&gt;
