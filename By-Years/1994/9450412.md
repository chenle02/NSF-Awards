9450412 The proposed research encompasses the synthesis of pseudo-ternary
compounds of the silver chalcogenides and the characterization and simulation of
their physical and electrical properties. The ultimate aim is to relate
structural information to the ionic conductivity and diffusivity of silver to
obtain a deeper understanding of the mechanism of superionic conductivity which
marks high temperature phases in the system Ag2S---Ag2Se--Ag2 Te. Data sets
derived from x-ray diffraction,calorimetry, four-probe conductivity and x-ray
absorption spectroscopy analyses will be incorporated into a computer model of
the super ionic phases.
