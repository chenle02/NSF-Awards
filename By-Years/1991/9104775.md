Approximately on half of the earth is believed to be MgSiO3- perovskite. The
idealized crystal of this material consists of 8 silicon octahedra, each sitting
at the corner of a cube with Mg in the center of the cube. This material,
examined at room pressure and temperature is slightly distorted, with small
rotations of these octahedra about various axes to yield an orthorhombic crystal
symmetry. Such distortions in other perovskites, however, have lead to numerous
polymorphs with an array of physical properties and temperature dependencies of
these properties which drastically differ from those expected in the absence of
these rotational degrees of freedom. It is the aim of this project to
investigate some of these properties with the hope of gaining insight to the
behavior of MgSiO3 in the earth's lower mantle.
