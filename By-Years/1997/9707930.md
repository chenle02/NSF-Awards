The Department of Mathematicals at Texas A&amp;M University will purchase a
high-performance multiprocessor computer which will be dedicated to the support
of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be usedfor several
research projects, including in particular: the numerical simulation of flow
processes; computational algebraic geometry; and inverse problems in partial
differential equations.
