This starter grant award to Princeton University supports the research of
Professor Sonny C. Lee. The research focuses on an improved understanding of the
structural chemistry of the iron-molybdenum cofactor in nitrogenase enzymes
through investigation of metal-sulfur cluster core rearrangements. Certain
reactions are known to transform common iron-sulfur geometries into clusters
bearing structural affinities to the cofactor. This chemistry is applied to new
clusters classes to construct higher nuclearity clusters with structural
features similar to the iron-molybdenum cofactor. Clusters which are geometric
isomers of the cofactor are specific targets, with the goal of attaining
clusters with substantial topological homology to the cofactor. The research
advances understanding of the fundamental structural chemistry of iron-sulfur
clusters, leading to progress toward a chemical understanding of nitrogenase.
The nitrogenase enzymes catalyze the reduction of atmospheric dinitrogen to
ammonia, a reaction critical to the biological availability of fixed nitrogen.
