The proposed research involves the numerical solution of various free boundary
value problems modelling flows of liquids in Hele-Shaw cells. Such Hele-Shaw
flows, as they are called, are important in their own right, and they serve as
very useful models of more complicated phenomena involving free boundaries. The
proposed research will produce robust numerical schemes capable of handling many
different types of nonlinear phenomena whose analytic resolution is currently
impossible. The phenomenon of "fingering" of one fluid as it flows into another
is a common, easily observed occurrence that is very difficult to describe
quantitatively. The proposed research will suggest and evaluate different kinds
of methods for studying numerically the set of mathematical equations that
govern the evolution in time of an unstable finger. A successful numerical
scheme for this particular problem will have much broader applicability to a
host of problems in fluid dynamics.
