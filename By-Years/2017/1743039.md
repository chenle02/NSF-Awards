The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it will
introduce a new nanocarbon foam technology that can be utilized in multiple
industrial applications. Initially the technology is expected to enhance the
performance of thermal management products in electronics through the
implementation of nanocarbon foams. Thermal management is critically important
to many electronics and energy applications because ever-increasing generation
of heat has become an impediment to the advancement and efficient operation of
those devices. Thermal management devices made from nanocarbon foams could
ensure enhanced performance of electronic devices by efficiently dissipating the
high heat fluxes present in these devices. The lightweight, super-elastic, and
high stability properties of nanocarbon foams make them a unique alternative for
the thermal management of portable and flexible electronic devices. In addition
to thermal management, other applications of nanocarbon foams include use in
electrodes for advanced batteries, in fuel cells, in pressure sensors, and in
scaffolds for medical treatments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project
focuses on potential applications of nanocarbon foams for thermal management.
Nanocarbon foam is a carbon nanotube based all carbon porous material. It
consists of large numbers of micro-scale cells and sub-micro thick walls with
nano-scale pores. Because of their unique structures, the nanocarbon foams show
high capillary pressure, super-absorption, large working fluid storage, and fast
fluid transfer capabilities. They are also conductive, lightweight, stable, and
flexible. These features allow nanocarbon foams to be a novel wick material for
thermal management products and have a better performance than current wick
materials. The simple and scalable fabrication process could lead to low cost
and high quality device manufacturing. The goal of this project is to do focused
customer discovery work in the electronics and thermal management industries to
evaluate the commercial potential of nanocarbon foams.
