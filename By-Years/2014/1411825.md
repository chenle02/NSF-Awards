This research examines the ways in which authoritarian systems negatively
characterize protestors in order to protect their own legitimacy and justify the
use of harsh repression. While research has examined how social movements
articulate their grievances, this study will make a contribution by analyzing
how repressive systems frame their messages and the implications those frames
have for citizens. This project focuses on the historical case of popular
resistance to a 1953 currency reform in Czechoslovakia, one of the first
uprisings against Communism in the Eastern Bloc.

This project will draw upon extensive examination of archival legal documents
and in-depth interviews with protest participants, to analyze how
characterizations of protesters served to legitimate state interests and
influence repression. The findings will have relevance for understanding how
other authoritarian systems have historically repressed citizens and quashed
public protest. The research will result in the creation of large data sets that
will be available to educators, scholars, and the public via the Internet. This
study has important educational impacts, as its findings will contribute to the
development of college level courses in sociology and history, and it will
provide hands-on training in research and collaborative opportunities with the
principal investigator for students at North Carolina State University.
