In this Minority Research Initiation project in the Chemistry Division, Edwin
Carrasquillo M. of the University of Houston will study quantum state-resolved
collision dynamics involving polyatomic molecules which contain chemically
significant amounts of vibrational energy. The combination of direct excitation
using a single-photon overtone vibration to prepare a molecule in a specific
quantum state, together with laser-induced fluorescence as a spectroscopic
probe, allows the temporal evolution of a hot molecule to be monitored. Various
hydrogen-containing molecules, such as HCN, DCN, HCP, and propynal, will be
studied in order to extract relaxation mechanisms and identify general trends.
%%% Studies of energy transfer involving very high vibrational levels are
important for understanding many chemical processes, including reactions.
Knowing how the internal energy of a reactant affects the reaction path or how
the excess internal energy of a product is redistributed as it equilibrates with
its surroundings can help in efforts to control the course of a chemical
reaction. This project aims at examining the behavior of molecules with large
but very precisely determined amounts of energy present in the vibrations of
individual chemical bonds.
