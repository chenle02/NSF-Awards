This is an application for a Career Advancement Award to support the applicant
while she learns modern molecular biological techniques in the laboratory of
another investigator. The objective is to enable the applicant, who has
considerable experience with neuroanatomical and experimental embryological
approaches to developmental neurobiology, to expand the range of techniques
available to her for continued research on fundamental problems in nervous
system development. The proposed project will teach her a variety of molecular
biological methods including in situ hybridization and some associated
recombinant DNA techniques, including PCR, subcloning, gel electrophoresis,
plasmid preparation, restriction mapping, sequencing, and transcription of
labelled RNAs. In the future, the applicant expects to use these methods in her
own laboratory in combination with other traditional approaches for continued
studies of patter formation in the central nervous system.
