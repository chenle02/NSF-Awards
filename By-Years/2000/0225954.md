This project involves the development of software to facilitate the
understanding and use of brain model simulations. The project is based on the
GENESIS neural simulation system developed over the last 12 years in the
laboratory of the principal investigator. GENESIS is now used in many
laboratories throughout the world as a tool to help construct and run brain
models at many levels of brain organization from subcellular to whole networks
and systems. This project will develop a modeler's workspace to help find,
organize, and visualize the data on which these simulations are based. In
addition this project provides support to link numerous other existing
neuroscience databases to the workspace. Finally, the workspace will also
provide a novel educational tool to allow students of neuroscience to understand
both brain models and the areas of the brain they represent.
