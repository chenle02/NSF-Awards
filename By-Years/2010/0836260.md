Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;Within undergraduate engineering education,
programming is often a fundamental skill course included in the curriculum.
Unfortunately, students often learn to program and then do not apply the skills
they have acquired in follow-on courses. The lack of integration of programming
in upper division courses means that students perceive that programming is of no
value in engineering practice and that they are unable to apply this tool
effectively to solve complex problems. Through this project, programming topics
and techniques are being integrated vertically throughout the undergraduate
industrial engineering curriculum. The curricular materials being developed are
focused on case studies in the service and automotive industries. The
integration is being designed so that students are able to identify situations
where programming skills are required and to apply these skills appropriately in
the solution of problems. The essential outcome is that students proactively
consider programming solutions when faced with an engineering problem. The
project is being rigorously evaluated through a variety of
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;
