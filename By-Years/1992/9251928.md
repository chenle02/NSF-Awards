Creation of a Physical Measurement and Imaging Laboratory for the Archaeology
Program at Indiana University of Pennsylvania will provide training for students
in two areas that are not offered to undergraduates elsewhere. First, the
collection and management of large amounts of archaeological data using a
computer based automatic data collection system. These are becoming typical of
large archaeological projects, but only rarely is any training in their use
available. The second focus of the lab is on instruction about, and the analysis
of image data. This will have a twofold purpose, first to allow the teaching of
methods and techniques involved in analyzing overall artifact shape via high
resolution images, and second, to allow instruction of large groups in the
nature and analysis of microwear (using video microscopy) on both bone and stone
tools.
