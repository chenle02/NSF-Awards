This award will support a survey of low frequency spectral lines from the
southern portion of the plane of our Galaxy. The lines are produced by the
recombination of ionized carbon atoms into very high quantum states with
principal quantum numbers between 272 and 768; the corresponding frequencies of
the lines are 325 MHz to 14.5 MHz. The atoms producing these lines are extremely
large and fragile with diameters up to 50 microns. Such atoms can exist only
under the benign conditions found in cool interstellar clouds, and they are
extremely sensitive to their environment. For this reason they are excellent
diagnostics of temperature, pressure, and ionization levels in cool interstellar
clouds. All previous observations have been made with northern hemisphere
telescopes. This survey will cover the southern portion of the galactic plane
and the Magellanic Clouds using the Parkes telescope in Australia in order to
discover more line emitting regions.
