The proposed collaboration with GÂ¼nther Heinemann of the University of Bonn
investigate the katabatic wind system over the ice sheet and the coastal regions
of Greenland. Two mesoscale numerical models will be used to obtain
climatologically relevant numerical simulations of a few months' duration. The
model used by the Bonn group has a horizontal resolution of 25 or 50 kilometers;
the one used by the U.S. group is the Pennsylvania State University/National
Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model version 5, modified for ice
sheet meteorology, with a resolution of 25 kilometers. Results of an
observational study by the Bonn group will be used to verify the accuracy of the
numerical simulations, and a comparison of modeling techniques and results will
be used to improve model parametrizations and to lead to a clearer understanding
of the role that Greenland's katabatic winds play in North Atlantic climate.
