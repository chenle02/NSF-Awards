The area of optical neural networks has evolved by adopting the techniques
proposed by various "connectionist" models. The optical implementation was first
demonstrated by Psaltis and Farhat in 1985 Opt. Lett. 10, 98 (1985) and was
followed by a direct optical associative memory demonstration by Anderson in
1986 Opt. Lett. 11, 59 (1986) and by Soffer, Dunning, Owechko and Marom Opt.
Lett. 11, 118 (1986) as well as Yariv and Kwong Opt. Lett. 11, 186 (1986). Since
this time the field has evolved rapidly and many insights, problems, and
approaches have been considered. Most interesting has been Chinese to English
three character recognition and translation demonstrated by Psaltis and co-
workers, an optical novelty tracking filter by Anderson and co-workers, and
recent work by Lischer and Lee at N. R. L. Some of the problems to be addressed
include multiple image holographic storage, implementation of learning, and
faster nonlinear crystals exhibiting large effects.
