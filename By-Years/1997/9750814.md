The focus of this project is an emphasis on exploration and discovery of
mathematical concepts by student teams through a constructivist approach. In
developing this project, the personnel are reviewing laboratory configurations
which have proven to be conducive to group work. Desired is a layout which would
allow instructors increased flexibility in designing curricula and promoting
student group interactions. *
