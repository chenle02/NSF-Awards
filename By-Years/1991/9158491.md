Ferguson The focus is on developing cost-effective testing methodologies that
detect more defective ICs than current methods. There are two approaches to
manufacturing test. The use of high-level fault models reduces test generation
costs, but furnish lower quality tests. The use of low-level fault models
increases the quality of circuits that have passed the tests, but causes testing
costs to mushroom. This research integrates these two techniques so that tests
can be generated that detect virtually all plausible manufacturing defects
without excessive automatic test pattern generation costs. The approach is to
develop a software tool, "Carafe" (circuit and realistic fault detector), which
determines the most likely faults to occur in a CMOS circuit. It exploits the
hierarchical nature of VLSI circuit designs, making fault extraction faster and
more memory efficient. Also it supports multi-level metal CMOS technologies.
