This award funds exploring the use of the Sony Playstation 3 (PS3) gaming
console for scientific computing in gravitational wave physics. If successful,
this approach would yield a significantly higher cost effectiveness (measured as
performance per dollar) compared with traditional Beowulf compute clusters. The
project will focus on investigating the performance of the PS3 for projects in
numerical relativity and LIGO data analysis. Part of the project is dedicated to
identifying the specific codes and libraries that will need tuning for the
PS3/Cell architecture in order to perform well. Any Cell processor specific
optimizations that are implemented in publicly available source code as a result
of this study, will be made freely available via a
website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore the feasibility of a
novel extension of the cost-effective Beowulf cluster approach towards
supercomputing, using very low-cost special purpose hardware, such as the Sony
PS3. If successful, this approach suggests that it may be possible to reach a
performance per dollar that is over an order of magnitude higher than what can
be achieved through traditional means. Thus, this project will clearly have
serious implications for cluster computing and scientific computing, in general.
In particular, if PS3 clusters yield these benefits, searches of LIGO data and
simulations of gravitational wave sources could move into computer intensive
regimes not now possible.
