Abstract DMS-0401334 PI: ZJ Xia

Conservative mechanical systems, such as our planetary system, are examples of
Hamiltonian systems. Geodesic flows are other examples of Hamiltonian systems.
One of the most important problems in Hamiltonian dynamical systems is whether
orbits in typical systems are stable. In fact, the stability of our planetary
system has long been an important subject of mathematical research. Hamiltonian
systems usually exhibit some extremely complicated and chaotic behavior. The
proposed research will address various problems related to stability and chaos,
with research topics such as the Aubry-Mather theory, Arnold diffusions, chaotic
behaviors and the Newtonian n-body problem. The ultimate goal is to show that
typical near integrable Hamiltonians in higher dimensions are topologically
unstable. The proposed research addresses problems with a long history and wide
applications to classical mechanics, celestial mechanics, as well as areas of
engineering. Professor Xia's research in Hamiltonian systems and celestial
mechanics has been featured in many popular science magazines, books and even in
some elementary undergraduate textbooks. Another aspect of this work, is the
study of escaping and capture trajectories in the three-body problem, which may
have potential applications in NASA orbit design. Professor Xia will continue to
be actively involved in student training at both graduate and undergraduate
level.
