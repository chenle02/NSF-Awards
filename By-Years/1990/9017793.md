The field of neuropeptides has exploded with activity in the past few years
because of advances in isolation techniques and instrumentatation for structural
characterization. Although many insect neuropeptides have recently been
characterized there is a real paucity of information on their receptors and mode
of action. In researching a brain neuropeptide that regulates pheromone
production in redbanded leafroller moths, Dr. Roelofs discovered that the corpus
bursae was essential for activity of this neuropeptide. He now has isolated a
factor from the bursa that is released when the brain neuropeptide is present
and this factor, in turn, is involved in turning on pheromone production. A
unique opportunity is presented to define the role of these peptides in
pheromone production. This not only provides a basis for comparison of hormonal
controls in other insect species, with implications on how this endocrine system
evolved, but also will allow the identification of specific genes encoding these
hormones for possible use in transgenic manipulations for novel insect control
programs.//
