This SBIR Phase II project proposes to pursue commercialization of
perfluorocyclobutyl (PFCB) polymer products successfully developed during Phase
I. High performance fluoropolymers, whose structure can be readily adjusted to
achieve performance targets and which can be easily processed are in demand for
next generation technologies including integrated optics, fuel cell membranes,
gas separation membranes, and deep UV lithography. Tetramer's patented PFCB
polymers exhibit superior processing and performance advantages including
excellent molding and extrusion capability, unmatched thermal stability, zero
by-products during polymerization and fabrication, and the ability to tune
properties for these large market applications that promise significant growth
from to their global economic attractiveness and strategic military importance
to the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This distinctive activity will
enhance scientific and technological knowledge in both academia and industry for
such diverse technically driven fields as lower cost higher data rate integrated
optics, fuel cell membranes, white light LEDs, and gas separation membranes and
particularly the discipline of polymer chemistry due to its structural
versatility. After protecting intellectual property, Tetramer plans to share the
results through published papers, and university and industrial seminars. This
project will also contribute to US global leadership in the above fields of
strategic commercial and military interest. &lt;br/&gt;
