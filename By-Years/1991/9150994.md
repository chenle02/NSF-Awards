The project emphasizes a better integrated approach to the teaching of courses
in mapping techniques to undergraduate students in the Department of Geography,
University of Georgia. Through a suite of 15 carefully designed laboratory
exercises focusing on the theme of terrain mapping, modeling and analysis,
students will learn in a sequence of three 10-week courses the principles and
techniques of computer-assisted cartography, photogrammetry, and geographic
information systems. The integrated approach allows a holistic treatment of
these technique courses by the instructors and promotes understanding by
students of the interdependence of these mapping techniques. The project
recommends the purchase of 386- VGA personal computers, A- and C-sized
digitizers, printers, plotters, and a scanner in conjunction with software, such
as, ERDAS/VGA, pc ARC/INFO, GRASS, ATLAS*DRAW, and SURFER, as the most
appropriate and cost-effective configuration to achieve the objective. After the
completion of the project, a laboratory manual with supporting software will be
produced.
