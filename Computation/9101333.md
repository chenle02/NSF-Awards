The ability to describe complex bodies of data by mathematical models is an
essential and challenging task. The investigator of this award expands the
horizon for model fitting. The work on generalized model fitting is expected to
have great impact on data analysis. The investigation will consider the
estimation of nuisance dispersion parameters by partially Bayes methods. It will
also examine the relationship between the adjusted profile likelihood and the
modified profile likelihood methods.
