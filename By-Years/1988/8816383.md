Dr. Hall proposes to conduct an aeromagnetic survey of aportion of the Gulf of
Mexico in order to map magnetic trends related to the formation of the Gulf in
Late Jurassic time by processes of sea floor spreading and continental drift.
The observed trend of magnetic anomalies in the Gulf wil help distinguish among
several different suggested histories for the early history of the Gulf based on
data from other ocean basins or from the margins of the Gulf.
