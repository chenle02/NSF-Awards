The Photonic Switching Topical Meeting will consist of invited papers and both
oral and poster contributed papers in the following areas: Devices and Phenomena
for Switching Applications. - Optically, electrically, or mechanically activated
optical switches. - Switching arrays. - Integration of optical and electronic
switching devices. - Material properties relevant to optical switching devices.
- Comparisons of optical and electronic switching; practical and/or theoretical
limitations. - Trends in performance or optical and electronic switching
devices. - Switching systems and network architectures utilizing optical
switching technologies. - Applications for optical switching devices as
alternatives to electronic switching devices in today's switching systems, and
architectures. - New system and network architectures that capitalize on the
unique attributes of optical switching devices. - Novel systems applications
that may favor or require the use of optical switching technologies.
