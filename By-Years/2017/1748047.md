Despite its long and successful history in academic research, approximate
computing has not become mainstream in commercial products. This award supports
the organization of a workshop to bring together researchers and practitioners
to brainstorm ideas for bridging the gap between the state-of-the-art research
on approximate query processing and real-world use-cases for data science and
cluster computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organization of this workshop has
broader impacts on the related scientific research communities and the society
at large. In the short term, this mutually-informative interaction will help
academic research align its focus with real-world challenges, and will help
practitioners learn about new opportunities made possible by approximate
computing. In the long term, this workshop will also foster future
collaborations and real-world adoptions.
