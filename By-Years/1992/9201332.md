A large and unique data set was collected during a series of experiments
conducted in the equatorial Pacific (TROPIC HEAT) between 1984 and 1987. The
measurements consisted of intensive microstructure profiles, mean current
profiles and thermistor chain observations of internal waves. The continuing
analysis focusses on the interaction between internal waves and turbulence in
the upper equatorial Pacific. It is postulated that mixing by high-frequency
internal waves dominates the vertical fluxes in this region.
