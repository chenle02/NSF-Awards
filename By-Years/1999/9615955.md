9615955 Low This project will explore new ways to reach a broadcast audience
wider than those who normally would watch an NSF funded television program on
PBS. The PI will define new, non-competitive relationships between PBS and other
broadcast or cable venues and will explore incentives for pursuing such
relationships. The specific tasks to be conducted under the grant include:
developing and testing procedures for distributing a program or series in a
venue in addition to PBS, implementing such distribution, and evaluating the
impact on audience size in the new venue as well as on subsequent broadcast on
PBS. The final report will document the results of this research and describe
the steps required to arrange for multiple venues. This project represents
examination of an untested idea, the results of which may establish the basis
for significantly increasing the impact of broadcast programming supported by
NSF. Traditionally, when PBS has agreed to schedule a program or series, they
have insisted on a window of exclusivity for a period three years. If the data
from this project indicates that broadcast of a PBS program in a new venue
reaches new audiences and, potentially, attracts some of that audience to PBS,
it should establish a more open attitude on the part of PBS toward multiple
venues at a much earlier time.
