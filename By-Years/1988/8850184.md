This Young Scholars Project sponsored by Northeastern Illinois University will
select 24 gifted students entering the eighth and ninth grades in Chicago public
schools to participate in a 4 week workshop in Environmental Analysis during the
summer of 1988. The students will engage in scientific research as a means of
promoting their interest in careers in science. They will be given experience
with research methodology, analytical procedures, and with the ethics of
scientific research. Using the topic of environmental analysis of ecosystems,
and with assistance from science practitioners and career counselors,
participants will be exposed to the excitement of research and the career
planning process. To insure continuity and the achievement of project
objectives, follow-up sessions are scheduled throughout the fall of 1988 and the
winter and spring of 1989.
