AST 9528536 PI: Hyron Spinrad The Early Phases of Galactic Evolution. Dr.
Spinrad will continue a study of the optical properties of distant radio
galaxies using the Keck 10-m telescopes. He is using radio galaxies to
efficiently find very distant galaxies. These sources permit an important study
of the evolution of galaxies and their relationship to quasi-stellar objects.
Dr. Spinrad is also investigating the alignment effect of optical/infrared
continuum emission with radio jets/lobes. Also he is using the radio galaxies to
identify the most distant clusters of galaxies to study their evolution and
history of star formation. ========================================
