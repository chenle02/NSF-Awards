This Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Project is directed at
upgrading three existing undergraduate laboratory courses in archaeology through
acquisition of basic geophysical remote-sensing equipment and enhancement of
undergraduate teaching, student training, and student experience with
geophysical field and lab technology. Archaeological field and lab methods are
taught in a cycle of three established courses conducted by the applicant at the
Department of Anthropology. The courses include Introduction to Field and Lab
Methods in Archaeology, Field And Lab Experience in Archaeology, and Collection
and Data Analysis in Archaeology. The set of three lab courses offers students
the up-to-date methods and technology essential to archaeology. The project is
dedicated to the introduction of practical contemporary applications of
geophysical Remote Sensing as vital nondestructive surveying and sampling
technology for archaeology. Previously, geophysical remote-sensing technologies
have been discussed only in the lab and field series in archaeology as an
integral part of field survey and sampling. No appropriate geophysical equipment
has been available for field and lab teaching, training, and practical student
experimentation and testing, apart from GPS instrumentation and manual surveying
equipment.
