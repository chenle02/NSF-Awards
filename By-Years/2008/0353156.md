&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COMPUTATIONAL INVESTIGATION OF VIOLENT WATER
WAVES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted concerning the interaction
between water waves and large marine structures (LMS), such as deep water risers
and offshore platforms. The goal is to advance computational modeling of
breaking waves and high Reynolds number flows that cannot be fully investigated
in laboratory-scale tests, and thus enable better predictive and engineering
design models. The Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) method will be used in developing the
computational tools. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to
obtain a better understanding of fluid structure interaction with large marine
structures. Development of the Lattice-Boltzmann method is challenging because
it involves breaking waves, turbulence and free-surface modeling. It is
apparently a novel application of the LB method to breaking waves over LMS.
Broader impacts of the proposed activity include rediction and mitigation of
failure of LMS, which has a very large potential economic impact. For example,
LMS collapse when hurricanes strike in the Gulf of Mexico, with devastating
economic consequences. The computational model developed will be widely
applicable to other fields of science and engineering. In addition, a graduate
student will be trained in the field computational flow simulation and fluid
structure interaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
