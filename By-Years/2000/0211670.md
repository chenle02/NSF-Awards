0211670&lt;br/&gt;Meyerowitz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major research program is
proposed, with the goal of understanding in detail how shoot apical meristems of
plants control their patterns and numbers of cell divisions. Two sets of genetic
experiments are proposed, each with its own aims. The first set includes careful
analyses of cell type and cell divisions in mutant and wild type shoot apical
meristems (SAMs), and time course analysis of the dynamic changes induced in
SAMs by changes in expression of the genes that control meristem behavior. Among
these genes are CLAVATA1, CLAVATA3, WUSCHEL, and SHOOT MERISTEMLESS. These
experiments should result in a newly detailed view of cell division and cell
differentiation control in meristems, and will provide a toolkit for detailed
analysis of new mutant phenotypes and new gene functions. The second set of
experiments are developmental-genetic analyses of newly discovered meristem
control genes such as HANABA TARANU and KANADI4, and mutagenic screens of types
not used so far with plants, to find more meristem control genes. These
experiments will fill in some of the missing players in meristem control, and
will lead directly to new hypotheses of cellular communication and behavior in
meristems. The overall result is expected to be a newly detailed and dynamic
description of meristem cell activity, and following from this, and from genetic
analysis of the genes that control meristem behavior, a new functional
understanding of shoot apical meristems, and thus of plant growth and
development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
