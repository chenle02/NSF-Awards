This award supports participation in a series of three conferences on
commutative algebra, KUMUNU 2023-25, which will be held at the University of
Missouri’s Columbia campus, one each in the Fall of 2023, 2024, and 2025. The
first of these will be held September 23 - 24, 2023; exact dates for the
remaining two are to be determined. KUMUNU (which is named for its original
participating institutions (the University of Kansas, the University of
Missouri–Columbia, and the University of Nebraska–Lincoln) is an annual
conference (held since 1999) for commutative algebraists in the Great Plains
region and attracts participants from a significantly larger geographical
region. Invited speakers for KUMUNU 2023 include David Eisenbud (University of
California, Berkeley), Jakub Witaszek (Princeton University) and Laura
Matusevich (Texas A&M University). The conference will also include talks by
early career researchers and a poster session for junior researchers. Members
from the local graduate student community will be actively involved in
coordinating the poster sessions and other activities promoting a sense of
community amongst students and young researchers. The conferences will provide
opportunities for early-career mathematicians to showcase their work and
introduce promising graduate students to the research community.

The KUMUNU conferences aim to advance mathematics through research talks on
current and the most influential research by a mixture of prominent and
experienced mathematicians as well as budding and talented researchers and
students. More specifically, the conferences will promote connections between
commutative algebra and other areas by inviting speakers who are expert on a
broad range of subjects connected to commutative algebra.
