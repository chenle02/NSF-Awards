Mathematical Sciences (21). This "proof of concept" project is developing
educational materials to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematical ideas
for quantifying real world problems, enhancing problem solving skills, and
improving students' ability to interpret results and further their understanding
of the underlying problem. The investigators aim to counteract students'
perception that mathematical modeling consists of ad hoc lists of methods and
techniques, and to promote instead a view that mathematical modeling is anchored
in a suite of general mathematical principles. Two drafts of textbooks -- a
basic theory text as well as an advanced applications text -- are under
development and being tested. The approach and materials are also incorporating
findings and new topical areas arising from on-going interdisciplinary research
projects at the principal investigators' institution.
