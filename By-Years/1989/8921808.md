The two decades separating the first and second world wars were bracketed by
far-reaching new discoveries in nuclear physics. In 1919, Ernest Rutherford
discovered artificial disintegration and in 1938, Otto Hahn, Fritz Strassman and
Lisa Meitner discovered nuclear fission. Under this grant, Professor Stuewer is
investigating the routes followed by nuclear physicists in going from the first
of these discoveries to the second. These discoveries fundamentally transformed
the field and established nuclear physics as the most important branch of
physics during and after the second world war. Professor Stuewer is tracing the
origin and evolution of the nuclear models or theories during the inter-war
period and is setting the theoretical, experimental, and instrumental
developments that took place within their institutional, social and political
contexts. The PI has already gathered the primary and secondary sources, both
published and unpublished, necessary to carry out this research program. He has
also already undertaken a series of studies that have prepared him to complete
this project.
