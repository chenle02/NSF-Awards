Weather and climate exhibit some degree of periodicity, not 100% of course, for
in that case predictions would be a much less difficult problem. However , a
significant fraction of the variability of the tropical climate, for example, is
attributable to wavelike motions (travelling "disturbances") with periods of
40-50 days. This grant supports research which attempts to model the 40-50 day
oscillations and study the seasonable variability of its structure. The research
will also explore the dynamics of the response of the seasonal climate of the
middle latitudes to this tropical oscillation.
