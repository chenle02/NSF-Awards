The PI will conduct airborne measurements of 222Rn as part of the Pacific
Stratus/Sulfur Investigation. The radionuclide measurements will compliment
measurements made by the NASA/Ames tracking sun photometer, the NOAA/PMEL sulfur
gas chromatograph and the NOAA aerosol size distribution probes to investigate
the postulated link between marine dimethyl sulfide emissions and the reflective
properties of marine stratus clouds. Altitude profiles will be conducted to
locate layers of enhanced particle abundance or thin cloud, and samples for
radionuclide and sulfur gas analysis will be collected in and between the
layers. Source origins and degree of recent aerosol scavenging and free
troposphere - boundary layer exchange will be assessed in conjunction with
measurements made on other PSI platforms, meteorological analyses, and satellite
observations.
