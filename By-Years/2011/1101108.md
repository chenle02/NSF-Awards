The research objective of this grant is to establish a general three-dimensional
model capable of predicting the stress-strain-magnetization behavior of magnetic
shape memory alloys under any type of magnetic and/or mechanical loading.
Magnetic shape memory alloys are unique because they experience a recoverable
strain when exposed to a magnetic field as internal martensitic variants
reorient. The challenges associated with modeling these materials include, but
are not limited to, determining when the variants reorient and the direction of
reorientation under any loading. As an initial step towards a three-dimensional
model, a complete model for any two-dimensional magneto-mechanical loading is
needed. In order to better understand these alloys and to assist with the
modeling, all qualitatively different biaxial load cases with compressive stress
and/or magnetic field will be tested experimentally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
materials, methodologies, and results of this research will be integrated in the
Adaptive Materials and Systems course taught by the principal investigator,
providing students with unique training in magnetically adaptive materials. The
results of this project will be presented to peers at technical conferences, to
students and faculty at Northern Arizona University, and to the general
population during the annual Flagstaff Festival of Science, as well as published
in journals and conference proceedings. Finally, this work will create a means
of predicting the behavior of magnetic shape memory alloys subject to complex
loads, which will give engineers insight into potential applications of these
alloys and a robust tool for the design of devices that include magnetic shape
memory alloys.
