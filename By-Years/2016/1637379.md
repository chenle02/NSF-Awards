This project will support attendance of young faculty, under-represented
minority scientists, PUI faculty, along with graduate students and post-docs at
the 2016 Plant and Microbial Cytoskeleton Gordon Research Conference to be held
at the Proctor Academy in Andover, NH, August 14-19, 2016. The meeting will
consist of short talks, poster sessions, communal dining, and conversations that
will provide ample opportunity for sharing latest research results and for
exploring collaborative possibilities.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The cytoskeleton of
plant, fungi, and plants play important roles in cell division, cellular
trafficking, and wall organization in these groups of organism. The Broader
Impacts of this work involves both the importance of the cytoskeleton to a range
of organisms, as well as the training of new scientist to pursue research in
these fields. Cutting-edge or late-breaking research will be highlighted in
several short talks chosen from the abstracts. The primary purposes of this
conference are to promote discussion between scientists with common professional
interests, including those from non-research-intensive colleges and
universities, to foster the exchange of ideas from advanced aspects of their
field, and to enable scientific collaborations to evolve in new directions.
