Abstract

Award: DMS-1005360 Principal Investigator: Carolyn S. Gordon, Alexander Barnett,
Peter A. Perry

A week-long International Conference on Spectral Geometry will be held at
Dartmouth College July 19--23, 2010. The primary themes of the conference will
be Quantum Unique Ergodicity, which addresses the behavior of the highly excited
states in the quantization of ergodic Hamiltonian systems, and Inverse Spectral
Geometry, which asks the extent to which spectral data associated with the
Laplacian or other natural operators encode the geometry of a Riemannian
manifold. In addition to spectral problems on Riemannian manifolds, there will
be a secondary focus on the related topic of quantum graphs, in which the one-
dimensional Laplacian acts along edges, and waves scatter at vertices.

Both quantum unique ergodicity and inverse spectral geometry are areas of
intense research activity in mathematics, bridging geometry, analysis and number
theory, and both have strong ties to physics. By bringing together experts and
young researchers with various perspectives and expertise, the conference will
promote new collaborations and interactions and contribute to the advancement of
research in these areas. The conference will be preceded by a two-day intensive
workshop, aimed at graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s, to prepare for the
conference themes.
