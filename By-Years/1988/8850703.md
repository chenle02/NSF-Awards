This program of research and development uses intelligent microworlds to teach
fundamental concepts of number and operation to elementary and middle school
children. The work will examine innovative ways of incorporating computers into
conceptully oriented mathematics instruction. The following questions will be
addressed: (a) how computers can support human interaction instead of replacing
it; (b) how discussion of mathematical ideas ay enhance conceptual lerning; (c)
how graphical and symbolic representations scaffold discussion; and (d) how
intelligent miroworlds facilitate problem solving and mathematics understanding
by providing visible representations of mathematizable situations and connecting
them to abstractions. An integrated system of computer microworlds will be
developed. These microworlds will represent abstract mathematical concepts in a
directly manipulable graphical form, permitting display and exploration of a
range of basic number concepts taught in elementary and middle schools. The
system will include distinct representations for the different senses of
arithmetic operators, along with facilities for linking these sense-specific
representations to more abstract graphic and symbolic representations of
equations. The system will be used to scaffold both teacher-led discussion of
mathematics concepts, and independent mathematics work by children.
