This conference intends to bring a small group of Minority Serving Institution
(MSI) faculty and experts in program evaluation to share lessons learned; to
present new and evolving theories embedded within indigenous cultural
experiences; and, to actively engage in strategizing avenues for improving
capacity building and sustaining the application of responsive culturally
appropriate evaluations. It is also a needs assessment focused on participant
identification of needed capacity building activities in evaluation from three
perspectives: their own, their institution and across Historically Black
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). This grant would be a follow-up to expand
previous activities initiated by NSF through the Broadening Participation
Initiative in Evaluation Capacity Building. The proposed conference also would
set the stage for designing and revising strategies/models and the review of
their use for broadening participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM
evaluation.
