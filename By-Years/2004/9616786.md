The aim of this planning project is to assemble a collection of non-human
primate skulls from animals of known life history. At the end of the planning
period a sub-sample will be selected from this collection and used in a project
examining the relationship between defects in non-human primate teeth and life
events. The ultimate aim of this is to develop a method to recreate events in
the lives of fossil humans. The select sub-sample will provide the best possible
experimental sample for an adequate test of whether life history events do
reliably leave indicators in the developing hard tissues of the teeth. It is
essential to limit the final number of animals represented for practical reasons
due to the time consuming nature of the analysis. The estimated sample to be
gathered is 100, of which 50-60 would form the select sub-sample. The primary
source of primate carcasses is the New Iberia Research Center in New Iberia,
Louisiana. The carcasses will represent natural casualties from their non-human
primate breeding program. The other source of primate carcasses is a collection
of 52 frozen laboratory and zoo animals from the University of Cambridge in
England.
