This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant will advance understanding
and evaluate the application of several adaptive and energy-efficient soil
penetration processes to inspire a new paradigm for design and construction of
civil infrastructure. Current and future environmental and economic challenges,
including the continued growing population and the depletion of natural
resources, create a strong demand for sustainable and adaptive infrastructure.
Many aspects of our infrastructure rely on soil penetration processes, from the
characterization of soils at project sites to construction. This project will
improve our understanding of the soil burrowing and penetration strategies used
by several insects, mollusks, and fishes to develop innovative solutions for
applications in foundation and anchorage systems, tunneling, soil
characterization, and monitoring of sites and structures. The integrated
educational, diversity, and outreach goals are to raise awareness and broaden
the overall understanding of bioinspiration as a philosophy for development of
sustainable engineering solutions and to help develop a workforce that is
inclusive of Hispanic and Latinx students for the field of bioinspired
geotechnics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal research goals of this project
are to identify and quantify the mechanisms that enable efficient soil
penetration in biological systems and to effectively upscale these mechanisms to
physical scales relevant to civil infrastructure. Biological adaptations
involved in wasp, honeybee, mosquito, and sand lance substrate penetration,
earth and marine worm locomotion, caecilian and clam burrowing, and root growth
will be explored. This project will integrate bioinspired design, laboratory
experiments, discrete element modeling simulations, and centrifuge models. The
fundamental mechanical processes that facilitate bioinspired soil penetration
will be investigated, including soil arching, principal stress rotation,
interactions between zones with altered stress states, load transfer and its
dependency on shape, and softening caused by pore fluid pressurization. The
education and outreach efforts will be targeted towards middle school and high
school students through youth citizen science activities and towards
undergraduate and graduate students through training in the classroom and the
laboratory. This educational and outreach plan will aim to increase
participation of Hispanic and Latinx students in the bioinspired geotechnics
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
