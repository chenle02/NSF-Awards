The 2017 Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS) and Centre de
Recherches Mathematique (CRM) Summer School in Probability will be held at the
University of British Columbia, Canada, from June 5-30, 2017. The school will be
devoted to the training of doctoral students in the area of probability. The PI
anticipates some participation of advanced undergraduate students and
postdoctoral researchers. The summer school will consist of two principal
courses and three short courses. The participants will learn the current
techniques in cutting-edge areas of probability. The themes of the main courses
will be the discrete Gaussian free field and lattice spin models. It is expected
that the participants will engage in active research on some topics covered by
the main courses and related areas, and many will give presentations on their
current research.

The Summer School will be widely advertised and under-represented groups will be
encouraged to apply. The information about the school is available at the
