The goal of this proposal is to understand the role of the BALD-2 locus in
meiosis and to identify other genes that interact with this locus. A genetic
approach will be used to examine the range of mutant phenotypes at the BALD-2
locus and to identify interacting and regulatory genes by the isolation of
suppressors and enhancers of mutant bald-2 alleles. Preparations of isolated
mutant and wild-type basal bodies will be analyzed by two- dimensional gel
electrophoresis for changes in the polypeptide composition and by electron
microscopy and computer-assisted imaging for morphological changes. The BALD-2
gene will be cloned and sequenced for use in further molecular studies. A study
of the fundamental process of meiosis and its genetic control will be useful to
all who study sexually reproducing organisms. The information gained using this
experimental organism can be transferred to many animals and plants.
