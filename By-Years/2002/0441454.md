Workshop on Reliability Issues in Nanomaterials&lt;br/&gt;August 17-19,
2004&lt;br/&gt;NIST Laboratories, Boulder,
Colorado&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sponsored by NSF,
NIST and the Mechanical Engineering Department of the University of Colorado, an
invitation-only workshop will be held in Boulder, CO to identify and discuss
mechanical reliability issues of significance for nanomaterials. We seek to
identify future possible paths where nanotechnology-based research could lead us
during the next 5 to 10 years in materials science and engineering and vice
versa. Forty to fifty respected leaders in the field representing academia,
national labs, government agencies, and industry will provide their inputs into
developing a roadmap of key technical issues and possible solution approaches.
The focus will be on specific measurement-related barriers to successful
incorporation of nanomaterials into widespread engineering practice and
identification of measurement methodologies, standards, data, and models for
overcoming these barriers. The major findings of the Workshop will be published
in the form of a NIST Special Publication.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The University
of Colorado (CU) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will
be hosts, and the event will take place on the NIST site. For more information,
