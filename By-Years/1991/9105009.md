This award will provide half the funds needed for the acquisition of modern
computer equipment to upgrade the computer facilities in the Department of
Geological Sciences at The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). UTEP is
committed to provide the additional funds necessary for this acquisition. This
award will make it possible to set up two modern, powerful workstations. These
workstations will be necessary to allow faculty to expand their capabilities in
modelling and seismic reflection processing. With the addition of this new
computer equipment there will be a reduced load on the existing system which
will allow for greater access for course-related computing. The PIs stress the
importance of involving undergraduates, a large number of whom are minority, in
modern computer applications.
