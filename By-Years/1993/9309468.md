9309468 Boynton Professor Boynton will conduct two null experiments to test the
inverse square law of gravity in the critical range between 10 cm and 100 meters
with significantly higher precision than earlier work. He has devised a new
class of torsion pendulum detector designed specifically to provide high
sensitivity to deviations from Newtonian gravity. Special care has gone into the
experimental design to measure and remove systematic error sources due to
gravity gradients. The experimental site on the Hanford DOE reservation will be
constructed by Battelle Northwest Laboratories as an extension of their
involvement with gravitation physics through the LIGO project. Departure's from
Newton's description of gravity are not expected to be seen. Nevertheless, these
experiments will set sensitive limits to the strengths and ranges of possible
fundamental non gravitational forces which might act on electrically neutral
matter. ***
