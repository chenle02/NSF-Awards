This award uses funds to help obtain a 130,000-year high-resolution record of
climate from speleothems in the mid-continent of North America. The primary
field site, Crevice Cave, Missouri, was located south of the former Laurentide
Ice Sheet during the past interglacial-glacial cycle. The researchers
hypothesize that the site is well situated to record changes in mid-continent
climate, global climate variability, and vegetation changes during interglacial-
glacial cycles. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Previous studies by the researchers
indicate that speleothems from Crevice Cave have grown continuously over tens of
thousands of years. The researchers expect to produce a high-resolution stable
isotope record, dated by the Thorium-230 technique, from the North American mid-
continent covering most of the last interglacial-glacial cycle.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide a unique educational experience
for graduate and undergraduate students and will help improve our knowledge of
Holocene climate variability of North America from a new paleoclimate data
archive.
