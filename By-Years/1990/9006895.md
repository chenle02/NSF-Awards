This research investigates localized etching phenomena which occur in metals
and nonmetals. The program explores the factors that determine where etch pits
initiate and how they grow. For instance, in aluminum and some other metals etch
pits can exhibit oxide passivation at their sidewalls; this leads to etching of
deep micron-sized cavities with constant sidewall widths. Sites of pitting are
correlated with surface composition profiles determined by scanning transmission
electron microscopy. Important variables that are controlled through systematic
processing include dislocation substructure, impurity segregation, and vacancy
concentration. The model system selected for these studies is aluminum etched in
chloride solutions. The ultimate goal is to use the information on etch pit
initiation gained from this research to preprogram specific patterns of etch
pitting on metal surfaces.
