During the last several years, there has been growing interest in studying how
humans solve difficult optimization problems. The common feature of these tasks
is an enormous search space. Prior research on human problem solving was based
on two key assumptions: (i) that search through a problem space is a key element
in solving problems, and (ii) that human thinking and problem solving are
suboptimal. Recent results obtained independently in three laboratories have
demonstrated the fundamental inadequacy of these two assumptions. It has been
shown that humans produce optimal, or near-optimal solutions to difficult
optimization tasks by performing minimal amounts of search. Existing decision
research paradigms are not able to account for this sort of result; some new
approaches are needed. For example, it appears that the mental representation of
a problem is a key to peoples' effectiveness in solving difficult optimization
problem, but mental representation is not much studied in current decision
research.

We will hold a three-day workshop where 15-20 scientists (psychologists and
computer scientists working on optimization) from the United States, Canada,
Australia, and Europe will discuss the current status of the field, future
directions and ideas for collaborative work. The workshop will help establish a
framework for research in this area over the coming decade and will also provide
delegates the opportunity to discuss potential applications of recent findings
about optimization by humans.
