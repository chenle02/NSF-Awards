String Theory has emerged as a leading candidate for a quantum theory of
gravity&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the interplay between geometry and
string theory, focusing on how the geometry of spacetime determines the physics
observed in the universe. The problem to be investigates is how to obtain N=1
supersymmetric string vacua when one compactifies 10 dimensional string theory
or 11 dimensional M theory. Particular attention will be given to how
singularities in the spaces spanning the extra special dimensions affect the
physics of our 4-dimensional world. It is hoped that an understanding of the
hierarchy of mass and length scales will naturally occur in this description.
Cosmological singularities relevant to the big bang will also be investigated.
