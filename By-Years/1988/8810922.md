This ROW Career Advancement Award will help the investigator to initiate a new
research program in yeast molecular genetics. As a first step, the yeast gene
for glutathione reductase will be cloned. Once cloned, the gene will be used to
examine the role and regulation of glutathione reduction in yeast biology. The
cloned gene will be subjected to site directed mutagenesis for a determination
of regulatory domains. This work will provide a genetic analysis of an important
aspect of cellular metabolism and growth. Yeast should be an excellent model
system for the planned genetic analysis.
