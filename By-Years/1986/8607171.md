This is Phase II of research solicited under the Small Business Research.
Titanium based alloys are prime candidates for orthopedic implants due to their
excellent corrosion resistance, high fatigue strength, low density,
biocompatibility, and most importantly low modulus of elasticity. However, the
only undesirable feature of these alloys is their poor wear resistance. Results
of experiments undertaken in Phase I study clearly shows that the ion
implantation process is an effective method for improving the wear resistance of
Titanium Alloy (Ti-6A1-4V) for prothesis. The ion implantation process
substantially reduces the wear of the mating ultra high-molecular weight
polyetholene (UHMWPE) surface on which the prosthesis articulates. The objective
of Phase II is: to understand the fundamentals of the ion beam interaction with
titanium; to optimize implantation parameter for maximum hardness; to
investigate fatigue and corrosion improvement of the ion implanted samples.
Johnson & Johnson Orthopedic Divisions in the process of entering into an
agreement with Spire Corporation to use ion implantation for surface treatment
of titanium devices. This research can lead directly to a process for
commercialization. The facilities of the organization are adequate to support
the research. An award for $179,599 in support of a two-year program is
recommended.
