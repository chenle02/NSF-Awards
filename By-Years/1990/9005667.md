This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the
subfield of electroanalytical chemistry. Professor Anson will study the
electrical properties of conducting polymers on electrode surfaces using a
variety of electrochemical methods together with complementary measurements of
mass and surface morphology. This research will involve several different
projects all involving chemically modified electrodes. A quartz crystal
microbalance will be used to quantify changes in mass during electrochemical
experiments involving explusion and uptake of ions. Scanning electrochemical
microscopy will be used to determine the surface features of active redox sites.
This research will contribute to the development and understanding of
electrocatalytic systems.
