This research concerns automorphism groups of rings and more generally, the
actions of Hopf algebras. The principal investigator will examine those
automorphisms of a ring which become inner on the two-sided quotient ring of the
ring, as well as the generalized Picard group. Non-abelian extensions of Hopf
algebras will also be considered. This research is in the general area of
noncommutative ring theory. It concerns the actions of Hopf algebras. This line
of study is motivated in part by the study of group rings and representations of
an affine algebraic group. In both of these cases the underlying coalgebra is
commutative. This research will endeavor to remove the commutativity
restriction.
