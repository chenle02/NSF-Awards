Partial support is provided to the Tulane University to acquire a 300-MHz, wide-
bore, solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer for on-going
research of 10 faculty members and 42 postdoctoral fellows and
graduate/undergraduate students in the Departments of Chemistry and Chemical
Engineering. The existing NMR instruments at this University have no solid-state
capability. Solid-state spectroscopy has become an essential tool for the
structural characterization and dynamic study of solid-state materials important
to chemistry, chemical engineering, and materials science. Accordingly, the
purchase of this instrument will enhance the analytical instrumentation
capability of two Departments and will bring significant new capability for the
characterization of bulk crystalline and glassy materials. The major users will
employ solid-state NMR for the investigation of polymeric (biological, organic
and inorganic), ceramic, and zeolitic materials. The instrument will also be
used in the support of existing research involving industrial-university
collaborations.
