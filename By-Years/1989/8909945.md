The subject of this proposal, the English Only Movement, has shown rapid growth
in membership and influence over the last ten years. The proposed work involves
some exploratory analyses of conditions fostering political movements generally
and this movement in particular. The data under analysis consist of six exit
polls taken in Texas and California. Also to be undertaken are content analyses
of a growing collection of media materials about this movement and additional
interviews with its leadership. This proposed work will significantly extend the
author's previous work on language cleavage, interethnic group conflict and
education in countries with multi-lingual populations.
