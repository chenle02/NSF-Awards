McCullough will continue to work on structure and mappings of three-dimensional
manifolds. In individual projects, or joint projects with off-campus
mathematicians, he will work on the mapping class groups and diffeomorphism
groups of 3-manifolds. Techniques will be drawn from several areas, including
combinatorical topology, hyperbolic geometry, and combinatorial group theory.
3-manifolds are particularly important objects to understand, since we live in a
3-dimensional universe.
