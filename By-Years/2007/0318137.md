EAR-0318137&lt;br/&gt;Peucker-Ehrenbrink&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal
requests technician support for Research Specialist Lary Ball, the manager of
the ICPMS Facility at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and primary
operator of the ThermoFinnigan NEPTUNE multicollector ICPMS. Lary Ball
supervises Research Associate David Schneider and Senior Research Assistant Scot
Birdwhistell, who are responsible for the routine operation of the ELEMENT2, a
single collector ICPMS. Lary Ball has two decades of ICP experience with optical
and sector-field instruments. He was involved in establishing the WHOI ICP
Facility in 1997 and has been instrumental in developing it into a well-
operated, productive and open facility with a broad in-house and external user
base. His expertise in ICP spectrometers, mechanical and electronic skills,
aptitude for technical solutions to analytical problems combined with his
interpersonal skills make him an ideal facility manager. This proposal is aimed
at fostering the development of critical analytical protocols (Li, Cl, Mg, Ca,
Fe, Sr, Cd, Nd, Hf, Os, Pb, Th, U) on the NEPTUNE, through support of Lary Ball,
so the NEPTUNE facility can become self-sustaining in the future with a diverse
user base driven by a broad range of new analytical platforms. Support for a
full-time technician position will have broader impacts by introducing students,
post-docs and guest scientists to state-of-the-art instrumentation, thereby
mitigating the "black box" mentality that may overwhelm the geochemistry
community with abundant isotope data of questionable quality. Lary Ball will be
intimately involved in training users on the NEPTUNE. He will participate in the
dissemination of the "tricks-of-the-trade" through a web-based MC-ICPMS user
group, analogous to the very effective on-line ELEMENT user group. Development
and timely publication of new analytical protocols will benefit a broad and
diverse user base at WHOI and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
