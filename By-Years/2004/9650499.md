We are developing a prototype system for social science research methods
instruction in a virtual laboratory environment. The lab is designed to address
a number of common problems in teaching social science research methods to
undergraduates: student motivation, access to learning and methods software, the
integration of all stages of the research process into methods courses, and the
limited variety of research experiences available. The virtual lab, which we
call the Virtual Institute for Social Science Research (VISSR), is used by
social science students as a distributive computing (client-server) application
that provides integrated access to essential tutorials, basic data collection
and analysis routines, and, perhaps more important, live interaction with others
over networks and the Internet. Once developed, the client-server software
bundle will be made available over the Internet, as well as from other media.
