This project is a seven day international conference in Game Theory and its
applications which will be held at Ohio State University in June of 1987. The
conference will bring together leading game theorists from throughout the world
to discuss recent developments and directions for future research in the field.
In addition, representatives from the social, behavioral and economic sciences
and from evolutionary biology and computer science, will be invited to address
current applications of game theory in their respective areas. The conference
will deal with issues like repeated games with or without discounting, games
with incomplete information, value of information, bounded rationality,
refinements of the Nash equilibrium concept, and application of the above to
imperfect competition and to industrial organization. The conference will also
deal with cooperative games and will mainly focus on axiomatizations of several
central solution concepts, such as Aumann's recent axiomatization of the Shapley
value to the non-side-payment games and Peleg's recent axiomatization of the
core corresponding for the non-side-payment games
