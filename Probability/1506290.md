Interacting particle systems originate from mathematical physics, but are now
used in a number of areas in applied mathematics. Among others, they can be used
to model phenomena such as capital distribution in equity markets, fluid
dynamics, stability of queueing networks, and traffic flow. The main goal of
this project is to obtain a better mathematical understanding of interacting
particle systems and to relate them to other mathematical objects, including
partial differential equations, random matrices, random polymers, random Young
tableaux, and symmetric functions. Such detailed mathematical analysis would
provide new information on the applicability of interacting particle systems as
mathematical models within the fields described above, as well as on their
limitations. In addition, with the mathematics of interacting particle systems
being on the interface of probability theory, partial differential equations,
and representation theory, the proposed research is expected to unveil
connections between these areas of mathematics. Such connections are of great
interest as they allow one to combine tools from all these different areas in
future research.

More specifically, the PI intends to study interacting particle systems with
continuous state spaces in which the particle dynamics can be described by
interacting Brownian (or, more generally, diffusive) motions. Typically, such
systems are the continuous analogues of the more classical discrete interacting
particle systems. However, the continuity of the state space allows one to apply
methods of stochastic analysis to such systems and is natural due to the
continuous nature of the (stochastic) partial differential equations describing
the macroscopic behavior of interacting particle systems. In particular, the PI
intends to study systems in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, which
describes the microscopic dynamics behind the growth of random surfaces.
Examples of such systems include, among others, the Brownian totally asymmetric
simple exclusion process and the O'Connell-Yor semi-discrete polymer. In this
context one is particularly interested in the asymptotic behavior of the leading
particles and the spacings between them, and their investigation is a major part
of the proposed research.
