The objective of this research is to address issues of non-uniform information
structure in financial markets. Specifically, this research focuses on the
credit risk issue where a financial institution or a firm fails to honor a
financial contract, for instance, a bond issuing company being unable to repay
the agreed-upon amount of money at the bond's maturity date. The first step of
the research is to develop appropriate mathematical models and measurements for
the difference between partial information (held by ordinary investors) and
complete information (known to the firm's management). The second step is to
quantify how a varying knowledge of the firm affects the estimation of the
firm's default. Evaluation methodology will also be developed for pricing
corporate bonds using only limited public information of the firm. This
methodology will also be exploited to study the dependence among the default of
multiple firms. Finally, several mathematical models will be suggested and
explored for estimating the appropriate percentage to pay off for corporate bond
holders in the event of the firm's default. A successful completion of the
project will contribute to the theory of filtration, general theory of Markov
processes, and stochastic filtering. It will hopefully lead to a better
understanding and prediction of defaults, more efficient pricings for credit
derivatives with the incorporation of different information structures, and
consequently a more rational and efficient (credit) market
