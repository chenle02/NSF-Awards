9418236 Dalziel A recent hypothesis that the proto-Appalachian margin of
Laurentia rifted from the proto-Andean Margin of South america at the end of the
Precambrian, and that the Appalachian and Andean orogens were initially a single
mountain system resulting from Paleozoic Laurentia-Gondwana interaction, has
many far reaching implications. This project will test this hypothesis
principally by geologic and geochronologic study of poorly known but critical
basement rocks of the Andean Cordillera in northernmost Chile and a
paleomagnetic study of Cambrian, Ordovician, and Silurian Strata of the
northwest Argentine Precordillera. Results should increase understanding of the
origin and development of the Pacific margin of South America in addition to
testing the SWEAT hypothesis.
