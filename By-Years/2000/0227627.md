The Exploratorium will host an invitational three-day conference on best
practices in science exhibition development. At the conference practitioners
will identify best practices in conceiving, designing, managing and developing
science exhibitions. The conference will highlight current issues such as
responding to diversity, providing access to current science and balancing the
considerations of market and mission. The ideas and issues raised at this
conference will culminate in a publication for dissemination to the field that
includes conference proceedings as well as interviews with and essays by
practicing exhibition professionals&lt;br/&gt;
