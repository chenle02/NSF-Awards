In 1989 a long lasting earthquake swarm was detected near 60 degrees north on
the Reykjanes ridge. The area of the swarm has been mapped and imaged by SeaMARC
II and Hydrosweep in 1990, and suggests the presence of two apparent young lava
flows. During the summer of 1992 the Russian research vessel Keldysh with its
two deep-diving MIR submersibles will investigate, verify, and sample these two
flows. The award is to provide support for the principal investigator to
participate in the cruise.
