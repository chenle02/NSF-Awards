9509268 Spilhaus The Proposed activities will encourage and promote development
of regional cooperation in global change research through the System for
Research, Analysis and Training (START), a joint mechanism of the World Climate
Research Programme (WCRP); the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme
(IGBP); and the Human Dimensions (of Global Environmental Change) Program (HDP).
The proposed activities are addressed to development of a global network to
promote such research and development of regional data and information systems
in Asia and the Pacific and in Eastern Europe and Africa. Integrating scientific
issues will be: land use change; coastal zone processes and related land-ocean
interaction; terrestrial ecosystems; and impacts of climate change. Activities
will include: development of regional cooperative research programs and viable
agendas for such research, initiated primarily through scientific workshops and
planning meetings; development of integrated data bases and systems for exchange
of data and information, especially electronically; development of standards and
standard methods, technologies, and formats for collection, processing and
exchange of global change data; and promotion of regional and national capacity
building.
