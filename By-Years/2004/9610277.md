The focus of this research is the development of direct metal-catalyzed
amination reactions. Goals of the present work include probing the mechanism and
synthetic scope of Fe-catalyzed amination and the development of
enantioselective reactions via the use of chiral iron complexes. The general
reactivity of Fe-, Ru- and Al-azodioxide complexes will be explored and selected
metal-imido complexes, L2M(=NR)2 (M=Cr,Mo,W) will be evaluated as potential
amination agents and catalysts. Investigation of novel metal-promoted allylic
aminations using nitroalkanes as aminating agents will also be carried out. With
this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
Kenneth M. Nicholas of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Oklahoma. Professor Nicholas will focus his work on developing new methods for
the direct introduction of nitrogen-based functional groups into unsaturated
carbon containing compounds. Nitrogen containing compounds form the building
blocks for the preparation of numerous pharmaceuticals , cationic surfactants
and even fabric softeners
