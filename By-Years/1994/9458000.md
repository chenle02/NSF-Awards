9458000 Barmak This research examines processing and characterization of
nanostructured metal films and functionally gradient coatings. New
electrochemically-based processing techniques for the fabrication of gradient
coatings is a major focus. Processing parameters are optimized based on
microstructural studies and the results of mechanical and corrosion tests. In
nanostructured metal films, there is a two-fold approach: one is the role of
grain structure and grain boundary diffusion in the reaction of thin metal
films; the other is an interdisciplinary investigation on grain boundary
segregation in nanostructured magnetic films for thin film storage media in
collaboration with IBM. Several undergraduate projects will be condensed and set
up as laboratory experiments for the senior undergraduate/introductory graduate
level course entitled; "Metal Films and Coatings: Processing, Structure and
Properties", which was recently introduced into the curriculum. %%%
Nanostructured metal films continue to bring about major advances in the
microelectronics and information storage technologies. Functionally gradient
materials, as thermal barrier coatings in engine components, present a
significant potential for future gas turbine design for power generation. ***
