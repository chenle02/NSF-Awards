This research examines equilibrium selection in infinitely repeated games
played by boundedly rational agents. The decision rules used by these players
will be determined by an evolutionary process in which successful rules
proliferate while unsuccessful rules die. The project first develops a model of
boundedly rational players, building on recent work using finite automata. A
dynamic evolutionary process will then be constructed, with particular attention
devoted to the fact that with conventional definitions, evolutionarily stable
strategies do not exist in repeated games. The research will then examine the
limiting outcomes of this evolutionary process, which will embody both rules for
action and rules for learning from experience during the game. Finally, the
robustness of the results, especially to different specifications of
environmental "trembles," will be explored. The effectiveness of game theory is
limited by the "folk theorem," which established that in repeated games,
virtually anything can be an equilibrium. The significance of the proposed
research lies in its potential to yield game-theoretic predictions for repeated
games, making game theory a more powerful analytical tool for a wide class of
applications. In particular, the research should shed light on the evolution of
learning rules among boundedly rational agents.
