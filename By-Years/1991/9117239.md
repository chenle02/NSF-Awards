Detailed mapping and sampling of the lowermost volcanics of the Blosseville
Coast succession were undertaken by the PI and student in 1989. This material,
supplemented by samples from the University of Copenhagen and Greenland
Geological Survey collections, provides the framework for these detailed
geochemical and experimental studies. The plan is to conduct major and trace
element analyses of whole rock samples, microprobe studies of mineral phases,
and Sr, Nd and Pb isotope analyses of selected whole rocks and pyroxene
separates to establish temporal changes in magma composition during the
transition from continental rifting to oceanic spreading. Complementary
experiments are proposed to characterize the compositional relations for "damp"
melting of mantle lherzolite and to define the liquid line-of-descent of
parental magmas for Blosseville Coast basalts. These geochemical and
experimental results will form the basis for modelling East Greenland basalt
petrogenesis and for an evaluation of proposed physical models of early rifting
in the North Atlantic.
