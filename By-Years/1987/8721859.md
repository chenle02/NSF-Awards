Professor Field's first goal in this project is to clarify the content and
methodological function of the doctrine of physicalism. This doctrine has played
an important methodological role in guiding science, but exactly how to
formulate it is a difficult question. It is also an important one, not only
because of the importance of understanding this aspect of scientific methodology
for its own sake but also because the answer one gives to it makes a real
difference to how one approaches certain subjects. One of the more difficult
subjects which philosophers consider is intentional psychology whose status and
methods are very much in dispute. A related goal for Professor Field is to
clarify the explanatory role of talk content or truth conditions in intentional
psychology. There appear to be some difficulties in achieving for intentional
psychology the same high physicalist standards that we demand for other
sciences. So Professor Field will examine whether the explanatory role of
content or truth conditions might be so different from the role of the typical
notions of the other special sciences that those high standards might be
inappropriate to content or truth conditions. Even if the answer is 'no', the
investigation should shed light on how to reconcile intentional psychology with
physicalism. If that can be done, it will remove the motive that some have had
for trying to do without the use of intentional talk in psychological
explanation.
