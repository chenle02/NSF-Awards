Residential networks lack empirical information about service outages and
reliability. The absence of clear information, coupled with the relative
inexperience of ordinary users combines to hide the sources of connectivity and
performance problems. The goal of this proposal is to provide external
measurement of outages in residential Internet connections, empirically
determining the reliability of different providers and technologies, and
recording outage information suitable for diagnosis. Although some projects
instrument home networks from within the home, this work looks from the outside,
searching for rare events across many more networks and countries for
comparisons. This work addresses two key challenges in measuring network
reliability from the outside. The first important problem is to determine
whether address changes are actually the cause for a network device becoming
unreachable to external measurement. The second key problem is in separating
individual failures from other failures. For example, with an approaching storm,
many users may disable their equipment to avoid lightning damage, but with a
passing storm, an outage may affect many users at once. Engineering the
measurement infrastructure to adapt to these events and identify simultaneous
outages will permit classifying outages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reliable networks
are particularly important as users transition away from dedicated landlines
toward voice-over-IP, while still needing the ability to make emergency calls,
particularly during events that challenge networks such as earthquakes and
severe weather. Predicting reliability permits informed decision-making about
migrating to new network technologies--concretely, whether removing conventional
wired lines is safe.&lt;br/&gt;Datasets from this research will be public and we
will maintain a website that presents Internet outage data in a manner that is
accessible by the general public.
