The process by which individuals come to form self conceptions is one which
social psychologists have long sought to understand. Research has shown that
there is often a discrepancy between self.appraisal and appraisal by others.
This discrepancy can provide an individual with the possibility of changing
his/her self appraisal. This research will look at the social psychological
concommitants of discrepant self appraisals. These studies will look at
individuals in a transition state, entry into college, when changes are expected
to occur in self.perception and perception of others. Data will be gathered
relating to self appraisals in academic and social domains, appraisals of the
students by others, and objective measures of achievement. This research will
help us understand why and how some individuals accomplish the transition with
relative ease and success while others do not.
