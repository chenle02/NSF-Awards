This work will conduct a survey of nearby low-mass stars and Brown Dwarfs using
the Pan-STARRS 1 survey. This will provide a census of kinematically-selected
high-velocity low-mass stars and substellar objects, including parallaxes,
spectral type classifications and luminosity functions of several hundred low-
mass objects within 25 parsecs of the Sun.

Brown Dwarfs are substellar objects which have more mass than planets, but not
enough mass to sustain hydrogen fusion in their cores. These and other low-mass
stellar objects, such as M-dwarfs, are very poorly understood, yet may play
important roles for understanding star and planet formation. Many of the objects
discovered in the solar neighborhood by this study will be prime targets for
searches of exoplanets in habitable zones, regions where conditions are right
for water to exist in the liquid form. The team will use telescopes in Hawaii
(Pan-STARRS 1, CFHT, UH 88?, IRTF, Gemini) to obtain photometry and spectroscopy
at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. This work will involve the
participation of graduate and undergraduate students, who will be trained in
scientific research, including data-mining techniques. techniques.
