This action is to help support the travel costs of fourteen U.S. scientists so
that they may present scientific papers at an international conference which
focuses on neural mechanisms of head and neck movements. The meeting will be
held in Paris, France and will be attended by leading scientists in the fields
of eye movement physiology, biomechanics, rototics, embryology, evolution, and
comparative aspects of the head.neck movement systems. By bringing together this
diverse group of scientists, more opportunities will be available for
cross.fertilization of scientific fields. This planned gathering should enlarge
the pool of scientists interested in head movement control and establish a
conceptual and collaborative umbrella.
