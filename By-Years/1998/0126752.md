Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates a
shift in the introductory digital systems course from the current focus on gate
level design to a HDL (hardware description language), register-transfer level
focus. The emphasis is placed on the fundamentals of current design
methodologies and skills to utilize the latest high-density programmable devices
and synthesis software tools. The PI is developing a textbook, a set of
experiments, and a web site to provide a detailed coverage of the concepts,
principles, and practices of register-transfer level design. Student surveys
provide feedback on the content, organization, continuity of topics, and level
of difficulty. Course instructors in the senior design course will assess the
students' digital circuit design abilities and compare them to those of earlier
students who had a traditional digital systems course. The PI is planning to
present papers at education-oriented conferences, to prepare manuscripts for
education journals, and to post complete lecture slide, class projects, and
laboratory experiments on his web site to supplement the material in the
developed textbook. &lt;br/&gt;
