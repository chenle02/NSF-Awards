For approximately nine months of each year, the waters of arctic lakes are under
ice. The PI proposes to carry out time series studies: 1) to quantify physical
controls on under ice thermal structure and circulation, mixing of snow melt
waters, mixing during spring and fall, 2) to quantify respiration rates in
arctic lakes of differing morphology and on different geological substrates, and
3) to illustrate the linkages and feedbacks between these physical and
biogeochemical processes.

Measurements will include temperature and conductivity, meteorology, sediment
temperatures, ice thickness, snow cover, and respiration with newly developed
oxygen and pCO2 sensors.

Lakes cover nearly half the land surface area in some parts of the Arctic. As
such, they are expected to have a significant impact on the atmospheric bottom
boundary layer and air-land gas exchange regionally. This project will begin to
provide the process understanding necessary to parameterize Arctic system models
on regional scales.
