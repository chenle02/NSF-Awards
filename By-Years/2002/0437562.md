The East Coast Computer Algebra Day, ECCAD'2004, meeting, will be held at
Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario on Saturday May 8, 2004. The
meeting is the eleventh of the series. ECCAD meetings have been held annually
since 1994 at a variety of US East Coast locations. We estimate a turnout of
about 100 participants from the Computer Algebra research community, doing
either theoretical research or important applications in science and
engineering. This year we expect some participants from the high performance
computing research community as well, since recently there has been a vivid
interest on computer algebra applications using high-performance computing.
ECCAD'2004 will be preceded by a two-day workshop at the University of Waterloo
in Waterloo, Ontario, funded by the Fields Institute. Drawing on similar
experiences from previous years, we expect an increase in the number of
participants, because of the collocation of the two events. Participants will
come mainly from the eastern half of North America and especially from the East
Coast of the United States. The meeting will be comprised of three invited talks
and contributed poster and software demonstration sessions, covering all aspects
of computer algebra: theoretical research, software and applications.
