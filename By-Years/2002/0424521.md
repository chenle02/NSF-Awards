Structural and Functional Neuroanatomy of Language
Laterality&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With National
Science Foundation support, Drs. Eckert and Binder and colleagues will conduct a
two-year investigation of the brain specialization for language. Most people are
dependent on brain areas in the left hemisphere to process language. Only rarely
is the right hemisphere essential for understanding or producing language. The
reasons for this left-hemisphere language dominance remain unexplained. One
popular explanation suggests that larger left hemisphere language-related areas,
compared to the right hemisphere, predispose language to organize in the left
hemisphere. Superior verbal ability may stem from this structural and functional
organization. The present research project tests this explanation for language
organization, as well as an alternative explanation that proposes that left
hemisphere language-related areas are not the basis for language dominance, but
interact with language dominance to predict verbal ability. Functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging and the intracarotid anesthetization procedure will be used to
assess language laterality in normal (functional imaging only) and epilepsy
subjects. Anatomical data will be collected from MRI scans. This study will be
the first to directly test hypotheses about the relation between language,
anatomical asymmetries, and cognition. In addition, this study will increase
understanding of functional imaging results by examining how individual
variation in neuroanatomy influences individual variability in functional
imaging patterns of activation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
