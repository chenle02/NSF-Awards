The PI will organize intense eight week summer research experiences in number
theory for 8 undergraduates (at least half women) in the summer of 2009, 2010,
and 2011 in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin at
Madison. The students will be selected by a nationwide
search.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After one week of introductory lectures, the
students will be divided into teams. The presiding REU staff will consist of two
team leaders (the PI and one postdoc), and two Research Assistants (i.e.
advanced PhD students). The REU program aims to attract talented undergraduate
students to careers in the mathematical sciences. It will also be a fundamental
catalyst towards further establishing a permanent tradition of mentoring young
mathematicians in teaching and research at Wisconsin. This program will attract
new generations of students to science and mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;
