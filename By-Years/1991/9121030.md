Dr. Pramanik will develop a data management system for the U.S. Arabidopsis
Biological Resource Center located at Ohio State University, which is supported
under DIR 9113224. The center will collect, maintain, and distribute Arabidopsis
seeds and other biological resources such as RFLP markers and YAC libraries. An
advisory committee consisting of active Arabidopsis researchers will advise the
center on its policy and overall operation. The Center also provides information
associated with the resources it maintains, including genetic data, biological
history, and bibliography. The research community will have access to this
information either electronically or via regularly published catalogues. The
objective of this award is to develop necessary databases and software for the
information service aspect of the Center. The data management system to be
developed will be flexible enough to allow additions and modifications to suit
the changing needs of the research community. Initially, a user survey will be
carried out in collaboration with the International Plant Molecular Biology
Society. Continued input from the users will be sought throughout the life of
the project. Dr. Pramanik plans to coordinate his efforts with similar efforts
by other genome informatics research groups in general and by the USDA plant
genome informatics group in particular.
