The "1990 Summer Study on High Energy Physics Research Directions for the
Decade" was held in Snowmass, Colorado; June 25 - July 13, 1990. The Division of
Particles and Fields of the American Physical Society organized the study and
about 520 participants attended. This action will provide funds for publication
of the proceedings and post conferences expenses. This study followed four
highly successful summer studies held at Snowmass, Colorado, in 1982, 1984, 1986
and 1988. The 1990 summer study included physics at existing and anticipated
hadron-hadron, e+e- and ep colliders; physics at fixed target energies; the
physics potential of possible new facilities, such as B factories; non
accelerator based physics; accelerator and detector initiatives; and the physics
and technical ingredients of the initial SSC experimental program.
