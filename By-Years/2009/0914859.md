The Mathematics Department of the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP)
has had five years of very productive experience in mathematics with the Summer
Program in Research and Learning (SPIRAL). SPIRAL is the recipient of an award
from the American Mathematical Society (Programs That Make a Difference, April,
2008) and plays an important role in increasing the inclusion of
underrepresented groups into the mathematics
profession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from NSF and NSA we have formed a
partnership with a group of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs)
to bring undergraduate students to UMCP for a six week program of instruction,
research and enrichment. We provide instruction in advanced mathematics, we
engage in research that can be, and has been, extended significantly beyond the
six week program, and we have visits and presentations with agencies that employ
significant mathematics in their work. Examples of the latter would be the
National Security Agency (NSA) and the National Institute for Standards and
Technology (NIST). We provide the students with detailed information about
graduate programs and discussions with our current graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have an active mentoring program during this
six week session. The mentors are graduate students in our mathematics
department, which includes SPIRAL participants from previous years. This
mentoring is particularly important and well-received by the participants.
Additionally, the Mathematics Department at UMCP has been supporting, on a
volunteer basis, tutoring and outreach to area middle schools serving
minorities. We are expanding this program through the SPIRAL grant.
