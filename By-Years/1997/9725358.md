9725358 Ben-Zion This research involves the study of the simultaneous evolution
of regional seismicity, aseismic deformation, and the network of fault systems
sustaining the deformation in a continuation of prior 3-D simulations. The goal
is to establish a physical basis for understanding spatio-temporal patterns of
regional earthquakes, and the interrelations between different modes of
deformation, structural properties of faults, and rheological properties of the
brittle crust and its ductile surroundings. The work will employ a model
incorporating deformation- and time-dependent damage rheology in a structure
consisting of a layered elastic/viscoelastic half- space. The work will attempt
to map in parameter space the basic types of crustal response that are possible
for different structural and rheological properties, understand the essential
characteristics of the different responses, and examine the possibility of
earthquake prediction based on seismicity patterns. This research is a component
of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
