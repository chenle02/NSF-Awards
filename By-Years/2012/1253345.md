The past decade has seen a growing reliance on data driven technologies,
including recommendation systems, targeted advertising, and search
personalization. This growth in big data has made data privacy into a central
concern. The central question raised is: how can we continue to extract useful
information from large datasets, while provably protecting some measure of
privacy for the individuals contained in these
datasets?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research centers around advancing the state
of the art in privacy preserving data analysis. It specifically has several
themes: (1) Exploiting structure in the private data being analyzed, as well as
the classes of queries used in the analysis to give computationally efficient
algorithms for private data analysis. (2) Deepening the connections between
private data analysis and machine learning theory. (3) Relaxing the adversarial
collusion model implicit in most work on the foundations of data privacy, and
(4) applying the tools of differential privacy to usefully exploit and analyze
noise in other algorithmic settings. To ensure the broad impact of this
research, this project includes substantial outreach activities, including
workshop organization, course development, and the development of a textbook and
other educational materials.
