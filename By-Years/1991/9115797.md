Today, tools are needed to support and promote the use of formalisms in
designing software interfaces concurrent algorithms, and digital circuits. Such
tools must provide assistance with assessing the semantic content of designs,
not just with their syntax. This project involves development of one such tool,
the Larch Prover (LP). Current applications of LP include debugging Larch
specifications, reasoning about circuit designs, and reasoning about concurrent
algorithms. The project will continue developing LP in support of these and
other applications, e.g., reasoning about specification in Larch and other
specification languages, making use of specifications in optimizing compilers,
and verifying locking levels in Modula-3. The project will develop front ends to
serve as interfaces between these applications and LP. It will also enhance LP
to serve better as a back end for such applications. Projected enhancements to
LP include more general quantification, additional inference mechanisms
(congruence closure, decision procedures for linear orders), and further
assistance for handling complex proofs ( scoping, polymorphism, proof
management). These enhancements will be driven by the demands of applications:
they will be made within a context that is oriented towards debugging proofs and
that emphasizes ease of interaction, good performance, proof strategies based on
simplification, and replayable proof scripts.
