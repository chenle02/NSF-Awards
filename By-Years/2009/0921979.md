(Public Law 111-5).

This project will improve our ability to predict the access of solar energetic
protons to Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere. Solar energetic particle (SEP)
events have strong space weather impacts and can change the radiation
environment in the radiation belts and can modify the ionosphere. The project
will make use of state-of-the-art empirical models of Earth's magnetic field as
well as physics-based models of the coupled ionosphere and magnetosphere. The
project will compare the different models with ground-based observations to
determine the errors incurred by the various assumptions made by the different
models. The project will involve research done by undergraduate students.
