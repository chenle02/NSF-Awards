This project investigates three questions in general relativity: (i) The
stability of solutions of electromagnetic and linearized gravitational waves in
a Kerr (rotating) black hole background metric; i.e., solutions of the Cauchy
problem for these partial differential equations with compactly supported
initial data outside of the event horizon of the black hole. These stability
results will add credibility to the use of the Kerr metric in detailed
astrophysical models. (ii) Rigorous justification of the Penrose process for the
extraction of energy from a rotating black hole. (iii) Incorporation of Guth's
theory of inflation into the principal investigator's cosmological model.

Black holes have interested both physicists and mathematicians since Einstein
proposed his theory of general relativity in 1915. They have been studied
intensively, but many questions remain unanswered. This project explores three
important questions. It investigates the stability of black holes under
electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations. Such understanding is of great
importance for predicting the nature of gravitational radiation originating in
outer space. The stability problem will be considered in a manner parallel to
the observations made by astronomers, leading to a better theoretical
understanding of numerical modeling of solutions of Einstein's equations. The
project also aims to put the question of extracting energy from a rotating black
hole on a firm theoretical basis. The extraction of energy from a rotating black
hole was proposed in 1968, but until recently the question was far too difficult
to be studied. Finally, the project studies some questions in astrophysics
dealing with cosmology and supernova explosions; these explosions of enormously
dense massive stars undergoing gravitational collapse are responsible for
seeding the universe with heavy elements, including carbon and iron.
