9729831 Cochran The proposal is not well written. The goals as stated in the
abstract and introduction suggest circular reasoning and tests that cannot be
done. On page 6, however, there is a clear statement that they will be testing
the assumption that axial depth &amp;/or MBS can be used as a proxy for crustal
thickness. We have been concerned with the use of gravity data as a proxy for
crustal thickness, and this work will test that proxy. It will not be a
definitive test since there is still the possibility of temporal changes in
crustal thickness, but it will be a systematic study of the problem. We agree
with the panel and recommend a one-year award.
