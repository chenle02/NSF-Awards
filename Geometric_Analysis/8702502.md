Marsden is one of the most active and productive workers in the field of
symplectic geometry and dynamical systems. In joint work with many
collaborators, he has developed very general differential geometric procedures
for analyzing Hamiltonian systems with symmetry groups, and has applied these
general ideas to an impressive range of physically interesting systems. Some
outstanding characteristics of this work are the unified geometric and Lie
theoretic framework it provides, the detailed working out of examples, and its
applicability to field theories where one has infinite dimensional symmetry
groups. Marsden and his collaborators at Berkeley and Arizona will carry out
research into the following topics and their interconnections: Poisson geometry
and the bundle picture; transverse structures, Lie algebras and singularities;
differential equations in the complex domain; algebraic Poisson structures;
geometry of bifurcations and normal forms of Hamiltonian systems; Hamiltonian
chaos; relativistic field theories; modulation theory; Kac-Moody Lie algebras
and integrable systems.
