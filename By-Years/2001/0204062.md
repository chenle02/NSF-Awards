This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2002. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "How much
influence do the collateral effects of selection have on natural levels of
genetic variation?" Genetic variance among populations, FST, is being measured
at multiple mapped loci from specific linkage groups in Silene latifolia. The
relationship between FST-values and genetic map distance is used to estimate the
differential effects of selection across the genome, elucidating the overall
effect of selection on population genetic structure.
