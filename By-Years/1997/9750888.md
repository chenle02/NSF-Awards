The equipment requested in this project will improve students' ability to
interpret electron microscope images and to increase their understanding of cell
and tissue ultrastructure. This will be achieved through simultaneous viewing of
electron microscope images projected or displayed on a TV monitor. Viewing in
teams or in small groups will also make possible increased collaborative
learning among the students. The project will thereby enhance the investigations
experience of the students by allowing them to focus more on the research
projects rather than on acquiring the interpretive skills. Though the project
will benefit primarily upper level undergraduate students, students in lower
level biology classes will also benefit. The equipment request is for a TV-
adapter which can transfer transmission electron microscope images via a CCD
camera to a high resolution monitor. The images displayed on the monitor can
then be viewed by several people simultaneously.
