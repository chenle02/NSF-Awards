This award provides one-half of the funds required to acquire a diesel-powered
four-wheel drive vehicle. The vehicle will be used by members of the Department
of Geology at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh for geological field work in
remote areas of Mexico and other areas where access is possible only with four-
wheel drive equipment. The University will provide the remaining 50% match for
the purchase and will also provide support for maintenance of the vehicle. The
field studies in Mexico are directed at interpreting the late Paleozoic and
early Mesozoic history of the southern margin of the North American continent
and are currently supported through the NSF Research in Undergraduate
Institutions program.
