9600016 Ellis Donald Ellis and John Ketterson of Northwestern University will
collaborate with workers at the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Fisicas (CBPF),
led by Elisa Baggio-Saitovitch. They will use state-of-the-art computational and
experimental techniques at each institution to model and perform in situ
experimental studies of the magnetic response of thin metallic films and
multilayers. The exceptional characteristics of synchrotron radiation will be
exploited to study the evolution of the overall magnetic response of thin
magnetic layers and multilayers as a function of their local and global
environment. As part of the investigation, the technique of synchrotron
Moessbauer spectroscopy will be developed and applied, perfecting a new and
speedy technique for materials science at large. This international
collaboration builds on over 10 years of cooperative effort and research, moving
through several phases of theoretical and experimental work. CBPF has in the
last few years received funding to build a Magnetic Film Laboratory, now
providing extensive capabilities for vapor deposition of ordered and amorphous
films, x-ray characterization, and Moessbauer, NMR and perturbed angular
correlation spectroscopy. ****
