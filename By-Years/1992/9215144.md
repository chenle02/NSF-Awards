This project supports a workshop for the member institutions of the Association
of Departments of Computer Science and Engineering at Minority Institutions
(ADMI). The workshop will concentrate on research and education issues in
computer science and engineering, including sessions designed to help initiate
research program, and improve instruction. An additional effort will be
undertaken by the organization to provide sessions, and support for a group of
individuals from Native American Institutions. The Computer Research Association
(CRA) will be an active partner in the program of the workshop.
