The quantum world is very different from the classical, everyday, world. The
mere act of measuring affects a quantum object so that applying feedback to
control such object is rather delicate. The researchers will investigate quantum
feedback on an experimental&lt;br/&gt;apparatus, Cavity QED, which has been
center to the development of quantum information science. The object of study is
the spontaneously generated coherence observed in a cavity QED system with two
polarization modes. We will look into ways to shield and protect the coherence
from disturbances while applying feedback, while we will also develop post-
selection protocols that help understand the disturbances affecting the
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One full time graduate student will be trained in
the area of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics with special focus on quantum
optics. The student will have ample exposure to leaders in the field that visit
the Joint Quantum Institute of the University of Maryland. There will be
undergraduates participating in the research effort during the academic year,
and in the summer. In conjunction with the Sociedad Mexicana de FÃ­sica, two
Mexican undergraduates will spend ten weeks in the laboratory. The results of
the group will be available on the web page of the JQI as well as in the one of
the group, with explanations for the general public. The students will give lab
tours to prospective undergraduate students as well as to the undergraduates
that take courses with the PI.
