Boston University will initiate a six-week, residential, Young Scholars project
in Physics and Engineering for 30 students in grades 11-12. Students participate
in research at laboratories affiliated with Boston University and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where they are placed during the summer
following their sophomore and junior years; this age group is chosen because of
its maturity and its ability to share the summer experience with fellow high
school students during their senior year. This program for high ability
secondary school students is coordinated by Boston University, where the
students will reside for the duration of the project. The object of this
Research Internship Program (RIP) is for the students to become aware of the
realities of a scientific career through involvement in research and exposure to
questions at the frontiers of knowledge, and to the methods and ideas used to
answer them. To this purpose each student is paired with a Preceptor, a person
actively engaged in research, and works with him or her in on-going research
problems. A series of weekly seminars provides a more global view of the
problems in science.
