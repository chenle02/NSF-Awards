The feasibility of extending the operation of highly sensitive resonant-based
gas sensors to elevated temperatures will be investigated. Towards this end, the
electrical, resonant and mass transport properties of langasite, a piezoelectric
material stable to elevated temperatures, will be characterized as functions of
temperature, oxygen partial pressure and cation composition. The defect model,
to be developed and based on these results, will be used to modify langasite in
order to maintain high Q values and compositional stability to elevated
temperatures thereby insuring high sensitivity. Means for isolating thermal and
stress cross effects will be investigated and implemented. Gas sensitive films
(PrxCe1-xO2-?, and ZnO) will be deposited on langasite by pulse laser deposition
with varying thickness and microstructure. Sensitivity and response time will be
correlated to film stoichiometry, thickness and grain morphology. Parallel
monitoring of film stoichiometry and resistivity with temperature and pO2 will
provide further insights into gas-solid interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bulk
and surface acoustic wave resonant devices exhibit exceptional sensitivity to a
wide range of chemical and biological species when coated with appropriate
species-sensitive films but are typically limited to room temperature operation.
In this program, the electrical and mass transport properties of langasite, a
piezoelectric material stable to elevated temperatures, are modeled and
investigated to elevated temperatures and in controlled atmospheres.
Understanding gained from these studies, will enable the operation of this
multifunctional resonant sensor platform to elevated temperatures and thereby
address the need for improved sensors in the transportation, industrial process
and energy industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was submitted in
response to the Dear Colleague Letter: Next Generation Chemical and Biological
Sensors and Sensing Systems [nsf 02-112].&lt;br/&gt;
