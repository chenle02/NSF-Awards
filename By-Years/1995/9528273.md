With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Streitwieser at the
University of California-Berkeley is to continue his studies on the reaction
dynamics of polar organometallic reagents. Through experimental as well as
theoretical chemistry, a more thorough understanding of the factors governing
the aggregation of these complexes and their relative reactivities will be
garnered. One of the major questions still confounding investigators in this
area is the state of reagent aggregation versus reactivity. This proposal
addresses this issue. Since these reagents are ubiquitous in organic synthesis,
an understanding that allows scientists to predict the reactivity with regard to
chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity would have significant impact on the use.
Synthetic organic chemistry which is responsible for new methodologies and
actual preparations of physiologically active compounds relies heavily on
specific reagents to effect certain organic transformations. Some of these
reagents are complex and have a variety of forms. Since the exact form affects
the efficiency of its reactivity, it is important to understand the factors
influencing these reagents. This proposed effort will address these issues with
regard to polar organometallic reagents.
