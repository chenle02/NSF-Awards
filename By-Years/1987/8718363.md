Several existing and new sets of observational data of Quasi- Stellar Objects
(QSOs) will be used to look for underlying trends affecting the QSO population
in general. The data will be used to probe the nature of the broad emission line
regions in QSOs. This work will include studies of the dependence of emission
line profiles and intensities on continuous luminosity and on radio power,
analysis of the profiles and intensities of weak emission lines which can only
be properly studied in narrow- lined QSOs, and studies of the relationship of
the broad absorption line QSOs to the general QSO population. New observations
will be obtained of some specific complete samples of QSOs so that these studies
can be pursued free of the effects of selection criteria which depend on
emission line strengths. The data will be used to try to understand the way that
the radiation is produced and emitted from these extragalactic objects which
appear starlike but are actually very distant and emit huge amounts of
radiation.
