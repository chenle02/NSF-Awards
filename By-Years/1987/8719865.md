This research will lead to the construction of a critically- verified
historical data base of snowfall, snow cover and snow water equivalent in the
United States for the last 100 years using the National Climatic Data Center
(NCDC) archives. The data base will be used to assess the capability of general
circulation models in the simulation of snow cover and snow- climatic
interactions and assess the utility of using snow records as indicators of
climatic change. The data base will be assembled at NCDC by the principal
investigator during the first year of the project, and analyzed in cooperation
with modelers during the second year. This research is important because snow is
a critical element of the earth's climate system. Climate models and empirical
studies suggest that snow anomalies are associated with synoptic and long-term
weather events and may play an important role in climate change. However, there
remain many unanswered questions regarding the variability of snow, the
representativeness of short-term empirical studies and the accuracy of the
modeling of snow-climate interactions which need to be addressed with a long-
term data base.
