This project is concerned with the spontaneous formation of periodic structures
in complex systems. Examples of such systems include bands of mussels in tidal
flats, bacterial aggregation patterns, and hexagonal or stripe patterns in
convection problems. Spatial patterns often arise due to the instability of a
simpler state. For example, in ecological or chemical applications an
equilibrium state may be destabilized due to the introduction of a previously
absent species. Initial states lying near this equilibrium state will evolve
towards a new profile and one would like to predict what this new state will be.
For spatially extended problems, this process involves the formation of moving
interfaces, known as invasion fronts, that move at a fixed speed and serve to
transition the unstable state to some other configuration. The objective is to
uncover the properties of a nonlinear system that lead to selection of a
particular invasion front and consequently the patterned state that is created
by that front. Transitions from unstable to stable states occur in many applied
contexts and this research will help inform scientists to formulate predictions
regarding, or even control over, the formation of complex spatiotemporal
patterns in those systems. The work has potential application via the role of
reaction-diffusion equations in modeling the generation of small scale
structures in nanotechnology and materials science. The mathematical focus of
the project is the study of pattern formation in systems of reaction-diffusion
equations in which periodic structures are created by invasion fronts. Several
specific systems of parabolic partial differential equations will be considered
with the aim of extracting general principles mediating wavespeed selection. The
project areas include the study of competition amongst patterns in reaction-
diffusion-advection equations arising in ecological and chemical applications,
coarsening modes in biological aggregation models of Keller-Segel type, and the
existence of fronts in coupled amplitude equations describing the emergence of
and competition between patterned states near a supercritical Turing
bifurcation. The project will require a variety of tools including linear
analysis, geometric singular perturbation theory, blow-up techniques, and
comparison principles. There are several innate challenges in regards to
describing pattern-forming fronts in systems of equations that will require
extensions of analytical techniques. For example, systems of equations can
support invasion fronts wherein different components invade at different speeds
for which no single fixed frame can capture the relevant dynamics.
