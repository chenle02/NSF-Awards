9505568 Mountain The PIs will map mass flow deposits in the upper 1.0 sec record
of sediments on the US continental rise between Blake Ridge and New England
seamounts. Single and multi-channel seismic profiles in existence will be used
to map vertical extend of mass flows. 3.5 kHz records will also be examined.
Buried canyons will also be mapped. Armed with improved awareness of the seismic
expression of mass-flow deposits, the PIs intend to extend their volumetric
measures of down-slope transport to the rise back to the Neogene time.
