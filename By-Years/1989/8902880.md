The goals of this project, called "Academic Institutional Memory" (AIM), are
to: refine a set of tools that encourage researchers to increase their use of
electronic information sources during research;incorporate machine learning
mechanisms that are capable of transforming these researchers' browsing
behaviors into self-organizing information structures; and analyze the
information structures built manually by the researchers and automatically by
the learning mechanism as "artifacts", created by the cultural process of
science. In addition to its contribution to machine learning and the philosophy
of science, this kind of theoretical analysis is necessary to understand how new
information retrieval tools can become part of the infra-structure coordinating
the activities of modern scientists. The work under this award will revolve
around three related themes: the development of a theory of science and
scientific activity as a cultural process; implementation of a prototype of the
AIM system as a data collection technology that will permit the testing of
hypotheses from the theory; and development of computational models that capture
the regularities predicted by the theory.
