This project studies the mechanical design process with the aim of developing a
design environment where functional and structural knowledge can be used to
create and edit detailed geometry. This involves the study of typical design
problems to identify natural operations on designs, the use of data
representation methods from the fields of artificial intelligence and geometric
modelling as a basis for the development of interactive methods for the
generation of designs from functional descriptions.
