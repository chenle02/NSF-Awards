Professor Robert Gordon, University of Illinois at Chicago, is supported by a
grant from The Physical Chemistry Program to perform experimental tests of
reaction rate theories. Dr. Gordon is making use of current state-of-the-art
molecular beam techniques to study reactions between very simple molecules at
the most fundamental level. The results gleaned from these experiments should
provide valuable tests of prevailing theories of chemical reactions at the
molecular level. Two extreme mass combinations will be studied in order to
reveal unusual dynamic effects and to test theoretical predictions. In one case
the transfer of a light atom (hydrogen) between two heavy partners (chlorine 35
and chlorine 37) will be studied, and in the other case the exchange of two
light partners (hydrogen and deuterium) in hydrogen chloride will be
investigated. Specific questions to be addressed include: the validity of the
transition state theory for treating these reactions; the contribution of
tunneling to the reaction rate; the structure in the energy dependence of the
reaction cross section; the effects of the attractive and repulsive features of
the potential energy surface.
