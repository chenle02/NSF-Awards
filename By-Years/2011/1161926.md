The research objective of this award is to understand the relationships and
interactions when combining additive and then subtractive direct manufacturing
techniques so that the sequential combination yields the advantages of both
production techniques without incurring significant disadvantages. Two specific
objectives are: 1) To identify the part geometry inaccuracy and shrinkage in
order to establish material allowance during additive processing, and 2) To
identify and create mathematical and physical models for setup to account for
location error due to the nature of direct metal fabrication surfaces.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;If successful, this work will provide a rapid capability
to make parts with complex freeform geometries as provided by function free-form
additive systems, while providing exacting tolerance control and material
properties, as provided by computer numerically controlled machining by using
these processes sequentially and automatically. This research will lead to a new
technology that would create service parts and prototypes for next-generation
complex mechanical part systems with the specified material properties, to the
exacting tolerances and advanced geometries as desired, and do so in an
automated manner with little or no human intervention required.
