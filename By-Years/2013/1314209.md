The world's oceans have taken up approximately 30% of the anthropogenic CO2
emissions since the beginning of the industrial revolution. The oceanic uptake
of CO2 is associated with a change in water chemistry that results in a decrease
of seawater pH and carbonate ion concentrations, commonly referred to as Ocean
Acidification. The availability of carbonate ions is crucial for marine
calcifying organisms to form their skeletons or shells that are made of
different crystalline forms of calcium carbonate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In spite
of the overwhelming global mean Ocean Acidification signal, which exceeds levels
of natural variability, both observational data and Earth System Models indicate
a considerable spatial variability of trends carbonate ion concentrations and
pH, which has not been fully understood. Elucidating the mechanisms determining
the regional characteristics of Ocean Acidification requires a concerted
modeling and data analysis effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a
team of researchers at the University of Hawaii to investigate the regional
patterns of current and future Ocean Acidification using a hierarchy of Earth
System Models. Process studies will focus on the effect of ocean currents,
mixing, winds, air-sea gas exchange on the spatial variability of the
biogeochemical responses to increasing CO2 concentrations. The project will
further provide important boundary conditions for near-shore numerical
assessments of the impacts of Ocean Acidification and ecosystems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outreach activities include the development of narrated
Ocean Acidification animations that can be shown on Science on the Sphere and
Magic Planet systems used by many science museums and universities across the
country.
