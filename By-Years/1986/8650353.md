The detector units of the x-ray diffraction and x-ray fluorescence instruments
in the Geology Department have been converted from out-of- date vacuum tube
electronics to solid state circuitry. This provides increased stability and
reliability so that these fundamental tools of geological study are used fully
in regular course work in mineralogy, geochemistry, petrology and sedimentary
petrography. In addition, the analytical potential of the x-ray fluorescence
unit has been enhanced by the addition of a dual-target tungsten-chromium x-ray
tube.
