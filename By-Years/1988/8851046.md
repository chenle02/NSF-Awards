Through a Lawrence Hall sponsored partnership, 151 high school teachers from 35
school districts in the San Francisco Bay area have had summer jobs in 40
industrial firms. From these experiences these science, mathematics, and
computer science teachers have carried a broader understanding of the
applications of modern science and mathematics back into their classroom
teaching. In 1986 an Industry Initiatives for Science and Mathematics Education
Academy of Fellows was established to promote further exploitation of their
industrial experience in Bay area classrooms. Through this project the Academy
teachers will develop and test instructional materials based on their summer
assignments in industry which they can use themselves and share with other
teachers, explore ways to form an electronic network between themselves, and
provide seminars which will carry university credit. The summer experiences in
industry have already proven valuable, but this project will explore ways to
enhance the value of such work experiences further through this variety of
continuing activities. Cost sharing by the partners will total 75% of the NSF
funding.
