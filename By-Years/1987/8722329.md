Banach space theory treats infinite-dimensional phenomena within the framework
of rigorous mathematics. It has historical connections to more concrete applied
subjects because, for instance, solutions to differential equations are often
conveniently thought of as inhabiting an appropriate Banach space. In physics,
one frequently encounters systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom which
must be modeled in Hilbert space, a special type of Banach space. Two
interesting things to do with a Banach space are to slice it (technically,
project it onto a complemented subspace) and to approximate it by finite
dimensional subspaces, in which one can so to speak draw pictures and do
geometry. The principal investigator for this project will work on a famous open
problem that asks what the slices of a certain standard Banach space look like,
and will investigate the geometry of finite-dimensional subspaces of Banach
spaces.
