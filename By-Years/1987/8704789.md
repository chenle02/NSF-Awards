An award for computing equipment is recommended, for use by the signal
processing group in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University
of Utah. This group consists of four faculty members and approximately twenty
graduate students. Current research projects include simulated neural networks,
communication networks, data compression of voice band data signals and images,
signal recovery and regularization, adaptive filters, and spectral estimation.
The computer system will consist of a deskside fileserver with floating point
accelerator board, high resolution monochrome monitor, and 16- channel
asynchronous line multiplexor. Repetitive calculations will be carried out in
parallel by the array processor, affording a great savings in computation time.
