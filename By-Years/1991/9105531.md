This research will study the three-dimensional anelastic structure of the
earth's mantle. Over three decades, the state of knowledge has progressed from
identifying qualitative variations in seismic wave attenuation across tectonic
features to models of upper mantle anelasticity from surface wave amplitudes.
The incorporation of body wave amplitudes here will extend sensitivity into the
lower mantle while the current abundance of, and efficient access to, seismic
data from IRIS increases the feasibility of near-global inversions for anelastic
structure in the entire mantle. The results will provide insights into mantle
dynamics and composition.
