9321094 Shellhamer This grant from the Organic Dynamics program supports the
work of Professor Dale Shellhamer at Point Loma Nazarene College who will
involve undergraduate students in the study of interhalogens XF (X= I,Br,Cl)
synthesized from a combination of various electrophilic reagents. The resulting
interhalogens will be added to a variety of unsaturated hydrocarbons with the
goal of elucidating the versatility and utility for XF in synthesis. Evidence
for the elusive cationic form of Xe-O will be sought. The synthesis of reagents
containing N-F bonds as mild fluorination reagents will be studied. This
research will enhance the understanding of species that are selective in
fluorination reactions. %%% In this project Professor Dale Shellhamer will
explore the unique behavior of fluorine containing compounds so that the very
high reactivity of fluorine can be moderated. The results from these studies
will develop utilitarian uses of specially designed fluorine reagents so that
fluorine can be introduced into organic compounds under controlled conditions.
