Professor Darrell J. Woodman and other members of the Chemistry Department at
the University of Washington are being supported to conduct a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1990-92,
ten (10) undergraduate students will spend nine (9) weeks each summer actively
engaged in a variety of research projects. Projects range from use of two-
dimensional NMR spectroscopy to investigate the dymamics of biological species
to study of the sterochemistry of a methylation reaction. Cooperative
arrangements will be made with faculty members from neighboring institutions so
that students may continue their work after they return to their home
institution. Students will present a seminar on their progress at the end of the
summer.
