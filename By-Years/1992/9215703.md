The objective of this project is to develop and test a theory- based,
quantitative and operationally efficient methodology which would enable industry
to predict, assess and develop the knowledge and skills required of
manufacturing personnel, concurrently with the design and development of
manufacturing technologies. Specific techniques will be developed to assess
human knowledge, skill and ability requirements during the manufacturing systems
design phase to improve selection and training of personnel in order that the
personnel can be optimally productive when the technology arrives at the
workplace. The conceptual framework for the development of the methodology is
based on the combined information derived from Fleishman's taxonomy of human
abilities, Gange's learning hierarchy, Anderson's automation of human thought
process, Wicken's cognitive resources and Koubek and Salvendy's knowledge
structure models. The conceptual model will be operationalized through the
utilization of a computer-based decision flow diagram. The development,
experimentation, and validation efforts will be performed in cooperation with
the private sector (industry).
