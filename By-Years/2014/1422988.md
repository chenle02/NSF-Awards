Increasingly ubiquitous network connectivity has engendered applications in
which sources send real-time updates of their status to interested recipients.
Examples include position, velocity and acceleration updates from nearby cars
that facilitate safe maneuvers in an intelligent transportation system; forest
temperature and humidity updates that can help better predict and control forest
fires; and status reports gathered from the human body that enable timely
detection of bodily ailments. These applications need status updates to be as
timely as possible despite limited network resources. This project explores new
timeliness metrics as a basis for the evaluation and design of status update
systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting from a time-average status-age measure
that applies to a broad class of systems, this project analyzes queue-theoretic
system abstractions consisting of a source, service facility and monitor. While
initial conclusions have been based on queue-theoretic abstractions that are
simpler than their real-world counterparts, the resulting insights are a useful
starting point in understanding and designing systems that support real-time
status updates. On this basis, the project goals include the design and
evaluation of (1) distributed resource sharing algorithms for simple networks of
competing status updaters, (2) multiple access protocols for status-updating
wireless sensors sharing a random access channel, and (3) stochastic
approximation algorithms for online optimization of status update systems
operating in networks. An improved understanding of the analytic fundamentals of
status updating will contribute to the development and ultimate deployment of
efficient and timely status updating systems.
