Necessary hardware and software has been assembled to provide laboratory
support for a new course, Introduction to Cognitive Science. Cognitive science
is a set of problems common to the disciplines of psychology, linguistics,
philosophy, and artificial intelligence. A strong role is played by computing in
this emerging multidisciplinary enterprise and a strong laboratory component is
essential to an introductory course. A cluster of four computer workstations, a
laser printer, and the means to link them into an integrated system as well as
to tie them into a campus wide network have been provided by the award. The
award will be matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
