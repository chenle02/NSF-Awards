0228104&lt;br/&gt;Spivak&lt;br/&gt;This award supports fundamental research and
education in condensed matter theory and the particular area of mesoscopic
physics. The PI will carry out theoretical investigations of electronic
interference phenomena in metal. The topics and systems for investigation
include superconductor-ferromagnet interfaces, phase separation near the metal-
insulator transition in silicon MOSFETs, and the superconductor-insulator
transition. This work supports graduate level education of the next generation
of condensed matter theorists.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award supports
fundamental theoretical research and education that seeks to advance our
understanding of quantum mechanical effects involving electrons that occur on
mesoscopic length scales in metals and superconductors. This basic research
helps improve understanding of fundamental and novel quantum mechanical effects
that occur in materials and contributes to the intellectual underpinnings of
potential future electronic device technologies. This award also supports
training the next generation of condensed matter theorists. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br
