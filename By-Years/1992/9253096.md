This planning proposal seeks to enhance the use of technology in the science
and mathematics classroom. More specifically, the project seeks to do the
following: to examine how and which technological innovations are being used in
the teaching of science and mathematics; to examine how technology is being used
to link scientists, science and mathematics educators, and other professionals
together; to determine what has worked, how well and why; and to explore new
advances in technology that have implications for education. As a result of the
findings, a teacher enhancement program will be designed for grades K-12 for
effective use of technology in the teaching of science and mathematics.
