9528208 Winter This U.S.-Mexico Program award will support a planning visit by
Dr. Joseph C. Winter of the University of New Mexico to work with Professor Raul
Mendez Lugo of Instituto Nacional de Antropologia y Historia (INAH) and
Professor Bruce Benz of the Universidad de Guadalajara (UdeG) study the Huichol
Indians of the Sierra Madre Occidental. The Huichol Indians are one of the most
intact, culturally conservative indigenous groups in all of North America, who
live under a traditional agricultural system. This project will investigate four
topics: 1) the origins and development of prehistoric Huichol agriculture; 2)
the changing nature of contemporary Huichol agriculture; 3) the expression of
Huichol agriculture in art, mythology, and social organization; and 4) the
transmission of Huichol agriculture through traditional education. The PIs will
visit the main villages of two of the three traditional Huichol communidades and
meet with comunidad governors and other members of the group. ***
