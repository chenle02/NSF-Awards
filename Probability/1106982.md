A wide array of mathematical methods will be used to increase the understanding
of the long and short term behavior of random processes occurring in self-
similar, fractal and disordered media. The existence and uniqueness of self-
similar Dirichlet forms, diffusions, and random walks will be proved on a wide
class of fractals, including infinitely ramified fractals appearing as limit
spaces of groups. Gaussian and non-Gaussian heat kernel estimates and Green's
function estimates will be studied on disordered systems, such as self-similar
and random fractals. Furthermore, probabilistic tools will be developed to study
non-commutative analysis on and generalized differential geometry of disordered
spaces that carry a local Dirichlet form. In addition, the project will
contribute to the ergodic theory of products of not necessarily independent
matrices and their relation to local properties of processes on fractals.
Asymptotic formulas for Lyapunov exponents of differential and difference
equations with small random perturbations, and estimates of the Lyapunov
exponents of stochastic differential equations will be obtained, and related to
the spectral problems for stochastic differential equations and wave propagation
in fractal and other disordered media.

The project contributes to the study of processes in disordered media
(fractals), which have many applications in physics, chemistry, biological
sciences and engineering. Diffusion processes in percolation clusters,
vibrations of fractal objects, signal propagation in channels with random
obstacles, electro-magnetic waves in fractal antennae, Rossby waves in
oceanography, models of financial markets, neural structures are just a few of
many examples of such processes. Thus the project contributes to the integration
of mathematics, physics, biological sciences and engineering. The project
integrates education and research with undergraduate students. The broader
impacts of the project include contributions to the development of human
resources in science and engineering, expanding participation of
underrepresented groups, and enhancing infrastructure for research and
education.
