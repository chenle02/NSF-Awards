Under the direction of Dr. Jeremy Sabloff, Ms. Renee Bonzani will collect data
for her doctoral dissertation. She will analyze botanical and associated
materials collected during archaeological excavation at the site of San Jacinto
1 in northern Columbia. The site is extremely important because it contains
seven culturally distinct layers dated from 6000 to 5700 B.P. (before the
present) and these include some of the oldest fiber-tempered pottery known from
the New World. The site is also extremely rich in floral remains and these were
systematically collected by a flotation technique. What also makes the site
important is its location near a savannah margin. Several archaeologists have
argued that it was in such ecotone situations that domestication of plants was
most likely to have occurred. In her research Ms. Bonzani will attempt both to
reconstruct the environment and human use of it through time. To accomplish the
former she will study charcoal to determine the tree species represented and
also examine insect remains for environmental clues. The latter variable will be
addressed through study of food remains themselves. This research is important
for several reasons. It has been hypothesized that, based on distribution of
modern wild species, several New World crops were domesticated in northern South
America. However direct archaeological data is lacking and Ms. Bonzani's
research may provide relevant information. By placing the analysis in a broader
environmental context the research may also shed light on the causes of this
most basic transformation in human subsistence. It will provide information on
how humans at technologically simple levels adapt to changing environments and
finally contribute to the development of a promising young scientist.
