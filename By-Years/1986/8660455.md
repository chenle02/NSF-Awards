This is a recommendation for an award to support research on the feasibility of
developing a novel, non-caxing ultrasonic filter. This device uses standard
filter membranes placed in an acoustic field that traps and transports particles
away from the filter surface. Both solid and fluid particles suspended in a
fluid medium may be acted upon by the moving pressure surface. The filter will
have application such as clearing bacteria from reverse osmosis membranes and
for desalination and to improve fermentation process harvesting. The research is
consistent with the Environmental Engineering program objectives. The
investigators are appropriately qualified to carry out the research. This
proposal is in response to NSF's a SBIR Phase I Program Announcement NSF 86-19.
An award of $40,000 for six months starting February 1, 1986 is recommended.
