Nerve cells can only utilize glucose as an energy source through the process of
glucose degradation known as glycolysis. The reason for this metabolic
restriction is unknown. In addition to supplying energy to nerve cells, glucose
is important for normal synaptic transmission in brain by being a substrate for
neurotransmitter synthesis. This research project will examine how the process
of glycolysis regulates cerebral synaptic transmission. Dr. Lipton will study
whether glycolysis inhibits the formation of ammonia, a compound present in all
cells using amino acid derivatives as an energy source. Traces of ammonia have
been found to inhibit synaptic transmission. Electrophysiological studies, using
hippocampal slices, will be conducted to test whether glucose metabolism is
coupled to transmission by supplying energy in the form of ATP and whether
glycolysis prevents ammonia build up. Results of this study will elucidate an
important aspect of brain metabolism, and the etiology of several nervous system
dysfunctions.
