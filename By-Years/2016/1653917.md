Investments made across national boundaries create international flows of
capital. These flows help to determine the health of the global economy as well
as the economy of the United States. Economists have developed theories about
the causes and effects of these flows. However, while the term 'flow' suggests
that these investments move a single coordinated force, in fact the investments
are determined by many individual decisions made by individual investors and
investing institutions. This project will use very detailed evidence on a
fraction of these investments to build a better picture of international capital
flows. The project will also test theories about these global flows respond to
US monetary policy and examine how this specific category of investments may
have real economic effects on receiving countries and may help to determine
exchange rates. This research will help us understand how US economic policies
affect the global economy, and how the decisions of investors around the world
affect the US economy. The educational component of this CAREER grant will
incorporate these research findings into classroom material as well as
specialized courses aimed at central bankers around the globe. As a result, the
project will give us new results that will promote the competitiveness of the US
economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has four main aims. First, the PI and
his coauthors seek to develop summary measures of global bond markets that are
based on these detailed and accurate measurements. Second, the team will
consider how global capital flows respond to changes in one country's monetary
policy; by testing economic theory, the research will give us better evidence
for how changes in US monetary policy can affect the world economy. Third, the
project will investigate whether the specific composition of international
investments helps to determine how the investment affects the country receiving
funds. Fourth, the team will test hypotheses about whether and how currency
positions affect exchange rates.
