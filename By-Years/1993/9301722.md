Lohmann 9301722 Funds are provided to support the continuation of the work on
the chemistry and bathymetry of calcification in planktonic foraminifera. The
new emphasis will be on the chemistry and growth of secondary calcite. This will
improve the paleoceanographic utility of the foraminiferal shell chemistry and
will allow a test of the isotopic fractionation during calcification. The new
work will build on the techniques developed by the PIs for differentiating
chemistries of primary and secondary shell calcites. Morphology of the secondary
calcite will be examined to better understand their part in shell formation
during the sinking of the shell to the sea floor.
