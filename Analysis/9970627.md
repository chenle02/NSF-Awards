DMS-9970627 ABSTRACT

The proposed research is to study specific q-series and integer partitions. In
particular new forms of the Bailey transform are found which imply new
multivariable Rogers-Ramanujan identities. These forms will be related to work
in statistic mechanics. They also motivate new quintic transformations which
imply the Rogers-Ramanujan identities without the Jacobi triple product
identity. The q-Hermite polynomials motivate this work, and several related
integrals remain to be evaluated and applied to number theory. They suggest many
avenues of study for combinatorial enumeration, including the positivity
conjectures of Andrews and Borwein.



Suppose we have a positive integer, for example 12. We now split 12 into a sum
of possibly smaller positive integers, for example 12=5+2+2+2+1. We always order
the smaller integers from largest to smallest. We call 5+2+2+2+1 an integer
partition of 12. The total number of integer partitions of a given integer is a
number that mathematicians, physicists, and chemists need to understand.
Whenever particles of matter exhibit symmetry, this number can appear. In this
research, several problems related to integer partitions are considered. The
basic technique of the study is to consider certain functions instead of the
partitions themselves, and apply a higher version of calculus to these
functions.
