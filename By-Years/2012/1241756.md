To increase the number of faculty teaching cybersecurity content, the Department
of Computer Science and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at
Texas Tech University in partnership with the Center of Security Studies and
Criminal Justice at Angelo State University are offering a professional
development program in cybersecurity to community college faculty scholars
across West Texas. Thirty faculty scholars from community and private colleges
across West Texas are participating in a cyber-security education workshop and
are mentored in the establishment of cybersecurity associate degrees and
certification programs in their home institutions. The project provides a
holistic approach to cybersecurity education by integrating the science and
engineering aspects of cybersecurity issues with the management, ethical, and
practical aspects as they relate to national defense and homeland security. It
also introduces recent advances in cybersecurity research to improve cyber
security education and explores various technical research and educational
challenges. The project is increasing the number of educators knowledgeable in
cybersecurity, resulting in a multiplying effect to students including minority
groups that contribute to the workforce in the region.
