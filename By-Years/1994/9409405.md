Query Optimization refers to the selection of an efficient execution strategy
for database queries posed in declarative languages, as typified by SQL. The
design of successful query optimizers for sequential processing has contributed
significantly to the success of relational database systems. However, current
solutions to the problem of query optimization for parallel executions are
inadequate 4 and limit the potential success of database systems on parallel
machines. This project is concerned with the design an implementation of
parallelizing query optimizers. There are two basic challenges in the design of
parallelizing query optimizers. The first is the design of near-accurate cost
models that predict the time it takes to complete the parallel execution of an
execution strategy. The second is the design of reasonably efficient search
algorithms which search for the plan with the minimum cost.
