The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 300 MHz broadband NMR spectrometer
with variable temperature capabilities for the use of undergraduate instruction.
The instrument is an vital component in the implementation of a innovative long
range undergraduate laboratory project extending over the two years of
instruction in organic and physical chemistry. Known locally as a series
experiment the students synthesize a porphyrin in the organic laboratory and
study many of its chemical and physical properties. They retain a sample of the
prepared compound for use in further courses. For example, in physical chemistry
they acquire 2-D spectra and investigate the tautomeric forms of porphyrins.
These experiments are followed by conversion to both a diamagnetic and
paramagnetic metalloporphyrin which is investigated using both NMR and EPR
techniques.
