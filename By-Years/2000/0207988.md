0207988 Sornette Transport in heterogeneous porous media poses formidable
challenges to model and predict with good reliability. We propose to develop a
microscopic physical basis for effective large scale models such as the
continuous-time random walk (CTRW) method, which takes into account extreme
fluctuations and anomalous transport paths in the contribution to the large
scale transport properties. For this, we will use a combination of
renormalization group and functional renormalization techniques to coarse-grain
and extrapolate from the microscopic realm to the large-scale description. We
also propose to generalize the CTRW model to a multi-scale hierarchical
framework with standard local Poissonian-in-time and Gaussian diffusion-in-space
describing microscopic processes, to investigate in what sense the coexistence
of multiple scales is responsible for the effective anomalous power law
properties, such as non-Gaussian distribution of trapping times and of jump
sizes captured by the CTRW framework which are usually postulated at a
phenomenological level.
