96-18364 Sneden, Christopher Dr. Sneden will carry out a diverse program of
research into fundamental issues of stellar nucleosynthesis and the early
chemical evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy by obtaining highresolution
spectroscopy of key stellar populations in the Galaxy's halo. Galactic halo
objects possess richly varied chemical compositions, which provide fundamental
clues to early chemical and dynamical evolution. The signature of abundances of
very heavy elements in the most metaldeficient stars reveal the nature of the
first generation of Galactic supernovae; the abundance of light elements in
globular cluster stars indicate complex hydrogen nucleosynthesis and internal
mixing in stellar interiors;the interstellar absorption features on lines of
sight toward stars in the halo map out large interstellar clouds in the Galactic
halo. Among the most interesting of Dr. Sneden's work will be studies of the
element Thorium, which holds the potential to provide an estimate of the age of
the Galaxy. ***
