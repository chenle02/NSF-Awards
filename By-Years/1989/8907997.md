The principal investigator will study the point spectra of elliptic self-
adjoint (pseudodifferential) operators in a variety of contexts. This study is
fundamental to the understanding of the relationship between analysis and
geometry, and is of interest in mathematical physics. The project will emphasize
the point of view of microlocal analysis. A microlocal version of the Selberg
trace formula for elliptic operators will be pursued. Results from this project
will then be applied to inverse spectral problems. The work to be completed in
this project will extend our knowledge of the relationship between differential
operators and geometry. In this century mathematical physics has seen the great
rise of operator theory as a tool for understanding the quantum mechanics of
subatomic particles. The principal investigator will develop microlocal analytic
techniques to solve various fundamental problems concerning these important
operators.
