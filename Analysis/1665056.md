The project involves research and education activities in harmonic and
functional analysis concerning the mathematical theory of multidimensional
wavelet and frame expansions. Wavelet and frame theory is not only
mathematically interesting in its own right, but this area has found many
applications outside of pure mathematics. These range from applied and
computational harmonic analysis to signal processing and data compression. Some
well known examples where wavelets are a key tool include the JPEG 2000 digital
image standard and fingerprint compression for data storage. The broader impacts
of the project deal with education and training of undergraduate and graduate
students in the area of harmonic analysis and wavelets. There are three
components of this activity which are integrally connected with the research
aims of this project. The first is advising and training of Ph.D. students in
the research directions described in this project. The second educational goal
is a support for student-run Stochastic/Functional Analysis seminar, which will
provide additional, critical training for graduate students interested in doing
research in harmonic and functional analysis. The third aim is to recruit
advanced undergraduate students to research projects on frames.

The project aims at answering some of the most fundamental questions in wavelet
and frame theory. One of the main research directions of the project is the
development of techniques for construction of well-localized orthogonal wavelets
for large classes of nonisotropic expanding dilations. A closely related
complementary topic is the study of wavelets for nonexpanding dilations. The
problem of characterizing dilations for which there exist minimally supported
frequency (MSF) wavelets is connected with the geometry of numbers; more
specifically, with the estimate on the number of lattice points of dilates of
balls. An analogous problem of classifying dilations for which there exist well-
localized wavelets has implications in the study of nonisotropic function
spaces. Another direction of the project is the construction of frames with
desired properties, such as with prescribed norms and frame operator. This line
of research is closely related with the infinite-dimensional generalizations of
the Schur-Horn theorem. The problem of characterizing diagonals of self-adjoint
operators has not only implications for frame theory, but it has also been
extensively studied in the setting of von Neumann algebras. Finally, the problem
of characterizing tight fusion frame sequences is connected with algebraic
combinatorics methods that are typically not employed in analysis.
