This project involves a new approach to robot learning from demonstration which
allows experimenters to teach multiple robots nontrivial, heterogenous
collective behaviors in real-time. Training multiple robots is challenging
because while the experimenter may know what emergent collective behavior he
wishes to achieve, it is unlikely that he knows what individual robot behaviors,
and their interactions, will achieve it. This project decomposes robot teams or
swarms into a social hierarchy of leaders and subordinates. Small groups are
then trained at the bottom of the hierarchy relatively simple collective
behaviors, then groups of leaders are trained progressively with more complex
and abstract behaviors, until all trained top-level root behaviors have been
learned. The project examines homogeneous behaviors within robot groups,
heterogeneous behaviors among the robots, and mixtures of the two at any level
in the hierarchy. The method builds on prior work in single-robot behavior
training, which used decomposed hierarchies of behaviors consisting of finite-
state automata and learned transition functions. Beyond robotics, the project
also allows the development of group behaviors for virtual agents found in
animation and in emerging agent-based models in the social sciences and biology.
The work integrates with a teaching and research robotics laboratory, with
agent-based modelers in the social sciences, and with robotics education efforts
in K-12 underprivileged schools.
