9417882 Crumbly This proposal addresses a critical problem in the geosciences,
the problem of under-represented minorities in the goesciences and especially as
students. A major difficulty in attracting talented, science-oriented minority
students to the geosciences is that, while the historically Black colleges and
universities (HBCUs) have had the best track record in educating Black
scientists, few HBCUs have geoscience departments. This proposal capitalizes on
the successes and the networks of HBCUs and creatively addresses the problem of
how to train these young scientists in geology and geophysics by giving them
solid backgrounds at an HBCU in chemistry or mathematics (either of which will
stand students in very good stead in careers in geoscience) and intensive
geoscience training at a major university. The approach also has the potential
for creating a critical mass of Black students studying geology at one
institution, something that individual institutions find virtually impossible to
accomplish.
