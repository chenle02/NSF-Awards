In Texas, 57% of incarcerated youths have prior offenses. Multiple organizations
(Bell County, Central Texas College, Central Texas Workforce Board, ESRI, Inc.,
Killeen Independent School District, Texas A&M University System, and Texas
Youth Commission) will demonstrate different and innovative learning methods to
close this revolving door on the juvenile justice system. "Engagement in
Learning" will stimulate learning through technology and engage the student in
life-long learning through hands-on deliverables. Student engagement will be
achieved by circumventing poor reading skills through hands-on applications of
modern technologies. This three-year program is comprised of teacher and student
training, classroom research and exploration projects, and the integration of
students into the workplace. Killeen ISD will train teachers in basic computer
skills and in project-based learning that integrates modern technology into the
classroom through appropriate curriculum. Other trained teachers from the region
will serve as mentors to the teachers that directly serve the incarcerated
population. Several follow-up sessions will be incorporated to strengthen
'teachers supporting teachers.' Approximately 250 students will be selected and
trained for 100 and 150 hands-on learning hours in aligned science education
curriculum (e.g. Life Management Skills, Geographic Information Systems, Health
and Safety, Horticulture and Food Sciences). Working in teams, students will
utilize scientific processes to simulate real-world experiences that utilize
science curriculum. Each project will be developed collaboratively through the
student team and teacher facilitation and will utilize project-based management
methods and hands-on learning to build and reinforce student learning and self-
esteem. The evaluation process will examine the effectiveness of intensive
project-based learning on the at-risk population of incarcerated juveniles and
will study the power of technology in changing life direction.
