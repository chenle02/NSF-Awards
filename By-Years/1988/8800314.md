Gaisi Takeuti's research is divided into two projects: (1) proof theory of
bounded arithmetic and complexity theory, (2) Boolean-valued and Heyting-valued
models. The first is related to a generalization by Samuel Buss of an idea
developed originally by Takeuti in his book on Proof Theory. It would be
exciting if this could be adapted to work in the polynomial-time hierarchy that
complexity theory treats. The second project involves applying the method of
special models pioneered by Takeuti to obtain results about certain types of
groups and probabilistic metric spaces.
