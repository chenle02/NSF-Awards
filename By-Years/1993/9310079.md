The project concerns three topics: (1) Concepts of dependence and asymmetry of
multivariate distributions and product integrals: we consider a class of tests
for exchangeability of multivariate random vectors subject to censoring. The
tests are based on symmetrized hazard functions and derive their form from the
product integral representation of multivariate survival functions in
neighborhoods contiguous to the hypothesis of exchangeability. The aim of the
project is to develop asymptotic properties of these tests. (2) Resampling
methods in estimation and prediction from Markov renewal processes: we examine
two different resampling methods in estimation of the renewal matrix from a
censored Markov renewal process and apply them towards setting confidence and
prediction intervals. (3) L-estimation in the accelerated failure time model: we
develop an extension of L-estimates in a semiparametric linear regression model
with censored and truncated data. The aim of the project is to develop new
inference methods in models designed for statistical analysis of data arising in
application to areas such as medicine, econometrics and astronomy. Three
interrelated topics will be considered and will deal with testing hypotheses,
estimation and prediction based on incomplete data.
