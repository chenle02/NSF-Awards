This summer research program will train and mentor underrepresented minority
students at the University of Connecticut Health Center (UCHC) in
interdisciplinary research projects involving biomaterials, stem cells and
tissue engineering strategy development for orthopedic as well as craniofacial
tissues. The program is designed to provide hands-on research experience and
will mentor students in scientific writing, professional development, and
general communication skills. The unique structure of the training will allow
undergraduate mentees to learn about medical/dental school, while obtaining
research training under the guidance of a mentor. The principal investigator has
a successful track record of training and mentoring underrepresented minority
students and has excellent resources available to him at UCHC that would help
the program to be successful. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through research training
and mentoring, the program would enable and encourage URM students to pursue
biomedical science, biomedical engineering, and physician and physician
scientist careers, which in the long-term could help address workforce diversity
issues in the biomedical science/engineering and related fields.
