funding for a Summer Symposium in Real Analysis, &lt;br/&gt;that is part of an
established series of conferences in Real Analysis. &lt;br/&gt;This conference
has a long and successful history and it is expected that &lt;br/&gt;it will
attract a fair number of graduate students and young researchers &lt;br/&gt;form
all of the US. A substantial part of the award funds will be used &lt;br/&gt;to
enable them to attend the Symposium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium will
highlight lectures by experts, provide a dynamic forum &lt;br/&gt;for the
discussion of research problems, and allot prime speaking time to
young&lt;br/&gt;researchers.&lt;br/&gt;
