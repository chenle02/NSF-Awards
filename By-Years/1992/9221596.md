Theoretical research will be conducted on the structural and thermodynamic
properties of complex, partially ordered materials. Two types of materials,
quasicrystalline alloys and ferrofluids, will be described by models which
capture the most relevant energetic and geometrical constraints, while remaining
simple enough to perform accurate, analytic calculations of statistical
properties. Quasicrystals, a common but complex structure type in intermetallic
alloys, appear to be intermediate between conventional crystals and metallic
glass. Employing geometrical tiling models as a shorthand description of real
atomic positions, the phase diagram and phase transitions among equilibrium
structures will be investigated as functions of interactions, composition and
temperature. Ferrofluids are colloidal suspensions of microscopic permanent
magnets. In addition to technological applications, these materials are of
intrinsic scientific interest because they provide an approximate realization of
a dipolar hard sphere fluid. This work will establish the nature of phases
between the dilute isotropic gas and the close-packed magnetically ordered
solid. %%% Theoretical research will be conducted on the basic properties of two
partially ordered complex materials. Quasicrystals, which were discovered over a
decade ago in certain intermetallic alloys, remain a mystery as to the
mechanisms which produce this unusual structure. Ferrofluids, artificial
magnetic materials with many applications, are interesting on a fundamental
basis and as a real material system. Both of these fascinating materials will be
studied using the latest techniques in statistical physics and computational
science.
