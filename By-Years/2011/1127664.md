Center for e-Design &lt;br/&gt;Proposal #1127609&lt;br/&gt;Proposal
#1127664&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for the Center for
e-Design sites at the University of Massachusetts and the Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are
authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-601. The solicitation invites
I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental
research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design process typically entails generation
of numerous design alternatives followed by reduction of these by virtue of
application of different criteria. Ongoing application of computing tools to
create an entirely electronic process for e-design have been enabling but can
have the effect of saturating the process with numerous alternatives. The
proposed work seeks to bring together researchers in the psychological theory of
innovation, computer science and human computer interaction to transform the
innovative process of design from one which is ad hoc to a more systematic
search through the space of features. The effort aims to implement the resulting
strategies in a semantic framework leveraging the concepts from visual
perception, cognition and human computer interfaces that will allow
visualization on the part of the designer of the most promising features for
each specific design case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research has the
potential to enable e-design tools to overcome current limitations and improve
the process and outcomes of design while at the same time providing insights
into the process of human innovation. Both, if successful, could significantly
improve design efficiency resulting in cost savings and reduction of time to
market. The work is supported by individual industry members of the center and
has the potential to extend the portfolio of the center by virtue of the major
innovation in e-design tools enabled by integration of cognitive principles.
Both inside and outside the center, the impact on design education and execution
has the potential for broad impact in the engineering community.
