9617929 McManus This project will examine the effects of early diagenesis upon
two elements (Ba and P) often used as tracers for past ocean production. The PIs
hypothesize that Ba preservation is related to the degree of oxygen penetration
into the sediment, and propose to use a redox sensitive element such as U as an
independent tracer of sediment oxidation state. P preservation is hypothesized
to be dependent upon both sediment oxidation and the presence of Fe oxides. The
PIs will collect solid and fluid phases in sediment cores from the southeast
Pacific and Chile continental margin spanning a wide range of oxidation states
and sediment types. Species to be analyzed include Ba, P, U, Cd, SO4, C1, F, Mn,
Fe, PO4, NH4, NO3 and O2.
