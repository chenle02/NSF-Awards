The main objective of this work is to investigate connectionist (neural network)
clustering models. Several areas of focus are: 1. a new mode-seeking clustering
algorithm that handles nominal attributes and small sample size; its realization
as a parallel and distributed process; 2. limited lateral inhibition,
particularly its effects on topographic maps; 3. artificial neurons as evidence
combination units and their realization of probabilistic reasoning; 4.
incremental versions of mode-seeking clustering algorithsm. The results of this
work can be used in the design of new content-addressable memories, indexing
methods in case-based reasoning, and other efforts in the understanding of
intelligent systems.
