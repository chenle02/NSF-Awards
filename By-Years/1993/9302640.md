This project addresses two major problems in geology: (a) the tectonic setting
and crustal conditions for 1.4 GA "anorogenic" granites and (b) processes of
pluton emplacement, the so-called "room problem" for granites. These topics will
be addressed through a multidisciplinary field, structural and petrologic
investigation of well-exposed 1.4 Ga plutons and associated metamorphic aureoles
in central Arizona. Due to the complex interplay among heat, transport,
metamorphism, and deformation during plutonism, it is necessary to collect both
petrologic and structural data (at a variety of scales) in order to decipher the
tectonic framework of the magmatic event. Results will lead to fundamental
changes in models for Middle Proterozoic tectonic evolution of North America and
Scandinavia in addition to fundamental constraints on mechanisms of crustal
growth and reactivation during pluton emplacement.
