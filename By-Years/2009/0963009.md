This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This award will provide support for the renovation of laboratory space for the
establishment of the Nanostructured Materials Growth and Metrology Laboratories
(MIT NanoMat Labs) that will be housed within the NSF Center for Materials
Science and Engineering (CMSE) at MIT. The renovated 2,900 square foot MIT
NanoMat Labs will be part of the 200,000 square foot NSF CMSE. The renovated
space will support a MIT-wide shared facility for processing and analysis
facilities, which include wet lab, cleanroom, specialized instruments and
research space. The materials growth portion of the facility is expected to
support a unique multi-chamber integrated materials growth system for the
deposition of multi-nanostructured thin films, spun-cast polymers, e-beam
evaporated metals, stamp-printed quantum dots and sputter deposited
semiconducting and insulating dielectrics. Scientists will be studying physical
phenomena, materials structures and chemistries, and demonstrations of practical
nanostructured devices that exceed the current state-of-the-art science and
technologies. The metrology portion of the renovated facility will contain a
suite of equipment to characterize optical and electrical properties of
nanostructured photovoltaics, fuel cells, batteries, and solid-state lighting
structures.

The proposed NanoMat Labs could provide a centralized set of research facilities
in the campus aimed at enabling growth and metrology of nanostructured
materials, and is expected to foster collaborative interactions among nine
research groups at MIT. It is expected that the facility would be used by over
70 graduate students and post-doctoral fellows from the above research groups,
and 5 to 10 associated undergraduates. Additionally, the facility will also be
used by high-school teachers and students.
