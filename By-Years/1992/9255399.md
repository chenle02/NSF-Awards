The National Research Council will convene a committee to explore the merit and
feasibility a national infrastructure of resources capable of delivering to
teachers and schools the intellectual and material resources necessary to
sustain systemic reforms in science and mathematics education. The committee,
working as a whole and in focus sessions, will include the perspectives of
scientists and mathematicians, science and mathematics education reforms, and
others who understand the opportunities, barriers, and most promising strategies
needed to mount and sustain mathematics and science education programs aligned
with national goals and standards. The NRC Committee will address the central
questions related to the merit and feasibility of a national system to help
teachers and schools achieve the national standards in mathematics and science
education. The NRC Committee will explore central issues regarding the most
promising "delivery system' and infrastructure"' composed of federal, state, and
local governmental and nongovernmental resources--agencies, institutions,
organizations, and individuals. A final report with recommendations is expected
in early 1993.
