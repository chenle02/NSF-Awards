0114861&lt;br/&gt;Hunziker&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Janet Hunziker of the
National Academy of Sciences and junior and senior researchers from various U.S.
universities to participate in an international workshop on several current
engineering topics. The four primary areas to be covered are 1) medical device
technology, 2) urban engineering and planning, 3) intelligent transportation
systems, and 4) environment and renewable energy. Speakers will be asked to
address issues such as what the frontiers in their field are; what experiments
and prototypes are in progress; what new tools and instruments are available;
what the major impediments to progress are; and what the theoretical,
commercial, societal, and long-term significance of the work is. Invitees will
be accomplished engineers who have made recognized contributions to advancing
the frontiers of engineering, with half those present from industry and half
from academia. The primary benefit of the workshop will be to foster new
interactions between the best junior U.S. and German engineers from different
fields and sectors. Today's most exciting and powerful engineering developments
are occurring at the intersection of disciplines. By creating the opportunity
for sharing of research insights and techniques across a range of fields, this
workshop will facilitate leaps in knowledge and applications that might
otherwise take much longer to achieve.&lt;br/&gt;
