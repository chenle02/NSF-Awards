EIA-0103725&lt;br/&gt;James C. Browne&lt;br/&gt;University of
Texas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop the
tools needed for performance-directed integrated design and control of complex
applications running on distributed computational systems. Its target
computational systems are complex, incorporating the difficult heterogeneity,
latency, and adaptive properties of computational grids. Its target applications
are at the cutting edge of computational science: very large, complex
applications with adaptive characteristics that do not allow their optimal
system configurations or computational requirements to be estimated prior to run
time. Each application will be viewed as a composition of components, with a
formal, high fidelity model of performance to be designed for each component.
The approach is to use model-based adaptive run-time control, based on these
composed performance models, to control the execution of the application to meet
specified performance goals. The control strategy will make real-time changes to
parameters that modify the behavior of both application and computational
platform.
