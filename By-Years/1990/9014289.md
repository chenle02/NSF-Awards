This award provides funds to an outstanding group of investigators who study
organismal structure with particular attention to that of vertebrates. The funds
will be used to purchase microscopes, video cameras and recorders, computers and
specialized computer software need for modern morphometric analysis. Although
the study of structure is a long established area of biological investigation,
the recent remarkable progress in studies of molecular and subcellular
organization has somewhat eclipsed studies of higher level organization at a
time when the application of computers has permitted increasingly sophisticated
quantitative morphology. The coupling of video equipment to microscopes together
with the use of computers for storage and analysis of the video data has been
the key element of progress in this area. The study of morphology continues to
provide key insights into the how and why of organismal evolution, and to out
understanding of adaptation of species to their environments. This award
recognizes the continuing importance of the study of morphology and of the
importance of modern instrumentation in these studies.
