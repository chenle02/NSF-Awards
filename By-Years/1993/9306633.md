9306633 Shaffer This proposal will derive a phylogeny for the major lineages of
chelonians (turtles) using nucleotide sequence data from several mitochondrial
genes. This phylogeny together with information on fossil dates for the
divergence of various turtle lineages will be used to examine rates of molecular
divergence in turtles, thus providing a test for the molecular clock hypothesis.
Morphological character divergence also will be examined in light of the
relationships depicted by the molecular phylogeny. %%% Since the pioneering
efforts of Zukerkandl and Pauling (1965), an increasingly large group of
biologists have been intrigued with molecular data as a source of
phylogenetically informative characters and a means of providing an independent
estimate of divergence times using a molecular clock. The research outlined in
this proposal will contribute directly to these two major areas of interest by
exploiting the living diversity of turtles and their superb fossil record. ***
