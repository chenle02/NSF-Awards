Industry-Education Conference on Workforce Development for the U.S.
Semiconductor Industry Developing a competitive, world-class technical workforce
for our nation's semiconductor industry is a big challenge facing our country
today. Major expansions in this critical industry are occurring in Oregon,
Arizona, New Mexico, Virginia and Maine. Community colleges and secondary
schools in these states are ramping up programs to prepare the needed workforce.
This project continues a successful national conference on advanced
technological education in semiconductor manufacturing that has served as a
forum for educators and industry people to share best practices, learn about
industry needs, and enhance faculty capability through presentations and
workshops. The project funds annual conferences in 1997 and 1998.
