The existing database systems treat only the current information in a systematic
manner. The only information is either deleted or archived and it can not be
queried; if it has to be queried, the data is time stamped in an ad hoc manner.
A temporal database incorporates the concept of time at the logical level of
design. Our recent work cleanly generalized the existing relational approaches
to temporal databases. Our new model allows an dimensional time stamps. The two
dimensional case seems to be a promising building block for a futuristic general
purpose database system, in which, in addition to querying the current and the
past states of a databases, one may also query the errors in the past states.
Thus it is a profound application of temporal databases to databases as a whole.
To harness the potential of our model, it needs further study and its
applications need to be consolidated. We would first strengthen the foundations
of the relational and other approaches to temporal database. We will then
advance the relational, object oriented and the deductive approaches to temporal
databases.
