ITR: Spatio-Temporal Complexity and Non-Linear Dynamics of Coastal Ocean
Flows&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roger M. Samelson, John S. Allen, Gary D.
Egbert&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oregon State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spatio-temporal complexity and
non-linear dynamics of coastal ocean flows will be studied using methods adapted
from recent work on the non-linear dynamics of low-dimensional systems. Stable
and unstable periodic or approximately periodic solutions of a three-
dimensional, numerical coastal ocean circulation model with realistic bottom
topography and oscillatory atmospheric forcing will be computed and their
dynamics analyzed. The linear stability and disturbance growth properties of
these solutions will be studied using Floquet theory, optimal disturbance, and
Lyapunov vector analyses. Applications toward ensemble forecasting methods for
coastal ocean circulation will be explored. This research is expected to yield
substantial new insights into the nonlinear dynamics and inherent predictability
of the coastal ocean system.&lt;br/&gt;
