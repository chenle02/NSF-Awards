9357009 Simon Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are important regulatory molecules
that control many aspects of cellular growth, differentiation and metabolism.
This work is directed toward understanding the mechanisms by which these
proteins, particularly those which span the plasma membrane and are controlled
by extracellular ligands, regulate intracellular events. The PI has focused his
studies on the action of a particular transmembrane PTK that is encoded by the
sevenless gene of Drosphilia melanogaster. Mutations that inactivate the
sevenless protein (Sev) lead to a single known defect in the fly. Seven Enhancer
of sevenless loci were identified. Mutations in four of the Enhancer of
sevenless loci also affect signaling by other receptor PTKs. The PI has
concentrated on the analysis of these four loci in hopes that they would encode
components of a general PTK signaling pathway. One locus, Ras1, encodes a ras
protein. ras proteins are known to be molecular switches that control many
aspects of cellular activity. How Ras1 is activated has therefore become the
crucial question which will be a major focus of this work. %%% This work
explores a complex signal transduction system that functions in cellular and
organizational development and growth control. Since the components of this
system are highly conserved during evolution, it is likely that this knowledge
gained will apply to all PTK signalling systems.
