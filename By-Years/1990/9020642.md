The principal investigator, in collaboration with Peter Nabelek, of the
University of Missouri, will study the 160 Ma regionally metamorphosed
calcareous argillites in the Wildrose Canyon area of the Panamint Mountains,
California. The purpose of the work will be to understand the effects of fluids
on the geochemistry and minerals of rocks which have undergone low-pressure
regional prograde and retrograde metamorphism. Principal methods to be utilized
include petrographic work (and in turn phase equilibria analyses), stable
isotope measurements, and total major-element mass balance calculations. The
study will enhance our understanding of regional metamorphism and fluid-rock
interactions at mid-crustal depths.
