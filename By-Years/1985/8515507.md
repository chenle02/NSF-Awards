Electrocheimical studies using alternate electrode materials which are more
integral and impervious to the combined effects of the soil chemistry and soil
based microbial activity. Soecific objectives include: Investigate the
electrochemical behavior of graphite composite and rare-earth oxide electrodes
in the solution phase as well as in both aerobic and anaerobic soil environments
with regard to electro-chemical stability and reproducibility; Characterize the
electrochemical lifetime of the aforementioned electrodes in both the solution
phase and in soil environments; and Evaluate the viability of these types of
electrodes as in ditu indicators for biological activity responsible for
degrading organic compounds in soil environments.
