The work will facilitate the synthesis and integration of research carried out
under MARGINS source-to-sink initiative through an inclusive international
conference and the creation of a digital text and educational resources.
Knowledge gained in a wet tropical setting (New Guinea and the Gulf of Papua)
will be contrasted with that completed in a temperate setting (New Zealand and
its adjacent continental margin) in order to resolve fundamental differences in
the operation of processes that transfer mass (particulate and dissolved) across
the Earth surface. The general goal of the meeting is to articulate the ideas
that are the foundation for a holistic understanding of sediment dispersal from
land origins to marine accumulation, and to explore the theoretical and
observational studies that support them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A synthesis of
the S2S science in itself would be an important resource for the broader Earth
science community. Other broader impacts include participation of graduate
students and young investigators in the conference, production of digital text
for advanced college courses and mini lessons for introductory courses, and
inclusion of applied scientists, geoscience educators and others who study the
stratigraphic record.
