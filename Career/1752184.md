In the 1970s theoretical physicists invented a number of statistical mechanical
models, called spin glasses, in order to study the strange behavior of certain
alloys, such as CuMn. In mathematics, they are purely probabilistic objects
possessing extremely intricate dependence structures and exhibit several crucial
features that are commonly shared in many randomized combinatorial systems
arising from various scientific fields. As a result, spin glass models are very
often cited as examples of complex systems and the corresponding research has
been of great use in understanding many real-world problems emerging from, such
as, computer science, data science, and many others. This project aims to
improve the current mathematical understanding of the mean field spin glass
models and to establish theoretical foundations for related applications in data
science. An integral part of the project is the development of educational
activities including mentoring graduate students and postdoc fellows, developing
advanced courses, and supervising undergraduate summer research. The project
involves the study of the structure of the functional order parameter and its
connection to the fluctuation and the energy landscape of the mean field spin
glasses. In addition, the PI plans to investigate the mean field spin glass
models by means of the classical statistical mechanics based on the Thouless-
Anderson-Palmer approach and analyze its relation to the Parisi theory. The PI
will also study spin glass models with more complicated dependence structures
including the bipartite model and the Levy spin glass. Furthermore, the PI
intends to study some randomized combinatorial optimization problems arising
from data science in the approach of spin glass theory such as the detection
problems and positive semi-definite programming. Based on these research
projects, the educational component involves organizing probability summer
programs and mentoring graduate, undergraduate students as well as postdoc
fellows.
