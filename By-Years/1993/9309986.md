9309986 Hooper This proposal outlines a combination of electrophysiological
experiments and computer simulations on a small, well described invertebrate
distributed neural network (the lobster pyloric network) aimed at elucidating
these design principles. The pyloric network contains neurons with long lasting
active properties, can assume multiple functional configurations, and produces a
rhythmic multiphase output. The network has a remarkable dynamic property that
may be analogous to the ability to process inputs over a wide temporal range: it
maintains constant phase and duty cycle relationships within the pattern as
pattern cycle frequency changes. The experimental advantages of this preparation
allow all the network's neurons to be individually characterized, and the
network to be simulated on the level of the individual conductances of its
neurons. It is thus a excellent preparation in which to study the questions
outlined above. This work will show how cellular and synaptic properties lead to
emergent network functional properties, and elucidate fundamental mechanisms of
dynamic regulation in distributed neural networks.***
