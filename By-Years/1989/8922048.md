Professor Truhlar is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to develop theories associated with molecular scattering, gas
phase molecular reactions, and molecular energy transfer. This fundamental
research provides the foundations for a physical interpretation of chemical
reactions at the molecular level. Professor Truhlar's research is focussed in
four main areas: 1) calculation of cross sections and rate coefficients for
reaction, energy transfer, electron scattering and decay of metastable states;
2) testing of new methods for calculating properties of collision processes; 3)
use of existing theories to perform systematic studies of representative
collision processes; and 4) use of semi-empirical and ab initio theories to
devise potential energy surfaces for dynamic calculations.
