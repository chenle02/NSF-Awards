This dissertation research proposal is to do a quantitative analysis of
archaeological site looting and vandalism in Alaska in order to identify
successful mitigation strategies. The CoPI is building on previous research and
survey data from communities in the Pacific Northwest concerning this issue. The
project will combine methodology from the fields of archaeology, anthropology,
geography and sociology to examine the multiple contributing factors, e.g.,
social, cultural, geographic, legal and educational in an attempt to formulate
regionally appropriate solutions.
