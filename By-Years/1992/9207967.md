A new advanced mining pipe system for deep-ocean crust mining in ocean floor
depths up to 2,500 meters is proposed and to be evaluated by numerical
simulation. The mining system consists of a slowly continuous moving ship which
maneuvers a deep ocean pipe with a mining vibrator or ocean-floor vehicle to
fracture or crush the crust minerals. The development of this system, which has
been identified by the industry as one of the most crucial, involves the
analysis and control of the transient behavior of the pipe bottom end caused by
the ship's oscillatory and maneuvering motion, hydrodynamic loading due to ocean
waves and current, mining vibrator excitations, and dynamic interaction of
fractured mineral and water mixture flows with oscillating pipe motion. The
transient response of the pipe system consists of nonlinear large coupled
bending-axial-torsional deformation of the pipe. A three- dimensional model of
the complete pipe system based upon the discrete element method (DEM) is to be
developed in order to analyze the nonlinear dynamics of this coupled pipe system
due to the harsh operating and environmental loads encountered in a mining
operation.
