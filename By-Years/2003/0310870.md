Chemistry (12) This project is incorporating gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC-MS) into the chemistry curriculum. Experiments from the Journal
of Chemical Education are being adapted for use at different levels in the
curriculum. Use of GC-MS begins in introductory courses and will continue in
increasingly complex ways in organic, analytical, instrumental, and advanced
organic courses and finally in undergraduate research. In this way, experiments
will build on students' previous knowledge, beginning with guided inquiry and
gradually introducing greater independence in experimental design and
interpretation as students progress to more advanced courses. Additionally,
students in survey courses and in-service teachers participating in professional
development activities are gaining exposure to this technique through meaningful
activities which have a contextual basis.
