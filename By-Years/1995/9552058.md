This project is part of a long-term program to improve applied optics teaching
and research in the Physics Department. This project improves introductory and
intermediate lectures and labs and, also, undergraduate research opportunities.
The first project goal is to improve instruction in the many courses involving
light spectra through the purchase of a portable user-friendly rapid-scan
spectroscope. A computer display or LCD projector makes each spectrum visible to
classes of up to 80 students. In elementary and intermediate course lectures and
labs, sunlight, tungsten and fluorescent lamps, laser sources, and gas tube
sources can be quickly compared. Filters can be examined, including UV
absorption by clear glass versus clear plastic versus sunglasses, for example.
For intermediate to advanced project and research work by physics majors,
holographically formed filters can be characterized, gas-tube spectra measured,
and emission, absorption, and reflection by solids studied. This experience lays
the foundation for some physics students to participate in a new research lab
emphasizing spectroscopy of semiconductor surfaces that has been established in
the Physics Department. A second project goal is to strengthen the department's
capabilities in electronically based interferometry. Two existing student and
faculty research programs, one on holographically based measurement of surface
roughness using scattered laser light and the other on holographic
interferometry applied to musical acoustics are strengthened by the introduction
of electronic fringe measurement. A computer-interfaced CCD camera is obtained
for this part of the project along with the upgrade of an optical table used
both for course work and for musical acoustics research.
