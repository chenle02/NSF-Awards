9610440 Keer The purpose of this study is to develop the experimental
techniques and predictive theoretical understanding needed to engineer coatings
that are optimized for use on basic mechanical components such as bearings and
gears. The first step of the study is to engineer equiaxed coatings which are
expected to have better in-plane strength than the current columnar structure.
The proposed processing technique involves renucleation of coating layers and/or
high current, low energy ion bombardment. The mechanical and physical properties
of these coatings and their contact fatigue resistance will be determined and
correlated with microstructure. Theoretical models will be developed to account
for the correlations and to generalize them. ***
