This project will study phenomena in topology and geometry, using tools from
several parts of modern mathematics. The motivating questions for this project
are about what constraints a four-dimensional geometric shape must satisfy. The
main technical tool to approach such questions, mathematical gauge theory,
originates from physics, and part of this project will be about further
developing techniques in mathematical gauge theory. An additional goal is to
support graduate education, and to disseminate mathematical results.

More technically, this project will investigate Floer and Khovanov theories
associated to knots and three-manifolds, and deduce topological applications. In
Floer theory, there have recently been several enhancements of the powerful and
well-studied Floer homologies of three-manifolds. On one hand, Hendricks-
Manolescu have defined involutive Floer homology, and on the other there have
been several recent developments for Seiberg-Witten Floer spectra. These new
constructions have provided new insight into the structure and applications of
Floer homology groups, but these new theories have been particularly difficult
to compute, in practice. This project is centered on developing our
understanding of these and related invariants, and applying them to questions in
geometry and topology, especially on homology cobordism. Primary goals include
proving surgery exact triangles in Seiberg-Witten Floer homotopy theory as well
as determining the Seiberg-Witten Floer homotopy type of Seifert spaces. In
addition, the principal investigator proposes to develop techniques for
calculating involutive Floer homology, in order to find new phenomena in the
homology cobordism group of 3-manifolds.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
