The WCS/Bronx Zoo, in partnership with the United States Coalition for the
Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (USCDESD), will host a two-day
summit targeting professional educators working for institutions that maintain
living collections (such as zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens). The goal of
the summit is to provide an opportunity for sharing of best practices and
development of strategies and recommendations that these institutions can
utilize in supporting the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development
(DESD). A key focus will be the fundamental role science has played and will
continue to play in finding solutions to the challenges of sustainable
development. The summit will involve staff from approximately 50 institutions
across the nation and will result in a Recommendations Document and set of
Action Plans that will guide the work of the participants, and the field, in the
creation of science education programming focusing on sustainable development
and the Decade.
