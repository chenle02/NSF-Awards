This award is made by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division
and the Solid State Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research to
the University of Utah in support of the research of Joel S. Miller. The
research will explore structure- function relationships in
metalloporphyrin/tetracyanoethylene(TCNE)-based magnetic materials with the goal
of discovering new organic based magnets with high critical temperatures,
magnetic saturation moments and ambient stability. Research thrusts which will
be emphasized are the role of spins on the periphery of the porphyrin ligand,
effect of covalent bonding and supramolecular hydrogen bonding, synthesis of new
magnets based on anion-radical acceptors other than TCNE, synthesis of porphyrin
complexes with other high spin metal ions, photomagnetic effects in manganese
porphyrin/TCNE complexes, and the pressure dependence of ferromagnetism on
pressure. Collaborative physical measurements and computational studies will
supplement the synthetic aspects of the research. Organic based magnets are
tractable and offer the synthetic diversity necessary to design a variety of
magnetic materials with predictable and controllable properties. This research
will help define structure-performance relationships for a new generation of
magnets with potential applications in electronic and photonic devices.
