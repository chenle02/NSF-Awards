This objective of this exploratory project is to investigate the integration of
decision-based design theory with engineering design education pedagogy. The
plan is to design the design of the new engineering curriculum. This exploratory
project will determine the feasibility of bridging design theory research with
engineering practice through the planning, development, and assessment of two
junior level courses. This will serve as a testbed for establishing pedagogical
metrics for engineering education in design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
has the potential of significant broader impacts, not only upon evolving the
education of engineers in a four year curriculum, but also upon future
engineering practice in how industries will make design decisions within the
product realization systems. This exploratory program is based upon the high
risk hypothesis that a bridge between research in design theory and educational
pedagogy can be demonstrated, with validation and development of metrics for the
learning modules developed. The tasks for this Design for "XXX" Project, where
XXX is learning, are based upon current research in DfX. &lt;br/&gt;
