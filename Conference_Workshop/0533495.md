Abstract Lubotzky

This award provides partial support for a four-day international conference to
cover recent progress and developments of the theory of Lie groups, discrete
subgroups and homogeneous spaces. The last three decades have brought
spectacular advances in the area, highlighting various connections to dynamical
systems and ergodic theory, Diophantine approximation, rigidity theory, discrete
mathematics etc. The progress has been especially rapid and impressive during
several recent years. However, no major international conferences unifying this
subject and related fields were held since the beginning of the 21st century.
This justifies the need for the planned conference, which is going to bring
together world leaders in these fields and serve as a forum for dissemination of
new results, methods and ideas. Tentative list of topics includes: rigidity and
classification of actions of higher rank Lie groups and lattices; ergodic
theorems for lattice actions; growth properties of linear groups and Tits
alternative; counting integer points on homogeneous varieties; measure rigidity
of higher rank abelian actions and quantum unique ergodicity; the set of
exceptions to Littlewoods conjecture; applications to Diophantine approximation
with dependent quantities; invariant measures for actions on the Teichmueller
space and applications to billiards.
