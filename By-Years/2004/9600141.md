Abstract Wu The principle investigator proposes to study two problems: one is a
generalized "homogenization" problem; another is the two dimensional water wave
and Euler equations. Homogenization is an effective method used to study the
micro-structure of materials. The mathematical method used to tackle the problem
is the weak convergence method; 2-D Euler equations and 2-D gravity waves arise
in the naval study and applied physics. The objective of the proposed works is
to continue the line of research initiated by Coifman, Lions, Meyer and Semmes;
and Tartar and Murat, and many others, to understand the link between weak
continuity, cancelation property and Hardy spaces for multilinear operators and
nonlinear operators, to find sufficient conditions for the weak continuity of
nonlinear operators; and to continue the work of Nalimov, Yosihara and Walter
Craig and solve the existence and uniqueness problem for 2-D water waves. The
long term objective of the proposed works is to develop more machinery on the
weak convergence of nonlinear operators and to apply the result and methods to
solve open problems in nonlinear partial differential equations and applied
sciences; and to develop a complete understanding of the motion of water waves,
both two dimensional and three dimensional, and to develop a method which could
be used in the study of other areas in the mathematical theory of fluid
dynamics. The methods to be used are from harmonic analysis, complex analysis,
the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations.
