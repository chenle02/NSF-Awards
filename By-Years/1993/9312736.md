9312736 Antolovich This project is for the partial support of two sequential
annual workshops on research areas associated with processing, constitutive
laws, damage detection, damage and lifetime prediction of advanced engineering
materials and materials used in critical applications. The first workshop will
be held September 13-16, 1993 at Washington State University, Pullman,
Washington. The second will be held 12 to 18 months later at the Georgia
Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia. The goal of the workshops is to
assemble leading researchers in an interdisciplinary environment so that the
significance and implication of problems and advances in a particular field can
be shared broadly. Emphasis will be placed on reviewing progress that has been
made in the areas of thrust of the workshop, and on defining research that needs
to be performed in order to achieve major breakthroughs. ***
