Morton 9604536 The correct functioning of the brain of all animals, including
humans, is dependent on chemical messengers. Neurotransmitters are examples of
such chemical messengers which carry information from one nerve cell to another
within the brain. Nerve cells often respond to the presence of the
neurotransmitter by altering the levels of additional chemical messengers, known
as second messengers, within the nerve cell. Many hundreds of different
neurotransmitters have been identified in a wide variety of species. Some of
these are conserved between species and others are found in only a few species.
In contrast, there are only a handful of second messengers and these are
conserved across almost every species which has been studied. Dr. Morton and Dr.
Nighorn have identified a simple animal model system that is ideal to examine
the function of two specific second messengers, guanylyl cyclase and nitric
oxide synthase, in regulating neural processing and behavior. They will
concentrate on the olfactory system since its structure and function are very
well characterized and they can manipulate the chemical signals that the animals
smell. Using sophisticated molecular and cellular techniques, Dr. Morton and Dr.
Nighorn will first clone the genes for both of these enzymes. They will then
identify which cells in the olfactory system contain these enzymes and hence
utilize these second messengers. This enables them to examined how chemical
pheromonal cues will alter the system in the cells which first perceive odors
and the cells in the brain where this information is first processed. The
results from these studies are important to understanding the fundamental
properties of neural processing. It will provide new knowledge towards
understanding the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of vital
information obtained from the environment.
