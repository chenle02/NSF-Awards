In this project a computer system using two cameras as eyes will be developed
to recognize sign language vocabulary in real time. The theory and method,
called orientation chain coding, used in the realization of this system have
been studied and analyzed. Preliminary simulation results show that this method
is a feasible and efficient algorithm for sign language recognition. The results
of this project will enable the realization of a functioning prototype sign
language interpreter. The developed system could be used as a computer sign
language interpreter to help deaf persons talk to people who do not understand
sign language. The systems can be set up at schools, homes, and public service
organizations. It could also be further developed as a computer teaching aid to
help deaf students learn special courses or skills. All deaf persons and our
society will benefit from the development of such a computer system.
