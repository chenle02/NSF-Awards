Flocking Behavior in Wild Birds: The Role of Seasons, Hormones, and the Brain

The roles of the hormones vasopressin and oxytocin in the regulation of social
behavior have garnered considerable interest within the neuroscience community.
These compounds modulate a variety of affiliative behaviors, including mother-
offspring interactions and the formation of social bonds. Although the influence
of oxytocin and vasopressin on social bonding has been firmly established,
little is known about their relationship to social behaviors aside from bonding.
Is group cohesion established solely through social bonding? In gregarious
species characterized by the formation of large aggregations, maintenance of the
group by close social bonds alone is unlikely. This research will investigate
the relationship between hormones and variations in seasonal flocking behavior
in the wild White-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys), a conspicuous and
abundant North American songbird.

Training objectives include learning: (1) to locate, capture, and handle wild
birds and (2) how to integrate techniques employed in neuroscience and field
biology. By examining the physiological processes underlying group formation
within the environments experienced by free-living animals, this research stands
to reveal a more comprehensive view of social behavior than currently exists.
This research will also augment our understanding of winter sociality (group-
living that is limited to the winter, non-breeding months) and facilitate
comparisons of captive and free-living animals. Broader impacts of this award
include: (1) research opportunities for undergraduates, (2) delivery of public
lectures to local non-scientist groups, particularly those dedicated to persons
with autoimmune disease; and (3) dissemination of research findings to those
with learning and visual disabilities using audio files.
