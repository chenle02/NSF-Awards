Non-technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discontinuous Shear Thickening
fluids such as cornstarch and water exhibit an amazing and useful response to
impact. They become solid-like in response to impact and can, for example, stop
an impacting object, or support a person running on the surface of the fluid,
but remain fluid-like before and after impact. This project involves controlled
laboratory experiments to study this impact response and aims to develop a
better understanding of how jammed materials behave. The applications of this
work include the design of materials for impact protection, as well as improved
suspension flow processing. This research program includes the training and
participation of graduate and undergraduate students in the scientific process.
Outreach to local public school students includes lecture-demonstrations
focusing on science and engineering education for women and underrepresented
minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The goal of this project is to understand the
dynamic behavior of Discontinuous Shear Thickening fluids (including impact
response and the ability to run on the surface). It has recently been found that
a transiently jammed region of material can develop and propagate in front of an
impacting object. The research team carries out experiments with a combination
of force measurements and images of the jammed region at the surface to
determine if and how the stress response correlates with the jammed fronts
reaching the boundaries. The experiments investigate the physical mechanism
behind the strong stress response by testing if the stress response scales with
the stiffness of the boundary or particles as in other jammed systems. The
research team also carries out experiments to determine the critical shear rate
at the shear thickening transition under impact. This is tested with impact
experiments for different impact velocities and fluid viscosities. A
constitutive relation describing the dynamic behavior of Discontinuous Shear
Thickening fluids can be developed from these experiments. The experiments are
complimented by low-dimensional modeling to connect and explain the various
dynamic behaviors of Discontinuous Shear Thickening fluids. This low-dimensional
model requires as input a stiffness and relaxation times, obtained from
measurements of the model system of impact experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
