The International Symposium on the Growth of III-Nitrides (ISGN) will be held
May 18-22, 2014 at the Westin Hotel Peachtree Plaza, Atlanta, Georgia. The
symposium will foster advances in the leading research on various types of III-
Nitride material growth and device technology by gathering a diverse group of
experts, researchers and students. The program provides the opportunity for
scientific exchanges and discussions on exciting breakthroughs in the terahertz
field and the understanding the underlying physical mechanisms.. Topics to be
addressed include III-N Bulk growth of AlN, GaN, InN, III-N nanostructures,
defect control and surface effects, III-N devices such as Filed-Effect
Transistors and Light Emitting Diodes. The Symposium will promote interactions
between leading researchers in material growth and device technologies and will
focus on the technical challenges of these materials and their applications. The
highlights of the symposium will be accessible worldwide through and Abstracts
book..
