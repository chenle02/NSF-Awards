This award supports the participation of the principal investigator in a
combined shipboard/aircraft sampling expedition identified as WATOX-CASE
(Western Atlantic Ocean Coordinated Air-Sea Experiment). The ship and the
aircraft operations are supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) for their ongoing research operations. The principal
investigator of this NSF project will be accommodated aboard the NOAA research
ship. The overall WATOX-CASE project will combine the work of NOAA scientists
with the efforts of several university scientists, including the principal
investigator for this grant, who, as a guest on the NOAA research ship, will use
this opportunity to work toward his own particular goal to clarify sulfur
conversion mechanisms. Specifically, the NSF investigator will do size-
segretated measurements of aerosol sulfate and other ions, and will collaborate
in collecting and analyzing for up to 50 chemical elements in fine- and coarse-
fraction aerosols taken on shipboard. Size-spectrum measurements will also be a
part of the shipboard work. Some work will be included on the elemental analysis
of samples taken by aircraft. The data arising from this NSF project will be of
general interest to atmospheric chemists seeking to understand processes
occurring in the marine boundary layer, and the collection of these data is the
principal objective of the grant.
