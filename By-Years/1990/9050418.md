The purpose of this project is to introduce the use of lasers to the
instrumental analysis laboratory program at the College of Charleston. The
forefront of optical spectroscopic research involves the use of lasers for both
atomic and molecular spectroscopy. The acquisition of the equipment is allowing
the establishment of a strong laser component for the course. The experiments
being developed involve quantitative molecular florescence, the quenching of one
fluorescent molecule by another, and thermal lens spectroscopy. The modular
approach to construction of the three experiments is helping the students to
better understand the design of the experimental set-up. An additional benefit
is the development of alternative projects to those that are currently available
in the department for undergraduate senior research by expanding opportunities
in atomic and molecular spectroscopy. The institution is matching the NSF grant
with an equal amount of funds.
