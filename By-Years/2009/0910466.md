Reactivity studies on organic bi- and polyradicals are hindered by their high
reactivity and short lifetime in solution. Only little is known, for example,
about the factors that control the chemical properties of many carbon-centered
radicals, and nothing is known about the chemical properties of related tri- and
tetraradicals. However, information on the factors that control the chemical
properties of these species is highly desirable since it may allow one to "tune"
their reactivity by varying structural details and hence design polyradicals
with tailored properties. The ability to do this is expected to impact many
fields, including organic synthesis, materials science (e.g., organic magnets),
and drug development. In the past, PI and her students have studied the
reactivity of gaseous mono- and biradicals by using Fourier-transform ion
cyclotron resonance mass spectrometers (FT-ICR), a flowing afterglow quadrupole-
octapole-quadrupole apparatus, and most recently, a linear quadrupole ion trap.
These studies have revealed several important reactivity controlling factors
that can be used to "tune" the reactivity of these species. This project will
extend these studies to analogous tri- and tetraradicals whose reactivity is
nearly entirely unexplored. The properties of several isomeric and differently
substituted tri- and tetraradicals will be explored by experimental studies on
their reactivity and by computational studies on their geometries and electronic
structures. More than 20 graduate and at least five undergraduate students will
carry out all aspects of the research, and disseminate the results under the
PI's supervision. About half of the participating students are female and/or
belong to underrepresented minorities. Further, mass spectrometry will be
introduced to Purdue's College of Science Van that delivers research grade
instruments to high and middle schools throughout central Indiana. The proposed
research will lead to the training of a large number of ethnically diverse,
highly qualified science Ph.D.'s.
