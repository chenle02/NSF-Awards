9503514 Moore Centre College proposes to install and maintain a 1.5 Megabit (T1)
communications circuit for the purpose of establishing a permanent connection to
the Internet. This line will enable Centre College to replace the current
temporary connection to the Internet and to expand current services to two
public school systems and the Kentucky School for the Deaf. This connection will
also afford improved sharing of resources by and with other educational
institutions by providing connectivity with federal and state agencies and
institutions of higher education worldwide.
