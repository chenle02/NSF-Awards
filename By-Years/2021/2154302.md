With support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms-A (CSDM-A)
Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Stefan Stoll and his research
group at the University of Washington are studying the fundamental behavior of
qubits (quantum bits), the essential building blocks needed for ground-breaking
quantum information applications such as quantum computing and quantum sensing.
A fundamental challenge in the development of qubits is their decoherence, i.e.
the fact that they lose information over time. Professor Stoll and his research
group are addressing this challenge by developing and validating a computational
model that predicts qubit decoherence based on molecular structures. This model
will have broad impact by guiding the chemical design of novel quantum
materials. Additional broader impacts of the project include advanced training
opportunities for students, outreach activities, and the dissemination of online
educational resources, including an open-source software for EPR
spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific goals of the project include
modeling and understanding the physical mechanisms that cause decoherence of
molecular electron spin qubits. For this purpose, the research team led by
Professor Stoll is working to develop and validate a novel computational
approach that quantitatively predicts electron spin decoherence in molecular
spin qubits from their spatial structure. The first-principles approach combines
density functional theory and molecular dynamics with many-body spin quantum
dynamics. This innovative approach and its quantitative predictions will be
validated by comparison with experimental data from pulse EPR (electron
paramagnetic resonance) spectroscopy on a variety of molecular spin
centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
