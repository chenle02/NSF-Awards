This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
explore the novel use of an immune protein for measuring stress in rainbow
trout. No convenient tests are currently available to measure stress, a
condition that often leads to disease. Accurate stress measurements will
dramatically reduce disease losses, the major cause of economic losses in
salmonid aquaculture. HLP-1 is a potent antibiotic immune protein that is
naturally present in many tissues of rainbow trout. This protein is expected to
play a critical role in protecting trout against disease. Stress has been noted
to cause a dramatic decrease in HLP-1 levels. This Phase I Project will explore
the feasibility of measuring HLP-1 in gill tissue using a simple, antibody-based
methodology (ELISA). This assay should have sufficient sensitivity and
specificity to be used for commercial development of a low- cost, field-
deployable, immunoassay prototype test.

The commercial application of this project is in the field of aquaculture. The
proposed technology will find use in aquacultured food fish, as well as for
health monitoring in pet fish, laboratory animals and wild fish populations.
