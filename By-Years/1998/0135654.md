0135654&lt;br/&gt;Weare&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial support
for the acquisition of a cluster of networked PCs (Beowulf cluster) dedicated to
the prediction of the properties of ore forming fluids and aluminosilicate
melts. Additional support will cover the salary of a postdoctoral scholar who
will develop an interactive web site and necessary software to allow
collaborators in the geosciences to initiate, view and control ab-initio
molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations of the chemical properties of hydrothermal
fluids and the structure and dynamics of molten aluminosilicates over a wide
range of temperatures and pressures. AIMD simulations facilitated on this multi-
CPU Beowulf cluster will support and enhance experimental spectroscopic
investigations of the chemical structure and dynamics of hydrothermal fluids and
silicate melts and should offer new insights into the behavior of these fluids
in a P-T range largely inaccessible to experimentation.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
