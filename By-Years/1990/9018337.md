In order to meet its objectives, the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study must operate
in both spatially intensive and spatially extensive modes (JGOFS, 1990), that
is, in process studies at specific sites and in ocean surveys. This project is
for the collection and processing of data on optics and pigment distributions in
the survey mode, and combines the efforts of JGOFS and the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic Program (WHP). The researchers will
operate a bio- optical profiler to collect data on the biological and optical
properties of the upper water column. The measurements to be made include
spectral irradiance (upwelling and downwelling), broad-band visible irradiance
(PAR), fluorescence, and beam transmission. This study represents the first
undertaking of a systematic and consistent data collection on the oceans pigment
and optical properties, and should be invaluable in improving algorithms for
satellite imaging of ocean pigments and in estimating primary production. The
data collected under this program will be provided to the oceanographic
community in particular to JGOFS and WOCE Investigators in a timely fashion for
analysis.
