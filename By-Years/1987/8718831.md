This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). This research program
will investigate the factors affecting practical SIMS microanalysis of
semiconductor and electronic devices and of biological tissues. The goals of
this program are (1) to improve the spatial resolution of the stigmatic
secondary ion microscope through the use of a charge-coupled device detector and
(2) to provide high-resolution quantitative mapping of elemental and isotopic
distributions in solids. The achievement of these goals will broaden the
application of SIMS to many new important materials and biomedical problems.
