The objectives of this research are to investigate the kinetics of free-radical
initiation reactions carried out in the single-phase, mixture-critical region.
Research will determine the effect of the solvent properties of mixtures in
their critical region (enhanced diffusivity, reduced viscosity, and enhanced
solvent power) on the rate of formation of primary radicals via homolytic
scission. The information generated in this study should suggest novel and more
efficient means for performing reactions and separating reaction mixtures for
many free-radical reactions such as polymerizations and oxidations. There is a
change in mechanisms (viscosity and energy- transfer effects) which occur in
going from a gas-phase to a liquid- phase reaction medium.
