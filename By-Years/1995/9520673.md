9520673 Within populations, there is often wide variation among individuals.
This variation may be adaptive, because it allows different individuals to use
subsets of the habitat to which they are functionally best suited. This research
addresses two questions regarding individual variation. First, do locomotor
performance and body shape covary, and do individuals that differ in shape
select parts of the habitat in which their performance is best? Second, what are
the relative roles of genetics and environment in shaping individual morphology?
The model system is a population of fence lizards that utilize multiple habitat
types and show significant differences in morphology between individuals. The
research questions are addressed through a series of descriptive and
experimental studies. Locomotor performance on a variety of substrates will be
measured, and covariance between performance and shape variables will be
determined using multivariate statistics. Siblings will be raised in
structurally different habitats, and in different food level and thermal regime
combinations to separate genetic and environmental influences on body form. The
research will reveal the adaptive significance of variation within a population,
as well as the factors that produce that variation.
