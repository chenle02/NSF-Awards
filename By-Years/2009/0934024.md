This proposal requests NSF support to assist students in attending the
2009&lt;br/&gt;International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO
2009). CGO&lt;br/&gt;provides a premier venue to bring together researchers and
practitioners working&lt;br/&gt;on feedback directed optimization and backend
compilation techniques. The&lt;br/&gt;symposium covers compilation for
parallelism, performance, power, and security.&lt;br/&gt;This support will
broaden participation in CGO by subsidizing the travel for participants who
might not otherwise travel to attend CGO. The funds will be used solely to
provide travel support for students from US universities.
