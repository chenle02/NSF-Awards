9311568 Krevor This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic program, is concerned with the synthesis, reactivity, solution
structure and dynamic behavior of di- and trinuclear platinum complexes that
contain hydride and/or phosphine ligands. Major emphasis is placed on the use of
two-dimensional multinuclear NMR spectroscopy for structure elucidation. This
proposal deals with fundamental synthetic and structural studies of compounds of
platinum and with new uses of nuclear magnetic resonance as a tool for in situ
structural elucidation. The results of this work may have applications in the
development of new industrial catalysts.
