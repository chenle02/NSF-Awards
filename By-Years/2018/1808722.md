This 1-year project is to enable the participation of young U.S. scientists at
the 3rd Workshop on New Opportunities in the AMS Era: Solar Energetic Particles,
Solar Modulation, and Space Radiation, which will be held in Washington D.C. in
June of 2018. This third workshop in the series will bring together experts from
around the world in the field of cosmic rays, solar energetic particles, and
space radiation with an additional focus on their propagation inside the
heliosphere and their interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere. The workshop
aims to advance present understanding of the radiation environment in the near-
Earth space by combining various observations of energetic particles with theory
and numerical modeling. Therefore, the project supports the goals of the
National Space Weather Action Plan.
