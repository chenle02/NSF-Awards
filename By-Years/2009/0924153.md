This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Faculty Development Award supports
the effective integration of research, teaching and outreach. The research goals
are to investigate novel supramolecular assemblies in well-defined crystalline
networks and to understand their dynamics. The systems under study are
"molecular gyroscopes" that exhibit correlated or "geared" rotations. The
education and outreach goals include promoting undergraduate research and
initiating a mentoring network that will support minority students. The
Discovery Corps Fellowship Program supported postdoctoral and professional
development models that combined research expertise with professional service.
Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellows are eligible to apply for this Faculty
Development Award.
