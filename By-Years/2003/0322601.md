In this project we are investigating a scalable architecture for building
hundreds and thousands of Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuators housed in a compact
body. SMA filaments submerged in special fluids are arranged in matrix form, so
that heat can be removed from and delivered to each of the SMA filaments rapidly
and efficiently. With this matrix architecture, only 2N valves are needed for
delivering fluids to each of N2 SMA array actuators. The architecture is
therefore scalable for building a vast number of actuators: 20 valves for 100
array actuators, and 30 valves for 225 array actuators. In this exploratory
project a test bed for testing 4 by 4 (16 axes) array actuators is being built
in order to study the dynamics and control of the vast array SMA actuators as
well as to investigate scalability of the design. The proposed method can be
integrated with other energy sources, such as fuel cells, micro gas turbines,
and internal combustion engines, for energy saving. These energy sources
eventually produce heat as waste energy, which can be collected with fluids and
used for activating the SMA actuators. This co-energy generation system has the
potential to revolutionize the design of mobile robots, automobiles, and other
mobile platforms. The vast number of SMA array actuators powered by a co-
generation system would allow a mobile platform to perform highly complex,
multifunctional tasks. Like biological creatures, robots will one day be able to
run, leap, and fly, if the vast DOF actuator technology becomes available.
