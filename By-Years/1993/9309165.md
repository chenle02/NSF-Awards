9309165 Coppola This research project deals with the development and application
of perturbation methods for obtaining solutions of strongly nonlinear dynamic
systems. By providing accurate analytical approximations of motion, the
perturbation analysis permit the development of improved design guidelines and
control strategies. They also add to the insights into the effects of
nonlinearities by measuring the influence of parameters on system response. The
method of averaging, employed in this research, involves a near- identity
transformation of variables which simplifies the equations of motion by
separating responses over fast and slow time scales. The result is a reduced
system of equations which is simpler to analyze that the original equations. A
symbolic computational scheme is utilized in this research project. The method
has capabilities of having immediate impact on understanding complex systems
such as the satellite attitude and orbital motion, and exploring generic
behavior of a variety of highly nonlinear dynamic systems.
