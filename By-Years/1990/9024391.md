This project addresses research in the dynamics and control of multiple arm
manipulation. A major difficulty in the implementation of multi arm systems is
the complexity of the dynamic interactions between manipulators. This project
develops an improved dynamics formulation which is expected to provide a more
efficient and physically meaningful model than currently available by closed
chain approaches to multiple arm dynamics. The dynamics model is expected to to
provide a clear, novel, and computationally efficient method of dealing with
both motion and interaction effects at the joint level. It is designed to
clearly display the interactive forces without resorting to complex constraint
equations. Three phases of research are planned and include (1) development of a
multiple manipulator dynamics model, (2) use of this model to develop new load
distribution and control models, and (3) implementation and testing of the
resulting algorithms on a dual arm laboratory facility.
