While studying the nitrogen-fixing endophytes within poplar trees, the profound
discovery was made that some of the isolates were yeast, a eukaryotic organism.
Since it is believed that only prokaryotic organisms can utilize nitrogen from
the air, this was an exciting discovery. In this small grant for exploratory
research, the PIs will identify the eukaryotic genes from these nitrogen-fixing
yeasts that allow growth on nitrogen-free medium, and attempt to isolate mutants
that no longer grow in nitrogen-free medium. The nif gene cluster will be
analyzed and compared with known diazotrophic bacteria and they will determine
whether or not the genes have eukaryotic transcription signals. Identification
of the known genes required for nitrogen fixation within the genome of the yeast
strain will provide compelling evidence for nitrogen fixation by this eukaryotic
organism. Verification that the genes known to be involved in nitrogen fixation
are being expressed in the yeast strains will also provide further support for
eukaryotic nitrogen fixation. If nif mutants can be isolated that no longer fix
nitrogen, and if adding back the nitrogenase genes restores growth on nitrogen-
free medium, it would provide unequivocal evidence of eukaryotic nitrogen
fixation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts resulting from the proposed
activity include an emphasis on training of women in science. Dr. Doty will
continue to lead a graduate level seminar course, Plant-Microbe Interactions in
which she shares her results about the nitrogen fixing endophytes of poplar. The
goal is to publish the results in a first-rate journal, and give seminars to
disseminate the news widely. If successful, this research would cause a paradigm
shift in current understanding of nitrogen fixation since it would be the first
example of a nitrogen-fixing eukaryotic organism.
