Professor John A. Belot of the University of Nebraska Chemistry Department has
submitted a new GOALI proposal for research aimed at exploring and determining
oligomerization, decomposition, and contamination issues affecting the lifetime
and delivery characteristics of volatile MOCVD and ALD precursors for metal
oxide thin films. This proposal involves collaboration between the University of
Nebraska - Lincoln and Air Liquide. Ultimately, the PI's research will attempt
to preclude deleterious reactivity by introducing trace stabilizing additives.
Precursor stability is a critical factor which impacts manufacturability and is
decisive in determining adoption of precursors for thin film growth of metal
oxides by semiconductor manufacturers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will study
the inorganic chemistry of trace hydrolysis, aging, and concentration in select
titanium, hafnium, and lanthanide homoleptic amino- and alkoxides, with the aim
of improving the manufacturability and therefore the adoption of stable
precursors for the deposition of oxide thin films. Undergraduate and graduate
students will be exposed to real world problems and internship opportunities in
a forefront research program in inorganic materials chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
