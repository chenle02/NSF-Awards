This project is designed to implement the NSTA Scope, Sequence, and
Coordination model for science education reform in the Houston Independent
School District and the Conroe Independent School District. With funding from
the U.S. Dept. of Education, preliminary work has already been done in the
Houston School District at the 7th grade level; the current project extends
through the 11th grade and focuses on program development, teacher training,
field testing, and demonstration of grade level models. In addition to working
closely with NSTA, the Baylor College of Medicine joins with Rice University and
the University of Houston in a consortium approach to this project. Cost sharing
in the amount of $310,292 is 23% of the NSF contribution.
