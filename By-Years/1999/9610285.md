9610285 Zhu The primary objective of this project is to determine the kinetics
of atmospheric aldehyde reactions and their photochemistry. Aldehydes are key
participants in photochemical reactions affecting smog processes; their
photodissociation represents a major source of free radicals and organic
aerosols for tropospheric photochemistry. Despite the importance of aldehyde
photolysis in the chemistry of the troposphere, few studies of aldehyde
photolysis product channels and quantum yields have been carried out either
under atmospheric conditions or under conditions that can be readily
extrapolated to those of the atmosphere. Free radicals, such as formyl radicals,
are readily converted in the atmosphere to hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl radicals,
which participate in photochemical oxidation processes. In this project, studies
of the photolysis of aldehydes with five carbon atoms or more, aromatic
aldehydes, and dicarbonyls, will be carried out. The photolysis product channels
and quantum yields will be characterized, as well as their dependence on
photodissociation wavelengths. The relationship between the structure of alkyl
side chains and photolysis quantum yields will be extracted for homologous
series of aldehydes. The experimental studies will be carried out using pulsed
laser photolysis coupled with a sensitive optical absorption technique, cavity
ring-down spectroscopy. In addition to the photolysis studies, the kinetics and
mechanisms of aldehyde formation reactions, such as the reaction of the methoxy
radical with molecular oxygen, will be elucidated.
