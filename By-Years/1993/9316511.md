9316511 Guest The proposed work is part of an integrated research program
("Anzflux") into the oceanographic structure of upper mixed layer of the eastern
Weddell Sea. It is to be carried out from the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer in the
austral winter of 1994. The work proposed here concerns the dynamics of the
forcing of the sea ice cover and the upper ocean by the atmosphere. Measurements
and analyses will include the wind stress and atmospheric heat fluxes, and
upward and downward components of short and long wave radiation. An on-board
rawinsonde system will obtain daily profiles wind, temperature, humidity, and
pressure through the troposphere, and an acoustic sounder will continuously
monitor the structure of the lower atmosphere. Satellite data and imagery will
be used to determine the regional and mesoscale context of the point
measurements from the ship. The major goal of this component of Anzflux is to
provide for the continuity of heat exchange measurements through the ocean/ice
interface into the atmosphere. These measurements, in conjunction with the other
concurrent experiments to quantify the energy brought to the underside of the
ice, will form the basis of a regional study of the processes responsible for
the relatively thick upper mixed layer and thin ice cover. It is believed that
these conditions are only marginally stable, and are maintained by a relatively
high upward heat flux, which, if interrupted, could lead to deep vertical
convection, and a significant change in the oceanic climate. ***
