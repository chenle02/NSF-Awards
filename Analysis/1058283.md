Singular (or nonsmooth) objects arise everywhere in mathematics. To mention just
a few instances, they turn up in the following situations: as limits of smooth
objects (spaces such as Riemannian manifolds, or smooth functions); as
asymptotic "spheres at infinity" of finitely generated groups, objects that
reflect the behavior of the groups at large scales; or in the fine-scale
structure of sets, even in concrete and practical circumstances (irregular
crystals, for instance, or other materials). The principal investigator studies
questions that relate to singular objects and their geometry, and he does
analysis on such objects. Specifically, he seeks to understand the extent to
which the concepts of classical differential (first-order) analysis can be
introduced into such spaces. For example, one would like to have a well-defined
Sobolev space of weakly differentiable functions on certain singular spaces. It
is also important to understand which potentially very singular spaces can be
parametrized by "nice" spaces (say, by Euclidean spaces) via transformations
that distort the basic metric structure only within fixed bounds. The principal
investigator and his students are developing new tools for approaching this type
of problem. Finally, the question of parametrization by a Euclidean space can be
replaced with the requirement of embedability in some finite-dimensional
Euclidean space. The methods that emerge from the project should clarify this
problem as well.

The proposed research relates to applications in two ways. First, singularities
(or impurities) occur everywhere in nature, from the local microstructure of
materials to the large-scale features of the universe. Understanding and dealing
with such singularities is one of the central objectives of modern mathematics
and science. The principal investigator has made contributions to the solution
of this problem in cases where the singularities can be analyzed and then
transformed, with minimal cost, to better behaved models. Second, although not
directly related to the project, there are potential applications of the
research to theoretical computer science, where large and complex data sets need
to be transformed and stored in simpler form.
