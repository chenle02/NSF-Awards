An addition to the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty between the United States and
Mexico will allow for greater sharing of water from the Colorado River. This
agreement calls for a flooding event, planned for from March 2014 to May 2014,
whereby 130 million m3 of water will be released into the dry Colorado River
channel in Mexico. The project will examine how rapid mobilization of carbon and
greenhouse gasses in newly flooded sediments and soils, affect river-carbon
composition and fluxes (land/ocean and land/atmosphere), after being isolated
from an active floodplain. This is particularly important in light of possible
increases in the occurrence of natural flooding events associated with climate
change. It is also an important study in terms of understanding the unintended
consequences of such ecosystem restoration efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project is to be conducted as a cooperative venture between US academic
scientists, USGS scientists and faculty/students from the Universidad Aut√≥noma
de Baja California. The project will generate international experience and
provide a basis for entry into a carbon cycle problem of significant scope. This
project is supported by EAR/HS, EAR/GG, EAR/GLD, DEB/ECO and ISE/GVF.
