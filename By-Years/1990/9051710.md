This project utilizes eight, four channel, wide bandwidth, digital oscilloscopes
to strengthen the digital and microprocessor laboratories. This equipment allows
students to perform new experiments with greater ease and accuracy. Freshman
students gain an appreciation for the automatic setup measurement mode aa well
as the digital readout of significant quantities without the need for manual
calibrations and calculations. This enhances motivation, retention, and
learning. Other students are able to perform experiments and demonstrate
important principles that could not previously be accomplished. The award is
being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
