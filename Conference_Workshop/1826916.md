This travel grant supports US-based junior researchers for participation in the
International Conference on Mathematical Biology, to be held June 22-25 2018 in
Beijing, China. The conference site will be at the Beijing University of Civil
Engineering and Architecture and Jiuhua International Conference Center of
Beijing. This International Conference on Mathematical Biology will bring
together leading experts and young researchers to communicate recent advances in
mathematical modeling and their applications in biology, ecology, epidemiology,
and public health. A main objective of conference activities is to facilitate
collaborations between mathematical modelers and biologists, who may wish to use
models to evaluate ideas about the preservation of endangered species or
conservation of habitat or to develop tools for identifying optimal
interventions to mitigate disease outbreaks or perhaps even to eliminate the
pathogens causing them. Researchers from abroad will not only bring their
expertise, but foster partnerships between Chinese mathematicians, ecologists,
epidemiologists and public policymakers. The conference will consist of plenary
and special session talks and posters. Plenary presentations will be delivered
by internationally recognized experts in mathematical biology. This grant will
provide travel support for young researchers including postdocs and graduate
students from US-based institutions. A unique feature of this conference is a
short-course that will feature introductory lectures, case studies and hands-on
exercises. Activities will emphasize the utility of transmission models in
guiding research programs, designing, evaluating and occasionally improving
public health policy, and communicating counter-intuitive results. Such
activities will prepare mathematical modelers to: 1) develop and analyze
suitable models for infectious diseases that can advance our knowledge of
pathogen spread and control; and 2) generate tools to facilitate public health
practitioners' appreciation of modeling and its utility in disease control and
prevention. More information can be found at
