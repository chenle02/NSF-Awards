ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;12 July 2011&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1118412&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;PI: W.
Byam&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: [None]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests four
Shipboard Scientific Support items for the University of Delaware for use aboard
the R/V HUGH R. SHARP; namely replacement sheaves for the stern A-frame, a
stainless steel docking head for the CTD handling system, additional airborne
and underwater radiated noise treatments for the active stabilization fins, and
a remote control for the port trawl winch. All items will either enhance safety
or provide greatly improved support capabilities to
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit:
The PI addressed the Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit of the proposed
equipment specifically for the R/V HUGH R. SHARP. The research projects
supported have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit. During
operations, these vessels routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students
to seagoing oceanography. Specifically, College of Marine and Earth Studies
participates in a large number of outreach programs including open house events
(Coast Day), participation the MATE program, and educational cruises. The
College also hosts the UNOLS East Coast Van Pool. The R/V HUGH R. SHARP is
scheduled to support over 110 NSF-funded days in CY 2011.
