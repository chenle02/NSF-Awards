Critical research into cybersecurity vulnerabilities may be affected by legal
considerations. For example, cybersecurity researchers fear certain good-faith
work could put them in personal legal jeopardy. At the same time, the risks to
the public and the economy associated with security research must be addressed.
This project convenes a set of leading computer scientists, academics, and
lawyers to map out the challenges and propose a set of concrete solutions,
including articulating reasonable norms, standards, or best practices for the
conduct of cybersecurity research that could be used as a guide for defining
good-faith research and for applying current statutes and exemptions.
