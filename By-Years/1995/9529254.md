There are numerous calls for information policies that will serve U.S. poor
people equitably. However, very little is understood about what poor people know
about or might want or need from advanced information technologies, and how
policies can be shaped to serve their needs as they define them. This one-year
research project will provide empirical data on the penetration of computers and
on-line services in low-income communities in Austin, Texas, how this
community's computers are being used, and what low-income citizens know about
and want from electronic information resources. The project team will conduct
its research in both English and Spanish, using principles of participatory
action research, a kind of investigation that involves the research subjects in
the design and evaluation of the research parameters. The project will begin
with discussions among public housing residents who participate in Family
Learning Center programs, after-school education programs located in public
housing complexes in East and Southeast Austin. The residents will help the
researchers develop surveys and approaches to assessing information resources
available or desired in surrounding low-income neighborhoods. Through the
surveys, participants for small focus groups will be identified and recruited.
After introductions to computer networks, these focus group participants will be
asked about how they might use networks and what kinds of access they believe
their communities need. Focus group participants will meet with City of Austin
officials to assess opportunities for participation in the City's policymaking
with respect to telecommunications. The research team will attempt to understand
and document what obstacles there are to such participation, what values and
needs low-income citizens bring to this issue, and how well the City's
policymaking process serves the assessed needs and values of low-income
neighborhoods. The project will include a participatory evaluation process.
Results of the study will be published in a scholarly journal and configured for
access on the World-Wide Web so that researchers, citizens, and policymakers
throughout the US will have access to them. The project sponsor will also plan a
public conference for fall 1996 on equity on the information superhighway.
