Already in the Middle Ages bell makers knew how to detect invisible cracks by
sounding a bell on the ground before lifting it up to the belfry. Since then,
the relations between sounds and geometric structures have been a central topic
of interest in mathematics with important applications in the broader scientific
community. Steklov eigenvalues play an important role in this context and, for
example, are essential in electrical impedance tomography for medical imaging,
and in the study of linear water waves in physics. In this project, the PI will
reveal new relations between Steklov eigenvalues and the underlying geometry
from which they are derived. Funds for the project will also support the PI’s
efforts to make the research accessible and beneficial to students and young
scholars and to promote the participation of underrepresented groups in
mathematics, through mentoring and conference organization.

This project involves two research directions tied to spectral geometry of
Steklov eigenvalues. In one direction, the PI will study generic properties of
Steklov eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and will investigate domain
perturbations, differential forms and their applications to equidistribution
theorems. In another direction, the PI will investigate Steklov eigenvalues on
smooth metric spaces by studying collapsing manifolds. The PI will promote the
participation of early career, female and other underrepresented group in
mathematics as organizer of AMS special sessions and distinguished lectures
series at Cal State, Long Beach. The PI will also organize career panels for
undergraduate math majors, and a “Math Day at the Beach” for high school
students.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
