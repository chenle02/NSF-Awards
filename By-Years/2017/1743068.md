During a solar eclipse, when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, the
shadow results in cooling of the Earth's atmosphere along the swath that
experiences a total eclipse. It has long been hypothesized that internal gravity
waves (GWs) would be generated in response to sudden horizontal temperature
gradients, that would then propagate away from the region of the shadow. The PI,
who is an early career female, will deploy two imaging spectrographs at separate
locations along the line of totality that will observe airglow before, during,
and after the North American total solar eclipse on August 21, 2017. A third
imager will be located far away from the eclipsed area, to provide a control
dataset. The science objective is to study eclipse-driven gravity wave evolution
in the airglow. This experiment is expected to provide information about how the
atmosphere reacts to fast changes in ozone heating and ionizing photon flux. The
work will also contribute to the debate about where gravity waves form and
propagate during a solar eclipse.
