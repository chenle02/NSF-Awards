The last few years have seen increasing mutual awareness and interaction
between computer science and interactive decision theory (e.g., game theory,
economics). This has been spurred by parallel developments in the two
disciplines: in computer science, the advent of distributed systems; in
interactive decision theory, the analysis of increasingly complex social
systems, leading to the realization that traditional rationality assumptions
make extremely large demands on the information processing capabilities of the
agents. Computer scientists started using game-theoretic and similar interactive
models for the study of distributed computing systems and economists turned to
computer science (finite automata, Turing machines, and actual computer
programs) to model bounded rationality. This project concentrates on three
central problems which arise in this connection: (1) Optimization with limited
memory-the study of the effect of limited capacity on the optimization of
rational agents. The explicit modelling of the cost of information processing.
(2) Common knowledge-to introduce the idea of "formal common knowledge" which
would, practically speaking, achieve all the desirable coordination consequences
that would be achieved under common knowledge. (3) Social interaction with
bounded rationality-to formulate the presence of irrationality in social systems
and define their equilibria. That is, the project initiates a serious study of
the behavior of interactive systems when some or all of the agents are bounded
rational.//
