This research will concentrate on two approaches for analyzing the effectiveness
of algorithms for a class of significant hard optimization problems -- the
bottleneck problems -- with applications to location theory, routing, and
communication network design. These approaches are probabilistic analysis of
heuristic algorithms, and worst case analysis of heuristic algorithms. Although
these approaches are often considered theoretical in nature, they can have
profound practical implications. Currently, algorithm design is largely an ad
hoc procedure, whether the goal is to analyze the algorithm based on its
expected or worst case performance, or to provide bounding procedures within a
branch-and-bound context. The aims of this research are to study the bottleneck
problems from several different viewpoints and to devise unified techniques
rather than separate, haphazard problem-dependent methods.
