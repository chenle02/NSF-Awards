This action funds Jeffrey Wayne Streicher of The University of Texas at
Arlington to conduct a research project, entitled "Genetic consequences of
forest fragmentation in two frog species from Singapore," during the summer of
2012 at National University of Singapore in Singapore. The host scientist is Dr.
David Bickford.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is that it provides a valuable
commentary on the effects of deforestation in a tropical region with high levels
of biodiversity. Using populations of frog species from the heavily urbanized
country of Singapore, rates and patterns of gene flow are being characterized
among several discontinuous forest fragments.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
