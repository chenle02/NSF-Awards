The Laboratory of Anthropology of the Museum of New Mexico holds a significant
assemblage of ethnographic objects from the American Southwest. Based on a
comprehensive conservation needs survey, the museum staff has identified
irreplaceable, perishable ethnographic artifacts that are rapidly deteriorating.
These include baskets, objects of wood, leather, and rawhide. Many of these
cannot be safely handled due to their deteriorating condition, and hence are
unavailable for research. Conservators will be hired to preserve and stabilize
the most damaged objects. Staff will repair, remove mold and the effects of
pollution, build protective mounts and containers, and improve storage units.
The objects to be conserved are part of one of the largest, best documented, and
most significant, systematic collections in the country. They are an almost
complete reference collection for groups living in the American Southwest and
northern Mexico. As such, they are invaluable for anthropological research.
