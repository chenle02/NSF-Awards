This project is concerned with research in group theory. There are several
different directions that this research will take. The principal investigators
will study the subgroup structure of the finite simple groups, examine flag
transitive linear spaces and produce a unified and accessible treatment of the
existence and uniqueness of the sporadic groups. In addition, the Brauer
centralizer algebras associated to the orthogonal and symplectic groups will be
examined, including connections of these algebras to enumerative combinatorics
and representations of the Braid group. This research deals with various aspects
of group theory. One part is concerned with problems dealing with finite simple
groups; the other with group representation theory and combinatorics. These are
both very active areas and the results will be of interest to investigators in
many areas of mathematics.
