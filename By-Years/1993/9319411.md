9319411 Mullen This is a collaborative project between Dr. Steven Mullen of the
University of Arizona and Dr. Frederick Sanders (ATM-9318751). The goal is to
understand the impact of initial data uncertainty in short-range (1-2 day) and
extended range (3-5 day) forecasts of explosive cyclogenesis. This will be
accomplished through diagnostic studies and forecast experiments. Both a global
spectral model and a limited-area mesoscale model will be used to produce model
simulations of cyclone cases. Analyses of observed cases will be examined as
well. In addition, the PIs plan to conduct Monte-Carlo ensemble forecasts to
evaluate the efficacy of this technique in minimizing the negative impact of
forecast variability. Explosive cyclogenesis events, whether over land or ocean,
represent potentially dangerous storms in terms of both economics and safety.
The principal investigators hope to provide insights into the most promising
ways to improve the forecasts of such storms. ***
