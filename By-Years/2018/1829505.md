US-Spain Collaboration in Computational Neuroscience, Madrid, February 15-16,
2018.

This award supports a workshop, led by Adrienne Fairhall and Javier Mart?n
Buld?, on US-Spain collaboration in computational neuroscience. The workshop
builds on the interests of multiple NSF directorates and NIH institutes, and
Spain's State Research Agency (AEI), in this rapidly developing area of
research.

The workshop has been organized to explore the intellectual opportunities,
broader impacts, and practical considerations needed for US-Spain collaboration
to be successful, with researchers and government representatives from the US
and Spain in attendance. A report from the workshop will be made available at
http://www.nsf.gov/crcns.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
