The objective of the proposed research is to obtain an improved understanding of
the transport phenomena occurring during solidification of multicomponent
mixtures. The research is aimed at investigating the effects of buoyancy and
solid/liquid density difference driven flow in the liquid phase on the heat and
mass transfer and solidification processes. A consistent model that integrates
the description of the transport phenomena occurring on a macroscopic level,
such as momentum, energy, and species transfer due to convection and diffusion,
as well as on a microscopic level, such as nucleation, interfacial transfer, and
growth of the microstructures will be developed. The theoretical work will be
supplemented by a comprehensive experimental program through which qualitative
and quantitative information about the relevant transport phenomena can be
obtained and which serves to validate the model predictions. The results
obtained through the proposed research will contribute to improved understanding
and control of a wide range of processes involving solidification and will lead
to more realistic predictions and optimization of material properties. The work
is pertinent to ingot solidification, shape casting, directional solidification,
continuous casting, welding processes, rapid solidification, electroslag
remelting, as well as coating, purification, crystal growth and polymer
production.
