Neural network threshold autoregressive models are investigated in this
project. This model may be used with advantage in pattern recognition. Effect of
a misspecified model on forecasting will also be investigated. The properties of
a predictive Kullback-Leibler divergence measure will be investigated.
Predictive diagnostic checking will also be explored.
