This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will introduce novel
separation techniques to improve the efficiency and product quality in
rechargeable lithium battery recycling. Producing high purity materials from
scrap is difficult to achieve. Current separation practices rely on the use of
high temperatures or strong chemicals to separate various elements from the
waste mix; typically, landfill is the only economic option for end-of life
cells. This project will develop an efficient system to produce battery
materials from scrap batteries without treating scrap as an ore body for
elements. The objective of this project is to improve the purity of material
recovered from electronic scrap by an order of magnitude, compared to current
practices, while reducing the cost of operation. The intellectual property
developed in this project will advance the knowledge and industrial practice for
highly efficient material recycling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the
potential of developing a cost efficient green technology that saves material
resources, energy, and landfill space. Innovative recycling technology will be
essential to the future service industry for scrap material generated from
consumer electronics and vehicles. Materials are a major fraction of battery
cost. If successful, this project will result in high quality secondary
materials at a very low cost. By reducing the energy expended to produce and
manufacture advanced materials from one product generation to another and
minimizing low value scrap materials that are disposed in landfills, successful
outcome of this project will impact the life cycle cost of rechargeable
batteries. The project will provide educational opportunities for undergraduate
students in the pursuit of science, math, engineering and technology
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
