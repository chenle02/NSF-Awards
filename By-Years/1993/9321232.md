9321232 Wang The technique of ion implantation has been utilized in the
semiconductor industry. Thin film ceramic superconductors are expected to be
integrated with semiconductors for future microelectronics applications. The
prospect of having ion implantation for superconductor thin film processing
would be extremely desirable, since it is compatible with present
microelectronics technology. To date the overall effort on the utilization of
ion implantation for superconductivity processing is quite limited. ***
