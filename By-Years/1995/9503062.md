9503062 Weiss A principal goal of this project is to determine the Hochschild
and cyclic cohomology groups for the full algebra of bounded Hilbert space
operators relative to an arbitrary 2-sided ideal. These computations have been
recently linked to characterizing commutator ideals. Trace extensions and the
structure of commutators and commutator spaces will be investigated and
exploited to yield information on the homology, determinants and K-theory of
operator ideals. This project lies at the interface of two mathematical areas.
On one side, the project concerns delicate explicit computations of commutators
of operators. Operator theory evolved as an abstraction of the equations of
mathematical physics. A commutator corresponds to the difference between ordered
observations. In another direction, a collection of operators can often be
considered as an algebraic structure called an operator algebra. Certain
invariants of such algebras play an important role in several disciplines
including mathematical physics and geometry. The purpose of this project is to
realize these invariants by performing delicate commutator computations. ***
