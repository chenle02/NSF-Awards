Why do some reproductive patterns persist despite their costs to the health of
females? The evolutionary consequences of social behavior variation of nonhuman-
animal females are unknown, but important for understanding why some patterns of
mating within populations are more common than others. The investigators will
complete a comparative experimental study of behavioral and demographic
variation of females in multiple species of Drosophila (model organisms) for
which phylogenetic relationships and ecology are known, but social and mating
behavior unknown. The investigators will collect flies from the wild, culture
them and perform controlled experiments in the laboratory to evaluate whether
multiple matings confer benefits to the health of females and their offspring;
females will be allowed to mate only one time or multiple times with one or
multiple males and the health of the females and their offspring will be
measured. Data will be deposited to an online repository, to FLYBASE, and
available in published papers coauthored by undergraduate collaborators,
postdoctoral associates, and senior personnel. Undergraduate participants will
contribute substantially and collaboratively as research partners to the
programmatic enterprise in a broader impacts activity, a scientific research
immersion, that is an integrated part of the research, designed to introduce
students to experimental research science from project implementation,
execution, data acquisition, analysis, primary-report production, and response
to the critiques of their colleagues before submission to scientific journals.
The study will provide large data sets for efficient testing of hypotheses,
producing general insights. Thus, it is important in providing controlled
experimental data in comparative perspective about a general puzzle, currently
unanswerable in other longer-lived model organisms or humans.
