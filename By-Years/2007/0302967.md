ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Research: Enhancing Diversity in Geosciences in
North Carolina&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaborative effort
between North Carolina State University (NCSU), a Research I University, North
Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NC A&amp;T), an
Historically Black University, and Robeson Community College (RCC), a community
college serving a predominantly minority student body. This project will develop
and enhance geoscience education and research capabilities at two participating
minority serving institutions, enabling them to collaborate with a major
research university to expand opportunities for students from underrepresented
groups to participate in geoscience education and research through geoscience
course study, structured undergraduate research training, and academic and
professional support activities. NCSU has existing bachelors, masters and
doctoral programs in geosciences, while neither NC A&amp;T nor RCC has
geoscience degree programs. The objective of this program is to provide an
opportunity for the minority student populations at NC A&amp;T and RCC to become
geoscientists by adding introductory level courses at RCC and by adding a
geophysics concentration to the physics program at NC A&amp;T, and by enhancing
research infrastructure and undergraduate research training in geosciences at NC
A&amp;T and RCC. The program will emphasize undergraduate research, will include
geoscience curriculum enhancement and comprehensive support activities to
maximize retention and graduation, and has assessment elements to evaluate each
program element. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
