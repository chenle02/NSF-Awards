9421714 Wojcicki Two research projects at the forefront of elementary particle
physics are supported by this grant to a Stanford University faculty member,
postdoctoral associates and graduate students. Data recently obtained will be
analyzed to yield by far the best results on rare decays of neutral K mesons.
That will provide critical tests of the validity of the Standard Model
theoretical structure and clues to its possible extension and refinement. The
masses of the neutrinos the lightest members of the elementary particle families
a continuing important subject. Recent hints that those masses are not zero
provide further stimulus for the second activity, a conceptual feasibility
study, in collaboration with physicists at other institutions in this country
and abroad, of a bold experimental search for oscillations among neutrinos in
different families whose objective is a specific technical design that will make
use of National Laboratory facilities. ***
