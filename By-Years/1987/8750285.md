Technical advances in the design and current applications of the Scanning
Electron Microscope (SEM) are making it increasingly desirable for undergraduate
Biology majors to gain experience in using it. The recent arrival of two new
faculty members with expertise in SEM technology have made this a propitious
time for the Department to develop two new courses, Electron Microscopy and
Advanced Developmental Biology. Both of these use scanning electron microscopy
as a primary technique. In addition, the SEM will be used for demonstrations in
the Introductory Biology, Developmental Biology (core) and Botany courses,
providing an introduction to the instrument for all students taking courses in
this Department. This faculty successfully employed a SEM in the instructional
program until the demise of their former instrument several years ago. The old
SEM had featured prominently in student research projects. Based on their
educational experience with the earlier, somewhat primitive instrument, they now
have selected a modern, more adaptable instrument - - the Zeiss DSM 950. The
virtues of this instrument include its ease of operation for students and its
digitalized design which allows integration into existing computer facilities,
providing enhanced capability for automating analyses. The Department already
possessed the requisite ancillary equipment such as coating devices, critical-
point drying apparatus and computer facilities. Thus funds were needed only for
the SEM itself. A substantial contribution from the Hilden Trust, when added to
the College matching funds, has provided a substantial overmatch to the Federal
grant for this project.
