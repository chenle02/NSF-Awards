Research will be performed on (1) Statistical micromechanical damage mechanics:
to characterize advanced brittle materials containing many interacting
microcracks. (2) Micro-mechanics of heterogeneous composites: to predict micro-
macro correlation of particle reinforced advanced composites. (3) Inelastic
constitutive theories: to develop novel plasticity and visco- plasticity
formulations and algorithms. (4) Dynamic strain softening and localization;
Nonlinear frictional contact-impact finite element formulations.
