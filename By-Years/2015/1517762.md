Many of the best studied planetary systems orbit nearby A-Type stars, which are
stars that are slightly more massive than the Sun. This project will use Georgia
State University's Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy interferometer
array (CHARA) to determine the fundamental properties of these stars (for
example, sizes and surface temperatures) that, among other things, will enable
much more accurate estimates of their age. Accurate ages are critical for
determining how planetary systems change with time. This program will train a
junior astronomer (a postdoctoral researcher) and two undergraduate students in
a high profile area of scientific research. Project participants will also
participate in public outreach activities at Georgia State University's Hard
Labor Creek Observatory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will use the CHARA
interferometer array to survey 60 nearby A-Type stars. They will precisely
measure the oblate shapes of rapidly rotating stars and model the effect of
gravity darkening. These measurements will provide more accurate comparisons
with evolutionary models, from which masses and ages can be inferred. The
results could enable new scientific advances, including tests of evolutionary
models that account for rapid stellar rotation, constraints on theories for how
and why some A-Type stars are chemically peculiar, a temporal stamp for the
evolutionary stage of the debris disks and/or planetary systems that some of
these stars harbor, and empirical relations for correcting the biases in mass
and age estimates of more distant, and thus spatially unresolved, rapidly
rotating A-Type Stars.
