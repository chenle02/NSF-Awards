The principal investigator applies tools from algebraic representation theory
and from number theory to study deformations of representations of profinite
groups and of complexes of modules for such groups. Deformations and deformation
rings have been at the center of remarkable recent progress in the theory of
Galois representations and modular forms. This project has four main goals: (1)
to study the connection of deformations to the non-existence of solutions to
certain embedding problems; (2) to find bounds on the singularities of universal
deformation rings; (3) to determine the ring structure of universal deformation
rings of representations of finite groups; and (4) to develop an obstruction
theory for deformations of complexes. The principal investigator also works on
one other project on degenerations of modules over a finite dimensional algebra.
The main goal of this second project is to use Grassmannians to study top-stable
degenerations of local modules.

Groups are abstract mathematical objects by which one may encode and study
symmetry, for example in chemical molecules, crystals, networks, or abstract
mathematical structures. Representations of groups provide a way to extract
information about the internal structures of a group. Roughly speaking,
representations can be thought of as "linearized snapshots" of the group which
are given by explicitly described matrices. In this project, the principal
investigator studies deformations of representations. The deformations of a
given representation form a family of representations which are associated to
this representation in a certain way. In case there is a single deformation
which can be used to uniquely describe all other deformations, one talks about a
universal deformation. Universal deformations provide universal constructions
which can be used to solve certain problems all at once, which otherwise would
have to be solved in a case-by-case fashion. This project belongs to the
mathematical areas of representation theory and number theory. Research in these
areas has in the past had unexpected applications to subjects such as
cryptography and error correcting codes, and in this way has been a benefit to
society.
