This study will determine the absolute plate velocity of the Izanagi Plate of
the Western Paleo Pacific during the early Cretaceous. Preliminary modelling
suggests that the Izanagi Plate reached velocities as high as 20 cm/yr,
substantially faster than those of present day plates. An independent measure of
the Izanagi Plate motion will be obtained from paleomagnetic study of an
accreted oceanic rise in the Tokoro belt of Hokkaido, Japan, thought to be a
remnant of the plate. The Tokoro belt comprises pillow basalts and flows,
radiolarian chert, pelagic limestone, and overlying continentally-derived rocks.
Preliminary paleomagnetic data from the Tokoro belt suggests an equatorial
origin for the pelagic limestones and implies a minimum plate velocity of 13
cm/yr. A thorough paleomagnetic investigation of the Tokoro belt will be
undertaken to determine the absolute plate velocity of the Izanagi Plate. The
results will provide fundamental new data on accretion rates at continental
margins and will provide necessary constraints for modelling of plate-driving
mechanisms.
