This engineering education research award to Texas Engineering Experiment
Station in collaboration with Saint Mary's University will employ researchers in
the development of new methods and web-based tools to integrate design of
automated manufacturing into the engineering curriculum. Automated manufacturing
is highly complex and collaborative, and it requires systems level approaches to
solving problems. This work will develop new virtual collaborative learning
environments with emphasis on communication and teamwork for engineering
students studying automated manufacturing. It will allow students to engage in
more realistic collaborative activities with other students and also with
working engineers. Input from 100 companies will provide an understanding of
current practices, and the results of this research will be of benefit to both
engineering students and industry. Advanced automated manufacturing capability
is essential to national competitiveness, and effective integration of systems
level thinking into the engineering curriculum using this research will better
prepare engineering students to work in this area.
