The project takes a new approach to simplifying the construction of distributed
multimedia applications. The I/O abstractions put forth separate the description
of the communication structures from the computational components of a system,
such that software modules written in existing programming languages are
integrated flexibly and dynamically. The logical connections among the data
interfaces of independent software modules provide a uniform high-level view of
communication for both discrete and continuous data. The high-level view of
communication is not only intuitive for users, but it also offers a means to
establish protection for data and applications and provides opportunities for
low-level optimizations. The project develops the software support needed for
implementing the I/O abstractions, and evaluates using applications in four
domains: digital libraries, collaborative work, simu\-lation and medi\-cal
imag\-ing. The Washington University's high speed ATM network is used as a
testbed for the development work.
