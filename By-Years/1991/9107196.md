This project concerns the asymptotic solution of nonlinear boundary value
problems whose solutions involve boundary and interior layer regions of rapid
change. Extensive numerical computation must be carried out to solve these
problems for specific values. Also, involved in the solution is symbolic
computation for both regular perturbation problems and for carrying out
Poincare-Lindstedt type procedures. Symbolic computation promises new techniques
and methods for these problems. This project is in the general area of applied
mathematics and, more specifically, in the area of singular perturbations. Of
special note in this project will be the use of symbolic computation for
boundary layer and shock problems. This research has wide applications to
engineering.
