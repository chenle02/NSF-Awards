Integrated circuit technology continues to progress in the direction of higher
device density and with it, a higher density of waste heat that must be removed
in order to maintain the electronics below their desired operating temperatures.
In the majority of applications, including personal computers and workstations,
cellular phones, hand-held electronics, and automotive applications, economic
and other practical considerations restrict thermal management solutions to air-
cooled systems. Air cooling technology is often the limiting factor in
determining the size and performance of electronic products, and novel concepts
to improve air cooling capabilities are much needed.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the
proposed work is to produce ion driven air flow at the microscale, integrated
within micro-featured heat generating surfaces. It is the aim of this work to
fill a technological gap in microscale convective cooling by developing a pump
that is itself truly at the microscale. The key advancement proposed in this
work is the generation of unipolar ions in air. A single ion species can be
accelerated in an electric field, efficiently creating fluid motion. Preliminary
calculations of the heat transfer rates achievable using ion driven pumping of
air through microchannels show that as much as 40 W/cm2 of heat rejection is
possible by this technique. This cooling rate compares favorably to those in
many liquid-cooled applications and would provide an air-cooling alternative to
meet the needs of future semiconductor devices. Funding is being provided by the
Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program of the Chemical and Transport
Systems Division.&lt;br/&gt;
