The Principal Investigator, in conjunction with a material scientist, will
derive and use models based on upscaling and first principles (conservation
laws, second law of thermodynamics) to predict behavior of concrete and specific
smart materials. New physical concepts which have been previously derived
theoretically for swelling porous materials in general, will be tested
experimentally. The modeling&lt;br/&gt;approach not only provides more accurate
models for complex materials, but also yields new insight into &lt;br/&gt;how
microscopic structure affects macroscopic behavior. The results may lead to
ideas for engineering new materials (such as smart materials) or improving the
quality of existing materials (e.g. concrete).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
successful development of the model will depend on relating theoretical
parameters to those which are measurable. Dr. Yunping Xi of C.E. at Boulder will
provide the expertise as far as understanding the&lt;br/&gt;critical physical
processes which must be captured and the necessary experiments needed to
determine material coefficients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific impact of
this proposal is an improved understanding of the physics of concrete and smart
materials, as well as an improved model which may be used to better predict and
understand&lt;br/&gt;macroscopic behavior. Broader impacts include educating
graduate students, applied mathematicians, and material scientists of
theoretical knowledge and practical needs associated with material science
sufficient for increased collaboration between the two
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This IGMS project is jointly supported by the
MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of
Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
