This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF-0019. This NIRT project
focuses on the study of charge transport in molecular systems. An
interdisciplinary team from physics and chemistry, working in the areas of
nanoscale synthesis, high-precision structural characterization,
electrochemistry, DNA chemistry, microfluidic techniques, and the use of novel
nanoscale materials will be engaged in the effort. There are two principal
experimental thrusts to the work: 1) the systematic exploration of electronic
tunneling through solvents and other small, well-characterized molecules and 2)
a rigorous study of charge transport through DNA. The award is jointly funded by
the Divisions of Physics and Chemistry.
