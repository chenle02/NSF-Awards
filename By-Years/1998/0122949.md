The MCIS (Mathematics, Computer Science and Mathematics Education) Department at
Mississippi Valley State University developed the Odyssey 2001 Scholarship
program to recruit underrepresented students from the Mississippi Delta region
of the state. Odyssey 2001 Scholarships help to increase the number of community
college transfer students at the University and to assist students in
successfully completing the gatekeeper courses required by CSEM majors. Scholars
participate in research opportunities and internships before joining the
workforce at graduation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
