Random matrices play a central and fundamental role in various areas of science,
including mathematical physics, data mining, random noise perturbation,
combinatorics, statistics, and theoretical computer science. For example, the
Wigner semicircle distribution, which arises as a limiting distribution of
eigenvalues of random symmetric matrices in the large-size limit, was first
observed in the study of nuclear physics. This research project is a rigorous
mathematical study of the phenomena of singularity and universality in random
matrices. This research is expected to lead to a more complete and deeper
understanding of random matrices, with considerable impact on related areas of
science.

Technically speaking, two aspects of random systems will be studied: singularity
and universality. This includes the analysis of the repulsion of Wigner matrix
eigenvalues and of random polynomial roots, and specifically the study of
certain Wegner-type estimates for matrix eigenvalues and, for random polynomial
roots, the repulsion phenomenon under minimal conditions on the random
coefficients. The goal under the universality aspect focuses on a central limit
theorem-type result for the logarithmic determinant of Wigner matrices and
certain equidistribution properties of the eigenvectors.
