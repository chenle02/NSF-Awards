9730648 McInerney The Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS), in
collaboration with the Expert-center for Taxonomic Identification (ETI),
Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and Ward's Natural Science Establishment, Inc.
Rochester, New York, are developing and publishing an interactive CD-ROM on
taxonomy, systematics, and biodiversity for use in high school biology courses.
Ten developed activities are interactive and laboratory-based investigations
that allow students to use a variety of data (for example, morphological,
behavioral, and molecular) to construct and analyze classifications of groups of
organisms both extant and extinct. The approach is one of viewing classification
systems as active hypotheses that represent current understandings and
relatedness of life on earth. Students are able to access the database that is
central to the CD-ROM and are directed to other, public databases that are
related to systematics and biodiversity.
