A conference on the Global Circulation of the Atmosphere will be held at the
California Institute of Technology, November 4-6, 2004. This conference will
bring together experts in the theory of the global circulation of the
atmosphere, with the aim of assessing the current state of our understanding and
defining important outstanding questions. The conference program consists of
invited lectures by the leading scientists in the field as well as contributed
talks and posters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this award for student travel
support, students interested in the dynamical mechanisms responsible for the
maintenance and variability of the global circulation will be enabled to
participate in this event.
