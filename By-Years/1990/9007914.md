This award from the Chemistry Division's Special Projects Office will support
an experimental outreach activity which is a joint effort between the American
Chemical Society and the National Science Foundation. The purpose is to develop
a mechanism for improved communication to the public on developments in
chemistry, focussing on those supported by the National Science Foundation. The
American Chemical Society will make available extensive resources of its ACS
News Service to review NSF research reports and essays for news potential by the
press, radio, and TV; to review with authors and principal investigators the
present status and potential applications of new research developments; to
write, produce and distribute a monthly bulletin of newsworthy items for follow-
up; to provide capsule summaries of stories with contact information; to
research, write, produce and distribute two full news releases each month; and
to list all materials available on an electronic bulletin board.
