ABSTRACT PROPOSAL # : DEB-9707556 INVESTIGATOR(S) : NEPSTAD AND DAVIDSON
INSTITUTION: WOODS HOLE RESEARCH CENTER Severe droughts associated with the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO) have been common in tropical regions
in recent years, and long-term reductions in rainfall in the tropics are
predicted from many climate models. Up to two million km2 of Amazonian forest,
representing one-fifth of the world's moist tropical forest, depends on annual
recharge of deep (&gt;2 m) soil moisture, and is therefore susceptible to
rainfall reduction. As a result, forests that normally extend like firebreaks
through the forest-pasture landscape become flammable. The mortality of drought-
vulnerable understory and hardwood trees leads to a reduction in above-ground
biomass. Soil water depletion also leads to a reduction in below-ground
production and, hence, in soil respiration and soil carbon storage. In this
research, responses to drought of two tropical forests with similar rainfall
patterns and soils will be compared: a high evergreen forest of eastern Amazonia
and a low evergreen forest of the Cerrado Region of central Brazil. The response
of these forests to rainfall reduction will be compared to the response of the
grass-dominated ecosystems that are common in both regions. Rainfall will be
reduced experimentally using a network of clear, portable panels that intercept
incoming rain during the rainiest months and transport this water outside of the
plots. Canopy phenology and stem sapflow, fine fuel characteristics, soil
respiration and water content, root distribution and tree mortality will be
compared for control and rainfall-excluded plots.
