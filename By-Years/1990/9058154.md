The objectives of this research are to investigate and explain the four basic
steps of the welding of plastics and composites: (1) heating and heat transfer,
(2) squeeze flow, (3) intermolecular diffusion, and (4) through experimentation
and modeling. The research will include: determining the heating mechanisms and
heat transfer for internal and external heating methods, predicting the squeeze
flow of viscoelastic liquids under combined static and dynamic loadings,
evaluating methods for measuring intermolecular diffusion, investigating the
effects of time, temperature pressure on diffusion and healing of weld
interfaces, and evaluating the effects of cooling on microstructure and on
residual stresses and distortions. The results of these studies will be used to
model new and existing welding processes like hot plate, vibration, laser,
infrared, resistance, induction, and others. The research will also determine
the effect of process parameters on weld quality, and enable development of
sensors for closed-loop control of these processes. This research could lead to
better, faster, more reliable, and less costly manufacturing of plastic and
composite structures.
