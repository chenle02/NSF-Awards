9512396 Kash A shared equipment facility will be established in support of
research programs in optical materials and devices. There are five major
components to the facility: an ultraviolet photolithography laboratory; a device
processing laboratory consisting of a reactive ion etcher, thermal evaporator,
and sputtering system; a materials preparation section with tools for sawing and
polishing; a display cell fabrication laboratory; and a device and materials
characterization laboratory for electrical and thermal measurements. Three core
programs in optical materials share the infrastructure needs and research
interests. One program will use the facility for fabrication and electrical
characterization of semiconductor structures of reduced dimensionality with
applications in linear and nonlinear optics. A second program studies organic
and polymeric nonlinear optical materials, and requires the facility for
characterization of the glass transition in optical polymers as well as for
fabrication of devices and substrates. A third program emphasizes optical
studies of liquid crystals and complex fluids, and requires the display
fabrication and characterization facilities. The instrumentation will be housed
in central facilities and will be available to other researchers both on-campus
and at collaborating institutions. %%% The shared equipment facility will
benefit three major programs which form the core of an optical materials
concentration within the department. These programs, studying semiconductor
materials of reduced dimensionality, liquid crystals, and polymeric materials,
encompass materials with important applications in linear and nonlinear optical
devices. ***
