Under this award, the PIs will measure the seismic velocities, modal mineralogy,
water content, and mineral and rock elastic properties in order to understand
what controls the seismic velocity variation with depth in the lower ocean
crust. Whereas conventional wisdom suggests that the observed velocity changes
with depth in lower ocean crust (seismic layer 3) and the observed velocity
gradients are controlled by increasing pressure and decreasing alteration
(chlorite) with depth, recent evidence by the PIs indicates these factors are
unlikely to exert major control. Instead, preliminary data suggest that the
presence of hydrous minerals and the overall water content of the rocks may
control the seismic velocities. The additional measurements for samples from ODP
holes 504B, 735B, 894G, and 923A will be used to test this hypothesis and extend
the findings to answer several specific questions about the relationships
between mineralogy, cracks, water content, and hydrous phases, on the seismic
velocities and velocity gradients in the lower ocean crust.
