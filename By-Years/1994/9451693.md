9451693 Boatman Support is requested for the purchase of biotechnology equipment
in order to improve the Biology program at Hollins College. This equipment will
allow us to modernize the laboratory for our Genetics course and to introduce a
new Molecular Genetics Laboratory. It will also allow us to use polymerase chain
reaction experiments in courses and undergraduate research in the Biology and
Biochemistry programs at Hollins College. The Biology and Chemistry Departments
have long and successful records of preparing students for graduate study in
biology, biochemistry, medicine and related fields. This success is due in part
to our strong emphasis on undergraduate research. We are well equipped in many
areas, but our lack of sufficient modern equipment for biotechnology results in
serious deficiencies in our program. In order to provide our students with
instruction and research experience at a high experimental level, we need to
secure equipment for nucleic acid manipulation. Acquisition of this equipment
will allow our students to gain experience with techniques that are central to
biology, biochemistry and molecular biology.
