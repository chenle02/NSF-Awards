0220458&lt;br/&gt;Behringer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this
project is to understand the genetic differences that underlie morphological
variation between mammalian species. Dr. Behringer hypothesizes that many of
these genetic differences reside in DNA sequences that regulate the
transcription of developmental control genes. He has chosen to focus upon the
classic developmental biology paradigm of vertebrate limb development. He
proposes to make functional comparisons between mouse and bat limb morphogenesis
because compared to mouse, bats have highly modified limbs. The developmental
control gene that he proposes to study, Prx1, encodes a paired homeodomain
transcription factor that is required in mice for limb and craniofacial
development. He has localized a discreet &lt;600 bp DNA segment encoding a
transcriptional enhancer that directs limb expression in a Prx1-specific pattern
during mouse development. He has isolated the Prx1 orthologue from bat (Carollia
perspicillata) libraries that we have generated. He is characterizing the
expression pattern of this gene in bat embryos by whole-mount and section RNA in
situ hybridization. He has identified the putative limb enhancer of the bat Prx1
gene by virtue of its conserved DNA sequence and genomic position relative to
mouse and human orthologues. He will test the activity of this putative limb
enhancer using a lacZ reporter assay in transgenic mice. He will then replace
the endogenous limb enhancer of the mouse Prx1 gene with the bat Prx1 limb
enhancer by gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Thus, mice will
be generated where the mouse Prx1 gene is expressed under the control of the bat
Prx1 limb enhancer. He will assess the morphological consequences of this
regulatory element alteration in the limbs. He proposes that this type of highly
focused in vivo test will provide important insights into the genetic basis of
morphological divergence. In addition, his studies should further our
understanding of how regulatory diversity can modulate organogenesis.&lt;br/&gt;
