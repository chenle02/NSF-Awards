This award supports the acquisition of several pixel charge- coupled device
(CCD) sensors in support of ground-based optical observing at San Diego State
University's Mount Laguna Observatory. Several of these will be unthinned and
one will be thinned and anti-reflection coated for enhanced blue and ultraviolet
sensitivity. They will be manufactured by the Ford Aerospace foundry following
Science Applications International Corporation's (SAIC) design. San Diego State
will assist SAIC in the testing and characterization of the CCD's in selecting
the devices for delivery, as well as to help SAIC develop improved devices and
to determine their range of performance characteristics. The thinned sensor will
provide improved quantum efficiency and a factor of 9.4 larger detector area
than the currently available TI sensor. The CCD's will be controlled by a
quadrant readout camera controller designed at San Diego State, and by a dual
processor instrument control and image processing computer system. The thinned
CCD will be targeted to three ongoing observational programs - the optical and
near infrared imaging of Bok globules, studies of the physics of plasmas in
stars, and a search for and monitoring of novae in external galaxies.
