In this project the P.I. will develop equations describing the saltation and
suspension characteristics plus the transport rates that result when poorly
sorted marine sediment is transported by bottom currents. Focus will be on
parameterization of the effective bed roughness and accounting for mixed
sediment grain sizes.
