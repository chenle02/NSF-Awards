How do we recognize real-world objects from the auditory events that they
produce? Objects can generate and reflect sound as well as light, and people can
recognize objects on the basis of either kind of information. Yet we know almost
nothing about auditory object recognition compared with the vast literature on
visual object recognition. With funding from the National Science Foundation,
Dr. Heller will examine how the human auditory system uses time-varying acoustic
information to support the perception of auditory events. In an unprecedented
series of experiments, Dr. Heller will bring rigorous experimental methods to
bear on the study of real-world auditory events such as breaking glasses and
bouncing balls. The experiments are designed to discover the relationship
between event properties, such as sound-generating materials and their dynamics,
and their resulting event percepts. The aim is to bridge the gap between the
detailed knowledge that we have of low-level auditory processing and the more
ecologically-valid, but understudied, perception of events in the world. Results
from these experiments will serve as the basis for further work on the complex
interactions among event properties that give rise to larger-scale events. An
additional benefit to the academic community will be the construction of an
extensive environmental sound database that will be made freely available over
the web.&lt;br/&gt;
