This proposal encompasses the preparation of a variety of cyclic and acyclic
compounds from environmentally friendly and readily available starting
materials. The Louie's laboratory recently discovered a potentially important
intermediate in Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. Mechanistic analysis of
both cycloaddition reactions as well as cross-coupling reactions will be
continued. Concurrent to these investigations, reactive M-CO2 intermediates will
be synthesized and their reactivity toward other substrates will be explored
with the intention of incorporating these reactivity patterns into the
repertoire of new catalytic reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of
Professor Janis Louie of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah.
Professor Louie's research efforts revolve around the development of facile
transition metal-mediated methods for the formation of cyclic and acyclic
compounds. In addition, new methods for utilizing benign starting materials such
as carbon dioxide will be evaluated. Successful development of the methodology
will have an impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical and agricultural
industries.
