Little is known about sex determination or the genetics of the sex chromosomes
of dioecious species of flowering plants. It is proposed to identify molecular
markers on the large X and Y sex chromosomes of Silene alba. Such markers will
make it possible to ask genetic questions concerning sex differentiation,
evolution, sex chromosome recombination, and dosage compensation in flowering
plants; questions which cannot now be asked. Obtaining such markers will have a
significant impact in making such inquiries feasible research areas for many
scientists.*** //
