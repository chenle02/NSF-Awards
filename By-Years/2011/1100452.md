The long-term goal of this work is to develop transformative technologies for
the actuation and control of mobile, soft robots in challenging field
applications, such as disaster relief. This project is an innovative, feedback-
based solution for enhancing soft-robot mobility. This solution is inspired by
the caterpillar Manduca sexta, a remarkable, multi-segmented invertebrate that
crawls, climbs and burrows in many terrains. Our approach is aimed at
controlling the caterpillar-like, periodic movements of a fluid-filled soft
robot, in which the robot's deformable structure makes it difficult to sense or
model body configuration on-the-fly. The research has two specific research
aims. Aim 1 will formulate a control design method for generating caterpillar-
like gaits by exciting sustained oscillations (e.g., limit cycles) within a
deformable, fluid-filled system. Aim 2 will quantify the in vivo kinematics of
burrowing caterpillars to identify how they adapt their gait in response to rich
patterns of tactile stimuli. New educational opportunities will be developed to
foster interdisciplinary controls teaching for engineering and biology
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soft robots offer tremendous potential to enhance
mobility, for example, by burrowing through debris or maneuvering through
complex terrain not accessible to conventional rigid robots. The research will
have a broader impact through its integration with the team's teaching
activities. Major advances in soft robot technology are likely to come from
insights gained at the interface between systems biology and controls
engineering. Hence, existing courses will be modified to introduce undergraduate
biologists to engineering control, and to introduce graduate engineers to
neurobiology.
