Chemistry (12) NMR methodologies are being incorporated into selected
laboratories across the chemistry curriculum with a new 300 MHz NMR with an
autosampler. NMR experiments previously published in the Journal of Chemical
Education are being used. The experiments are being used to enhance a larger
picture of the curriculum, since experiments build on students' previous
knowledge, beginning with an introduction in the honors laboratories for general
chemistry and general studies. Gradually the students are introduced to more
complex uses of the instrumentation and data interpretation as students progress
to more advanced courses leading ultimately to undergraduate research
experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
