Recent published results show that fractal geometry can be effectively used to
model the skewness and degree of self- similarity exhibited by the memory-access
patterns generated by processors. The fact that the fractal model can be used to
predict the behavior of programs at many levels of the memory hierarchy, and
that the performance of those levels can be in turn predicted, implies that
memory access patterns are highly structured. Unfortunately, this structure is
also highly irregular, and the vast majority of models that have been proposed
to simulate program behavior must rely on over-simplifying and unrealistic
assumptions of uniformity of access and/or of independence of access. Some
preliminary results show that under some conditions, in particular when a
process is allocated too little cache storage, its memory access pattern results
in chaos in the cache, yielding poor cache performance. This research
investigates the conditions under which chaos occurs, how cache design
parameters influence it, how chaotic behavior influences cache performance, and
applies these results to threading and cache partitioning, two methodologies
that present potentially favorable conditions for chaos to appear.
