Colorado State University Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participating (CO-
AMP) will build on the successes of the existing Bridge to the Doctorate
(BD)program to support effective academic, mentoring and social networks among
underrepresented minority (URM) graduate students in science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Graduate Center for Diversity and Access at Colorado State University will offer
opportunities through the entire professional development journey, from
matriculation to STEM doctoral completion and successful job placement and re-
affiliation with the ystem as alumni.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The comprehensive
program will recruit and matriculate LSAMP students into PhD STEM programs with
an emphasis on recruitment from national LSAMP programs; ensure BD student
retention and interest in the professoriate by creating a BD network that builds
social and academic support systems; provide student-centered activities and
mentoring programs. The programs will be infused with content regarding the
importance of URM presence in faculties that will include mentoring workshops to
faculty advisors as well as support for successful placement of BD students in
the workforce with an emphasis on appointments within the professoriate.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program include a rigorous evaluation to collect
formative and summative data for program improvements and comprehensive
analyses. Findings will be disseminated at regional, state and national
diversity conferences and in related journals.&lt;br/&gt;
