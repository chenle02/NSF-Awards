The principal investigator (PI) will study the use of artificial neural networks
in robotic control. A variety of nonlinear adaptive control problems will be
simulated for a one-link manipulator applying force to various objects. Flexible
and rigid manipulators will interact with mobile and fixed objects to conduct
various tasks specified by the PI&gt; The nonlinear adaptive controller will
incorporate an artificial neural network that learns the nonlinear dynamics of
the manipulator. Computer simulations will be used to assess the performance of
robotic controllers based on neural networks. The ability of neural networks to
approximate multivariate nonlinear functions representing robot manipulator
dynamics will be exploited in a feedforward controller architecture. Research
will focus on learning algorithms for neural networks used with both rigid and
flexible one-link systems. Adaptation to varying dynamics caused by wear or by
picking up objects will also be examined, as will alternative architectures for
controller. the goal of this project is to create a neural network controller
that is applicable to any control problem.
