This proposal is a renewal REU site that will introduce students to authentic
research in solar and space physics. It will begin with a one week summer school
on the Sun, the Earthâ€™s magnetosphere and atmosphere, the heliosphere, and the
Sun-Earth connection. This week also includes a practical course in scientific
computing and a cohort-building group project. The students will spend the
remaining nine weeks working on individual research projects guided by scientist
mentors from the participating institutes in Boulder, Colorado. The program
concludes with each student giving a 20 minute oral presentation of their work
as well as a poster or manuscript of their findings. The students learn to work
independently on cutting-edge research and to communicate their results
effectively. In addition to research, weekly professional development sessions
teach the students about career options in science, applying to graduate school,
ethics and impostor syndrome, creating a CV, and scientific communication
(talks, posters, proposals, and manuscripts).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site is
supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
