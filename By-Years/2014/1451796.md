This project will document several dialects of Koryak, a severely endangered
Chukotko-Kamchatkan language spoken in the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia by 1,670
speakers spread across at least eight dialects. The researcher will gather data
that will greatly enhance our understanding of the Chukotko-Kamchatkan family
and lead to cross-dialect and cross-linguistic comparison. The Chukotko-
Kamchatkan language family is of interest because it shares features with
languages on either side of the Bering Strait, which bridges the Old and New
Worlds.

Under the direction of Marianne Mithun from the University of California, Santa
Barbara, Dibella Wdzenczny will document dialects of Koryak, including Paren,
Achaivayam, Kamen, and Srednie Pakhachi, all severely endangered, under-
documented, and surprisingly distinctive in their grammars. Through comparative
analysis of the grammar and lexicon of these divergent dialects, Wdzenczny will
attempt a reconstruction of Proto-Koryak grammar and trace the historical spread
of the Koryak language and people throughout the peninsula.

Speakers are keenly aware of language loss and are very interested in
preservation efforts. To support these efforts, Wdzenczny is working with
Kamchatkan-run institutions, such as the Palana Okrug Archive, to preserve and
archive recordings of different Koryak dialects. Her work will also provide data
for pedagogical and reading materials being created for various Koryak dialects.
