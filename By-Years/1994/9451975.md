This project will add the important field of cellular neurophysiology to an
undergraduate laboratory. Using invertebrate preparations, students will do
hands-on experiments and exercises while learning modern equipment and
techniques. Four student workstations will be equipped with microscopes, intra-
and extra-cellular amplifiers, stimulators, oscilloscopes and computers. The
students will study the physiology and morphology of the innervation of the
crayfish superficial flexor muscle, the ionic basis of the resting potential,
the excitable properties of snail brain cells, crayfish neuromuscular synaptic
transmission and the stimulus-response properties of the crayfish stretch
receptor. This project will expose all lab students to hands on work which
corresponds to text work in the course as well as provide the initial experience
and equipment for those students wishing to continue their studies on the
neuroscience research team and in the neuroscience concentration.
