This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Massachusetts Boston
(UMass Boston) received funds from the Major Research Instrumentation Program to
support acquisition of an Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (IR-MS) to support
ecological, biogeochemical, and geochemical research. The instrument is
incorporated into the UMass Boston Environmental Analysis Laboratory (EAL)
enabling broad transdisciplinary research such as (1) isotopic analysis of
water, dissolved organic carbon, and carbonate materials, (2) measurement of
delta 13-C in dissolved organic carbon and colored dissolved organic matter
(CDOM), (3) isotopic analysis of individual compounds (e.g. fatty acids and
polyaromatic hydrocarbons), and (4) isotopic measurements in tissues, whole
rocks and organic macerals from rocks. Results from the research enabled by the
new equipment will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated
through student and faculty presentations at regional and national meetings.
UMass Boston is the only public university in the greater Boston area and is the
most diverse public 4-year institution in New England. The instrumentation
significantly enhances research and training of underrepresented minority
students through integration into environmental courses throughout the College
of Sciences and Mathematics at the undergraduate and graduate levels. In
addition a significant number of our students gain additional depth in
experience and expertise through independent research projects, and presentation
of their findings at scientific meetings.
