The radio astronomy program under the direction of the Principal Investigator,
Professor Bernard F. Burke, will concentrate on the study of extragalactic radio
sources, with particular emphasis on the study of the gravitational lensing
phenomenon. The first phase of the study, which involved the mapping of 4000
radio sources with the VLA, has been completed, and that work has resulted in
the discovery of at least six new examples of gravitational lensing. The
gravitational time delay effect has been utilized to give an independent
evaluation of the Hubble constant, and to explore the large-scale geometry of
the universe. A new class of gravitational lenses, called "Einstein Rings" has
been identified. Three have been found, and a search will be made for more of
these objects. These objects are of particular importance since they allow
definitive measurements of galactic masses to be made. During the period of the
grant two new radio source surveys will take place, one using the Very Large
Array (VLA) in Socorro, New Mexico, and the other to locate sources using the
Parkes 210-foot telescope in Australia. This will be followed up by use of the
Australia telescope interformeteric array to look for gravitational lenses. In
addition to these programs, the Principal Investigator will continue a program
that uses the VLA survey material to search for high-redshift radio galaxies and
quasars, and to study their radio properties. The Principal Investigator is
regarded as a world leader in this research area.
