Villanova University will initiate a six-week summer, residential Young
Scholars project in Mathematics and Biology for 36 students entering grades 11
and 12. The project combines coursework with extensive laboratory and research
experience. The subject matter in the two disciplines is presented in an
innovative, unified manner that emphasizes interdisciplinary connections,
underlying principles of scientific inference, quantitative thinking and
techniques of visualization. Participants will use two new NSF-funded
laboratories for experiments in physiology and for simulation and visualization
of biological systems. Field trips and on-campus activities will increase
students' awareness of the broad horizon of research career opportunities in the
sciences and mathematics. Participants will explore important course-related
issues of scientific ethics in open discussions with project staff and visiting
scientists. Academic year follow-up activities will include the implementation
of individual research projects designed by the students during the summer
component of the project. Participants will use electronic mail for exchange of
ideas and experimental results during this phase of the project.
