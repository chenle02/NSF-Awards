One investigator will study the behavior and singular structure of area-
minimizing surfaces using calibrations. On Riemannian manifolds calibrations
provide distinguished representatives of homology classes. A wide range of open
problems arising from the study of isoperimetric inequalities, materials
science, and soap films compel the consideration of integrands more general than
area and of new classes of surfaces. A second investigator will continue his
studies of volumes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds and 3-orbifolds. These include the
study of horoball packings which has shed new light on the geometry of
hyperbolic 3-manifolds. An example of a calibration of the torus is the set of
longitudinal circles. As in this case, elements of a calibration are homology
class generators. These have minimal length. One investigator will use the
emerging theory of calibrations to understand assorted integrals on area-
minimizing surfaces. The second investigator will study the geometry of three-
dimensional surfaces, or manifolds.
