This Symposium, under the sponsorship of the Institute of Mathematical
Statistics, will be held August 16-20, 1988 at Colorado State University. It is
scheduled to coincide for two days with the Annual Meeting of the Institute for
Mathematical Statistics which will also be held at Colorado State University.
There will be three one-hour invited addresses, eleven special topical sessions,
and contributed sessions. The invited addressees will be given by D. Aldous, A.
J. Baddeley, and K. Urbanik. The eleven special sessions cover a wide range of
topics. The organizers are Professors R. Pyke of the University of Washington
and R. Taylor of the University of Georgia. There is participant support
available. Probability theory has developed into a mature discipline in its own
right, as well as fostering new research developments in areas such as computer
science and physics. It has applications in areas of the physical sciences such
as filtering, control and optimization, economics and finance modeling,
neurological models, and image processing.
