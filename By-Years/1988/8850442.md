This project will improve the teaching of the biological sciences by involving
teachers in the design and formulation of new teacher educational materials
while, at the same time, providing them with authoritative and current
background information in the biological sciences. The modules around which the
program is organized were developed during previous summers in Institutes held
at Merck and Co. in Rahway, New Jersey and the Waksman Institute at Rutgers
University. The modules consist of experimental laboratory based activities and
supporting background information. A four-week summer institute will be held for
20 high school biology and biology/chemistry teachers from the New Jersey area.
A series of Background Seminars in science will be presented by university and
industrial scientists to provide teachers with knowledge on the module topics.
These seminars will provide both an up-date on current research and the
background science necessary for the teachers to maintain a good fundamental
understanding of biology and biochemistry. During the academic year the
participating teachers will introduce the modules in their respective schools
and present the modules to others teacher groups. Two kinds of follow-up actives
will be conducted. The first is a series of four meetings to be held during the
academic year. The second follow-up meeting will be a one-week institute to be
held the following summer. This project is significant since it is a strong
collaborative effort of University and industrial research scientists and high
school teachers. The projects allows the scientists to focus on the subject
matter while the teachers provide expertise based upon their experience. Rutgers
University has contributed an amount equal to 10% of the NSF award.
