The investigators will attack a basic but unsolved problem in numerical modeling
in the atmospheric and oceanic sciences -the proper formulation in a numerical
model of the subgridscale turbulence when the scale of the grid size in the
numerical model (d) is of the order of the scale of the energy-containing
turbulence (L). Current mesoscale models tend to contain eddy-diffusivity models
of the type proposed many years ago and this approximation was adequate when d
was much greater than L. Preliminary work by the research team has revealed,
however, that new formulations are required as d approaches L.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will first install the new formulation
in a high-resolution large eddy simulation (LES) model. They will compare the
scalar and velocity statistics obtained with the standard and new formulation in
atmospheric boundary-layer (ABL) simulations. Since the two sets of results
should not be significantly different, this provides a model validation
test.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will then install the new
formulation into an advanced mesoscale model and study the impact on simulations
of moist convection. They will also continue the simulations of ABL flows. The
goal is to document the performance of the new model as d approaches
L.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is expected to impact numerical modeling in
applications where the grid mesh size is of the order of the scale of the
turbulence. This occurs in high resolution meteorological modeling in
applications ranging from regional weather prediction to simulations of severe
storms and hurricanes.
