This collaborative project seeks to revisit previously initiated field
experiments in order to further characterize the chemical concentrations and
transformations of certain (Cl, Br) halogen species and radicals in both size
segregated aerosols and equilibrated gas streams of the marine boundary layer
(MBL). These atmospheric chemical studies will be carried out on a global
Atlantic Ocean transect (Bremerhaven - Capetown) aboard the German research
vessel R/V Polarstern, conjointly with a team of German and British
investigators engaged making a suite of ancillary gas-phase (spectroscopic, GC
etc), and aerosol characterization measurements. These measurements will be
complemented with multiphase photochemical modeling efforts. The scientific goal
of this study, to characterize and interpret multiphase halogen cycling along a
global meridional cruise transect, will provide and be informed by the broader
suite of measurements enabling insight into halogen activation, halogen species
diel cycling, halogen gas-phase aerosol partitioning, aerosol pH variability
together with related inferences on the impacts on lifetimes and cycling of
tropospheric ozone and sulfur (IV) species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current
understanding of the role of multiphasic halogen transformation reactions in the
MBL and their potential impact on heterogeneous atmospheric chemical processes
in the global marine atmosphere is hampered by a lack of reliable field
concentration measurements of key halogen species. The project will enhance our
understanding of the importance of natural halogen cycle chemistry in relation
to anthropogenic perturbation. The project will enhance research and education
partnerships at both inter-institutional and international levels.
