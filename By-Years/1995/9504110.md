9504110 Crossey This U.S.-Mexico Program award will support a workshop entitled
"Planetary Impact Events: Materials Response to Dynamic High Pressure," to be
held in Cancun, Mexico, August 27-September 1, 1995 in conjunction with the
"International Conference on Advanced Materials IV (ICAM -IV). Organizers are
Dr. Laura J. Crossey, University of New Mexico, and Dr. Luis E. Marin, Instituto
de Geofisica , UNAM, Mexico. Topics to be discussed include cratering processes,
Chicxulub impact and the K/T extinction, mineralogical changes during impact,
and spectroscopy of shocked materials and samples from the Chicxulub site. The
symposium will expose the international materials community and students from
the U.S. and Mexico to the work being done in the planetary impact field.
Speakers will provide an overview of impacts and associated processes, followed
by specialized topics of interest to the participants. ***
