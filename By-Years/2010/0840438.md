With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
Multiuser Program (CRIF:MU), Professor Marsha I. Lester will acquire an X-ray
diffractometer to be used by many users in the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Pennsylvania as well as by some researchers from neighboring
institutions. The main research projects that will benefit from this award are
in areas of synthesis, catalysis, and materials. Examples involve NHC-carbene
catalyzed reactions, peptide synthesis, design, characterization of organic
cages that bind xenon with high affinity which are useful for biological
imaging, identification of asymmetric organic compounds and perylenequinone
natural products, polyborane compounds, asymmetric catalysis, and mechanistic
investigations. The diffractometer will also be used in outreach activities
involving K12 students and teachers as well as undergraduate and graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and
precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule,
including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the
spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies
described here will impact a number of areas, including chemistry, materials
chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching
as well as research.
