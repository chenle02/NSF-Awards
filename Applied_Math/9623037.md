9623037 Gamba This proposal concerns problems that model potential compressible
fluid flow and charged-particle transport systems. The compressible fluid flow
models under consideration include the standard transonic flow problem in gas
dynamics, its viscous approximations and boundary value problem, and the Mach
reflection problem when a weak shock (pressure) wave collides with an oblique
obstacle. Models of charged- particle transport systems are studied within the
framework of submicron electronic devices. In particular these models include
electro- hydrodynamic or energy-transport models for semiconductors, related
models for plasmas, boundary value problems and their high field approximations.
%%% Areas of applications of the proposed research include models in
aerodynamics and aircraft design. In particular, wing performance just below
supersonic speeds and wing design for flight in the upper atmosphere. These are
models that describe how a gas moves around an object at high speeds (i.e. close
to producing sonic booms). In addition models of ionized plasmas and electron
transport are considered. In particular, the design and performance simulation
of semiconductor devices of extremely small size and even quantum level. The
models under consideration describe the flow of current in the working of a
submicron or a quantum-scale electronic device. The core of the proposal focuses
on issues related to questions of validity and stability of models based on the
available data. This information is of paramount importance in finding the best
computational strategy for the computer aided simulation of experiments. ***
