Historically, applications usually interface with persistent storage systems
through protocols, abstractions and interfaces. Protocols define a series of
actions that can be taken on the storage such as reading, or writing and have an
implicit abstraction model such as blocks or objects. Interfaces such as general
or dedicated storage networks transport protocol messages. While protocols and
interfaces simplify storage system design, both impact performance by the use of
abstraction models and limited operations. Emerging storage class memory has low
latency and granular operations, greatly increasing the relative impact of the
overhead of protocols, abstractions and interfaces. This project is re-imagining
the storage interface as programmable storage, where the defined protocol
involves sending encapsulated programs to the actual storage where their effect
is applied. This will improve the performance of distributed systems as well as
storage applications, both of which are central to Internet
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual challenge in this project is
the design of the new storage abstractions, insuring they are suitable for a
variety of new storage media and that security is maintained while performance
is improved. We are extending an existing storage system to include features of
programmable storage while also supporting emerging consensus on low-level
components used by distributed systems, such as persistent logs and
transactional operations at the memory level. The project is using existing run-
time code generation frameworks to insure that the programmable interface
generates portable code that is also efficient. Part of the research effort is
developing consensus among industry and academic researchers on the necessity
and sufficiency of the storage abstractions we propose and developing
educational materials to demonstrate how they should be used.
