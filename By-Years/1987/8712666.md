Considerable effort is being made to grow controlled thin layers of a variety of
semiconductors and other type of materials. These have been of increasing
importance in the fabrication of both electronic devices and optoelectronic
devices and will see increasing importance in the future. Along with the ability
to fabricate the layers it would be advantageous to be able to write patterns in
situ, that is while the layers are being grown. This proposal addresses problems
associated with such patterning.
