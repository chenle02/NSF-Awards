This project continues the long-running Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) program at DIMACS, the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical
Computer Science at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. The program
exposes students to a broad range of computer science topics emphasizing the
theory and use of algorithms applied in contexts that range from bioinformatics
to big data. The program includes projects led by Rutgers faculty from several
disciplines, involves graduate students as assistant mentors, and combines with
other REU programs that add cultural diversity and an international element
through partnership with the DIMATIA center in Prague.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
program draws on the traditional strengths of DIMACS in theoretical computer
science, mainly focused on algorithms and complexity. Student research spans
both theory and applications showcasing algorithms in settings that include,
among others, big data analytics, privacy and cybersecurity, bioinformatics, and
robotics. The majority of the projects address algorithmic foundations,
including projects on complexity, machine learning, coding theory, and analysis
of algorithms for streaming and privacy. Additionally, the program leverages
DIMACS' position as an interdisciplinary center to involve mentors from various
academic departments to offer students varied perspectives and projects whose
applications cross disciplines to illustrate the power of computing in a variety
of settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
