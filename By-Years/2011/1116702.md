The Internet revolution enabled private users across the world to send and
receive messages to one another. Coupled with cryptographic techniques like
public key encryption and digital signatures, this gave rise to the development
of the world wide web, e-commerce, and so many other technological changes that
we routinely take for granted today. We are now facing a second revolution in
which we are changing not just how we communicate, but how we compute. More and
more we are sending large datasets to untrusted servers, having them perform
calculations on our behalf. From our cell phones and our GPS units, we send
compromising information to our service providers in order to outsource the
computation that we cannot do on-the-go. Cryptography has a new role to play in
these emerging environments.

The PI intends to explore the theoretical underpinnings of the cryptographic
challenges that arise in this context. The proposed directions of research touch
on the following questions: -- How can we safely allow others to perform
computation on our encrypted data while maintaining its privacy? -- How can we
verify that outsourced computation was done correctly? -- What stronger security
models are needed in this new, highly interactive environment?

The PI will address the theoretical aspects of these problems, including
modeling, protocol design, and negative results. As part of her investigations,
PI will study the powerful cryptographic primitives of fully homomorphic
encryption and functional encryption (in particular, the relationship between
them and outsourced and verifiable computations), as well as the area of
leakage-resilient cryptography.
