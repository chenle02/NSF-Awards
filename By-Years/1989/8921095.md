This Special Minority Award provides a second year of support for Gloria
Carrillo, a graduate student at the University of Minnesota. The award will
allow Ms. Carrillo to finish her course work more expeditiously and reach the
research participation phase sooner. This award is an integral part of the
strategy of the National Science Foundation to strengthen and increase minority
participation in the field of physics.
