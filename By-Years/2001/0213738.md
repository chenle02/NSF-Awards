Democratic politics, for the purpose of theoretical analysis, might be divided
into electoral politics, in which voters determine representatives, and post-
electoral politics, in which representatives determine public policy. Whereas
the study of electoral politics focuses on the candidate entry decision, the
conduct of campaigns, and the incentives of voters, the study of post-electoral
politics abstracts from these details and focuses on the process of negotiation
and coalition formation among representatives, within a parliament or
legislature, or across different branches of government. This project studies
post-electoral politics from a game-theoretic perspective, where one specifies a
mathematical model of the institutional setting in which public policy is made,
and where one employs concepts of equilibrium to predict the outcomes of
rational strategic behavior. In technical terms, the project analyzes post-
electoral politics as a "bargaining game" among elected representatives. The
objective is a theory of post-electoral politics that can yield sharp
predictions in highly structured situations, as when debate revolves around one
issue and positions of representatives are clear, and that is general enough to
describe broad properties of policy outcomes, such as Pareto efficiency or the
stability of the status quo, in less transparent contexts. The project is
divided into four parts: the first part proves that, in one-dimensional
problems, the unique outcome of strategic bargaining is the ideal outcome of the
middle (or "median") voter; the second part assumes less structure on the
problem and considers issues of equilibrium existence, the stability of the
status quo, etc.; the third part considers the strategic aspects of agenda
formation in legislatures; and the fourth part examines the dynamics of policy
outcomes over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because it applies advanced methods
from theoretical economics to the analysis of political issues, the results of
the project will contribute both to the political science literature on
legislative, parliamentary, and committee decision-making, and to the literature
in economics on bargaining and game theory. From an academic standpoint, the
project will improve our understanding of post-electoral politics and is a step
toward a general theory that integrates the analyses of both electoral and post-
electoral politics. And this, from a long-range perspective, is a necessary step
in the full understanding of existing political systems, the impact of political
reforms, and the design of better political institutions.&lt;br/&gt;
