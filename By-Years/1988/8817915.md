It has been known for some time that mesoscale convective systems in the
tropics may develop rotational circulations of sufficient strength that the
systems transform into tropical cyclones. More recently, mid- latitude mesoscale
systems have been shown to form mesoscale vortices which outlive their parent
mesoscale convective system. It also has been established that these mesoscale
vortices can have significant impacts on the location, timing and severity of
subsequent convective weather. Due to their relatively small size and amplitude,
mesoscale vortices typically are not sensed by the current operational weather
system and the important physical processes are not well understood and,
therefore, not accounted for in operational prediction models. Using a state-of-
the-art mesoscale model, the Principal Investigator will perform a series of
numerical simulations of the formation of mesoscale vortices in both mid-
latitude continental and tropical maritime regimes. Results will lead to
increased understanding of the physical processes by which mesoscale convective
systems initially develop rotational circulations. This understanding may lead
to significant improvements in our ability to forecast convective weather
systems and their attendant severe weather such as heavy rainfall, hail, high
winds and tornadoes.
