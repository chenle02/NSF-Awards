97-29595 Hennessy It is well established in humans that adaptive physiological
functioning and health are influenced by the social environment. This effect is
perhaps most apparent in the mother-infant relationships. Infants that are
involuntarily separated from their mothers may suffer severe physiological and
behavioral consequences. Most of what we know concerning the physiological
effects has derived from studies using nonhuman primates. These effects include
increases in sympathetic activity, changes in neurotransmitter levels, and
increased activity of the pituitary-adrenal system, a neuroendocrine system
associated with stress. In contrast, the presence of the mother in threatening
environment can reduce stress-associated neuroendocrine responses of the infant.
It has been assumed that the mother's capacity to reduce stress responses
somehow generalizes or transfer to other social partners as the individual
matures. This issue, however, has received little study and is poorly
understood. One reason is that for many years, it was only possible to study
such questions in primates, and possibly humans. In his previous NSF support,
Dr. Hennessy developed a rodent model in which the responses to maternal
separation is similar to those of primates and this offers many practical
advantages. In the present series of studies, he will used this rodent model
system to examine the effect of the mother's presence on neuroendocrine stress
responsible in juvenile and adult offspring. Dr. Hennessy will involve
undergraduates into his research program directed towards determining if, and at
what age, other social partners attain the capacity to moderate stress-
responsiveness. The results from these studies will provide fundamental
information regarding the development of social influences on stress-related
neuroendocrine activity.
