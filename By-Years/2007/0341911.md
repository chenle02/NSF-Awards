THE NON-CONTACT DETERMINATION OF RIVER FLOW RATES

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for monitoring the
flow rates for over 7000 rivers across the United States. This monitoring
mandate is expensive and often hazardous, as it requires direct in-the-field
measurements by USGS personnel during storm events. The USGS, as well as other
agencies responsible for river flow monitoring around the world, is extremely
interested in the development of remote non-contact flow rate measurement
capabilities. This grant is to develop an infrared-based quantitative imaging
system for the determination of surface velocity fields and velocity fields at
depth via remote non-contact means. The latter will be accomplished by
considering the vertical turbulent thermal structure of river flows under non-
equilibrium conditions. The proposed image analysis algorithms will be derived
from the PI's previous development work with particle image velocimetry (PIV).
The ultimate goal of this work is to develop a robust tool for the non-contact
monitoring of river flows. The infrared measurement technique will have wide
ranging uses beyond river flow monitoring including direct measurements of
surface renewal for air-water gas transfer studies, near-surface transport of
sediment in shallow sediment laden flows (such as the swash zone), as well as
near-surface conditions in other two-phase flows such as aerated flows (e.g.,
the surf zone).
