This project will advance the practice of information security and computer
networking forensics in the public sector, and build the national capacity to
deal with threats in this area. The target audience is public sector
professionals and managers, including law enforcement officials. Starting with
existing materials and the expertise of CERIAS at Purdue University (a NSA
Center of Excellence in Information Assurance Education), the University at
Albany/SUNY is developing competency-based distance-deliverable courseware in
two key Information Security content areas, aimed primarily at professional
needs in the public-sector. These curricula and materials are designed to be
flexible, and able to be used in a variety of settings including undergraduate
and graduate degree programs, certificate programs, and professional education.
We use these materials in a variety of outlets, including degree and certificate
programs at the University at Albany and Purdue University, as well as public-
sector training programs and workshops in New York and Indiana. We are using the
universities close relationships with the New York and Indiana State Police, and
the New York State Office for Technology in a partnership to develop and test
these modules. In engaging these organizations as partners on the project, we
bring the resources of the University to bear on critical public needs. In doing
so, we are developing a mutually beneficial relationship that enable the
university educational programs to be more responsive to both public and private
sector needs. The results of this project will be disseminated through a number
of national outlets, including distance education learning communities, and
consortia for information security education and training.
