The research is directed toward novel approaches to wavefront synthesis and
reconstruction by means of digital diffractive elements to produce very high
performance computer-generated holograms with a minimum of speckle noise. A
hologram is a synthetically reconstructed image generated by computer processing
of laser-generated views of an object. Holograms are being used in commercial
applications such as nondestructive testing, heads-up displays, information
storage, and testing of aspherical optics. The list of applications would grow
appreciably if improved, reliable holograms and better methods of generation
were available. In this research effort, the principal investigators are
utilizing very high resolution digital diffractive elements (DDE) to perform
wavefront synthesis and manipulation to do speckle suppression and make high
performance computer-generated holograms.
