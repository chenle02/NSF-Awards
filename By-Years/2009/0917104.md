Current digital media editing software allows malicious amateur users to perform
imperceptible alterations to digital speech communications This creates a
serious threat to the "knowledge life cycle". The proposal seeks to develop
theories, methods and tools for extracting and visualizing evidence from digital
speech content for the purpose of media source identification and content
authentication. The strategy will be based on the important paradigm of
nonintrusive media forensics. The hypothesis is that the physical devices and
associated signal processing chains may leave behind intrinsic "fingerprint"
that are detectable by statistical methods. The hypothesis clearly indicates the
purpose of the project.
