Proposal # HRD-96-23958 Applicant: WGBH Educational Foundation Principal
Investigator: Theodore A. Sicker Title: "CD-ROM Access Project" ABSTRACT CD-ROMs
are the most widely used form of multimedia in schools and their use is expected
to grow especially in the area of science education. People with print-
disabilities (those with visual impairments or learning disabilities) currently
are unable to use most hardware and software (including CD-ROMs) that base their
information displays on a "graphical user interface" (GUI). This application
proposes to initiate a research project leading to CD-ROM-based science
instructional materials that are useable by people with print-disabilities. To
reach this goal, it will be necessary to establish standards for multimedia
accessibility. The project proposes development of design guidelines for
multimedia accessibility concentrating on science, engineering, and mathematics
instructional materials published on CD-ROMs-- currently the most common form of
multimedia-based instructional materials. Specifically, the project will: -
Research CD-ROM accessibility by conducting a CD-ROM Accessibility Survey -
Explore access solutions to technology barriers through the creation of adapted
iterations - Demonstrate accessibility with a model accessible SEM CD-ROM -
Develop Design Guidelines that recommend standards for multimedia accessibility
- Distribute project results through a dissemination of findings. It is expected
that this Project will significantly impact blind, visually impaired and
learning disabled students by allowing them to approach academic equality of
opportunity with their sighted peers in SEM education leading to increased
representation in SEM careers. ***
