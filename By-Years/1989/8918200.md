This project will support the Joint Summer Research Conferences in the
Mathematical Sciences, administered by the American Mathematical Society, the
Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and the Institute for
Mathematical Statistics. Between six and ten one or two-week conferences have
been held annually since 1982 on a wide range of mathematical topics. The 1990
Summer Research Conferences will be held at the University of Massachusetts,
Amherst on the following topics: (1) Logic and Local Fields, (2) The Schottky
Problem, (3) Deformation Theory of Algebras and Quantization with Applications
to Physics, (4) Strategies for Sequential Search and Selection in Real-Time, (5)
Probability Models and Statistical Analyses for Ranking Data, and (6) Inverse
Scattering and Applications.
