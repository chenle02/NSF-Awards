The University of Texas - El Paso (UTEP) proposes an Extension to the Computing
Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI). CAHSI is an alliance of some
of the leading producers of Hispanic science and engineering graduates:
California State University-Dominguez Hills, Florida International University,
New Mexico State University, Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi, University of Huston-
Downtown, University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez, and UTEP. Its goal is to create a
unified voice in order to increase the number of Hispanic students who pursue
and complete baccalaureate and advanced degrees in computing. It uses a three-
fold strategy that promotes interventions addressing recruitment, retention, and
advancement, as well as social science research, and dialogue that leads to
collaborations and consolidated efforts. In the initial phase of its funding,
CAHSI built an effective organization with well-defined communication
strategies. CHSI has transferred effective-practice interventions to adopting
institutions, and established collaborations with key professional
organizations. This Extension builds upon CAHSI?s field-tested interventions --
including curriculum development, introduction of undergraduates into research
early in their career, and student activities that build leadership skills --
with a focus on mentoring across the academic pipeline from the undergraduate
level to the professoriate, developing a resource infrastructure, and continuing
establishment of partnerships with industry, professional organizations, and
other entities.
