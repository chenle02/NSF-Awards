The principal investigator will investigate the theory of modular
representation of finite groups of Lie type for primes not equal to the
characteristic. She will also work on two specific problems on Green functions
and the related Hall-Littlewood functions: a group-theoretic interpretation of
some symmetric functions in two variables introduced by Macdonald, and a
Murnaghan-Nakayama type formula for Green functions of classical groups. This
research is in the general area of the representation theory of finite groups of
Lie type. One of the main applications of group theory to other mathematical and
scientific fields is in representation theory.
