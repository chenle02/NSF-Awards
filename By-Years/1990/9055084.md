The Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE) at the University of Rochester will
initiate an eight-week, commuter Young Scholars project in Physics and Chemistry
for 10 students entering grade 12. Participants will work in a major state-of-
the-art research facility where scientists are involved in research and
development in advanced laser, optical, and optoelectronics technology. The LLE
is the largest nonclassified laser facility in the United States.
