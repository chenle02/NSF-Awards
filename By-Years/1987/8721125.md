In Prior work, techniques have been developed for the extraction and analysis
of fluid from fluid inclusions in halite, miocene, permian and silirian marine
evaporites have been studied so far. Miocene halite inclusions indicate sea
water compositions similar to today; however, variations in Br/K concentrations
have been identified throughout phanerozoic evaporites. Plans now include
investigation of fluids from additional sites, refinement of our understanding
of chemical pathways involved in evaporation of sea water and develop models for
interpreting the composition of inclusion fluids. Beyond the important goal of
understanding the evolution of sea water, possible application of results may
apply to exploration of valuable saline deposits and use of salt beds for
nuclear waste repositories.
