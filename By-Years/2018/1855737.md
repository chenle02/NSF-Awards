The main parts of the mathematics research project by Shiferaw Berhanu involve
the investigation of the validity of unique continuation for solutions of
systems of first order partial differential equations and second order partial
differential equations. The project includes problems on the regularity of
certain mappings between submanifolds in complex spaces. The second order
partial differential equations under study arise in the study of electromagnetic
radiation, optics, seismology, and acoustics. Some of the equations that are to
be investigated are relevant to solid mechanics where they can be used to model
elasto-static deformations. They are also of relevance in fluid mechanics since
they can be employed to describe the motion of an incompressible viscous fluid.
Results from the project have important applications to function theory of
Several Complex Variables, CR Geometry, and linear as well as nonlinear partial
differential equations. The project will provide several interesting problems to
graduate students and young researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first main
problem concerns understanding geometric conditions on two Cauchy-Riemann
submanifolds that guarantee unique continuation for a CR mapping between them
that vanishes to infinite order at a point. The second problem concerns the
unique continuation at the boundary for solutions of real analytic, second order
or higher order, elliptic partial differential equations. The third problem
involves the regularity of CR mappings between Cauchy-Riemann submanifolds. The
methods to be employed include the theory of analytic discs, nonlinear Fourier
transforms (FBI transforms), and a precise analysis of Green's functions for the
second and higher order operators under study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
