9307677 Horowitz Much recent research in econometrics has been concerned with
developing semi- and nonparametric methods of inference in order to reduce the
number of a priori and, often, untestable assumptions needed for inference and,
thereby, reduce the potential for incorrect inference due to erroneous
assumptions. The project aims at extending semi- and nonparametric methods in
several ways that have important in applications. These include the semi- and
nonparametric estimation of transformation models, models with errors in the
data, and panel data with attrition. New methods will be developed that have
important economic applications. The project developed new methods and economic
applications in the following areas: (1) Estimation of a regression model with
an unknown transformation of the dependent variable; (2) Nonparametric
estimation of regression models with errors in the data; (3) Nonparametric
estimation of the effects of attrition on inferences derived from panel data;
(4) Use of bootstrap-based critical values for the test of overidentifying
restrictions on generalized-method-of moment (GMM) estimation; and (5) Bandwith
selection for certain semiparametric and nonparmetric estimators. ***
