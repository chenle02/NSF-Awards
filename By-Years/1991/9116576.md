The investigation of a new approach to the synthesis of highly substituted
dihydrobenzofurans, dihydroindoles, bicyclo{3.2.1}octenones and cyclobutanes
will be made utilizing novel regio- and stereoselective Lewis acid catalyzed
formal cycloaddition reactions of alkenes and alkynes with 1,4-benzoquinones,
1,4-benzoquinonediimides and alkoxy-alpha, beta-unsaturated enones. The
exploration and development of enantiospecific variants of these new methods
utilizing chiral Ti(IV) catalysts is planned and many provide the products in
high enantiomeric purity. The structures of the products form all, or part of,
the basic framework of many classes of biologically active molecules and chiral
cyclobutanes may also be useful in the preparation of novel rod shaped polymers
with interesting properties Specific targets include kadsurenone, a specific
platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist, recaglamide, an antileukemic
agent, viniferin, an antifungal agent, guianin, a representative neolignan, and
acanthodoral, a structurally interesting natural product. In addition, syntheses
of several 2-and 3-aryl-2,3-dihydrobenzofurans and their nitrogen analogs, i.e.
2-and 3-aryl-2,3-dihydroindoles, are planned. %%% With this award, the Organic
Synthesis Program will support the research of Dr. Thomas A. Engler at the
University of Kansas. The studies will explore new routes to asymmetric
molecules based on new methods utililzing chiral Ti(IV) based reagents. The new
synthetic methodology should benefit research in biochemistry and medicine, as
well as in the chemical industry.
