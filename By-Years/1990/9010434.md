The objective of this project is to study the photocatalytic oxidation of
several representative organic contaminants of water as they are affected by
altering the properties of the catalyst used in this process. The catalyst
selected for this research project is titanium dioxide. The catalytic properties
of this substance will be altered by subjecting it to various physical and
chemical processes that alter its surface characteristics. The proposal leading
to this award was submitted under conditions in the NSF Program Announcement
titled: "Research Initiation Awards," NSF 88-99. The project addresses the
problem of removing relatively small concentrations of organic pollutants from
aqueous solution. The ultimate goal is a process for decontamination of water
and removal of organics from wastewater that utilizes solar energy to drive the
oxidation process. Results of this project may be applied in engineering design
of water and wastewater treatment processes and systems.
