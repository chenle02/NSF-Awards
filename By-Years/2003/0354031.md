This award provides funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
Site program at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee's Center for Great Lakes
Studies (CGLS). The scientific focus of the site is environmental aquatic
science. Funding provided supports internships, travel, housing and some
research supplies for ten students each summer for three years. The students
will conduct independent research projects under the guidance of a scientist
during the 10-week internship program. In addition to their research, students
will participate in workshops on graduate school, career opportunities, writing,
and public presentations. They will also participate in various field trips in
and around Lake Michigan. At the close of the program, students will present
their research in a poster and oral discussion session, and they will write a
final research paper in standard journal article format.
