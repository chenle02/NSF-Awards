This project assesses the impact of gender mistakes on inequality. A gender
mistake occurs when an actor learns that he or she has incorrectly sex
categorized another. These gender mistakes may have lingering effects on the
behaviors and attitudes of the actor who made the mistake, even after they are
corrected. For example, when a man is mistaken for a women, he will enjoy less
of a gender advantage in that interaction, even after the mistake is corrected,
than he would if the mistake had never occurred. A women who is mistaken for a
man, on the other hand, will suffer less of a gender disadvantage than she would
have if the mistake had not happened. The project tests these claims using an
experimental design common in expectations states research. The results suggest
that if gender mistakes occur in many interactions, involving many actors, they
might contribute to reducing gender inequality and the male advantage in
interaction. They also suggest that gender equality is maintained by clear-cut
displays of gender behavior in certain social situations and distinct
categorization of the sexes.
