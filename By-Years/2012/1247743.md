This workshop brings together Principal Investigators involved in national
security relevant projects funded through the 2008 DoD Minerva Research
Initiative; the NSF National Security, Conflict and Cooperation (NSCC)
competition; Minerva Research Chairs; and Fellows funded through the RCUK Global
Uncertainties Programme. &lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the workshop are to
investigate the commonalities between research programs, determine whether there
are interesting opportunities that may build or bridge between differing
research methodologies and identify potential breakthroughs, and barriers to
advancement in the evolving field of security research, particularly longer
term, transformational opportunities..&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit and
broader impacts of the workshop are significant. The activity will produce
insights into what methodologies or combinations of methodologies are most
appropriate to address security questions of direct policy relevance, may spawn
collaborations the outcomes of which will have direct implications for security
policy and practice, and will encourage cross-Atlantic collaboration in
security-related efforts
