This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to the University of Mississippi for
the renovation and repair of Lewis Hall and the accelerator building which,
after the consolidation to be accomplished, will house all the physical research
and research training activities of the Department of Physics. These buildings
were constructed, respectively, in 1939 and 1950. Lewis Hall has never been
renovated, while the accelerator building was last renovated in 1980. The ARFMP
grant of $889,260 and $1,264,607 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be
used to modernize these research and research training facilities and to
consolidate all research training activities in physics in one contiguous
facility. This project will address the need to improve the current research
infrastructure by eliminating water leakage, providing adequate power, and
achieving proper climate control to enable more reliable and meaningful
experiments to be carried out. This award contributes to the infrastructure of
science by providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and for
the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students. The Department of
Physics at the University of Mississippi has a particular commitment to
educating nontraditional students who would be unlikely to go to college outside
the mid-south or to begin graduate school outside this region.
