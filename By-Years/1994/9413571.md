The overall objective of this Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR) Phase I
research project is to fabricate, demonstrate, and characterize a high
resolution, high efficient imaging time-of-flight nanoprobe which uses high
repletion femtosecond postionization techniques. Successful completion of this
new instrument will make it possible to quantify the spatial distribution of
atomic and molecular species in semiconductors, optical fibers, biological
specimens, environmental and others samples, to subfemtomole concentration
levels.
