This career proposal describes ground breaking techniques to detect a possible
form of dark matter known as WIMPS: Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. Most
of the universe is thought to be made of matter which has never been observed
through existing techniques and WIMPS is one of the logical candidates for such
unobserved dark matter. The educational component of this proposal involves the
development of interactive exhibits to inform the general public about such
astrophysics research, especially using the Great Lakes Science Center.
