The Center for Selective C-H Functionalization (CCHF) will develop new reactions
and synthetic methodologies for activating and functionalizing carbon-hydrogen
bonds. The carbon-hydrogen bond has traditionally been considered inert, but
recent advances have shown that this bond can be productively exploited. A
multi-faceted research team will build the mechanistic understanding required
for the development of next-generation, selective catalysts and will develop
predictive models for determining site selectivity in complex target synthesis.
New catalysts systems and new methods for C-H modification will be challenged
and refined in the context of natural product synthesis, library preparation and
drug discovery, and materials preparation. Selective C-H bond functionalization
will also be extensively investigated and further evolved for the single-step
tailoring of the structure and physical properties of known molecules.

The field of C-H functionalization is projected to impact the fine chemicals
industry, with the potential of revolutionizing synthetic strategies targeting
pharmaceuticals and materials. By collaboration and partnership with industry
leaders and other major research centers, CCHF will ensure the translation of
discoveries in basic research to commercial innovations. A Center-wide
commitment to continuing educating of the chemical community on the synthetic
potential of this new chemistry will facilitate the development of innovations
that lie beyond the scope of the proposed research. The Center also will take an
active role in reaching out beyond the chemistry community to engage young
students, the public, and underrepresented audiences in developing an
understanding of and appreciation for the chemical sciences. Through a novel
"Chemistry Communications" program, CCHF will educate and train their scientists
on the best practices in communicating science to different audiences. Products
generated by this program such as blogs, science animations, and science
journalism will serve to educate different audiences (general public, high
school teachers, K-12 students) about CCHF's research discoveries, placing the
Center in a unique position to make a positive impact on the perception of
chemistry in the Nation and the inclusion of more diversity in people pursuing
careers in chemistry. Course development, research opportunities, and research
partnerships will further enhance the influence that the Center will have on the
engagement of students and underrepresented minorities.

The Center for Selective C-H Functionalization is funded as part of the Centers
for Chemical Innovation (CCI) program.
