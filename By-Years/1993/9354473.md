9354473 Zielinski The project will produce 24-28 physical chemistry student
centered learning modules accompanied by an effective set of instructional and
assessment materials. These correct student misconceptions and help students to
appreciate their own powers of learning. The new modules will focus on stream
lining and modernizing the physical chemistry curriculum in order to adequately
portray the excitement and scope of the field while addressing the needs of
students as learners. The new modules will incorporate well established
pedagogical techniques to engage students in the learning process as they
construct concepts in physical chemistry. The new modules will capitalize on the
different learning styles of a diverse student population, typically 3rd year
male and female science majors who must take physical chemistry. ***y
