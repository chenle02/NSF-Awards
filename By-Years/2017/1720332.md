This award funds the research activities of Professor Mark P. Hertzberg at Tufts
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decades of research in both particle physics
and cosmology have led us to a set of so-called "Standard Models" which provide
tremendously successful descriptions of the universe over a vast range of energy
and length scales. However, future revolutions in physics will arise from
tackling the various shortcomings of these models. In particular, some of the
greatest mysteries that remain concern the nature of dark matter, the details of
early-universe cosmology, and a deep understanding of the structure of
gravitation. Professor Hertzberg's research will tackle these subjects through
the formulation of theoretical models and the exploration of connections to
experiment and data. As a result, research in this area advances the national
interest by promoting fundamental scientific research into the nature of the
universe. Furthermore, this project is envisioned to have significant broader
impacts as it will involve postdocs and engage the public in an important way
through public lectures and popular articles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More
technically, Professor Hertzberg will investigate axion dark matter in galaxies,
develop novel inflationary models that probe new physics, and investigate
theories of spin-two particles. This involves the development of theoretical
models that demand internal consistency and greement with data, all within the
framework of effective field theory. The primary work on the dark-matter front
is to determine the clumpiness, distribution, and possible evidence for axion
dark matter. The primary work on the early-universe front is to determine if
reasonable inflationary models exist that improve agreement with CMB data on
large scales beyond the standard scale-invariant models. Finally, the primary
objective on the gravity front is to determine if general relativity is the
uniquely consistent effective theory of spin-two particles.
