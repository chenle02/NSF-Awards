The choice of a long-term romantic partner is an issue of central importance in
the lives of most people; and must have been an adaptive challenge to our
evolutionary ancestors, for whom cooperative parenting was probably necessary to
raise several offspring simultaneously. The ability to choose a partner with
whom one is able to interact pleasurably and productively has far-reaching and
critical consequences, yet we know little about the psychological mechanisms
that underlie this vital decision-making process. This dissertation research by
a cultural anthropologist combines ethnographic and experimental psychological
methods in order to address some of the current gaps in our understanding of the
factors that contribute to the selection of romantic partners. The study will be
carried out among the Shuar, a lowland Ecuadorian population for whom the mating
environment more closely matches that in which our mating psychology most likely
evolved: in a subsistence pattern of hunting and horticulture, living in small
communities of few families, and for whom the combined efforts of husband and
wife are essential for successfully raising offspring. Ethnographic interviews
will enrich our understanding of relationship processes and variables in a
community very different from the usual study populations, and structured rating
tasks will shed light on the variables that make up the elusive quality of
"compatibility" between romantic partners. &lt;br/&gt;By systematically studying
the processes through which people negotiate the beginning of a romantic
relationship, it may be possible to enhance long-term outcomes in terms of
relationship satisfaction and quality. At a period in our nation's history when
romantic partnerships and the families that are built upon them are increasingly
fragile and short-lived, new knowledge on this aspect of human nature will have
important broader impacts for society at large as well as for policy
makers.&lt;br/&gt;
