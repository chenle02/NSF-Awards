This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop
encapsulation layers for organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays. Cost-
effective thin film encapsulation is widely recognized as a crucial key
technology needed to capitalize on the full potential of OLED technology.
Transparent thin film encapsulation layers deposited at low temperatures and
moisture-free ambient are needed for lightweight and low cost OLED displays and
microdisplays. This project is focused on novel atomic layer deposition (ALD)
techniques that are especially designed for cost-effective encapsulation of OLED
devices at process temperatures below 100 C. Traditional ALD techniques are
impractically slow at this temperature range and make inefficient usage of
chemicals. These problems are circumvented by a combination of efficient ALD
process and equipment. Objectives include evaluation of encapsulated OLED device
performance and reliability, with corresponding cost analysis. A successful
project can mark a breakthrough in the market of portable display devices since
adequate thin film encapsulation technologies for OLED devices have not been
developed successfully so far. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OLED market is
projected to grow to over $1.6 billion in revenues annually, attributed mostly
to microdisplay applications, within the next five years. It
is&lt;br/&gt;expected that OLED will play a bigger role in the $50 billion Flat
Panel Display (FPD) market in subsequent years. Currently the missing piece in
OLED device processing equipment, vacuum-deposition encapsulation technology
will provide a substantial competitive edge to process equipment vendors. It can
thus signify an entry point for the U.S. to regain a substantial market share in
the FPD market.&lt;br/&gt;
