This project is to develop a Process Instrumentation and Control laboratory
which will complement an undergraduate control course, with the same title,
which is the main course in the Controls Option at this Institution. The project
is focused on practical process control loop design and implementation using
modern instrumentation. The goal is that after completing the course with the
laboratory, the students will have learned practical as well as theoretical
aspects of process control. To this end, a network of six PCs equipped with data
acquisition cards will be purchased for both software analysis and design and
for controlling dynamic systems using digital computers. Typical transducers
will be introduced and specific processes and systems will be controlled using
commercially available instrumentation, actuators and controllers. The project
will also enable the introduction to the students of programmable logic
controllers, as used extensively in industry today.
