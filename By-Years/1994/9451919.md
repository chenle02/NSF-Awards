9451919 Haglin Parallel processing is demanding an ever-increasing role in
modern computer science. This is apparent in modern computer architectures and
is reflected in the ACM curriculum guidelines. The purpose of this proposal is
to provide a significant exposure to parallel processing for the undergraduate
students at Mankato State University. This exposure will be provided through
changes to several existing courses by adding one or more parallel processing
lab exercises to each course and by a new course devoted entirely to parallel
processing. A MasPar MP-1 processor has been identified to serve as the hardware
platform. This processor will provide students with a high degree of parallelism
and a user interface built upon the familiar Unix/C/X-windows base.
Documentation of the experiences, including both successes and difficulties,
will be published allowing other universities to better evaluate this approach
and platform.
