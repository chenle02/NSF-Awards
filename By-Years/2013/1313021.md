This is a theoretical project to develop simulations of protoplanetary disks
that model the development and saturation of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and
the response of small solid particles to that turbulence. They will focus on
planetesimals 1-100 km in size, and more accurately model Ohmic diffusion and
ambipolar diffusion in disks. One of the goals is to determine whether planet
formation can occur equally through a disk, or whether there are locations or
disk properties (such as metallicity) that strongly favor or inhibit
planetesimal formation. Planetesimals are the first bodies in primordial
circumstellar disks that are large enough that their dynamics is dominated by
gravity at the very early stages of planet formation, and they eventually lead
to the formation of planets.

Broader impacts include training a postdoctoral researcher, incorporating this
work into class lecture notes which are shared with the astronomy community, and
providing planetarium programs to the public. This work has implications for
models of how planets formed in our solar system, and for extrasolar planetary
systems.
