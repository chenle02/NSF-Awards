Discrete optimization lies at the core of computer science and its applications.
Except for a few special cases, exact optimization is computationally
intractable. Approximation algorithms seek to resolve this issue by providing
computational efficiency and at the same time provable guarantees on the quality
of solutions. The current project addresses fundamental open questions about
approximation algorithms. The project will use strong relaxations, especially
the sum-of-squares method, as a lens to shed light on these questions.

The Unique Games Conjecture has fueled many recent advances in our understanding
of approximation algorithms. A proof of this conjecture would show that for a
large classes of problems the approximation guarantees of a concrete algorithm
are best possible. On the other hand, a refutation of the conjecture would
likely lead to major improvements of approximation algorithms for a wide range
of problems. Recent works of the PI and coauthors identified a candidate
algorithm to refute the Unique Games Conjecture. This algorithm is able to solve
previously proposed constructions of hard instances for problems that the
conjecture predicts to be NP-hard. An integral part of the research project is
to resolve whether this algorithm indeed refutes the conjecture.

The candidate algorithm comes from a meta-algorithm, called sum-of-squares
method. The current project will also study the approximation guarantees of this
method beyond the Unique Games Conjecture, and investigate the thesis that for a
large class of problems, the sum-of-squares method is an optimal meta-algorithm
in terms of approximation guarantee and time complexity.

A broad range of academic disciplines apply optimization techniques and
computational efficiency is an important factor in these applications. In
practice, meta-algorithms are often a popular choice, e.g., belief propagation,
MCMC methods and SAT solvers, but lack provable approximation guarantees. The
sum-of-squares method has the potential to achieve the same versatility as other
meta-algorithms but with the additional benefit of provable guarantees.
