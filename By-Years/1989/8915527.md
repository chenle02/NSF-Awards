This collaborative research between Stanley Zionts and Vahid Lotfi, State
University of New York at Buffalo, and Yang Deli, Dalian University of
Technology, People's Republic of China, aims to develop and evaluate a decision
support system to be used to support joint venture negotiations. This research
will draw from three areas of inquiry: international management, information
systems, and multiple criteria decision making. Existing joint ventures will be
analyzed, and in the final stages of research, the group decision support system
will be tested in ongoing joint ventures negotiations. This collaboration draws
on a well established relationship between the participating institutions,
access to excellent facilities at each location, and a unique opportunity to
work with joint ventures in China. In addition to contributing to an enhanced
understanding of decision support system technology and its application in
multi-cultured negotiations, it is anticipated that results of this research
will be valuable to joint venture negotiation.
