Professor Jonathon L. Sessler, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry
at the University of Texas at Austin, is supported by the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies of expanded porphyrins and
calixpyrroles. Through the synthesis of expanded porphyrin systems, including
those designed to provide three-dimensional coordination geometries to
complement the planar to near-planar geometry afforded by simpler porphyrin
derivatives, Professor Sessler assesses the geometric requirements of anion
complexation, cation coordination, and neutral substrate binding by these
systems. Related studies address the basic molecular recognition properties of
two new substrate binding platforms, the calix(n(pyrroles and calix(n)pyridines.
The specific interaction between ions or molecules and receptors for them
represents a critical feature in countless biochemical processes. Whereas the
`molecular recognition` of positively charged species (cations) has received
intense scrutiny, the recognition of negatively charged molecules (anions) has
developed more slowly. With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program, Professor Jonathon L. Sessler, of the Department of Chemistry
and Biochemistry at the University of Texas at Austin, prepares large-ring
cyclic compounds designed to display specific interactions with various anions.
Given their unique structural features, many of these compounds also act as
binding agents for cations and neutral molecules. Through the synthesis and
study of these compounds, Professor Sessler gains critical information regarding
the relationship between structure and function in the binding of ions and
molecules.
