With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Ohio State University will
acquire instrumentation for ultrafast ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) and infrared
transient absorption measurements. The system is based on a femtosecond,
regeneratively amplified Ti:Sapphire laser system, in conjunction with UV/Vis
and infrared detection systems. The instrumentation will be used to study a
variety of chemical systems, including a) important intermediates in the
photophysics and photochemistry of organometallic compounds, nitrenes, carbenes
and flavins; b) charge carrier relaxation in electroluminescent conducting
polymers; c) the role of hydrogen bonding in the vibrational cooling of nucleic
acids; and d) the photocleavage of DNA by charge transfer
states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A femtosecond laser provides ultrafast pulses of
coherent visible or infrared light, which enables researchers to obtain
important information about fast occurring chemical reactions. Its use may
enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of reactive and
nonreactive molecules. These studies will have an impact in a number of areas
including polymer chemistry and biochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;
