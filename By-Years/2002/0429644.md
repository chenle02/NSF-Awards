Many environmental observations are collected at different space and time scales
that preclude easy integration of the data and hinder broader understanding of
ecosystem dynamics. Ocean Observing Systems provide a specific example of multi-
sensor systems observing several variables in different space - time regimes.
This project integrates diverse space-time environmental sensor streams based on
the conversion of their information content to a common higher-level
abstraction: a space-time event data type. The space-time event data type
normalizes across the diversity of observation level data to produce a common
data type for exploration and analysis. Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System
(GOMOOS) data provide the multivariate time and space-time series from which
space-time events are detected and assembled. Event detection employs a combined
top down-bottom up approach. The top down component specifies an event ontology
while the bottom up component is based on extraction of primitive events (e.g.
decreasing, increasing, local maxima and minima sequences) from time and space-
time series. Exploration and analysis of the extracted events employs a graphic
exploratory environment based on a graphic primitive called an event band and
its composition into event band stacks and panels that support investigation of
various space-time patterns.

The project contributes a new information integration approach based on the
concept of an event that can be extended to many domains including socio-
economic, financial, legislative, surveillance and health related information.
The project will contribute new data mining strategies for event detection in
time and space-time series and a set of flexible exploratory tools for
examination and development of hypotheses on space-time event patterns and
interactions.
