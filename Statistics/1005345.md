The study of empirical likelihood methods has attracted much attention in many
areas of statistics. This proposal develops new procedures to overcome the
computational burden in applying these methods to inference problems in
different settings such as: estimating equations, stationary sequences, high-
dimensional data, Pickands dependence functions in multivariate extreme-value
distributions and copulas in risk management. A practical obstacle in using
empirical likelihood methods is the computational issue due to the high
dimensional data, the large size of nuisance parameters as well as dependence in
the data. The investigators intend to develop new methodologies to overcome the
computational problems and extend the scope of the potential applications.

The new research results can be applied to economics, insurance, finance, risk
management and other social sciences that require effective tools for exploring
nonlinear dependence among multivariate series and to increase the complexity of
the models.
