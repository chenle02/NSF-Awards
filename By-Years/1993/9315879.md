9315879 Elias This award will fund a project to generate artificial neuronal
systems using a VLSI technique for processing visual information. The neuronal
network will be composed of electronic neurons, each with dendritic trees,
impulse generating soma, axonal arborizations and synapses. Pulsatile signaling
will occur between neurons. A genetic algorithm will be used to modify the
interconnections between the neurons. The analysis of the evolved neuronal
microcircuits are expected to uncover mechanisms of visual motion processing and
suggest methods of developing artificial neuronal visual processing systems.
This proposal was submitted to the Biosystems Analysis and Control Initiative
which encouraged the submission of proposals that through the study of
neurophysiological systems could advance engineering science and advance the
knowledge of biological systems through the use of engineering analysis
techniques. The research being funded by this award has the potential to advance
both neurophysiological sciences and the field of engineering in the area of
visual motion processing. ***
