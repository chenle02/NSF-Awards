Lenz 9314162 A team of six specialists, all of whom are now actively involved in
research on biodegradable polymers and plastics (four from universities, one
from industry and one from a federal government research laboratory,) will
conduct a ten-day, fact- finding tour of university, government and industry
laboratories and institutes in Japan to determine the present state o, and
future plans for, research, development and applications of biodegradable
polymers and plastics in Japan. Other possible applications for such polymers
will also be surveyed, including water-soluble polymers, fibers, coatings, etc.
It is planned to visit at least 20 different locations, after which an
interpretive report will be submitted to NSF and a workshop will be held at the
convenience of NSF.
