WeBWorK is a free, online homework system that has been shown to be effective in
helping students learn mathematics. At present, it is somewhat technical to use.
The goal of this project is to make it much easier for teachers to use WeBWorK
so that it can have a positive impact on student learning at a variety of types
of institutions.

Intellectual Merit: The principal outcome of this project is the organization of
a national library of homework problems coded into WeBWorK, and the development
of software tools to facilitate easy access to this electronic library.
Instructors teaching a variety of mathematics courses can search the library for
problems of the type they want, and use a point-and-click interface to select
specific problems for assignments. The project is testing and refining the
software tools by partnering with community colleges.

Broader Impact: The national WeBWorK problem library and the accompanying
software are helping to promote teaching and enhance the infrastructure for
education in mathematics. These are being freely available over the web.
Moreover, the project is fostering faculty development of mathematics teachers
around the country by making a new tool accessible to them for effectively
teaching mathematics. The results of the project are being disseminated through
workshops for teachers and presentations at conferences. It targets several
conferences with different audiences comprised of mathematics teachers from
different types of schools.
