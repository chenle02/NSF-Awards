The goal of this project is to explore some applications and potential
applications of homotopy algebras. In algebraic K-theory, the proposal describes
ideas applicable to the conjectures of Rognes and the conjecture of Waldhausen
on the K-theory chromatic tower, relating arithmetic and geometry. In unstable
homotopy theory, the proposal describes how E-infinity differential graded
algebras and related homotopy algebras can be used to study the homotopy theory
of spaces. In stable homotopy theory, the proposal discusses obstruction theory
for E-n algebra structures, and the relationship of E-n algebra structures with
structures on categories of modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homotopy theory
studies those properties of mathematical objects that do not change under small
deformations. These mathematical objects are often of a geometric nature but the
methods of homotopy theory have been increasingly applied to objects of an
algebraic nature as well. Homotopy theoretic properties tend to be accessible to
computation by taking advantage of the invariance under small changes. Since
they also generally retain important information about the original mathematical
objects, homotopy theory is an effective tool for a wide range of mathematical
problems.
