9633815 SEBENS The subtidal zones of temperate rocky shores are characterized by
complex topography and equally heterogeneous distributions of marine algae and
invertebrate fauna. The program of research will serve to continue long-term
studies on the interactions between species and the effects of water movement on
individual, population and community processes in these zones. Investigations
larval dispersal will involve a combination of field studies, laboratory
investigations, and modelling of large and small scale patterns. The model
chosen to represent this system is an adaptation of the `cellular automata'
approach developed for space-limited communities.
