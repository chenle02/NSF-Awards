Almost six million specimens are housed in the insect collection of the
Illinois Natural History Survey. The collection is among the largest and oldest
in North America and contains primary types of nearly 3,300 species. The
collection is used extensively by scientists and is a recognized national
resource. This project provides funds to continue the process of rescuing the
Survey's collection of slides of Thysanoptera (thrips) from permanent loss due
to severe dehydration of material mounted in Hoyer's medium. It will also
provide partial funding for incorporating the backlog of unprocessed and
unidentified material into the general collection and to facilitate the
reorganization of the collection during and after the installation of a
compactor system funded on a previous NSF grant.
