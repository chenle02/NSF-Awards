The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and
study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the
preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue
STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Clark Atlanta University
(CAU) seeks to increase the number of underrepresented minorities receiving
undergraduate degrees in STEM through the targeted infusion of curriculum
improvements and faculty engagement of undergraduate research. The development
and implementation of two new courses in Computational Chemistry and
Computational Biology through an interdisciplinary teaching and learning
approach will be a model for other schools to enhance their curriculum in STEM
education. CAU's undergraduate students, who will enroll in these courses, will
work with supercomputers through the NSF supported Extreme Science and
Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE). These courses will be essential for
underrepresented minority students at CAU to graduate with "Interdisciplinary
Computational Chemistry and Biology Certification" and compete nationally with
contemporary skill sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goals of the project
are to update the chemistry and biology curriculums and to educate undergraduate
students in both computational chemistry and computational biology. To achieve
these goals, the PIs plan to: 1) Develop, pilot-test, and implement two new
undergraduate courses in the Departments of Chemistry and Biological Sciences
and to educate twenty eight students with interdisciplinary computational
skills; and 2) Enhance the academic cyberinfrastructure for computational
chemistry and biology education integrated with research for undergraduate
students. Achieving the goals will benefit CAU in moving to the next level to
initiate a Computational Science "Minor" program for STEM undergraduates.
