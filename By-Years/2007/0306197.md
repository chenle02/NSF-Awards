TITLE: NONLINEAR PROBLEMS IN GEOMETRY

Abstract

The principal investigator proposes to study a number of problems in
Differential and Riemannian geometry that are related in that they may be
described by, or have a strong connection with, fully nonlinear elliptic
equations such as Monge-Ampere equations or mean curvature equations in some
novel way. These include extensions of the classical sharp isoperimetric
inequality to negatively curved Riemannian manifolds, hypersurfaces of constant
mean curvature in hyperbolic space with prescribed boundary at infinity and the
optimal domain for the fundamental tone of a clamped plate.

The aim of the Principal investigator is to develop fundamental geometric and
analytic methods to study highly nonlinear problems that are of importance in
several fields of pure and applied mathematics, especially in Differential
Geometry, image processing, optimal design, magnetohydrodynamics and
mathematical physics. These problems are formulated in terms of highly nonlinear
PDE's involving implicitly defined functions of curvature (or dynamic curvature
flows such as mean curvature flow) and are often variational in nature involving
free boundaries.
