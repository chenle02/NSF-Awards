9310784 Frost This action is to support the development of a combined resonant
column, torsional shear apparatus suitable for testing a broad range of geo-
materials over the full range of strains of engineering interest. The device is
to be used to support research into the dynamic behavior of large particle geo-
materials, including gravelly soils, refuse fills and waste modified soils; in
order to develop a better understanding and framework for predicting variations
in the shear modulus and damping of these materials as a function of applied
shear stress. ***
