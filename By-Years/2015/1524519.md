Proof assistants are software tools that assist users in developing formal
proofs of theorems. Proof assistants are now widely used to verify large
software systems. Hence a more trustworthy proof assistant could have
significant impact on high assurance software. An important issue in the design
of proof assistants is how to ensure they are logically sound. This project
investigates a new foundation for proof assistants, based on a method of
representing data using only functions which is known as lambda encodings.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lambda encodings are important for proof assistants
because they eliminate the need for a datatype subsystem. Such subsystems are
complicated, and increase the difficulty of ensuring logical soundness of the
proof assistant. There are several technical problems in using lambda encoding
for this purpose, including the fact that induction principles could not be
derived using them. This project develops new solutions to these problems, that
enables the use of lambda encodings as a viable foundation for proof assistants.
These new methods will be integrated into a new proof assistant, called Cedille,
which has a simpler foundation than other similar tools, and increases its
trustworthiness.
