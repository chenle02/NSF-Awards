9728794 Jackson The object of this investigation is to understand how a
specially-adapted vertebrate animal, the freshwater turtle, is able to survive
long periods without oxygen, and why other animals are unable to do this. The
long-term goal is to discover fundamental principles of cellular and organismal
function related to this adaptation. Several experimental approaches will be
utilized. First, the role of the turtle's shell and skeleton in enabling the
turtle to withstand the large buildup of lactic acid during long-term anoxia
will be investigated. Dr. Jackson has found that the shell both releases buffer
compounds into the blood and serves as a storage site for lactate. He will
determine whether the skeleton does the same. The role of the shell in lactate
storage is a new finding and he will explore this further in the turtle and will
also look for bone or hard tissue lactate uptake in other animals subject to
sizable increases in circulating lactate. He postulates that this may be an
important acid-base regulatory mechanism in many animals. In addition, the ionic
exchanges between the turtle shell and extracellular fluid will be studied in
preparations of powdered shell incubated with solutions of different pH and
ionic composition. Whole body ionic exchanges during anoxia will also be studied
in intact animals to further characterize the contribution of the shell and body
fluids to acid-base regulation. He will continue his work on the adaptation of
turtle heart to anoxia and acidosis using nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy and a computer-activated lever system to study perfused working
hearts and ventricular muscle strips, respectively. A particular goal of this
grant period is to compare responses in the anoxia-tolerant turtle heart with
hearts from anoxia-intolerant species, such as trout.
