Hurricane Andrew caused great structural damage to South Florida with insured
losses to up to seven billion dollars. The post- disaster assessment of low-rise
structures conducted by the principal investigator will help collect perishable
data and will allow clear comparisons between Hurricanes Hugo and Andrew as to
the type and level of damage from the two storms. In addition, wind tunnel
studies of wind field will be carried out which will help researchers place the
wind speeds into the context of code requirements.
