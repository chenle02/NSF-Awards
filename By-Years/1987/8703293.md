The proposed research will examine in detail the regulation of the PR1 set of
the Pathogenesis-Related (PR) proteins whose synthesis in tobacco plants is
induced by infection with Tobacco Mosaic Virus. Preliminary work indicates that
the level of PR1 transcripts increases after infection. The proposed research
will investigate the cause of the increase by measuring individual transcription
rates and mRNA stabilities, and will determine if translational regulation also
occurs. If appropriate, regulatory elements of the PR1 genes will be identified.
The fate of the PR1 proteins will also be examined. Preliminary evidence
indicates that the proteins are secreted; the secretory pathway and eventual
extra-cellular localization (if any) of the proteins will be examined using a
combination of genetic and cytological techniques. Finally, transgenic plants
that constituitively over-express PR1 proteins will be constructed in an effort
to identify the function(s) of the PR1 proteins. It has long been known that
infection of vascular plants by fungi, viruses or bacteria often leads to a so-
called hypersensitive response. Besides the death of nearby tissue, which helps
limit the spread of the infectious agent, the response frequently leads to
establishment of resistance to the pathogen ("acquired resistance") throughout
the plant. Resistance is not limited to the original infectious agent; thus, for
example, a bacterial infection can lead to resistance to viral infection.
Furthermore, certain chemicals can also elicit the response. More recently, it
has been shown that the response is accompanied by the synthesis of a number of
small proteins whose role in resistance is still unclear. The proposed research
will clarify the genetic mechanisms that regulate synthesis of one set of such
Pathogenesis-Related proteins and, as well, identify the eventual fate of the
proteins following their secretion by the cell. The research should advance
significantly our understanding of gene regulation and of the disease process in
plants.
