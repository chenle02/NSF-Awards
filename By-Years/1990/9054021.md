This project will permit the established of a center designed to assist
minorities to have successful science and technology careers. It will have four
major components: (a) specific science and technology programs that facilitate
the transitions of minorities from high school to college; (b) specific programs
that provide science and technology role models for minorities; (c) programs
that improve science, math and pre-engineering courses in elementary and
secondary schools; and (d) develop a student information and tracking system.//
