The Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) will design, develop, and
evaluate a K-6 science/health program that will incorporate proven
implementation strategies. The areas of discipline concentration will be equally
divided among the life, health, earth, and physical sciences. The program will
complement goals of science knowledge and processes with emphases on
personal/social goals, problem solving, decision making, and technology. Project
staff will use the appropriate results of research in the cognitive sciences to
revise and develop materials. The results of research on implementation
strategies will be applied when developing materials for teachers and
administrators, and in designing activities that promote use of the new program.
Implementation efforts are central to this project. Project outcomes will
include: 28 activity-based student modules for a complete K-6 science/health
program; teachers' guides and computer software for program management;
implementation guides; and supplementary activities integrating science with
reading, language arts, and mathematics. Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company is
collaborating with BSCS in the development and implementation of this
science/health program. The publishers will invest in excess of $2.9M during the
4-year development phase, and will continue teacher development activities in
subsequent years. Private foundations as well as the Colorado Springs School
District are also contributing to development and testing activities. This
proposal is a solid and high quality response to the Solicitation, Programs for
Elementary School Science Instruction, issued by the Instructional Materials
Development Program. The project director and staff are well qualified by
training and experience to conduct the activities. The track record of BSCS
speaks well for the success of the project.
