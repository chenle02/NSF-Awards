This award supports the research on Automorphic Forms of Professor Dinakar
Ramakrishnan of the California Institute of Technology. Dr. Ramakrishnan plans
to continue his work on cusp forms of arithmetic type on GL(2), and to
investigate certain ensuing problems concerning the Shimura varieties attached
to GSp(4) and U(4). He also plans to study the cohomology and cycle classes on
these varieties with a view to finding examples of the expected relationship to
poles and zeros of L-functions. Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early
nineteenth century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that century,
mathematicians had realized that many objects of fundamental importance are non-
Euclidean in their basic nature. The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane
geometries has given rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which
the study of Modular and Automorphic Forms is one of the most active. This field
is principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use
of Geometry and Analysis, it retains connection to its historical roots.
