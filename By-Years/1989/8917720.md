The purpose of this research is to understand the reasons for the existence of
the deserts on the west coasts of major continents. The PI will carry out two
modeling studies which are designed to investigate the roles of certain
processes in the maintenance of the deserts. The first will explore the
possibility that the longshore coastal low level flow represents an inertial
boundary current blocked by the Andes. The second will look at the influence of
the thermal gradient, caused by coastal upwelling, on the local circulation
patterns. This research is importnat for improving our theoretical understanding
of the general atmospheric circulation and climate regimes.
