This project supports the establishment of a new committee on the status of
women in computer science which would operate under the auspices of the
Computing Research Association. The committee will implement projects to
increase the participation of women in computer science research. The goals of
the committee are: (1) "to increase the number of women in all types of research
and in the faculty ranks at universities including both the research
universities and the 4-year teaching colleges", (2) "to increase the degree of
success experienced by women researchers", and (3) to provide a forum for
addressing problems of special concern to women." Near-term projects include (1)
preparation of computer science materials for K- 12, (2) review of teaching
materials for sexism, (3) regional workshops on tenure and recruiting of women,
(4) mentoring of undergraduate and graduate females in computer science. (5)
development of a women speakers list, and (6) surveys of graduate students.
