The National Virtual Observatory (NVO), an online portal to many large and
diverse astronomical databases, is on its way to becoming an indispensable
research tool. As petabytes of astronomical information are acquired by new
telescopes in many different spectral regimes, fast, powerful and robust means
of access will be of paramount importance in extracting maximal understanding
through effective cross--referencing of giant databases. The most critical new
set of skills that successful researchers will need to master and that current
graduate students in Astronomy should be taught, is that which will allow them
to take advantage of those new research tools. This award will enable the PI and
his research group at Cornell to create an extragalactic HI node within the NVO
environment and, in the process, train a generation of graduate students in the
development and use of online portals.
