The manner in which a key source of information is presented or "framed" appears
to have an effect on judgments and decisions that is both powerful and
generalizable. While initial work in the investigator's laboratory supported the
robustness of this effect, their recent research suggests that a variety of
mediating factors may influence the effect of information frame. A central theme
of this program of research is to use information framing manipulations to
understand the interactive effects of a variety of factors that influence
judgments and decisions. The proposed studies will attempt to move beyond
demonstrations of framing effects to provide empirical evidence of mediating
factors, develop models that incorporate these factors, and provide implications
for understanding individual and managerial decision making.
