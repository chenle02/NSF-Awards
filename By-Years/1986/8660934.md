This proposal will investigate the use of Moire' interferometry in conjunction
with optical Fourier transforms in a machine vision system for application to
inspection tasks. The suitability of Fourier sampling in the interpretation of
Moire' fringes will be investigated and the robustness of the system using
different test objects under different conditions will be tested. Current
machine vision systems are primarily based on video signal processing by digital
computer. The amount of information that must be digitally processed for each
test object is large, thus processing is either slow or requires expensive
hardware. The proposed method employs optical signal processing in both the
Moire' and Fourier portions of the system, thus greatly reducing the digital
processing requirements. The proposed techniques are inherently inexpensive and
very fast, and should be robust in production situations. The research plan in
this Phase I includes: Generation of well defined Moire' patterns and
investigating these with the Moire'/Fourier system. Testing the system on good
and bad versions of test objects, such as stamped metal part with dent or
improper curvature, smooth metal part with scratches, turned metal part with
nicks or out-of-roundness, and injection molded part with extraneous flashing.
Investigate the discrimination capability for moving objects at typical
production speeds. Investigate position tolerance by moving the test object in
the field of view. This research should determine which applications are suited
to Moire'/Fourier inspection and what kind of inspection discrimination can be
realized, and will provide direction for further phases. Follow-on phases are
planned which include investigating a table top set up of optimum hardware
configuration to handle the largest range of inspection parameters, followed by
commercial development of a system. This research should lead to an efficient
machine vision system which is expected to contribute to reducing manufacturing
costs, improving product quality and gaining competitive strength.
