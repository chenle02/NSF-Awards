Abstract - Rawlings - 9708497 The goal of this research project is to further
develop the theory of model predictive control (MPC) and further its application
as a means to improve real-time operation of chemical processes. The research
focuses on four areas: (1) Developing new theory for the linear plant case. This
new theory is needed to support the next generation of MPC technology for plants
described by linear models, which are the MPC models for most current industrial
implementations. (2) Handling large-scale applications through better
optimization methods. The industrial trend in several of the process industries
is towards larger scale MPC applications. The industrially implemented
optimization approaches are reaching their limits on these large problems. This
research develops the optimization theory and provides new optimization
algorithms to enable practitioners to tackle these large-scale applications. (3)
Developing improved methods for controlling nonlinear plants. Although the
straightforward extension of linear MPC to nonlinear plants works from a control
theory perspective, the optimization difficulties are intractable from the
implementation perspective. Building on the research of several groups during
the last several years, the PI plans to implement several new approaches for the
nonlinear plant, which do not require the solution to non-convex optimization
problems. (4) Application of MPC in collaboration with industrial partners. The
applications serve both as a vehicle to transfer technology and as a test-bed
for evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of these new theoretical results.
The PI's approaches are made freely available in high-level computing languages
to aid practitioners in testing and evaluation via computer simulation.
