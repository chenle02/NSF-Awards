9301494 Michalowski The objectives of this research are: 1. to improve
understanding of soil-reinforcement interaction, and 2. develop an analysis and
design method for reinforced earth structures, applicable to traditional
reinforcement (long metal bars, large blankets of synthetic fabric or geogrid),
short fiber reinforcement, continuous filament reinforcement, and reinforcement
resisting bending and shear (such as soil nails). The admissible failure modes
of the reinforced soil mass will be considered within an energy-based approach,
and the presence of reinforcement will be included as additional terms in the
energy balance equation due to the energy dissipation within the reinforcing
elements. Tensile failure of reinforcement, collapse associated with bending or
shear, and reinforcement slip, and yield criteria for randomly reinforced soil
will be derived. *** ~ ~ME143D TMP } ~ME143D TXT } ~ME3511 TMP =~ ~ME0C2D TMP }
