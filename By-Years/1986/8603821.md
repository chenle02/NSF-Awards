This research develops an improved model for the stress-strain behavior of
cellular materials and incorporates the three different states of deformation
associated with cellular materials including (l) cell wall bending, (2) collapse
of cell walls, and (3) reinforcement by multiple cell walls in contact. The
model will predict elastic moduli, energy absorption, and densification based on
the geometry of the cells, cell wall thickness, and moduli of the materials.
Experiments will be conducted to verify the predictive model.
