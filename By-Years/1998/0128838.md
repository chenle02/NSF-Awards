0129163&lt;br/&gt;Raines&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Ronald Raines and
students from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in a collaboration with Renate
Ulbrich-Hofmann of the Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology at the
University of Leipzig, Germany. The aim of the international project is to use
intein-mediated protein ligation to create semisynthetic variants of
ribonuclease A. These variants will be produced by the US group and studied with
respect to their thermodynamic and proteolytic stability by methods established
in the German group. The results will provide new insight into protein-folding
pathways and the fundamental basis for protein stability, and ultimately lead to
the creation of new proteins with desirable properties. The work plan provides
for extensive participation by graduate students in the international travel and
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
