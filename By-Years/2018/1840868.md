Support is provided for the international oceanographic activities of the
Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR) that are relevant to U.S.
interests in marine sciences and the Division of Ocean Sciences. Support of
these international activities through SCOR began in 1987. The SCOR provides an
international, interdisciplinary, non-governmental focus for ocean research and
makes it possible for national ocean science communities to (1) participate in
international research projects, (2) identify important ocean science issues and
create working groups to address the issues, and (3) participate in capacity-
building activities (40% of SCOR national committees are based in developing
countries). Funding in this request provides partial support for SCOR Working
Group activities, and international projects such as International Ocean Carbon
Coordination Project (IOCCP), Surface Ocean - Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS),
Integrated Marine Biogeochemistry and Ecosystem Research (IMBER), and GEOTRACES.
These activities also are supported by other international and national
sponsors.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;These major programs have origins in US and have
turned to SCOR to provide a forum for international planning and coordination.
SCOR's impact has and will continue to be evident in the standardization of
measurement protocols, sharing of data, coordination of ship time, and the
enlargement of field studies which would be impossible without international
coordination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
