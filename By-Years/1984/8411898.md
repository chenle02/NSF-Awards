Studies are conducted of collision processes occurring in plasmas produced in
various gases and gas mixtures. Research continues on the dependence of the
reaction rate constants of three- and four-body ion conversion processes on gas
temperature. A knowledge of this dependence may lead to a better understanding
of the recently discovered four-body ion conversion process and to a more
efficient design of several gas discharge devices such as a gas laser. The
energy transfer processes between activated rare gas particles and molecules are
investigated. These studies may give more detailed information about the
mechanisms of energy transfer in plasmas. Measurements are made of the
dependence of the destruction frequency of metastable atoms on gas temperature.
These data are needed for determining which collision processes are important
for predicting the behavior of electric discharge devices such as lasers, glow
discharge switches, and plasma reactors.
