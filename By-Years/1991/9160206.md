This is a SBIR Phase I project. It is proposed to develop a completely new
process to produce Large Diameter Fiber Optic Tapers. Fiber optic tapers are
used in a wide range of applications including X-ray imaging system. Virtually
all the existing tapers are less than 50 mm diameter. However, many existing and
potential applications require tapers up to 200mm. Such tapers are difficult to
make. Incom has recently developed technology which offer potential to overcome
this difficulty. The objective of the research is to determine the feasibility
of this idea. If successful, it will contribute to technical and commercial
advancements in scientific imaging.
