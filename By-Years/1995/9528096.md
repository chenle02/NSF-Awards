Paczynski, Bohdan 95-28096 Dr. Paczynski will study detached, eclipsing, double-
line spectroscopic binaries, which are the primary source of information about
stellar masses, luminosities, radii and effective temperatures. They can also be
used to determine distances to about one percent accuracy; distances to several
globular clusters and at least four nearby galaxies will be determined this way,
based on observations of member binaries. ***
