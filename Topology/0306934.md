This research project concerns the geometric classification theory of
topological 4-manifolds. The classification techniques are known to hold for a
class of good fundamental groups, and are conjectured to fail in general. This
conjecture remains a central open problem in 4-dimensional topology. One goal of
this project is to prove that the disk embedding theorem, and consequently the
surgery and s-cobordism theorems, hold for amenable fundamental groups. Another
approach to surgery, explored in the project, is provided by the disk embedding
conjecture up to s-cobordism. The topology of 4-manifolds is closely related to
link-slicing problems, and the third part of the project aims at extending the
results about slicing to Whitehead doubles of homotopically trivial links.

The classification of possible large-scale structures in dimension 4, which
locally look like the 4-dimensional space-time, has been a focus of intensive
research over the past 20 years. This area of research lies at the intersection
of topology, geometry, analysis and physics. This project is aimed at
classification of 4-dimensional objects with amenable fundamental groups, and at
proving the non-existence result of certain 4-dimensional shapes with large
fundamental groups, which contain many loops that cannot be contracted.
