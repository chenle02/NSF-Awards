This award will provide partial support for Dr. Norman Elwood of Oregon State
University to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Masahiro Amano of the
Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute, Tsukuba, Japan. Objectives of
the research are to develop a working model of U.S. and Japanese forestry
cooperatives and to assess the economic, social, and operational feasibility for
forestry cooperatives in the U.S. Dr. Elwood will conduct a comprehensive review
of forestry cooperative literature at Japanese university and government
libraries, and will interview members, managers, and advisors of Japanese
cooperatives including forestry extension programs, forest owners associations,
foresters, and government officials who consult with cooperatives. Forest-based
industries are important to the economics of both the U.S. and Japan. Although
forestry management and marketing cooperatives make vital contributions to the
productivity of Japanese forest operations, such cooperatives are less common
and, on the average, far less successful in the U.S. Collaboration with
researchers at Japan's Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute will
enable Dr. Elwood to better understand these organizations and will enable him
to include aspects of the Japanese cooperative system into a working model for
U.S. forestry cooperatives.
