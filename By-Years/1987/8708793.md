A complete theoretical study of the thermohydrodynamic characteristics of
bearings lubricated with contaminated oil will be performed. Very important, yet
often neglected, factors such as thermal expansion of the shaft and bearing will
be considered. A mixing temperature formulation will be developed and
implemented in a general finite difference computer code. Wear characteristics
of the bearing and shaft will be taken into consideration. The results will be
compared with those of published experimental findings. Finally, dimensionless
performance parameters useful to the designers will be provided for a wide range
of operating conditions as a function of particle type, size, and concentration.
