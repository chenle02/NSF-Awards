Title: February Fourier Talks 2012

This award provides support for the seventh meeting in the February Fourier
Talks (FFT) series. The 2012 FFT will be held February 16-17, 2012, at the
University of Maryland, College Park. The FFT is a high-level forum for harmonic
analysts to bring their work to scientists from industry and government
agencies. In addition it allows experts in applied and pure harmonic analysis to
get familiar with the latest problems in need of mathematical formulation and
solution. Finally, it introduces young mathematicians and scientists to applied
and pure harmonic analysis. More information, including a list of speakers and
abstracts, registration information, and an archive of past conferences, can be
found at the conference webpage: www.fft2012.org.

The February Fourier Talks directly encourage dialogue and collaboration between
mathematicians and scientists working in industry and government. The structure
of the conference consists of three main lectures and sixteen 30 minute invited
talks. The conference encourages and financially supports participation by
students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in
mathematics.
