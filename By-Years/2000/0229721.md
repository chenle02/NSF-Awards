The Franklin Institute Science Museum will develop, install and evaluate "The
Franklin Air Show," a 5,000-sq. ft. interactive, permanent exhibition that
explores the science and technology of aviation and aeronautics. Taking
advantage of nationwide interest in the 100th anniversary of powered flight
occurring in 2003, and the institute's collection of Wright Brothers
Aeronautical Collection (including a restored 1911 Model B Flyer), "The Franklin
Air Show" presents aviation and aeronautical technology as a vehicle for
demonstrating basic science principles and the practical application of
scientific and technical knowledge through invention, innovation and design. To
extend the reach of "The Franklin Air Show," the Institute will disseminate
parent and teacher curriculum guides through partnerships with the American
Association of Physics Teachers and the Federal Aviation Administration. The
exhibit is supported by innovative World Wide Web programming on The Franklin
Institute Online, including "Flights if Inspiration" and digitized artifacts
from the Wright collection.
