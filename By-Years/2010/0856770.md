This collaboration is building upon a successful biotechnology program and an
experienced team at Salt Lake Community College (SLCC) by adding Utah Valley
University (UVU) and numerous high schools in the region in order to enhance
matriculation and success in biotechnology and other STEM disciplines. Using a
2+2+2 pipeline approach, the collaboration is creating an integrated network of
activities that encourages and supports students as they move from the junior
year of high school through two- and four-year institutions. This includes
strengthening the secondary programs by providing high school teachers and
students with research-based learning opportunities, increasing the number of
biology and chemistry courses at SLCC, creating learning communities in gateway
courses, expanding biotechnology courses and laboratories at UVU, establishing
service learning and community outreach activities, and assisting with child
care support for working parents at SLCC. The strong support from secondary and
post-secondary institutions, industry, and the state of Utah increases the
broader impact of this project by establishing networks, providing support
mechanisms, and building capacity among institutions in the entire northern and
central region of Utah.
