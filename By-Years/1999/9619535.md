Thirteen undergraduates will spend three summer months at the Space Physics
Research Laboratory, University of Michigan, where they work with faculty
members researching airglow and atmospheric science, space plasma physics,
cometary studies, planetary atmospheres, air pollution transport, and lidars.
The students interact with mentors, other undergraduates in the program,
graduates, and faculty. They gain hands-on experience working with
instrumentation which has or will fly in space, and is making remote sensing
measurements of the atmosphere. In addition, they fabricate and calibrate
components of these systems. They will construct and work with software packages
solving analytical expressions, present space flight data in image forms, and
manipulate large data bases.
