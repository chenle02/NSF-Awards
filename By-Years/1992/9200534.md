The overall goal of the research is to use observationally- based data to
better understand and predict hydrological and dynamical processes over the
western Pacific Ocean and their interactions with adjacent areas. The main
objective will be to prepare an atlas containing monthly means of several
kinematic, thermodynamic, and hydrological variables over the tropical Indian
and Pacific Oceans with an emphasis on the TOGA-COARE region. The atlas will use
ECMWF analyses from the WCRP/TOGA archive II data set for 1985-1990, and should
be completed shortly after the end of the intense observing period (IOP) of TOGA
COARE. In subsequent years, a second atlas will be completed to include TOGA-
COARE results for comparison. Other specific objectives are: to diagnose the
horizontal and vertical structure of the intraseasonal oscillation as it
traverses the Large-Scale Array (LSA) of TOGA- COARE; to investigate the
relationship between enhanced tropical heating in the LSA and subtropical wind
maxima over the western Pacific; and to examine a new method for improving
estimates of heat and moisture transfer coefficients with the intent of
improving estimates of sensible heat exchange and evaporation over tropical
oceans. The research is important because it is one of the TOGA COARE studies to
investigate the principal processes responsible for the coupling of the ocean
and the atmosphere in an especially climate sensitive region of the world, the
western Pacific Ocean, the field site of TOGA COARE.
