This project will develop rigorously understood, highly efficient and accurate
computational tools (algorithms and their software implementation, based on a
solid theoretical foundation) for simulating the motion of networks of surfaces
under geometric motions such as motion by weighted mean curvature and motion by
surface diffusion. The approach is based on a new, variational formulation of
threshold dynamics (also known as diffusion generated motion) of Merriman,
Bence, and Osher that makes it possible to correctly extend the original
algorithm to e.g. weighted mean curvature flow of multiple phases with unequal
and anisotropic surface tensions.

The geometric motions that will be studied in this project play a central role
in materials science, where they describe the microstructural evolution of
polycrystalline materials under common industrial processes such as annealing
(heat treatment). Polycrystalline materials are very common: most metals and
ceramics belong to this category. They are composed of tiny single-crystal
pieces, known as grains, that are joined together along their faces. The
physical properties of these materials, such as conductivity and yield strength,
depend intimately on their microstructure (the shapes and sizes of the grains
that make up the material). This project will advance our ability to simulate
how the microstructure of these materials change, which is important for
computational design of materials, where computer simulations rather than costly
experiments would identify the most favorable processing parameters for
achieving desired characteristics.
