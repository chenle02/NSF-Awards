Over eight years of observations, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has
contributed to many fields of astronomy, from the identification of distinct
families of asteroids in our own solar system to the discovery of the most
distant luminous quasars, mapping both the surprisingly complex distribution of
stars in our own Milky Way and the distribution of galaxies that trace the
largest scale structures in the Universe. This broad-ranging symposium will
review progress and prospects, integrating observational contributions from the
SDSS and from other major surveys with theoretical interpretation of the
results, and to discuss plans for the next generation of large astronomical
survey projects. The organizers plan on 200 participants, about half of them
from the SDSS Collaboration (which itself has some 300 scientific participants)
and half from elsewhere. The seven main science sessions will be: The Solar
System, Stars, The Milky Way and Its Neighbors, Galaxies, Quasars, Large-Scale
Structure and Galaxy Clusters, and Supernova Cosmology. Sessions will include
invited reviews, contributed talks, and poster presentations.

The major goal of the conference is to review results from the 15-year effort on
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and present these to the broader community. Funds
from this grant will support reduced registration fees and travel expenses for
student participants.
