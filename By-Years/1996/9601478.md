9601478 Clayton This grant, made through the Academic Research Infrastructure
(ARI) Program, provides $410,000 as partial support of the costs of acquiring a
high-resolution inductively coupled mass spectrometer (HR-ICP-MS) equipped with
a laser ablation microprobe for the Department of Geophysical Sciences at the
University of Chicago. The primary use of this instrument will be for
siderophile and chalcophile trace elemental analyses of mantle derived rocks and
meteorites as proxies for their petrogenesis and indicators of early planetary
differentiation. An accurate estimate of the siderophile (i.e. Re, Os Ir, Pd,
Pt, Au) elemental abundances and their microspatial distributions in mantle
materials will provide clues to the formation conditions of the early Earth.
Other uses of the HR-ICP-MS will include studies of paleo-redox conditions
through determination of the abundances of redox sensitive trace elements in
marine sediments. ***
