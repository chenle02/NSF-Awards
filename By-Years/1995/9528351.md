ABSTRACT 9528351 This proposal focuses on thermal diffusion in disordered
materials at short time scales. Experiments using the pump-probe optical
technique to measure transient surface temperature will be used to assess the
utility of fractal models in understanding the thermal transport phenomena.
Potential application is to high frequency electronic devices and to the
characterization of new amorphous, polycrystalline and nanostructured materials.
