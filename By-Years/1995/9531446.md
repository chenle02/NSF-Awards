The Summer Institute for the Mathematical Sciences at Berkeley The University
of California at Berkeley proposes to develop and operate the Summer Institute
for the Mathematical Sciences (SIMS), a 6-week program for mathematically
talented undergraduate women. SIMS provides 24 women, selected nationwide, with
an intensive mathematics program that is designed to motivate and prepare them
to enter and complete successfully a Ph.D. program in the mathematical sciences.
SIMS aims to provide participants with a mathematical experience that will give
them a taste of what it is to be a researcher in the mathematical sciences, and
it aims to communicate to the students that women can and should be doing
mathematics. At the heart of the program are four seminars, two each in pure and
applied mathematics. Each seminar is led by a woman, selected nationwide, who is
an active research mathematician and a talented teacher. She is aided by a
teaching assistant who is a female graduate student in mathematics. The students
take two seminars, one pure and one applied. The character of the work is very
different from that which is encountered in typical undergraduate mathematics
courses. Students immerse themselves in the seminar material to discover and
prove results without the aid of textbooks, they are given many hard problems
and projects, and they learn how to obtain and express mathematical ideas in
conversation and in writing. In addition to the seminars, mathematics colloquia
are held twice weekly. In these talks, well-known mathematicians introduce the
students to a vast panorama of mathematical topics. There are also panel
discussions on: applying to graduate school and fellowship sources, the variety
of graduate programs available in the mathematical sciences, non-academic
careers in mathematics, and the challenges women face as graduate students and
as professionals in the mathematical sciences.
