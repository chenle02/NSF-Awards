Professor Charles Knobler is supported by a grant from The Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to study problems associated with the dynamics
of phase transitions and pattern formation in condensed systems. Experiments and
computer simulations will be used to study Breath Figures, the patterns formed
when droplets condense on partially wetted surfaces. The research will focus on
the mechanism of growth of single droplets and the effects on the patterns of
fluid-surface interactions. Investigations of monolayers of fatty acids at the
air-water interface will also be conducted. The evolution of two-dimensional
foams at the Gas-Liquid Expanded phase transition will be studied and
investigations will be carried out on the growth of striated patterns that are
observed in deep quenches into Liquid Expanded-Liquid Condensed and Liquid
Expanded-Gas two-phase regions. Pattern formation at interfaces in photochemical
reactions will also be investigated. Finally, continued light scattering
measurements on systems with three coexisting phases along a path leading to a
tricritical point will provide information about the asymptotic form of the free
energy.
