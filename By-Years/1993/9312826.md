9312826 DEUSER This study will continue time-series particle-flux measurements
at depths of 500, 1500, and 3200 m in the Sargasso Sea for three years. The
3200-m series presently extends over 15 years. It is by far the longest series
of its kind. Together with the hydrographic time series at nearby Station "S"
and with the growing number of JGOFS time-series measurements (BATS) in the
immediate vicinity this work will continue to provide a data base on physical,
chemical and biological variables in the open ocean. Over the years this time
series has demonstrated the existence of temporal variability in the deep ocean,
revealed the efficiency of processes removing materials from the surface ocean,
and documented many of the effects of those processes on the chemistry and
biology of the deep ocean. A search for a successor PI will be continued along
with maintaining the series and all associated analytical work as well as
identifying the forcing functions of carbon flux to the deep ocean, assessing
decade-scale trends in the efficacy of the "biological pump", and monitoring
transport of anthropogenic components to the deep ocean.
