Iosevich, &lt;br/&gt;Igor Verbitsky&lt;br/&gt;Proposal:
DMS-0222187&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Missouri at
Columbia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal
requests funding for a conference on Harmonic&lt;br/&gt;Analysis and Partial
Differential Equations to be held in &lt;br/&gt;Columbia, Missouri during the
period May 8--11, 2002. The &lt;br/&gt;conference will last 4 four days and is
expected to have&lt;br/&gt;70-80 participants among which 20 will be invited
speakers.&lt;br/&gt;Several world's leading experts in the emerging connections
&lt;br/&gt;between combinatorics, analysis and PDE will speak at
this&lt;br/&gt;conference. NSF funds will be use to support travel
expenses&lt;br/&gt;and room and board for thirty graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
