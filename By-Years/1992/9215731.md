Ambiguity in context-free grammars can be expressed in terms of algebraic
equations and detected via an algebraic approach. This project involves the
implementation of algorithms to detect ambiguity, identify certain ambiguity
causing constructs, and transform these constructs into less ambiguous
constructs.
