The long-term objectives of this research plan are to define the mechanisms of
heterotypic cell-cell interactions which regulate the normal development and
maturation of embryonic neural cells. Cell differentiation and maturation in
neural tissues is a plastic process and subject to change in response to
microenviromental cues. Hence, inborn developmental errors likely result when
normal cell relations are disturbed by external stimuli or genetic alterations.
Certain aspects of neuroglial cell development have been defined which are
dependent on neuronal-glial interactions for normal and timely expression.
Specific probes of cell surface components have been defined which interfere
with this interaction between heterotypic cells. The cell surface molecules
which react with the inhibitory probes will be defined and their role in cell-
cell communication investigated. Biochemical and immunochemical analyses will be
conducted to define the molecular interactions involved. Defined subcategories
of neural cells will be isolated by immunomagnetic separation. The defined cell
types will be recombined with other defined populations of cells in vitro under
varying controlled conditions and the effects of cell interaction inhibitors
determined. Biochemical analysis of communication-dependent gene expression will
be measured. Studies will also be conducted in situ to determine whether or not
probes which interfere with cell development in vitro will also affect
development in the embryo.
