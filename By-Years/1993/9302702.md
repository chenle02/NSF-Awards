Casian will study the problem of computing the cohomology of the flag variety
for real reductive Lie groups, the cup product and Weyl group action, using the
representation theory of the group. He will investigate the problem of
determining which Schubert cells contribute to the non torsion part in homology.
He will also investigate similar problems in the Kac-Moody setting. The theory
of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has
been one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the
mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the
representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics
itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical
physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.
