This project is to investigate the dynamic behavior and the seismic design of
the Meloland Road Overpass (MRO), a two-span reinforced concrete bridge close to
the Imperial fault in southeastern California. Full-scale dynamic testing,
comprehensive geotechnical investigation of subsurface soil materials will be
made. The investigation, as a supplementary portion of a comprehensive study
program on MRO, will enable an assessment of the current seismic bridge design
provisions to be made.
