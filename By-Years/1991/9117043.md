This is an award to support research on the factors that affect the rate of
flocculation of particles in water suspension when subjected to contacts with
metallic salt coagulants and coagulant aids used in processes for treatment of
water. Experimental variables being considered are the effects of temperature,
coagulant dosage, pH, concentration of suspended substances and sulfate
concentrations. Research is being conducted at bench scale. Coagulants include
ferric and aluminum salts and the coagulant aids include cationic polymers.
Results of this project are expected to improve our understanding of
flocculation, an important unit operation conducted in treatment of both water
and wastewater. This understanding is further expected to provide the basis for
improvement in the engineering design of treatment systems that include
flocculation as a unit operation, and in the improvement of existing treatment
plants that use this process in their water treatment and wastewater treatment
operations.
