The project has several distinct parts. Each component addresses a fundamental
problem in an important area of economics. In the first part, we propose a game-
theoretic solution concept called a Markov equilibrium. Economists use dynamic
games to make predictions about how economic actors interact strategically over
time. Markov equilibrium is a tool for making sharper predictions in these
dynamic games. We extend the notion of a Markov equilibrium to include
situations in which actions of agents cannot be observed, and situations in
which agents learn by experimentation. We use these tools to examine dynamic
inequality and segregation. In the second part we propose to examine the
efficiency of auctions. Auctions are a commonly-used mechanist for allocating
goods across buyers. We plan to investigate which auctions do the best job of
ensuring that the complex goods end up in the hands of the buyers who value them
the most. Third, we plan to study the extent to which the difficulty of
foreseeing or specifying future contingencies may interfere with contract
negotiations between two economic parties. In our model, we address the
difficult problem of agents who cannot make contracts contingent on every state
of nature, but can make contracts contingent on future payoffs. Finally, we
propose to investigate which voting rules (e.g., majority rule or plurality
rule) are robust in the sense that they work `well` (satisfy certain standard
desiderata) in as wide set of circumstances as possible.
