Statistical learning is widely recognized as a very active area of
interdisciplinary research, which lives between statistics, computer science,
and optimization. This research offers a host of new statistical learning
techniques for solving complicated learning problems, especially for high
dimensional and noisy data. In particular, the investigator develops (1).
several novel large-margin classifiers which are expected to yield highly
competitive classification accuracy, class probability estimation, as well as
variable selection; (2). a new regularization approach to estimate the
covariance matrix for a class of nonstationary spatial autoregressive model;
(3). a novel technique to assess statistical significance of clustering for high
dimensional data.

With the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being
generated across many different scientific fields. Analyzing such data becomes
more and more challenging. A major goal of this research is to provide a set of
flexible statistical learning techniques. These tools should have beneficial
impact on cancer research, medical imaging, microarray data analysis and
spatial-temporal modeling. The investigator collaborates with a number of
scientists in various fields outside of statistics such as biology, computer
science, pharmacy, and genetics. The new developments allow scientists to
analyze complex data with high prediction accuracy and increased
interpretability. Efficient algorithms and software are developed for public
use. The integration of the research goals with educational activities aims to
help students at graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels and researchers
from various disciplines to acquire state-of-the-art statistical learning
methods and tools.
