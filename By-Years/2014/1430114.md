This award provides student travel support for the International Conference on
Distributed Computing (DISC) to be held from October 11-15 2014, in Austin,
Texas. DISC is one of two premier conferences in the foundations of distributed
computing, and is a forum on the theory, design, analysis, implementation, and
application of distributed systems and
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distributed systems are becoming increasingly
indispensable in our day to day lives. The functioning of basic communication
infrastructure and services relies on our understanding and correct
implementation of distributed systems. The broader impact is that attendance of
students in DISC will expose more students to the exciting developments in the
field and in the long run will help to build a broad base of expertise in the
field, which will impact both industry and academia.
