Professor Speh will continue her research with J. Rohlfs concerning Lefschetz
numbers of automorphisms of arithmetic groups. She plans to find a stabilization
(in the sense of Langlands) of the Lefschetz numbers and then use this to find
an expression for the Lefschetz number using the Arthur-Selberg trace formulas.
Professor Barbasch will continue his work on unipotent representations of real
reductive groups, their character theory, and their role in the classification
of the unitary dual. He will be involved in several projects: (i) with J. Adams
he will study the dual reductive pair correspondence for the case of unipotent
representations, (ii) with A. Moy he will study the unitary dual for unramified
representations, and (iii) with S. Evens he will study relations between the
geometry of orbits, similar Shubert varieties, and multiplicities in finite
dimensional representations. Group theory is basically the theory of symmetry.
To take a simple example, when the system in question is invariant under a
change in the position of the origin of space, the group of translations
naturally arises. While groups are abstract objects, particular situations
demand concrete realizations or "representations" of the symmetry group. The
projects of Professors Speh and Barbasch will contribute to our understanding of
group representations.
