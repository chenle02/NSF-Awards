This research is concerned with the representation theory of finite groups and
group cohomology. The principal investigator will work on Mackey functors;
Alperin's conjecture; the development of computer software; group cohomology
calculations; stable summands of classifying spaces; and perfect isometries of
blocks and derived equivalences. The research supported concerns the
representation theory of finite groups. A group is an algebraic object used to
study transformations. Because of this, groups are a fundamental tool in
physics, chemistry and computer science as well as mathematics. Representation
theory is an important method for determining the structure of groups.
