Turgay Uzer is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of energy flow in atomic and
molecular systems. Classical, quantal, and semi-classical techniques will be
used to study dynamics of Rydberg atoms and molecules in static external fields,
photoionization and photodissociation in intense laser fields, and vibrational
energy transfer between adsorbates and substrates on well-characterized
surfaces. One of the overall aims of the research is to identify the
transferable motifs in the dynamics, like mechanisms, time scales and the
influence of couplings and anharmonicities, which persist in proceeding in
complexity from atoms to surfaces. Laser desorption from metal surfaces, and
laser photoionization are technologically important processes which are not well
understood at the molecular level. They depend on a details of the energy flow
between the various degrees of freedom with the molecule and between the
molecule and the surface. Uzer's research will help to provide a molecular level
characterization of these processes.
