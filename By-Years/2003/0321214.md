With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Baylor University will acquire a
X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector. This equipment will enhance research in
a number of areas including the following: a) the synthesis and characterization
of new organometallic species, especially anionic compounds that may be linked
together for the formation of dendrimers, polymers and other supramolecular
species; b) the study of the chemistry of 'half sandwich' monocarbollide
complexes of transition metals; c) the design of new vascular targeting agents
for cancer chemotherapy; and d) the development of chemically modified electrode
arrays for sensing ionic contaminants in aqueous matrices.

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full
three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles,
and it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the
molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have an
impact in a number of areas, especially medicinal chemistry and materials
chemistry.
