This award provides partial support for participation by U.S.-based
mathematicians at an international conference in geometric topology to be held
in Tuscany, Italy, during June 5-9, 2017. Topology is the study of the
properties of spaces that do not depend on a way to measure distance; this
conference focuses on those spaces that arise in geometric contexts such as
surfaces and three-dimensional spaces (with the universe we live in being one
example). The conference will feature both research talks on the latest
developments in the area and three mini-courses designed for advanced graduate
students and other early career mathematicians. The conference will provide an
opportunity for those conducting cutting-edge research to present their results
and a venue for discussion and collaboration among established researchers and
junior mathematicians in the field. This award will allow a significant number
of U.S.-based early-career mathematicians to attend, and a majority of this
funding will support these mathematicians.

The conference will focus primarily on low-dimensional hyperbolic geometry, and,
more generally, geometric structures on manifolds. Mini-courses on character
varieties and knot symmetries, arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and
renormalized volume will provide an introduction to several of the emerging
trends in the field. This will be complemented by research talks from a
distinguished international group of speakers. More information on the
conference can be found at
