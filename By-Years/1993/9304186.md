9304186 CONSTABLE, Catherine Recent global geomagnetic field models provide
detailed pictures of the geomagnetic field, both at Earth's surface and at the
core-mantle boundary. However, because of the short time spanned by the
historical data that contribute to these models, they only sample a tiny
fraction of the variability known to occur in the geomagnetic field. This
project is to extend the time period over which global field models are
available using time series of paleomagnetic data derived from archeological
artifacts and sediment. A limited number of high quality data sets exist
spanning the past 3000 years, and these will be compiled and carefully assessed.
