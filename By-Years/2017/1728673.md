The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project can widely
affect the implementation of photovoltaics, by significantly reducing the cost
without compromising on device performance. The low temperature silver reactive
inks are projected to use 90 percent less silver than traditional screen-
printing technologies. Additionally the low temperature process will use
significantly less energy and utilize equipment with relatively low capital
expenditures requirements and high throughputs. This technique is of particular
importance to temperature sensitive devices and substrates, not only because the
reactive inks do not require firing but also because low temperature screen
printing silver paste are costly, even more so than their high temperature
counterparts. Thus the path envisioned for this technology not only can
radically change the cost structure of solar cells but it also has the potential
of affecting other markets such as wearable electronics, flexible displays and
building integrated devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project further
develops findings in the field of evaporation-confined adhesion promotion and
reactive ink chemistry. It is based on application of reactive inks to
photovoltaics, optimization of adhesion pretreatments, and understanding of
printing and drying kinetics of the multiple chemical solutions involved in the
process. It has been demonstrated that the process can reduce silver consumption
by an order of magnitude and obtain comparable high efficiency to a screen-
printed heterojuntion device. It has been further demonstrated that the reactive
silver metallization is compatible with the state-of-the-art smart wiring
technology for module assembly, reducing the silver consumption even further. It
has also been shown that the reactive ink printed modules can withstand damp
heat accelerated testing without any signs of performance loses, corrosion or
delamination of the modules.
