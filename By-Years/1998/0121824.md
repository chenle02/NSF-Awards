University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Projects: DIMACS Workshop: Complexity in
Biosystems: Innovative Approaches at the Interface of Experimental Modeling and
Computational Simulation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop focuses on the new
research area of complex biosystems modeling and simulation, bringing together
scientists who are developing this field along with interested newcomers. It
will serve to build a community of researchers across disciplinary boundaries in
computer and mathematical sciences and biology, leading to a continuing
collaborative working group in this area. The workshop proposal requests
participant support for 3 nonlocal organizers and 18 invited speakers, with
additional participant support set aside for nonlocal graduate student
participation. &lt;br/&gt;
