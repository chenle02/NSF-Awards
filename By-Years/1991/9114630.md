The research objective is to develop fundamental insight, including explicit
control design procedures, for control of mechanical systems subject to
nonholonomic constraints (i.e., systems characterized by rolling without
slipping). It has been demonstrated that suitable control cannot be achieved
using classical nonlinear control methodologies, and this project's intent is to
develop methods which are consistent with this class of dynamics problems. These
methods involve mathematical concepts from differential geometry. Strong
motivation is provided for this research by several important classes of
engineering control problems, including several classes of problems with
aerospace applications.*** //
