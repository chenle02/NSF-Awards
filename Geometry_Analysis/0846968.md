Abstract

Award: DMS-0846968 Principal Investigator: Martin Bridgeman, Noel Brady, Tao Li

The award supports US speakers and invited US junior researchers attending the
fourth William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop, a 3-day, directed
workshop to be held at the Hamilton Mathematics Institute in Dublin, Ireland in
August 28-30, 2008. Participants at the workshop include leading researchers,
junior researchers and graduate students from the fields of low dimensional
topology, geometric group theory, and hyperbolic geometry who have a special
interest in problems related to Heegaard splittings, mapping class groups, and
curve complexes. Specific topics include the relation of the combinatorial data
of a Heegaard splitting to the hyperbolic structure on the manifold and
applications of Masur-Minsky techniques on the curve complex to the Surface
Subgroup Conjecture and the Virtually Haken Conjecture. There is already a
growing tendency for researchers in each of areas of Heegaard splittings,
mapping class groups, and curve complexes to use techniques from the other two
areas. This workshop should increase this, and will focus collective energies on
common themes.

Mathematicians who study low dimensional topology, geometric group theory, and
hyperbolic geometry are concerned about the nature of symmetry. Examples include
the symmetries of a snowflake, frieze patterns in architecture, wallpaper and
tiling patterns, and symmetries of crystal or lattice structures in chemistry.
This award will enable leading researchers, graduate students and junior
researchers from the US to gather together with researchers from around the
world in order to combine methods and techniques to further research. This
activity will help focus the research programs of the next generation of
researchers, and will deepen our understanding of the nature of symmetry. This
activity supports an ongoing international workshop dedicated to forging bonds
between the US mathematics community and an emerging mathematics institute (the
Hamilton Mathematics Institute) in the European community.
