The investigator's new interpretation for charge-transfer polymerization
involves tetramethylene zwitterions and diradicals as the key intermediates. To
support this concept, he will generate the respective tetramethylenes in novel
ways, and will examine their behavior as initiators. Potential sources include
thermolysis of cyclobutanes, cyclic sulfones, and cyclic azo precursors.
Cyclobutanes containing leaving groups will be used to generate cationic
initiating species. Lewis acids will be used to catalyze the formation of
tetramethylenes both diradical and zitterionic, depending on the Lewis acid.
This will be a powerful new tool for control of initiation. Appropriate
gegenionic leaving groups in electrophilic or nucleophilic olefin initiators
will control the propagation reaction as well as the initiation. This concept
will be used in both coordinated cationic and anionic polymerizations. The
concept will be broadened to the study of other polymethylenes, in particular
trimethylenes, pentamethylenes, and hexamethylenes. This research is part of the
Polymers Program's effort to understand the fundamentals of polymer synthesis so
as to be able to control the structure of polymers.
