This funding allows ten students to travel to the Computer Aided Verification
2011 conference and its allied workshops held at Snowbird, Utah, during July
14-20. It also allows these students to partially offset registration costs. The
CAV Travel Awards committee emphasizes funding minorities and underrepresented
groups. This CAV is 23rd in its series and continues to be pivotal in developing
new methods for software and hardware
correctness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: CAV is the premier
conference on software and hardware correctness based on model checking and
allied technologies. These methods are fundamental to the production of correct
hardware and software. This funding allows the advancement of science by
increasing attendance and participation by students, especially underrepresented
groups. Such participation is vital for sustaining the intellectual aspects of a
flagship conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT: This award ensures the
participation of students, especially underrepresented groups and minorities, in
the software and hardware revolution. It ensures the development of vital
technologies for correct operation of computing systems used for critical
applications ranging from medical to aerospace. It ensures adequate and broad-
based supply of trained manpower for hardware/software industries and academia.
