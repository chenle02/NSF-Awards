9423716 He Thin metal film applications in electronic devices and circuits are
topics of great current interest and will be studied. The goal of this research
is to obtain a reliable, low-resistivity, thin metal film by LT deposition, to
attain lower resistance performance. The planning activities are as follows: (1)
Prepare uniform, electrical and structural stable LT thin films of various
conventional contact metals including : Au, Al, Ag, Pd, Ni and Cr; (2) Evaluate
the resistivity, TCR and their relation to the film thickness as well as the
film preparation conditions, deposition rate and substrate temperature. Perform
the stability test; and (3) Identify the physical and chemical structure, as
well as the conduction mechanism of the LT thin films, correlating
microstructural properties with electrical data. This project will also provide
a better basic understanding of the electrical and structural characteristics of
the LT thin films. ***
