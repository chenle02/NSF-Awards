Many of the deepest problems in theoretical physics revolve around combining
Einstein's theory of general relativity with quantum theory, two of the major
intellectual achievements of the twentieth century. The resulting theory is
called "quantum gravity" and is needed to better understand the origin of the
universe, the nature of space and time on small scales, what happens inside
black holes, and the very origin of our universe, the big bang. By enabling
graduate students and post-docs to participate in frontier physics, and to
interact with other research groups, this award will have a broad and long-term
impact on the development of future scientists. The results of the research will
be disseminated to the scientific community through peer reviewed publication
and scientific lectures, as well as to the general public through public
lectures and other means.

Much remarkable progress in understanding the big bang has occurred through the
use of loop quantum cosmology, a simplified version of loop quantum gravity
which models the universe as a whole. This award seeks to bridge the gap between
this simplified model and full loop quantum gravity in order to solidify
confidence in the predictions of the former. This involves a number of
interesting conceptual questions for which the principal investigator already
has preliminary answers. A second part of this research aims to answer key
questions regarding the Feynman sum-over-histories formulation of loop quantum
gravity, in which space and time are treated in a more unified way, and to bring
this formulation closer to completion.
