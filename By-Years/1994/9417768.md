9417768 Bethke Developing a quantitative understanding of how rapidly
groundwater migrates through the subsurface in sedimentary basins is fundamental
to our ability to safely dispose of toxic and radioactive wastes as well as to
continued successful exploration for petroleum and metallic resources.
Scientists estimate flow rates using computer models based on physical laws of
flow and with geochemical methods based on the decay of radioactive or
accumulation of radiogenic isotopes. Surprisingly, the two independent
approaches, both seemingly correct, give broadly differing results. This study
aims to reconcile these discrepancies by using quantitative methods that
rigorously account for the many factors influencing the distribution of isotopes
in very old groundwater within sedimentary basins
