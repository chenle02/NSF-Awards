There are serious problems in the college and university science classroom
including intended majors who switch to other disciplines and pervasive student
apathy, especially in introductory level courses. These problems exist because
there is too much emphasis on coverage of material and memorization, an
atmosphere of competition, and new faculty are either under prepared to teach
undergraduate science courses. These issues have stimulated reform efforts that
are just beginning to take place. As a result, there is now a real need for
programs that help professors incorporate student-active approaches into their
classrooms. To address this, we propose to develop a program of workshops
centered in 5 sites throughout the northeast where higher education partnerships
exist. Our program will target professors, including entry level and young
faculty, who teach introductory courses. Hampshire College is the lead agency on
this project; the college has a nationally recognized program in student-active,
inquiry science teaching. Program objectives are to: 1) effectively reach large
numbers of faculty through the "train the trainers" model, 2) give workshop
leaders effective training and tools for leading regional workshop programs, 3)
introduce workshop participants to effective student-active approaches and the
learning theories underlying them, 4) help workshop participants incorporate
student-active approach(es) of their choosing into a course, 5) link faculty
experienced with student-active teaching (mentors) with regional inexperienced
but interested faculty, and especially new faculty, 6) bring together a diverse
group of faculty from different disciplines and types of institutions, with
special emphasis on underrepresented groups in science, and 7) use consortia as
effective means to identify workshops leaders and workshop participants
