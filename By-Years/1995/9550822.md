The department is constructing a time-resolved fluorescence spectrophotometer
for use in advanced undergraduate laboratory courses. The main activities of the
project are (1) enhancing and modernizing the spectroscopy component in advanced
undergraduate laboratories by the introduction of lasers; (2) using fluorescence
spectroscopy as a tool to expose students to current research interests in
biophysical chemistry; (3) collecting data to reinforce chemical principles
introduced in the courses; and (4) providing students with training in
techniques for both the physical-chemical characterization and dynamical study
of biomolecules. The chosen set of experiments uses time-resolved laser
fluorescence spectroscopic techniques for data collection and exposes students
to research on antibodies, nucleic acids, and heme proteins, and to the
dynamical processes occurring in biomolecules. The experiments also introduce
the fundamentals of fluorescence spectroscopy as well as exposing students to
modern techniques in pulsed laser spectroscopy.
