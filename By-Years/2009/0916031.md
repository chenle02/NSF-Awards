Anonymous communication in computer networks generally relies upon the
&amp;#64257;ltering of tra&amp;#64259;c through a cascade of mixes. Clients
select a number of proxy nodes that modify and obscure the origin of a message
so as to make the detection of a relationship between source and destination
extremely di&amp;#64259;cult. While this architecture is known to not be robust
against a globally passive adversary, an ever growing body of literature has
demonstrated that even moderately capable adversaries can link the
communications between two parties using these networks. Accordingly, new
techniques ensuring stronger levels of anonymity must be explored. This project
will develop a new architecture for anonymity networks o&amp;#64256;ering
cryptographic guarantees of anonymity based on a foundation of Secure Function
Evaluation. These Provably Anonymous Networks (PANs) protect the participants of
communication from tra&amp;#64259;c analysis attacks by remaining unaware that
the exchange of messages has occurred. However, realizing a more trustworthy
architecture is not simply the result of haphazardly assembling the above
components. Rather, this system must be carefully composed so as to avoid the
leakage of information useful in the identi&amp;#64257;cation of a communication
channel. The results of this project will not only be used to enhance graduate
and undergraduate curriculum, but will also be used to develop a tool to assist
members of the Carter Center administer observe elections without fear of
eavesdropping.
