This project will support the annual Athabaskan Languages Conference (ALC) at
Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington on August 15-17, 2012.
The conference has never before been hosted at WWU, a location relatively
accessible for Athabaskan communities in British Columbia, Alberta, Yukon,
Alaska, and northern California. The ALC serves as the principal gathering of
linguists, educators, language planners, and community members working with
Athabaskan languages. It is a key event in fostering long-term collaboration
between Athabaskanists working on theoretical linguistics and language
documentation, on the one hand, and linguists and community activists involved
in developing or fostering language revitalization programs, on the other.
