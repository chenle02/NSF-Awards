The principal investigator (PI) will continue research in areas of diagnosis of
multi-processor systems at the system level and of Very Large Systems
Integration (VLSI) intermodule routing. Research in the first area assumes a
computing system consisting of a large number of autonomous interconnected
modules which have the capability of testing one another to identify faulty
modules. The PI will continue his work in developing adaptive diagnostic
algorithms with parallel testing to improve fault testing time in this kind of
system, modifying the Kuhl-Reddy algorithm which includes incomplete information
refining a simple diagnosis algorithm for n-cube multi-processor computing
systems, and analyzing the relationship between distributed diagnosis and the
Byzantine Agreement. The PI also will explore the diagnosis of fault problems
associated with "corners" in VLSI conducting paths that connect terminals on a
chip. This research will include developing improved approximation algorithms
for special cases of the vertex-coloring problem of graph theory that can be
applied to multiple-layer routing problems associated with designing and testing
conducting paths.
