The Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms plus the Axiom of Choice (ZFC) have been widely
accepted as a foundation for mathematics; virtually all branches of mathematics
that have been studied and applied to other scientific fields can be interpreted
in ZFC. However, it turns out that there are natural and important mathematical
theories which cannot be decided by ZFC alone. The Large Cardinal Axioms (LCAs)
are extensions of ZFC designed to settle all such theories. This is the Godel's
program in Set Theory. If an LCA is "correct", then the theories it decides are
also correct. How can one test for correctness of an LCA? The Inner Model
Program, a major program in modern Set Theory, justifies correctness by
constructing canonical models for LCAs much like the natural numbers are the
canonical model for the Peano Axioms of Arithmetic (PA) (and as such PA is a
correct theory). The proposed project contributes to the Inner Model Program by
advancing methods for constructing canonical models for LCAs from various
extensions of ZFC.

The project focuses on studying the connections between inner models, sets of
reals, hybrid structures (such as hereditarily ordinal definable sets (HOD) of
determinacy models), forcing, and strong combinatorial principles (such as the
Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA)). The PI proposes to work on advancing the basic
theory of hybrid structures, focusing on strategy mice and hod mice as well as
developing methods for the core model induction beyond its current state. In
particular, the project aims to make advancements in answering the following
fundamental questions in descriptive inner model theory: (1) Is HOD of a
determinacy model fine-structural (e.g. do the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis
(GCH), various square principles hold in HOD)? (2) What is the consistency
strength of PFA? (3) Does PFA (or any other strong combinatorial theory) imply
models in various partially backgrounded constructions iterable?
