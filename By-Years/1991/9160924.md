With the new generation of programmable digital signal processing hardware and
the recent development in computer-aided design methods, a new approach to the
design of signal processing instruments, intelligent sensors, and
instrumentation systems is now possible. The work will design and build a
complete instrument development system for the fast turn-around design of
portable and field instruments. The system will consist of two components, a
line of generic programmable hand-held instrumentation hardware and a computer-
aided instrument design (CAID) package that will be used to develop the
application software. Most existing electronic instruments are targeted to a
narrow range of specific applications. The main reason for this trend is the
great diversity of instrumentation problems and the lack of powerful
programmable hardware that can meet demands of a sufficiently wide variety of
applications. Two end products of this technology will be: multifunctional,
cartridge-programmable instruments targeted for a broad range of common
instrumentation problems; and the application-specific, field-programmable
instruments developed by the end users.
