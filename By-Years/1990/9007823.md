The P.I. proposes to experimentally examine the influence of three apsects of
the biotic neighborhood on zooplankton dispersal rates, the density, quality and
type of neighbors experienced by an individual. Dispersal is likely to influence
strongly the information and persistence of zooplankton patches. Dispersal will
be analyzed with several measures including the net horizontal displacement of
individual zooplankton over a specified time. Experiments will be conducted in
large field enclosures (10,000) using the natural assemblage of plankton. Recent
studies indicate that physical factors alone can not explain all of the of the
observed small scale patchiness. However, very little is known of the influence
of biotic factors (ie. interactions with other animals or food) on patchiness.
The effect of three specific factors (food concentration, food quality and the
density of cannibalistics) on zooplankton dispersal will be tested in the
enclosures. All three factors have been shown t affect feeding, growth,
reproduction, behavior, and fitness of some zooplankton, and thus are likely to
influence the tendency if individuals to remain in or to leave a patch.
