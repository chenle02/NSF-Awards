The Ecosystem for Biophotonics Innovation (EBI) will accelerate the
commercialization of some key biomedical technologies that have been created in
the Center for Biophotonics (CBST), a NSF Science and Technology Center. To
create this ecosystem, CBST, the Sacramento Area Regional Technology Alliance
(SARTA, a regional economic development organization), 3rd party investor
companies, a foundation and a national lab will formalize their R&D, education
and commercialization alliance. EBI's primary intellectual merit stems from the
development of a unique alliance of committed partners that will work
collaboratively to translate research-based technologies to the marketplace.
CBST develops technologies in response to end-user needs, but the EBI will
actually lead to commercial products. In addition, the integration of an
entrepreneurial education and mentorship program in the EBI will increase the
innovation skills of faculty, postdoctoral entrepreneurial fellows, graduate and
undergraduate students, indeed all members of the ecosystem.

The activities of the EBI will advance the commercialization of CBST
technologies while providing hands-on training and learning. The resulting
products will correspondingly enhance scientific discovery, promote better
understanding of biophysical phenomena, and will ultimately improve patient
care. EBI will enhance the participation of under-represented groups (URG) in
the process of innovation and commercialization since CBST especially focuses on
engaging URG Community College and undergraduate interns in its programs. EBI
will foster the creation of new instrumentation, collaborative networks and
partnerships. The results of the EBI program will be published in academic
research journals, on a dedicated website, and presented in other public forums.
Finally, the EBI will benefit society by producing new scientific
instrumentation, medical devices, as well as the infrastructure to promote
innovation and educate burgeoning entrepreneurs.
