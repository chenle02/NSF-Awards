9406093 Rose This long term research program has focused on active volcanoes,
their emissions to earth's atmosphere and the mitigation of their hazards. In
the next three years the principal focus of work will be on the systematic
refinement of a new radiative transfer model for remote satellite sensing of the
ash burdens in drifting volcanic clouds, the verification of the technique by
means of actual sampling of volcanic cloud particles and by experiments in the
laboratory and the application of the technique to a data archive of volcanic
clouds spanning the last 13 years. The work will help us understand how much
fine volcanic ash is produced in eruptions and how this ash is removed from the
atmosphere.
