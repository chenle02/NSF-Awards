This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is designed
to provide insights into the structure and dynamics of transient molecular
species involved in chemical reactions, spectroscopy of clusters and
photodissociation dynamics of free radicals. This research is supported by a
Presidential Young Investigator Award (PYI). The experiments will be carried out
using molecular negative ion beams. A mass selected fast (3-5 KeV) ion beam is
photodetached with a laser tuned just above the electron binding energy of the
ions. This yields a fast beam of neutral radicals in their ground vibrational
state. A second laser photodissociates the radicals, and a two particle position
sensitive detector yields the masses as well as the center-of-mass angular and
velocity distributions of the photofragments. These data are then interpreted to
yield information on the structure and dynamics of the species studied.
