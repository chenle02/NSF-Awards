AST-0201657 Sheinis, Andrew

Dr. Sheinis is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship
to carry out a program of research and education at the Center for Adaptive
Optics at the University of California Santa Cruz. His primary focus will be the
development of an astronomical spectrograph which uses Micro-Electro-Mechanical
System (MEMS) technology. This new technology should allow a spectrograph to
have multi-slit capability without the construction of a fixed multi-slit mask
for each observation. He will use the new instrument to obtain optical and near-
IR spectra of QSO's in order to study the environment of the host galaxies. As
part of his fellowship, he will participate in the center's Science, Engineering
and Technology Training program which targets undergraduates underrepresented in
those areas. Twice every year, he will give a one-week seminar on general optics
to these students in order to prepare them for participation in group research
projects. ***
