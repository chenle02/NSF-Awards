In collaboration with scientists of Costa Rica's National Biodiversity
Institute, Drs. Barry Hammel and Michael Grayum of the Missouri Botanical Garden
are beginning the second phase of an extensive inventory of the ca. 12,000
species of ferns, conifers, and flowering plants of that tropical country. This
second phase is transitional, with continued field collecting in targeted
regions throughout the country and with increasing development of computerized
databases and of selected publications. One eventual goal is a comprehensive
identification guide, or manual, in both Spanish and English versions, to the
plant resources of Costa Rica. Training of host-country students to serve as
field collectors and "parataxonomists" is a novel aspect of the enterprise;
these individuals usually work in Costa Rica's extensive system of national
parks and refuges, where they gain first-hand knowledge of the flora and fauna.
Reciprocal visits between U.S. and Costa Rican botanists, as well as visits by
contributing European scientists, make this an international effort; the
parallel exchange of herbarium specimens is helping to develop Costa Rica's
natural history collections. The current taxonomic inventory and the resulting
computer databases will be of lasting utility to conservation and resource
management interests, in a country with proven ability to put such information
to effective use. The Manual Project, in becoming fully integrated with and
contributing significantly to the development of Costa Rica's new Instituto
Nacional de Biodiversidad, answers the need for urgency in collecting,
maintaining and distributing biodiversity information.
