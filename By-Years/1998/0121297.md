The MavHome project views a smart home as an intelligent agent, which is able to
perceive its environment through the use of sensors and act upon the environment
through the use of actuators. The home has overall goals, such as minimizing the
cost of maintaining the home and maximizing the comfort and productivity of its
inhabitants. In order to meet these goals, the house must be able to reason
about and adapt to information using knowledge about databases, machine
learning, multiagent systems, robotics, smart sensors, wireless mobile
computing, and multimedia computing. Smart homes can potentially minimize home
operating costs in a time when utilities fees are becoming prohibitive, and can
assist individuals with disabilities to lead independent lives. Through the
university visitor program, minority recruitment, course development, and
dissemination of results, the project will impact research and education in the
area of "smart space technologies."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
