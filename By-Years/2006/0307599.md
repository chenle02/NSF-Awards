ABSTRACT: Infinite Dimensional Lie Algebras, Quantum Groups, and their
Applications

The main theme of this proposal is representation theory and its applications.
The proposal is focused on the representation theory of quantum groups at roots
of 1, on invariants of 3-manifolds with flat connections and related topological
quantum field theories, on classical and quantum integrable systems, and on some
solvable models of statistical mechanics.

The last several decades have been characterized by an intense and productive
interaction between mathematics and physics. A large part of this process was
initiated in the study of classical and quantum integrable systems. This
interaction has led to revolutionary progress in both quantum field theory and
string theory on the physical side, and geometry, algebra and topology on the
mathematical side. The research of this proposal is focused mostly on the study
of algebraic structures resulting from this interaction and on applications of
these structures.
