Through a process called laser cooling, dilute gasses of atoms can be slowed and
confined, levitating inside ultra-pure steel vacuum chambers. At this point the
trapped atoms can be used for next generation applications, like voltage sensing
or the simulation of microscopic crystal structure. To pursue such applications,
the principal investigators plan to use two different exotic atoms, rubidium and
ytterbium, which each require several lasers with vastly different colors to
successfully laser cool. These lasersâ€™ colors will span from the ultraviolet to
infrared regions of the spectrum of light, and levitation can only happen if the
energy of the packets of laser light (laser photons) is precisely measured and
controlled to within about 0.0001%. This Major Research Instrumentation project
funds a pair of high precision devices called wavemeters to measure the photon
energies with sufficient accuracy. The two meters, which are designed to
function in different parts of the light spectrum, will be networked together
with fiber optic cables, enabling both principal investigators to have access to
the full measurement range in their physically separate labs. These advanced
measurement capabilities will not only generate new scientific results, but also
help generate meaningful research projects for undergraduate students at
Middlebury College.

The principal investigators (Goodsell and Hess) are planning experiments using,
respectively, launched cold rubidium atoms in highly excited Rydberg states and
chains of multiple isotopes of trapped cold ytterbium ions. These particles
require excitation light between 370 and 1250 nm for transitions that are hard
to determine by secondary observation such as absorption spectroscopy. This
Major Research Instrumentation project funds a network of Fizeau and Michelson
wavelength meters (wavemeters) to make real-time measurements of laser
wavelength. To span the entire spectrum required by both research groups, the
network will consist of two wavemeters with different wavelength sensitivity
ranges and sufficient measurement speed to stabilize lasers with feedback from
the wavemeters. The wavemeters will be connected to each PI's research space
using fiber optic links and multiplexed fiber switches, therefore allowing the
full range of lasers required by each research group to be monitored
simultaneously. With this instrumentation, the principal investigators advance
two areas of research: observations of Rydberg atoms subject to the spatially-
dependent force of a charged wire, which highlight the Stark effect in a quantum
regime, and experiments co-trapping ions of different isotopic species in order
to study their efficacy as sympathetic coolants for qubit ions.
