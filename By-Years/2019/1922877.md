The ability to measure fluid flow properties non-intrusively is often crucial
for providing understanding of fluid dynamics, and subsequently to enable
improving industrial and medical processes and equipment for the benefit of
society. Particle image velocimetry uses lasers to infer fluid velocities by
tracking particles in many applications involving single phase flows. However,
many multiphase flows (such as bubbly flows in the wake of a ship) are important
to understand, but these flows are opaque at visible wave lengths due to the
refractive interfaces between the phases. Fortuitously, at X-ray wave lengths
the change in refractive index between most fluids of interest is very small;
therefore, X-ray based particle image (or tracking) velocimetry can measure
fluid flow properties in multiphase flows. This project will develop a practical
in-lab X-ray particle image velocimetry technique. The project will combine the
use of numerical modelling and experiments to hopefully enable wider utilization
of in-lab X-ray particle image velocimetry for multiphase fluid dynamics
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use a combination of first
principle-based modelling and experiments, which together will yield a deeper
understanding of the physical and technical capabilities and limitations of in-
lab X-ray particle image velocimetry. The numerical modeling will utilize both
established Monte Carlo codes and simpler codes based on Beer-Lambert law. The
experiments will utilize photon counting X-ray detectors to determine the signal
to noise ratios and introduce small tracer particles to enable velocity
measurements without altering the flow. The project will develop algorithms and
rules for balancing source, tracer, and detector characteristics and settings.
The project will validate the in-lab X-ray particle image velocimetry technique
for the canonical pipe flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
