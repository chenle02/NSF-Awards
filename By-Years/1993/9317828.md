9317828 Beck Research will focus on the theoretical calculation of the
properties of lanthanide and actinide atoms and negative ions. The lanthanides
are beginning to be studied experimentally using accelerator mass spectrometry
and little is known about the electron affinities of the negative ions. Many
body and relativisitic effects will be included in order to obtain reliable
results. The relativistic configuration interaction method developed under the
previous grant is now sufficiently mature to undertake the challenge of this
complicated atomic species. ***
