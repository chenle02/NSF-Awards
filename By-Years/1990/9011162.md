The aim of this project is to integrate program verification based on Type
theory into classical program verification. This will be done by building a
wide-spectrum, partially constructive logic that includes computational and
noncomputational reasoning along with higher-order functions, destructive
operations, and assignment. The semantics for this logic does not dichotimize
constructive and nonconstructive reasoning but instead views them as being two
poles of a continuum, with the partially constructive verified programs
interesting to computer scientists in between. The logic will be implemented and
test programs will be written for it. This new logic will be an advance over the
logics currently available for program verification: it will be powerful enough
and flexible enough to support constructive reasoning over functional and
imperative programs, using one common syntax and semantics. Programs written
with the logic will be efficient and concise. In addition, the existence of such
a logic can be used to claim that constructive and classical verification, often
thought to be inherently incompatible, are actually related parts of a larger
whole.
