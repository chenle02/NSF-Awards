The absorption of solar ultraviolet radiation in the upper atmosphere results
in the ejection of electrons from the atoms and molecules, as does the impact of
high energy particles during auroral displays. The ejected electrons collide
with other atmospheric molecules and atoms and cause them to emit light, which
can then be used as a means of remotely sensing the processes occurring, and
also the changes in composition and the temperature of the atmospheric region
bombarded. The research to be performed at JPL is of laboratory measurements of
the light emission from a beam of atoms or molecules colliding with a beam of
electrons. The results will be interpreted at the University of Arizona, and put
in a form suitable for the analysis of upper atmospheric optical data to yield
parameters of the source region.
