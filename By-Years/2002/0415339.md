The earth's warming trend has important implications for the geographic
distributions of species, since climate affects biological traits and limits
geographic ranges. The fossil record documents both successes and failures of
species to persist, evolve and spread, in response to climatic change. Changing
climate can trigger several different types of species responses. Species may
(1) remain where they are and adapt (i.e. adjust genetically) to the altered
local environment, (2) go extinct, (3) disperse with their optimal habitat as it
shifts across latitude or altitude, or (4) form new species following range
fragmentation. This project's theoretical research uses mathematical models to
predict the joint evolutionary and ecological species responses to spatially and
temporally varying environments. This study addresses how characteristics of the
environment and of the species may result in extinction, local adaptation, range
shift, and range fragmentation, and how ecological and genetic factors affect
the magnitude of an evolutionary response. This study will determine a critical
minimal rate of adaptive evolution and a critical minimal rate of spatial
expansion that prevent extinction during rapid environmental
changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results will provide more reliable qualitative
predictions than those based only on an ecological approach, and will allow a
better understanding of experimental and field studies on biological aspects of
global warming.
