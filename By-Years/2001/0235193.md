This project proposes to extend the EPICS Engineering Projects in Community
Service model by vertically integrating select University of Illinois
undergraduate EPICS teams with K-12 students in the Champaign-Urbana. Depending
on the nature of the project, the K-12 students will work as consultants for,
clients of, or teammates with undergraduate students on real science and
engineering projects that serve the community. Problem-based learning and
cooperative learning will be the key pedagogical approaches to enhancing student
learning. By presenting K-12 students with an open-ended problem and challenging
them to work together to find and implement a solution, the students will
development cognitively as they learn new information, analyze data and
alternatives, synthesize and create solutions, and evaluate alternative.
Further, engaging K-12 students in large, real-world "hands-on/minds-on"
problems in teams with undergraduate engineering students will increase the
motivation, confidence, excitement and interest of younger students in SMET.
