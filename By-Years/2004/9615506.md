Marianne Page University of California - Davis SBR-9615506 Recent discussions of
sources of inequality have suggested that individuals' human capital and other
socioeconomic outcomes may be strongly influenced by the neighborhoods in which
the individuals grew up. Particular concern has focused on the role of
"underclass" neighborhoods in perpetuating poverty and welfare dependency. The
purpose of this research is to identify an upper bound on the socioeconomic
impact of community origins by estimating correlations between neighboring
children in their later socioeconomic status as adults. The estimates will be
based on data from the Panel Study on Income Dynamics, which has sampled
neighboring children and followed them into adulthood. This approach can
identify only an upper bound on the influence of neighborhoods because the
observed neighbor correlations will reflect the influence of similar family
backgrounds as well as the influence of shared community background.
Nevertheless, neighbor correlations will provide crucial information on the
potential scope of neighborhood effects. Large neighbor correlations would leave
open the possibility that neighborhoods are very influential. Small neighborhood
correlations would indicate that community origins must play only a minor role.
