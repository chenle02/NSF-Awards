This work incorporates seven accelerator-based atomic physics experiments and
several parallel theoretical research projects concerning collisions of high-
velocity, highly ionized projectiles with target atoms, molecules, and solids,
and of X rays with atoms and molecules. The experimental work is to be carried
out by a group of university users at accelerator facilities at ORNL; Stanford
(SSRL); BNL (NSLS); Cornell (CHESS); Frankfurt-Darmstadt (GSI); and Caen
(GANIL). Specific topics of investigation include: (1) the study of shake-up and
shake-off electron correlation effects on recoil ion charge satellites; (2) the
study of electron sharing and energy distributions in molecular fragmentation;
(3) the study of low energy charge transfer to multiply charged ions; (4)
studies of electron capture and loss to projectile-centered continuum states;
(5) electron production by 15 to 35 MeV/u heavy ions traversing solids; (6)
interference of amplitudes for autoionization of doubly excited He targets; (7)
low energy, highly charged recoil ions produced by impact of fast, high charge
state projectiles on gas targets; and (8) Auger electrons in coincidence with
electron impact ionization of ions.
