9353555 Giamati This planning grant invites 35 teachers and administrators to
the Northern Arizona University campus to attend two weekend-long meetings and
to participate in follow-up networking that will lead to the submission of a
proposal to the National Science Foundation Teacher Enhancement Program. That
future proposal, which would serve Native American teachers and teachers who are
employed by districts with a large Native American population, is anticipated as
a project consisting of a series of summer courses and academic- year follow-up
activities for teachers of elementary and middle school mathematics. The
educators who make up the planning committee either represent elementary and
middle schools and educational consortia from the targeted population or are
community college or university personnel who have special expertise in Native
American education. The planning grant provides funds to cover expenses
associated with organizing, attending, and conducting the two planning meetings
and establishing a computer network among the members of the planning committee.
