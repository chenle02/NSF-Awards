The goal of this research aims to produce a general-purpose but domain-
customizable collaborative scientific workflow tool for accelerating scientific
discovery, particularly facilitating large-scale and cross-disciplinary research
projects that are collaborative in nature and require intensive user interaction
from multiple distributed domain scientists. As a natural extension to the
existing single user-oriented scientific workflow management tools by providing
direct system support for scientific collaboration, this project seeks to pave a
way toward a next-generation tool supporting scientific collaboration over the
Internet. The expected tool can be easily expanded to support data-centric
collaborative information management in any intelligence
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve this broader impact, this research
seeks to establish a set of foundational models and techniques supporting
collaborative scientific workflow composition and management; and based on them,
construct an Internet-based collaborative scientific workflow tool framed with
an open-source initiative. The initial focus of the Early Concept Grants
Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is on rapidly creating a prototype tool as
a proof of concept, equipped with basic dataflow-oriented scientific workflow
models and collaboration patterns integrated in an agile service-oriented
architecture. To avoid reinventing the wheel, the efforts will be concentrated
on transforming and extending Taverna, a known open-source scientific workflow
management tool, into a collaborative version. Evaluations and validations will
be conducted through partnerships with multiple collaborative scientific
communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information, see the project
