This action is for the support of equipment to be used on the following
research projects: (1) The analysis and development of laboratory apparatus for
measuring the dynamic properties of soil; (2) Calibration of laboratory and
field vibration measuring transducers; (3) Determination of soil/structure
interaction behavior for both models and prototype, due to dynamic excitation
such as earthquakes; (4) Spectral analysis of surface wave measurements in-situ;
(5) Measurement of wave propagation velocities in the laboratory and in the
field. The equipment includes a real time spectrum analyzer with switching, mass
storage, and graphics output capabilities; as well as transducers and cables for
making accurate vibration measurements in the laboratory, on soil pavement
surfaces, or in boreholes. It has the capability of making very accurate
measurements of soil and structural vibrations and performing mathematical
operations on them. The equipment is portable and can be used in the field as
well as in the laboratory.
