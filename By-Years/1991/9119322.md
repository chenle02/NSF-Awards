This Research Opportunity Award funds a primarily hispanic university,
California State University, Los Angeles, for a project augmenting the research
program of Eastern Michigan University's Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Coatings Research. The two year project entitled "Surface
Roughness Effects on Adhesion of Polymer Coatings to Metal Substrates" will
employ a blister test to measure the bonding energy between coatings and
metallic substrate. The researchers will report their results to the Center's
Industry Advisory Board at Eastern Michigan University. This project is
coordinated with and cost-shared by the Division of Engineering Infrastructure
Development. The Program Manager recommends that California State University,
Los Angeles be awarded $100,000 for a two-year Research Opportunity Award.
