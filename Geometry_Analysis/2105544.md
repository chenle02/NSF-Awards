The goal of this project is to understand geometric space in terms of algebraic
data and to develop algebraic theories that unlock effective analyses of
quantitative and qualitative properties of geometric objects. The main tools
come from algebraic topology, a general framework that allows one to reformulate
questions about topology and geometry in terms of equivalent questions about
algebraic structures such as vector spaces. Topological spaces will be encoded
in terms of algebraic structures with particular operations. The PI will also
use a similar algebraic framework to study string topology, a theory concerned
with interactions of strings and loops in a geometric space. The study of
topological and geometric spaces by means of algebraic structures is of
fundamental importance in mathematics as well as in mathematical physics. The
project aims to explain mathematically the sense in which the fields of
topology, geometry, and algebra are equivalent, and the sense in which they are
different. The computational tools and invariants that arise from studying the
interplay between these fields are useful in the mathematical formulation of
quantum field theory, string theory, and mirror symmetry in physics. The award
provides funds for graduate students to be involved in parts of this research.
The PI will build an inclusive and diverse research group and will promote
initiatives directed towards groups that are currently underrepresented in
mathematics research.

In the first part of the project, the PI will characterize homotopy types
through the algebraic concept of an E-infinity coalgebra viewed from the lens of
Koszul duality theory. This viewpoint is motivated by a new observation of the
PI and M. Zeinalian: the E-infinity coalgebra structure of the singular chains
on a space determines the fundamental group in complete generality and this data
is preserved under maps which become quasi-isomorphisms after applying the cobar
functor. Once homotopy types are understood through this framework, the
resulting algebraic structure will be enhanced with extra operations describing
Poincar√© duality at the chain level in order to characterize topological
manifold structures in a homotopy type. The second part of the project is
concerned with both foundational and computational questions regarding the
string topology of manifolds. Some of the algebraic structures that arise in
string topology, in particular the operations related to the Goresky-Hingston
coproduct, are able to detect fine geometric information that go beyond the
homotopy type in the non-simply connected context. String topology operations
will be analyzed using the framework of Hochschild homology and Tate cohomology,
as developed in previous work of the PI and Z. Wang. The PI aims to understand
the full algebraic structure of string topology, its dependence on the
background geometric space, and the new invariants for manifolds that arise.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
