Logical frameworks are languages for specifying logics and reasoning with them
formally, with machine support. Examples are logics to prove the safety of
programs or authenticate access rights to protected data. The project
investigates theoretical foundations and efficient implementation techniques for
logical frameworks. Specifically, the project addresses performance bottlenecks
in current, large-scale applications of the Twelf logical framework aimed at
improving safety and security of mobile code within the national cyber
infrastructure. The techniques include methods for proof compression based on
intrinsic redundancy, and methods to increase the degree of automation in proof
search and verification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Logic is a key discipline in
computer science because it allows us to make definitive judgments such as "yes,
this program is safe to run" or "yes, this agent is allowed to access these
data". The critical notion is that of a formal proof, which can convince a code
recipient of its safety or an operating system of access rights. Logical
frameworks represent such proofs as data structures. This project investigates
methods to manipulate these data structures efficiently so they can be used in
realistic, large-scale applications. The system under construction is also used
to teach undergraduates the concepts of formal logic as they are applied in
computer science and mathematics.
