This award supports mathematical research into problems related to linear and
nonlinear partial differential equations arising in Riemannian geometry. The
work follows two main themes. The first is concerned with the spectrum of the
Laplace operator on compact manifolds and boundary value problems for the scalar
curvature equation. The main thrust of the research is the formulation and
resolution of the Yamabe problem for manifolds with boundary. The problem has
been solved for manifolds without boundary; the presence of a boundary requires
a much more imaginative approach. At this time, the formulation of the correct
questions is only being developed. Good results in 3, 4 and 5 dimensions have
been obtained in the case of Riemannian manifolds. Work with a more geometric
flavor will be done on uniqueness questions for conformal deformation of
metrics. This will extend a recent generalization of the theorem that any
Riemannian manifold which supports a function whose Hessian is a multiple of the
metric and whose normal derivative vanishes on the boundary, must in fact be the
upper hemisphere of the standard sphere. Partial differential equations form the
backbone of modern differential geometry. Phenomena which involve continuous
change such as that seen in motion, curvature and higher dimensional analogues
are known to obey certain general laws, expressible in terms of the interactions
and relationships between partial derivatives. The key role of mathematics is
not to state the relationships, but rather, to extract qualitative and
quantitative meaning from them and validate methods for expressing solutions.
