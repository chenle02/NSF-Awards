0118363&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matano/OSU&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the
is project is to use numerical modeling to examine the routes by which the upper
return flow in the South Atlantic carries heat and salt across the basin and the
role that mesoscale eddies play in this transport. First, diagnostic studies of
existing global and Atlantic simulations will be made. This will be followed by
process studies designed to test hypotheses about the paths of Pacific and
Indian Ocean upper thermocline waters through the South Atlantic to the tropics.
The project's broad goals are: (1) to understand how changes in magnitude of
southern sources of water, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Agulhas
Current, affect the magnitude and relative composition of South Atlantic upper
ocean export to the tropics, (2) to understand the mechanisms that regulate the
mean circulation and variability of the subtropical gyre and their linkage to
interocean exchanges, and (3) to determine the sensitivity of the South Atlantic
circulation to changes in wind forcing in the southern hemisphere. &lt;br/&gt;
