This project has three goals: (1) To create an electronic lexical database of
Standard Istanbul Turkish, called Turkish Electronic Living Lexicon (TELL). TELL
will be unique among existing corpora in reflecting the actual knowledge and
pronunciations of native speakers. It will be of value for a variety of research
purposes, including phonological, morphological, and lexicostatistical research.
(2) Using TELL, to pursue specific phonological questions about Turkish during
the course of the project, which will (a) help to ensure that the database
contains data representative of relevant phonological phenomena in Turkish and
(b) result in journal articles. (3) Using TELL, to produce a book, The Lexical
Phonology of Spoken Turkish, which will be a comprehensive survey of the
phonology of Turkish words. The book will provide a complete description and
theoretical analysis of Turkish lexical (word-internal) phonology which, by
being based on new data from TELL, will be able to go far beyond past work.
