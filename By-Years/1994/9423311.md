9408047 Paegle "Predictability Characteristics of Global and Limited Area
Models" Under this award, Dr. Paegle will continue his investigations of
atmospheric predictability, and in particular, the effects of uncertainties in
the initial conditions, both local and remote, on numerical predictions. Studies
will be carried out for global and limited-area models. Specifically, he will:
1) conduct experiments with a variable resolution global model, using
resolutions spanning three orders of magnitude, to ascertain theoretical and
ppactical limits of predictability and how the limits depend on local, remote,
and global uncertainties. The results should have practical implications for the
design of numerical models and observing systems. 2) perform experiments with a
high resolution local model designed to assess the "value- added" by resolution
enhancement relative to the uncertainty associated with imperfect boundary
conditions provided from operational forecasts used to initialize the model. The
goal is to quantify the relative forecast improvement which can be realized
within the inner (local) model domain from improvements in the forecast skill of
the outer (regional or global) model that supplies the boundary conditions. The
results of this research have obvious potential for improving numerical weather
prediction on both short and longer time scales. The Mesoscale Dynamic
Meteorology and Large-scale Dynamic Meteorology Programs will share in the
support of this award. ***
