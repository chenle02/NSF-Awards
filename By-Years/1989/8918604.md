This project is to acquire and establish a satellite facility at the University
of Hawaii to receive and process oceanographic data from various satellites. The
facility will provide information on sea surface temperature and other variables
for a large region of the central Pacific. The data will be used by a variety of
ocean scientists. The project has the joint support of the Office of Naval
Research and NASA.
