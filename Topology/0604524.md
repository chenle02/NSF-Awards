Most of this proposal lies under the umbrella of a vast program proposed by
Gromov: classify finitely generated groups by their quasi-isometric geometry.
One way to study the geometry of a group is via a space called the asymptotic
cone; in several important cases, interesting algebraic structure of groups has
been found encoded by the topology of their asymptotic cones. Through a study of
asymptotic cones, the PI will work towards understanding the geometry of several
particular classes of groups, including mapping class groups, relatively
hyperbolic groups, and three-manifold groups. In particular, the goal of the
project is to develop new geometric invariants with an eye towards proving one
of the main geometric conjectures concerning mapping class groups, namely quasi-
isometric rigidity. This conjecture asserts that no other groups geometrically
look like mapping class groups.

Groups are an algebraic way of encoding the symmetries of a space. It turns out
that an important class of groups (the finitely generated ones) are themselves
associated with a certain geometric object. This object is built by taking each
symmetry to be a point and declaring the distance between a pair of points to be
the number of simple symmetries one has to apply to get from one to the other.
In the study of finitely generated groups, insight into their geometry can often
be gained by looking at the group from ``infinitely far away'' -- this notion
can be made mathematically precise and yields what is called an asymptotic cone
of the group. The PI proposes certain ways to study groups from this asymptotic
viewpoint.
