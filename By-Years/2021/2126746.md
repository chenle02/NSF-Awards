The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will be to make possible small-scale, high-quality automated
construction. This proposal investigates a method to automate the concrete
forming process from design to construction, including site assessment, design,
and material construction. This platform can provide fast on-site construction,
reduce renovation timelines, and provide habitat
affordability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project advances translation of an
automated concrete forming process, including concrete material formulations,
robotic path planning/ machine vision for construction sites, and end-effector
electromechanical designs. Other processes to be engineered include 3D mapping
of existing site conditions, associated design processes, robotic path planning
and material scheduling, and project execution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
