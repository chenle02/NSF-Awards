This research involves developing a translator from procedural programming
languages (starting with Fortran) into the equational specification language-
MODEL. This is called "Software Reverse Engineering" (SRE). It is coupled with
the existing MODEL system that translates equational specifications in MODEL
into highly efficient programs in PL/1, C or Ada (generation of programs in
Fortran is in development). Together these two systems provide an automated
conversion path from old to new operational environments. The significance of
this project is also in use of the MODEL equational language specifications to
achieve much easier understanding of programs. This aspect is very important in
attaining maintenance, improvements, higher reliability and better efficiency of
programs. Another important aspect is use of SRE for conversion to parallel
computers. The proposed Phase I work consists of design of algorithms and
testing of the concept through examples.
