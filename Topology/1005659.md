Long plans to work on a wide spectrum of projects which explore a range of
geometrical, topological and number-theoretical problems. Most of the issues to
be explored are inspired by low dimensional topology, although several of the
problems fit into a much wider context. These include the behavior of the
spectral theory and homology of covering spaces, the structure of
commensurators, the arithmetic of trace fields, the deformations and limits of
real projective structures, and the role of similarity interval exchange maps in
geometrically infinite surface groups. The unifying theme is the tying together
of the many disparate aspects of hyperbolic manifolds in both low and higher
dimensions. For while Perelman's work has drawn together the topological and
geometric, our understanding of this geometry still has a long way to go.
Progress in the directions proposed in this project would add significantly to
this understanding.



A space is called a 3-manifold if it is made of small chunks all of which are
``like'' the ordinary 3-dimensional space that we live in. Mathematicians
understand how to interpret "like" very precisely and there are two very
different notions which are of great importance in this setting: "topologically-
like" and "geometrically-like". The recent work of Perelmann has verified a
long-standing conjecture which emerged in the seventies with the work of
Thurston, namely that the topological and geometrical pictures are intimately
related. This is an important piece of global understanding. Amongst geometrical
manifolds, by far the most important are the class called hyperbolic manifolds.
This class is ubiquitous in many areas of mathematics, ranging from low-
dimensional topology, to dynamical systems, to number theory. Indeed, this class
is also crucially important in physics. However, even with Perlemann's work,
hyperbolic manifolds themselves are still fairly poorly understood, although
their importance have made them a magnet for research for well over thirty
years. This proposal directs itself towards aspects of the structural study of
hyperbolic manifolds and many issues related to them. For example, he intends to
continue work on a famous old conjecture about which sorts of two-dimensional
objects can live inside these 3-dimensional objects.
