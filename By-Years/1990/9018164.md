9018164 This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing
work of Professor Gajewski at Indiana University. The results of this research
will provide fundamental information about the exact mode by which organic
molecules undergo thermal reactions and rearrangements. One of the questions to
be answered is, are there short-lived intermediates in these processes or do
they occur in a one step process without intermediates? Knowledge of these
processes is important to a basic understanding of organic chemistry. Dr.
Gajewski's research will provide basic information about thermal reactions and
rearrangements in several areas. There is a concern that the preferred
suprafacial-inversion stereochemistry in methylvinyl cyclopropanes is determined
by substituent effects rather than by orbital symmetry. An attempt will be made
to resolve this question by the use of deuterium isotope effects. Another phase
of the research deals with oxyanionic vinyl cyclopropane and cyclobutane
rearrangements, where two orbital symmetry allowed concerted reactions and a
stepwise reaction are possible. Deuterium isotope effects will be used to sort
out these possible mechanisms as a function of solvent and counterion. In
addition, substituent effects on Cope rearrangements will be studied and the
question of double rotation in the thermolysis of spiropentane geometric
isomerization will be pursued.
