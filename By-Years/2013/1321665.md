The Washington Internship for Native Students, established under the auspices of
The American University's Washington Semester Program, was developed in response
to the White House Initiative to help American Indian, Alaskan Native and Native
Hawaiian (AI/NA/HN) students develop knowledge and leadership skills necessary
to enhance their potential to contribute to their tribal communities, and the
nation. Having access to a significant pool of AI/NA/HN students, the program
focuses on experiential learning by coupling internships with coursework and
ensuring that traditional values and practices of sovereign nations and tribes
are incorporated in the program. WINS will continue to collaborate with the
National Science Foundation to provide internship placements for AI/NA/HN
students, a group sorely under-represented in the STEM workforce. It is
anticipated as a result of this effort, the NSF will serve as a conduit to
broaden participation of this under-represented group, and diversify the future
STEM enterprise, needed to keep the US competitive in a global environment.
