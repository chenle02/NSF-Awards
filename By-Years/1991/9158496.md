The PI will describe the interannual to intermillenial variability of the
surface ocean through novel geochemical techniques developed for reef corals.
Inferred changes in such processes as upwelling and wind genesis during events
ranging from El Nino to Earth's last glaciation will yield insights into the
role of ocean-atmosphere interactions in regulating global climate change
