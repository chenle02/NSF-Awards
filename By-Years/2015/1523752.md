This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015. The fellowship supports a research and
training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to
broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan
for this fellowship to Brook Moyers is "Using genotype and environment to
predict water use physiology in rice." The host institution for the fellowship
is the Colorado State University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. John McKay.

Rice is a water-intensive crop and the primary calorie source for many
developing countries. As global demand for water increases, so will the need for
rice varieties that require less water to grow. This project will model the
interaction of genotype and environment to predict water use in rice, providing
vital information to breeders and potentially contributing to the development of
new drought-tolerant rice varieties. The project is in collaboration with
researchers at the International Rice Research Institute and includes training
in applied agricultural research. A diverse group of undergraduate researchers
will participate in the project and will be trained as the next generation of
plant breeders. Together, the proposed activities will provide the basis for an
independent research program that uses fundamental research to address global
needs.

This project will tackle the "grand challenge" of predicting phenotype from
genotype in specific environments by building and validating a physiological
model that incorporates genotype effects. The two major objectives are (1) to
use high-throughput phenotyping data from a new, highly recombinant rice
population (Global MAGIC) to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying
water use physiology in two soil moisture environments, and (2) to use these QTL
as parameters in a model of water use physiology. The model will be validated by
predicting phenotypes that are produced by the novel genotypes grown in specific
environments. Evaluating the model will provide insight into the interactions
among alleles and environmental factors affecting water use physiology in
plants. All of the project data will be available to the public via the Dryad
Digital Data Repository, and the Global MAGIC population is freely available to
rice breeding programs through the International Rice Research Institute.
