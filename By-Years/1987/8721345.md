This research project examines the relationship between sorcery beliefs and
practices and other modes of processing interpersonal disputes in communities on
Siquijor Island, the Philippines. The student aims to delineate the cultural
values and cosmological beliefs which affect interpersonal conflict and conflict
resolution and to analyze the role which sorcery plays in the mediation of
conflicts. He will test the hypothesis that sorcery is chosen as a mode of
dispute processing when mediation is unsuccessful. This research will contribute
to our knowledge of sorcery and religion, dispute processing, social relations,
and interpersonal conflict in the Philippines. While sorcery is often
characterized as an illegitimate or pathological form of social control, this
research will show that it is part of a larger system of values that make the
world comprehensible to its inhabitants. This research will uniquely advance our
understanding of Philippine social relations. Social relationships are
determined by considerations of conflict as much as by positive goals such as
social reciprocity and companionship. Because this project will focus on
conflict- causing issues, the means used to process disputes, and the
consequences of conflicts, it will shed light on the relationship between
conflict and the structuring of social behavior.
