How much of our actual processing of information is available to consciousness
is an issue of continuing concern in psychology. In this work the investigators
propose a model based on previous (NSF-Funded) research that suggests that
considerable information processing is undertaken at the nonconscious level. The
PIs hypothesize (and have preliminary data to reinforce their view) that people
have considerable ability to detect relationships (say, between personality
traits) at a nonconscious level, and this ability is not related to their
ability to detect such relationships at a conscious level. This suggests that
individual differences in personality are related to the kinds of theories or
preconceptions an individual holds at a nonconscious level; these
preconceptions, in turn, will help to determine the acquisition and
interpretation of new information, which, in turn, change or reinforce the
nonconsciously held preconceptions.
