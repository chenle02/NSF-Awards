9513051 Gonzalez This U.S.-Argentina collaborative research effort between
Tulane University and INCAPE petrochemical institute in Santa Fe, Argentina will
investigate the synthesis, characterization, and application of supported metal
catalysts prepared by the sol-gel method. More specifically, experiments will
include sol-gel preparation of bimetallic catalysts, preparation and testing of
catalytic membranes, and synthesis of platinized sulfated zirconia. Primarily
focusing on the last of these, Richard Gonzalez of Tulane will work with Carlos
Apesteguia of INCAPE to prepare and test such materials as catalysts in the
oxidation of CO and other reactions. The international collaboration brings
together the expertise of Apesteguia in catalyst poisoning and deactivation with
that of Gonzalez in sol-gel preparation. Research will take place in both
laboratories with annual visits by the PI to Argentina and one visit from
Argentina to the U.S. ***
