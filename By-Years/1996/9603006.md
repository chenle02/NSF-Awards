The nuclear theory program in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at
Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge is focused on the properties of atomic
nuclei under extreme conditions: high spin, large deformation, stretched
isospin, etc. Of special interest is the structure of strongly deformed nuclei
of the rare earth and actinide regions. The collective modes of these nuclei
involve a large fraction of the total number of constituent nucleons and
therefore a special shell-model theory --- one that is not bound by the usual
constraints of an independent particle picture --- is required to understand
these collective features. The proposed research will focus on several matters:
potential energy surfaces and excitation energies; electromagnetic moments and
transition strengths; giant resonances; nuclear currents; double beta decay
strengths; and superdeformation. However, a deeper and more challenging
objective of the proposed research is to probe those special features of the
nucleon-nucleon interaction that give rise to mean fields and observed
collective phenomena. In particular, the proposed program will continue to focus
on the origin of pseudo-spin symmetry and the complementary of proton and
neutron dynamics. The training of graduate students (currently five) and the
building of international collaborations (from former Soviet Union countries and
Mexico, in particular) are an integral part of the research effort.
