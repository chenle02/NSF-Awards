This proposal describes a four-year program with the first three years funded
by NSF and the fourth funded by the University and other outside sources. The
primary objective is to improve instruction in secondary school science
laboratories by using the computer as a tool either to analyze conventionally
acquired data or to both acquire and then analyze data. This dual role for the
computer lends credibility to the acquisition of different skills in the
disciplines of biology, chemistry, earth science and physics. Two teachers from
each participating school will be selected to develop the strategies in each of
these two instructional modes. This will be further enhanced by a series of
school-site visits and sharing conferences.Each year, 30 well-prepared teachers
will be selected to attend a three-week summer workshop, followed by the visits
and conferences during the school year. Appropriate laboratory computer
applications will be developed and refined, using both original and existing
materials. The applications, including implementation and teaching strategies,
as well as the workshop materials, will be disseminated nationally through
presentations at professional meetings. An ongoing evaluation of materials,
instructional strategies and effectiveness in the classroom will enhance the
potential for success. About 28% of the cost of this project is being shared by
Ithaca College and the participating school districts. This will insure the
implementation of the program in the schools and the continuation into year
four. Additional private source funding is being sought for year four, but
sufficient commitment is included to provide for the project as written.
