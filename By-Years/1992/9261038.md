The feasibility of fabricating a YBCO based passive microwave device with GaAs
ICs on a single GaAs wafer by in-situ Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD),
conventional photolithographic patterning and metalization techniques will be
developed. The superconducting properties of the YBCO films to select the best
buffer film material and film deposition process will be evaluated in order to
obtain high quality superconductor films. A simple superconductor stripline
filter will be integrated with a GaAs low noise amplifier, and the device
performance evaluated. The ability to fabricate HTSC films on GaAs substrates
opens up a very rich field of opportunity for many superconducting film
technologies.
