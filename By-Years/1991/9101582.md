In Phase I, a new process for control of the emissions of submicron particles,
sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from combustion of coal has been
demonstrated on the laboratory scale. Sox and Nox are controlled with an
effectiveness comparable to wet limestone scrubbing and selective catalytic
reduction, the best presently available control technologies. A preliminary
estimate indicates that the cost of controlling submicron particles, SOx and Nox
via the new process will be less than the cost of controlling SOx and Nox via
the best of presently available technologies, and with a cost which is lower
than wet limestone scrubbing and selective catalytic reduction. In Phase II it
is proposed to demonstrate this new pollution control process on a pilot plant
scale for a coal burning combustion system, show that it can operate in a
satisfactory manner, and develop a more detailed analysis of process economics.
