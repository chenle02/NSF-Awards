The risk of coastal flooding has been growing due to the combined effects of sea
level rise, changing storm patterns, increased development, erosion, and in some
places, subsidence. Since many of these risks are uninsured, they could have
significant financial consequences for the nation and jeopardize the resilience
of coastal communities. This project examines whether innovations to insurance
marketplaces can produce better outcomes. Work on this project will include
synthesis reviews; exploratory and testing workshops; semi-structured
interviews; and deep case analysis of analog programs. This effort will draw on
best practices for qualitative research to solve "grand challenges" and "wicked
problems" and engage multiple sectors in co-creation of research and outcomes.
This work will contribute to our broad understanding of risk transfer
instruments and their role in community resilience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
