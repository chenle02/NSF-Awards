The goal of this project is to generate theories and techniques for a computer-
based system that will assist in creating mechanical designs that meet their
function, cost, and quality requirements while simultaneously meeting the
constraints imposed by downstream activities. The principal investigators will
create a design system that fuses the functional requirements of a mechanical
design with the constraints that are imposed on the design throughout its life-
cycle through the use of perspectives and features. This project is founded on
three underlying concepts: (1) integrating life-cycle concerns through the use
of views from multiple perspectives, where each perspective represents a
different life-cycle concern such as manufacture, distribution, maintenance,
etc.; (2) representing the design space at different levels of abstraction and
granularity through the use of features, where features are the attributes that
characterize a design from the viewpoint of any perspective; and (3) generating
and pruning the design space through the use of constraints. Design fusion is
the unifying concept that integrates these three. Fundamentally, design fusion
combines heuristic search and constraint directed reasoning with a robust
representation based on features so that life-cycle knowledge can be used to
generate, constrain, and test design decisions.
