MacAyeal/0944193&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This award supports a project to examine
and test a 3-step process model for explosive ice-shelf disintegration that
emerged in the wake of the recent 2008 and 2009 events of the Wilkins Ice Shelf.
The model is conditioned on Summer melt-driven increase in free-surface water
coupled with surface and basal crevasse density growth necessary to satisfy an
"enabling condition". Once met, the collapse proceeds through three steps: (Step
1), calving of a "leading phalanx" of tabular icebergs from the seaward ice
front of the ice shelf which creates in its wake a region, called a "mosh pit"
(located between the phalanx and the edge of the intact ice shelf), where ocean
surface-gravity waves are trapped by reflection (a fast mechanically enabled
process), (Step 2), and a rapid, runaway conversion of gravitational potential
energy into ocean-wave energy by iceberg capsize and fragmentation within the
"mosh pit" which leads to further wave-induced calving, capsize and
fragmentation (Step 3). The project will be conducted by a multidisciplinary
team and will focus on theoretical model development, numerical method
development and application and new observations. The project will participate
in both the Research Experience for Undergraduates program in the Physics
Department and the Summer Research Early Identification Program (SR-EIP) that
fosters participation in research by underrepresented minorities. The PIs,
postdoctoral scholar, graduate students and unfunded participants will develop a
graduate-level seminar/tutorial to introduce advanced computational methods to
glaciology. A postdoctoral scholar and graduate student will be trained in new
research techniques during the project.
