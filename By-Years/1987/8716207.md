This project will study the 30 million year record of mammalian faunas exposed
on the Bolivian altiplano. This renewal will capitalize on, and expand upwards
in time from the results of the previous research. The objectives for the
proposed research are to intensively work six known late Cenozoic (Miocene-
Pleistocene) sites and to prospect for new localities that will fill in the
sequence known to exist in this region. In so doing, we could use our results to
temporally trace 30 million years of well- calibrated evolution in a localized
area and also make spatial comparison with other important Cenozoic sequences in
South America, e.g., the classic sites in Argentina.
