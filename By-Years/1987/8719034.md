Under the bilateral Science and Technology agreement between NSF and the
Technical Research Council of Turkey, cooperative research projects in
earthquake engineering are being developed. American experts are required to
travel to Turkey to work with their counterpart researchers to detail the
cooperative work plans implementing the recommendations of the Joint Workshop on
Earthquake Engineering and Seismological Network, held in Istanbul in September
1985. The effort would lead to a realization of projects which could benefit not
only the U.S. and Turkey but also the world-wide community of earthquake
engineering.
