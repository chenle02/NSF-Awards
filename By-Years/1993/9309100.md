9309100 Camps This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. The
research uses techniques from robust statistics coupled with a Bayesian
approach, to develop mathematical models for robust 3D object recognition from
uncertain 2D image data, and to develop matching schemes that use these models
to robustly recognize and compute the pose of an object, while providing a
measure of confidence level for the hypothesis made. The results should enable
development of computer vision systems that can cope with imperfections in real
input data, due for example to fragmentation or sensor noise, without resorting
to use of ad hoc heuristics or trial-and-error procedures. Such systems should
offer more robust performance and significant reductions in development cost.
