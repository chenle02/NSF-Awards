The Telecommunications Laboratory is a multi-use state-of-the-art undergraduate
teaching facility designed to be both flexible and powerful. The controlled
workstation and computer communications facilities allow undergraduate students
an opportunity to apply and integrate classroom knowledge in communications,
signal processing, computer architecture, and algorithm and software development
via a set of practical experiments. Students are exposed to state-of-the-art
computer communications systems, on which they can implement everything from
modern digital communication and signal processing algorithms to parallel
algorithms and real-time databases. State-of-the-art computer software provides
the undergraduate students modern models of quality software, as well as allows
them to design and build sophisticated software/hardware systems. This
laboratory significantly impacts many of the University of Oklahoma
undergraduate students in both the School of Computer Science and the School of
Electrical Engineering. Many of these students will take positions with
organizations in the telecommunications/ computer industry, where these skills
and experiences will be greatly valued.
