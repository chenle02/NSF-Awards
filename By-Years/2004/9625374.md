9625374 Aho, Alfred Columbia University CISE Research Infrastructure: Scalable
Multimedia Information Processing This award is for the creation of a computer
infrastructure that will enable realistic and practical demonstrations for
future computing environments. The award will allow researchers at Columbia
University to upgrade their storage, networking and processing capabilities to
conduct interrelated research projects in four major areas: 1) High Performance
Integrated Multimedia Information Systems; 2) Visual Information Processing; 3)
Mobile Multimedia User Interfaces; 4) Scalable Systems for Mobile and Portable
Computing. The requested research equipment, which is critical to support these
research projects and will be treated as a shared resources, includes a data
farm, a multimedia/visualization supercomputer, multimedia workstations, high-
performance multimedia PC's and high-bandwidth networking hardware.
