In this project, the principal investigator will pursue two major themes: (1)
the Kadison-Singer problem and (2) the theory of tensor products of operator
systems. The Kadison-Singer problem is a major problem in this area of
mathematics that has been unsolved since 1954. The principal investigator has
made some recent progress on the problem and will explore three new avenues of
attack on it. Operator systems and completely positive maps play a central role
in several areas of mathematics, including quantum computing, quantum
information theory, and applications to C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras.
The principal investigator will continue to develop the general tensor theory of
operator systems and continue to apply this theory to problems in quantum
information and quantum computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area of mathematics
known as frame theory is concerned with systems that are used to sample signals
of various types and then to reconstruct the signals from the samples, such as
one does when sampling a soundwave, burning it to a CD, then playing back the
music from the CD. Engineers always build redundancy (or oversampling) into such
systems in order to ameliorate the effects of errors in the numerical values of
the samples. Progress on the Kadison-Singer problem should translate to a more
precise understanding of how redundancy behaves than exists at the present time.
Roughly, it asks whether or not systems with "finite redundancy" can always be
divided into finitely many systems with no redundancy. The second goal of the
project is concerned with developing the mathematics of quantum information
theory and quantum computing. Although no one can predict whether or not quantum
computers will ever be built, if they are, it is certainly vital to the national
interests to have developed sufficient human resources to be competitive in
putting them to use. Consequently, the principal investigator's students are
introduced to this area, and his work on the tensor theory of operator systems
has applications to questions about parallel structure in the quantum setting.
