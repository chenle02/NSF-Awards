Expertise is needed to develop immobilized enzyme preparations that are cost-
effective, enhance enzyme activity and allow multiple reaction cycles.
Surprisingly, large enzyme producers are not organized to provide this
capability. Their focus is to efficiently manufacture enzymes that meet demands
in high volume markets. Similarly, few chemical manufacturers have the internal
capability to develop efficient enzyme catalyzed manufacturing processes. The
commercial development of immobilized enzyme biocatalyst systems has the
potential to provide transformational new technologies to the chemical industry
that lower process energy input and avoid protection-deprotection steps. This
team has developed deep insight and practical experience in creating superior
performance immobilized enzymes.

The proposed technology will develop a deep understanding of how enzyme
properties, including activity and stability, are influenced by the surface
chemistry and physical parameters of immobilization resins. By identifying
optimal combinations of enzymes and immobilization resins, important
improvements in enzyme activity and stability will be achieved. The proposed new
company will also develop insights into resin-enzyme combinations that improve
immobilized enzyme biocatalysts for multiple cycle use. A key approach to gain
knowledge in the development of high performance immobilized enzyme systems will
be the implementation of a high throughput screening process.
