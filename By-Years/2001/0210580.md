This four-year Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team (NIRT) project at the
University of Florida with ProfessorCharles R. Martin as principal investigator,
conducts a broad-based and systematic investigation of the development of smart
nanotubes that are bioengineered and tailor-designed so as to accomplish
specific biomedical/biochemical functions. Silica asn polymeric nanotubes will
be extensively used in this research effort. Functionalized biodegradable and
biocompatible poly( (lactide) nanotubes will be prepared. The objective of the
research program include: (1) to show that the chemical microenvironment within
biochemically-functionalized nanotubes can be fine-tuned so as promote specific
desired biochemical processes; (2) to show that such nanotubes can be capped via
self-assembly chemistry with nanoparticle caps; (3) to demonstrate that these
nanoparticle caps can be attached via chemical bond that dissociate when a
specific intercellular chemical signal is detected; (4) to show that such
nanotubes can be tagged on their outer surfaces with antibodies that recognize
specific cell types; and (5) to prove that all of these concepts can be used in
concert to design new nanotube-based DNA transfection vechicles that deliver
genetic material to specific desired cell types.
