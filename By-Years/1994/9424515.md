9424515 Haimes The Seventh Workshop on "Risk-Based Decision Making in Water
Resources" will take place at the Engineering Foundation Facilities in Santa
Barbara, California, on October, 1995. Discussion sessions will be organized
around the following topics: basic evaluation/decision issues; hazard assessment
information; risk of extreme and catastrophic events; uncertainties in data,
models, forecasts and their influence on analysis; risk associated with
hazardous waste; range of alternatives; system performance reliability; risk
analysis framework (benefit-cost, multiobjective) and its influence on analysis;
models, display techniques to aid evaluation and reflect risk preferences. The
results from the workshop will recommend new and needed research topics in the
area of risk and decision-making in water resources management and the
publication of the proceedings will be the next volume of a series of seminal
books on this topic. ***
