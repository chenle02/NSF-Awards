This dissertation enhancement grant supports a US graduate student, Monibo A.
Sam, working under the guidance of Dr. Josef Gugler, Professor of Sociology at
the University of Connecticut, to do field research in Nigeria. The project will
study the structural and societal variables that impact on the survival rates of
micro- and small-scale enterprises (MSEs) in Nigeria. In developing countries
MSEs are often seen as the solution to poverty, unemployment, and unequal income
distribution. But MSEs in Subsaharan Africa countries are especially vulnerable
to failure when their founder dies. Through archival research and interviews,
Mr. Sam expects to define the variables that determine the success or failure of
the MSEs. Staff members of the Department of Sociology at the University of Port
Harcourt will collaborate with Mr. Sam on this project. The results of this
study should increase our knowledge about MSE survival rates in developing
countries, and prove valuable to policymakers in Nigeria and other developing
countries. The grant will also provide support to enable a promising student to
establish a strong, independent research career. Funding for this project is
being provided jointly by the Division of International Programs and by the
Division of Social, Behavioral, and Economic Research.
