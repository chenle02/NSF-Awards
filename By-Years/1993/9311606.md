9311606 Grant The overall goal of this research is to improve understanding of
ice formation in clouds. The specific objectives are: (1) to obtain ground and
aircraft-based measurements of ice nuclei; (2) to quantitatively describe these
measurements in a manner suitable for use by numerical cloud models; (3) to
adapt these descriptions to a detailed microphysical cloud model; and (4) to
compare simulations with aircraft data. ***
