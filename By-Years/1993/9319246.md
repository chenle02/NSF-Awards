9319246 Haydock This is a proposal based generically on the elctronic structure
of disordered materials; the disorder may be glassy, it may be in the form of a
disordered overlayer or it may simply be the presence of a surface. Tight
binding techniques will be used to examine these systems implemented primarily
via the recursion method. ( 1) In glassy systems like amorphous graphitic
carbon, the validity of an approximately conserved momentum-like quantum number,
resulting from the preservation of local real-space order, will be studied. (2)
The reason why metal atoms randomly distributed on a semiconductor surface
produce metallic contacts at low surface coverage (and the degree of
localization with coverage) will be studied. (3) The linear and non-linear
collective response of electrons to external fields (both above and below the
plasmon threshold) at metal surfaces will be studied to understand the
anisotropy of second harmonic generation. %%% This is a numerically intensive
proposal to study several aspects of disorder in solids. The disorder may be at
the level of glassy 3D structure; at the level of randomly placed atoms on an
otherwise ordered crystalline semiconductor substrate; or even at the level of
the presence of a surface in an crystal. In the first case, the project looks
for certain spectroscopic invariants due to the glassy structure. In the second
case, the work involves explaining why metal atoms deposited at low coverages on
a semiconductor surface give rise to conductivity. And in the third case, the
work tries to understand why systems which we expect to be very isotropic have a
very anisotropic response when their surfaces scatter externally impinging laser
light. ***
