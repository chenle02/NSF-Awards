This grant in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports research by Dr. James Burlitch to investigate the synthesis and
reactivity of silica-supported magnesium hydroperoxides. A primary goal of the
research is to characterize and develop the redox chemistry of the proposed
-SiOMgOOH group. Characterization will include the use of Raman, infrared, and
solid-state NMR spectroscopic techniques. Spectroscopic properties of the
magnesium hydroperoxides will be compared with those of similar groups that are
bound to surface-modified silica gels and to discrete model compounds. The
reactivity of these solid-state oxidants will also be explored. Reactions will
be carried out with model reductants and, once conditions are established for
simple oxidations, studies will be extended to base-sensitive groups such as
chlorinated hydrocarbons. This program will not only provide fundamental
information in the area of oxidation chemistry, but may also lead to the
development of a convenient, mild, and selective reagent for carrying out
chemical transformations. Additionally, magnesium hydroperoxides have the
potential to replace more dangerous and less environmentally friendly industrial
oxidants.
