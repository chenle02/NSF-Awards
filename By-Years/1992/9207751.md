In this study nucleotide sequences from nuclear ribosomal RNA genes will be
used to examine the higher-level relationships among snakes of the Infraorder
Scolecophidia. The research will involve state-of-the-art molecular techniques
and has the potential of providing valuable information relating to the
organization of ribosomal gene repeats in vertebrates. In addition, the new data
produced from this research will provide information that can be used to both
examine patterns of morphological variation in snakes and other groups of
vertebrates and evaluated analytical procedures designed for the statistical
analysis of nucleotide sequence variation.
