The principal investigator will study isomonodromy deformation problems and
their application to solve asymptotic connection formulae and to carry out a
related study on the factorization problem associated with Gelfand-Dikii flows.
These fundamental properties of integrable systems have been established for the
2 x 2 case, but have not been resolved for the general n x n case. A
geometrical-analytical understanding is critical for further development.
Integrable systems and inverse scattering problems play a fundamental role in
establishing links between fundamental physics and the way in which mathematical
models are used to describe it.
