This award supports cooperative research on energy transfer in molecular
interactions by David Micha at the University of Florida and Francisco Fernandez
and Eduardo Castro at University of La Plata (INIFTA) in Argentina. They will
calculate the interstate transition probabilities and energy transfer in the
shift of molecular states from translational to vibrational. The investigations
will cover extended molecular systems in polymers and solid surfaces. The
results will be useful in gasses and gas-solid interfaces, relevant to
combustion and catalytic processes. The work will be of mutual benefit: the
Argentines will increase their knowledge of quantum molecular dynamics and their
work will add to the ongoing effort at Florida in atomic-molecular collision
energy transfer and the interaction of light with polyatomic systems.
