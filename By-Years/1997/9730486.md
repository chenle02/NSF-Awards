The Historical Statistics Project is a major collaborative effort to produce an
updated, revised, expanded, and electronically-accessible new edition of the
Historical Statistics of the United States. The previous edition of Historical
Statistics, now long out of date (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975), is a
massive, two-volume compendium of 54 chapters on topics touching all of the
social, behavioral, humanistic, and natural sciences, including economics,
government, finance, sociology, demography, education, law, natural resources,
climate, religion, international migration, and trade. The new Millennial
Edition of Historical Statistics of the United States will be accessible to
researchers, educators, students, and the general public. The award provides
support for the central management of the project for the first year (1998) of
the three-year activity. This support is essential to insure the timely
completion of the project and the accuracy and reliability of the text.
