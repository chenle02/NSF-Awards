This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) program at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) of Columbia University.
The program would provide 10 students with a 10-week active learning experience
during the summer of 2013. The Global Databases and Geoscience theme focuses the
intern experience on unsolved scientific problems in the earth and ocean
sciences. The primary goal of the program is to teach students what research is
like, so they can explore the career option of a research scientist. A
subsidiary goal is to teach them about exciting forefront issues in earth and
ocean sciences, so that they become cognizant of future opportunities. Students
will work in LDEO's exciting research environment with over 120 PhD-level
geoscientists. Each student will be mentored by one of these scientists, who
will serve as research advisor. Funding is provided for student stipends,
housing in dorm rooms, travel to and from the site, research supplies and some
administative support.
