This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in experimental
computer science. The associate, James Cremer, will be working with Professor
Joseph Kearney on simulations of complex mechanical systems. The research will
consist of three parts. The first will have the associate continuing development
of the SimLab system that will simulate reality using computational mathematics
and physics. The second project involves collaboration with the Center for
Computer Aided Design in order to incorporate engineering concerns in the
development of capabilities in SimLab. The final project involves the
development of high level programs to control the complex mechanisms that arise
in rigid body dynamics specifications.
