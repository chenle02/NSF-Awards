The Association for Women in Science (AWIS) is a recognized national leader and
innovator in developing mentoring and leadership programs. AWIS proposes to
build on a previous project on academic climate funded by the Sloan Foundation.
This project developed surveys for assessing the institutional climate for
undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty.

In addition to surveys, site visit protocols were developed for campus visits.
Nine central issues for faculty emerged from this work: (1) Recruitment, hiring,
and retention; (2) Tenure and promotion; (3) Dual careers; (4) Family and work;
(5) communication; (6) Mentoring faculty; (7) Mentoring students; (8) Informal
networking and socializing; and (9) Career development.

Recommendations were developed to address these issues and sample model policies
were collected. AWIS has been involved in the dissemination of these materials
for the past three years. Recently, with the MIT Report, the demand has outpaced
the ability of AWIS to supply materials on an individual basis. AWIS proposes to
develop an on-line Institutional Climate Assessment Kit that institutions can
use to implement their own programs. In addition to the kit, AWIS will have a
section on Model Academic Policies that address many of the nine topics listed
above and a bi-weekly on-line column that tackles these issues. As a result of
the proposed project, AWIS anticipates three clear and realistic outcomes,
including (1) An institutional Climate Assessment Kit that will provide an
evaluated and tested model for replication by the institutions; (2) Model
Academic Policies that can be used by science societies and institutions; and
(3) explicit professional science society linkages that will facilitate
replication and sustainability of the project.

This project is supported by the National Institutes of Health through the NSF
ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the
participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the
increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and
engineering careers
