Most objects in nature are not smooth. Yet most existing literature in geometry
deal with smooth geometric objects such as a plane, a sphere, a saddle surface
and their generalizations. In this NSF funded project, the PI proposes to study
singular geometry by analyzing maps into and between them that are optimal in
the sense that they minimize energy. The analysis of these maps will help us
understand symmetry properties that exists in certain singular spaces. The
project will advance our scientific knowledge in the understanding of non-
singular geometry; in particular, the PI's research will lead to a greater
understanding of the natural world. The project also has an education component
and supports diversity by teaching and advising graduate students, post-doc and
early career mathematicians especially those that are underrepresented in the
STEM fields. A natural notion of energy for a map between geometric spaces is
defined by measuring the total stretch of the map at each point of the domain
and then integrating. Harmonic maps are critical points of the energy
functional. They can be seen as both a generalization of harmonic functions in
complex analysis and a higher dimensional analogue of parametrized geodesics in
Riemannian geometry. Next to totally geodesic maps, harmonic maps are perhaps
the most natural way to map a given geometric space into another. The celebrated
work of Eells and Sampson launched an explosion of research in harmonic maps
between Riemannian manifolds. Many important applications were found,
particularly in minimal surface theory, Teichmuller theory and rigidity
questions. A more recent development is the harmonic map theory for non-smooth
spaces. The seminal works of Gromov-Schoen and Korevaar-Schoen study energy
minimizing maps in the case when the target is an non-positively curved (NPC)
space. These energy minimizing maps are referred to as harmonic maps. The PI
will extend this harmonic map theory for singular geometry and to apply it to
solve problems in other fields.
