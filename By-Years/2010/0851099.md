Doctoral student, Laura K. Neck, with the guidance of Dr. Kirk Dombrowski, will
undertake social science research on local responses to the federal border wall
currently being constructed in Brownsville, Texas. The researcher will examine
the relationship between national economic and security concerns, increased
border controls, and the understandings and responses of border area residents.
The researcher will employ multiple social science methods including respondent
driven sampling, structured interviews, informal semi-structured interviews,
participant observation, and content analysis of letters addressed to local
newspapers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over time, Brownsville, which is one of the
busiest Land Ports of Entry into the United States, has developed economically,
socially, and culturally around relatively open access to Mexico. The Border
Wall may transform that situation. This research will compare ethnographic data
on local responses to the anticipation of the border wall and its effects on
local spaces with national perceptions about securing borders. The research will
help to better understand the dynamic relations between local and larger social
systems as they relate to public policy and the control of space. It also will
contribute to the education of a social scientist.
