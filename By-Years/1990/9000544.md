Professor Siedentop will investigate the mathematical physics of Coulomb
systems. The proposed work concerns (i) the asymptotic behavior of the ground
state energy and its leading corrections for large molecules; (ii) the ground
state density near the Coulomb singularities of the nuclei; and (iii) bounds on
the excess charge and ionization energy for various models of atomic and
molecular systems. The proposed work involves developing approximate methods of
calculating various quantities associated with the atomic physics of large atoms
and molecules. The systems in question are described by the Schrodinger
equation, a partial differential equation which in the cases at hand involves
many variables. It is thus too difficult to solve explicitly, and approximation
techniques must be developed to understand these systems. Professor Siedentop's
research will contribute to this important field in an area of interest to both
mathematicians and physicists.
