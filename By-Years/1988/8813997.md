In a one year planning grant, a group of mathematicians led by Andrew Gleason of
Harvard University and from a broad spectrum of institutions/regions will design
calculus syllabi outlines. They will investigate the use of
computers/calculators in opening up new topics and new ways of teaching. They
will completely rethink the goals and content of calculus courses; establish
closer collaboration with representative of client disciplines; plan the
creation of tests; and plan the development of materials to be used in workshops
on pedagogy. The team consists of mathematicians from Harvard University,
University of Arizona, Colgate University, Haverford College, University of
Southern Mississippi, Stanford University, Suffolk Community College, and
Chelmsford High School. The PI Andy Gleason, a research mathematician, is a
member of the National Academy of Sciences and a former President of the
American Mathematical Society. The co-PI Deborah Hughes has designed and
oversees the quantitative reasoning and calculus courses at Harvard. Tom Tucker
of Colgate University, an established leader in calculus reform, is also on the
writing team. He authored the content report of the Tulane Conference and has
chaired the College Board's Advanced Placement Calculus Committee.
