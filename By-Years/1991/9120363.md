Fundamental research directed toward improved understanding of growth and
processing of semiconductors, and the electronic properties of heterostructures
through the development and use of advanced contactless electromodulation
methods of photore- flectance and electroreflectance will be conducted. A major
advantage of these methods is that they can be used in situ and in real time for
effective improvement in the control of advanced semiconductor growth and
subsequent processing as well as providing fundamental information on the basic
electronic properties of these materials. The research base established will
serve to improve materials parameters such as alloy composition, Schottky
barrier heights, interfacial quality, well width in quantum well structures and
superlattices. %%% This research is expected to provide deeper fundamental
understanding of semiconductor growth and processing, and the fundamental
electronic properties of heterostructures. From an application point of view,
understanding these processes and properties is beneficial to semiconductor
device design and fabrication. The results will be of importance in a general
way to the technology of large scale, high speed integrated electronic circuits.
