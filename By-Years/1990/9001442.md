This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis Chemistry Program. Dr.
Hendrickson is developing a computer based system to aid in the complicated
process of synthesizing the variety of structures that are found in nature or
the new molecules needed to meet the demands of our society. The computer
provides an important tool in making choices among the myriad possible routes to
synthesize new structures in an efficient and economic manner. The first version
of a computer program (SYNGEN) was developed which creates the shortest
synthesis routes of construction reactions only by a protocol based on
convergent assembly of the target molecule from real starting materials in a
catalog. The program proceeds without resort to a database library of reactions
and without operator intervention. The program will be developed into a fully
practical tool for organic chemists, refining the presentation to present the
best routes foremost and to offer literature precedents on command. Ancillary
developments will include several new strategies for synthesis design and
expanded capabilities into special chemistry. The reaction and starting material
bases available for synthesis will be organized and used to assess the nature of
existing syntheses in the literature to gain more insight into the logic of
design strategies in actual use.
