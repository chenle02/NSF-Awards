This Research Opportunities for Women award will be used for the development of
molecular techniques to study the evolutionary relationships of strains and
species of marine microalgae. Similar methodologies have been developed and
successfully used for the higher plants but they have not been readily adapted
to the marine algae. Successful adaptations will greatly facilitate evolutionary
investigations on these organims which are of utmost importance inmarine
productivity and food chains.
