Professor Mahrt will reexamine the development of shear- instability and
generation of turbulence in stratified flow by employing nonlinear stability
analysis techniques (energy-Casimir approach). Preliminary work indicates that
the critical Richardson number is generally larger than 0.25 but depends on the
curvature of mean flow profile. While this stability analysis is more general
than previous analyses, a number of technical points must be examined before
results can be developed with confidence. Most interesting are differences
predicted by this approach and those of Ekman instability. These analytical
results will be compared to an unprecedented large sample of high-quality tower
data collected in stable conditions over flat terrain (Riso, Denmark) and will
also be applied to fast response aircraft data collected above the boundary
later in several meteorological field experiments. The objective is to assess
the relationship between turbulence development and the mean profile of wind and
potential temperature.//
