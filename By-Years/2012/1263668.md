Under this international collaborative project, Jonathan Bobaljik, David
Koester, Michael Krauss and Chikako Ono (Chiba University, Japan) will work
towards the completion and publication of a comprehensive dictionary of the
Itelmen language, comprising all known lexical resources, work that was begun
under the aegis of a 2012 RAPID award (ARC-1155973). The centerpiece of the
project is the large lexical card file (12,000 + cards) assembled by A. P.
Volodin (St. Petersburg) from 1962 into the 1980s. The project is coordinated
with a larger effort to publish comprehensive dictionaries of the languages of
"Beringia" (the Bering Sea region), and comes at a key juncture in the
language's history. Itelmen is critically endangered: at this time, the number
of native speakers has dwindled to fewer than 10. At the same time, there is
growing interest in the Itelmen language within the Itelmen community, as well
as growing scholarly attention to the languages of this region in the context of
language contact across the Bering Strait.
