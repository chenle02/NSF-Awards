The Geologic Data Center at SIO has multibeam bathymetry data for 241 cruises on
three vessels. These data have been locally archived and used to create custom
data products for the MGG community. In the future, the intention is to make all
these data available on line to the community and much of the cost for doing
this is provided by other support (other NSF directorates and programs). Under
this award, the PIs will clean up the existing data (systematically make
appropriate corrections, edit bad data, make consistent file names, etc..), and
migrate all the data to a common medium- a robotic digital tape library that
will be under the control of the Storage Resource Broker, an archive management
product of the San Diego Supercomputer Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
