While it has long been postulated that stationary wave patterns in the
atmosphere are predictable, it has never been satisfactorily demonstrated that
this is the case. A comparison of simulations with a simplified version and a
fully non-linear version of a general circulation model can be used to determine
the potential predictability of stationary waves. This project focuses on
examination of the causes for maintenance of stationary waves and their
anomalies in the NMC General Circulation Model. The technical tools to be used
are discretized, linearized models of the steady state response of the model
atmosphere to specified forcing such as orography and heating. The project will
provide for the first time a quantitative and definitive analysis of what causes
stationary waves in the NMC General Circulation Model. This will lay the
foundation for research on stationary waves in the real atmosphere as well as on
the feasibility of dynamical extended range prediction.
