The investigators will study electron solitary holes (ESH) on auroral magnetic
field lines. ESH are positive potential wells moving at a fraction of the
electron thermal speed with parallel scale sizes the order of the Debye length
and variable perpendicular scale sizes. The CLUSTER satellites have
instrumentation for measuring plasma waves and electron distribution functions.
These data can be used to study the origin, evolution, lifetimes and effects of
ESH. The four satellites making up the CLUSTER II mission were successfully
launched in the summer of 2000 and all instruments are working nominally. The
investigators have developed plasma wave receivers and interferometers for many
years and have studied ESH using data from the POLAR spacecraft. ESH have
recently been observed in the auroral acceleration zone, plasma sheet,
cusp/cleft, high latitude boundary layer, shock transition region, and possibly
the wake of Europa in the solar wind. Study of this phenomenon is essential to
our understanding of space weather and plasma processes in the magnetosphere.
