Dr. Quang Shen and other members of the Chemistry Department of Colgate
University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5, ten undergraduate
students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of
research projects. Projects range the traditional areas of chemistry-inorganic,
organic, physical and biochemistry. A unique feature of this program is that
each project will have chemical kinetics as a theme to provide a common thread
for communication among students initially, and a common base of knowledge for
further discourse among students and faculty.
