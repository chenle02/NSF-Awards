9415738 Nigg This project is being funded as part of the National Earthquake
Hazards Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and effects of the
January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake. The study will focus on three cities in
Los Angeles County: Los Angeles, Santa Monica, and Santa Clarita. Data will be
collected and analyzed on the emergency response and early recovery activities
following the earthquake that will allow for a systematic comparison between
these three communities. The study should provide part of the basis for
improving both disaster management and recovery planing in metropolitan areas at
risk to earthquakes and other hazards. ***
