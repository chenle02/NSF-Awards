The international conference Representation Theory at the Crossroads of Modern
Mathematics will be held May 29 - June 2, 2017 at the University of Reims
Champagne - Ardenne (France). This project is to support the participation of
U.S.-based researchers in the event. The conference will consist of twenty-seven
talks given by the leading international researchers in representation theory
and it will foster a high level of interaction and collaboration among a
diverse, international group of mathematicians. Participation of U.S.-based
researchers in the event will contribute to the current strength of domestic
mathematical research and support the development of the next generation of
researchers in the United States.

The unifying theme of the conference will be the impact of the oribit method of
A. Kirillov in representation theory. Talks will cover a wide range of topics in
the representation theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras, including quantum
groups, integrable systems, geometric quantization, cohomology of algebraic
groups, and applications of representation theory in enumerative geometry and
physics. The program will advance the dissemination of the newest results in the
field and catalyze and strengthen a broad spectrum of scientific exchanges and
collaborations between mathematicians from around the world working in
representation theory and related topics. The conference website is
