The purpose of this grant is for the development and interpretation of
empirical models of electron density in the equatorial plane of the earth's
magnetosphere. When available, these models will provide a substantially
improved basis for studies of magnetospheric convection, wave-particle
interactions, and plasma interchange between the magnetosphere and ionosphere.
The models would be based primarily upon a combination of results from whistlers
recorded be Stanford University at Antarctic stations and from the University of
Iowa Plasma Wave Experiment Sweep Frequency Receiver on the ISEE-1 satellite.
Magnetospheric research has reached a point of increasing emphasis upon the
development of theoretical and empirical models of the plasma distribution and
dynamics, an example of this emphasis being the October 1986 Huntsville Workshop
on Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Plasma Models. Among the magnetospheric plasma
parameters which one can model empirically, equatorial electron density neq now
appears to be one of the most important and most accessible. This parameter is
of scientific interest for many reasons. It depends upon a number of fundamental
physical processes that are difficult to observe, such as solar wind induced
convection and relate substorm morphology and the interchange of ionization with
the spatially and temporally variable ionosphere. neq represents the equatorial
propagation medium and hence the conditions on wave refractive index under which
resonant wave particle interactions take place, including particle scattering
from the radiation belts. The equatorial plasma is also an important part of the
medium through which ULF waves must propagate in carrying energy form either the
solar wind or the magnetopause regions where wave-particle interactions may be
modulated at ULF frequencies.
