Experiments on structural models and full-scale structures are important to
understanding the behavior of structures subjected to earthquake loadings.
Techniques such as shake table experimentation, pseudo-dynamic experimentation,
and static experimentation have been used in the past for various applications
with some degree of success. This research project will examine the controlled
underground expansion technique for use as a facility for inducing earthquake-
type ground motion into model structures. Emphasis will be placed on achieving
ground displacements up to 10 inches. The results of this research are directly
applicable to the design of an in situ experimentation facility for use in
structural dynamics research.
