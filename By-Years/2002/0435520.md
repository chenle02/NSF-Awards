Proposal Number: 0435520&lt;br/&gt;PI: Steven Low&lt;br/&gt;Institution:
California Institute of Technology &lt;br/&gt;Title: Counter-Intuitive Behavior
in General Networks &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is
well-known that counter-intuitive behavior can arise in a distributed system
where agents optimize their own objectives.&lt;br/&gt;This project studies the
intricate interactions in TCP networks. The emphasis is on general network
topologies with multiple links and heterogeneous flows and on rigorous
mathematical modeling and analysis. The project develops mathematical theory to
understand the behavior of large scale networks, verifies these theoretical
insights in simulations and real networks, and exploits them in practical design
and operation of networks and protocols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary
results illustrate that interesting and counter-intuitive behavior arises only
in a network setting where flows interact through multiple shared links in
surprising ways. For example, the researchers have shown that increasing link
capacity can reduce the aggregate throughput in a TCP network, and that,
contrary to conventional wisdom, a fair bandwidth allocation is not necessarily
inefficient. These results demonstrate that the formal approach taken in the
project is indeed necessary and rewarding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of
this project will help us better understand behavior of large-scale networks
such as the Internet, and in particular, help characterize paradoxical
phenomenon and derive guidelines to avoid harmful behavior in TCP
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Together with Professor Mung Chiang of Princeton
EE, the PI is developing a new course on ``Control and optimization of
communication networks'', at the introductory graduate and&lt;br/&gt;advanced
undergraduate level. The results produced in the project will be directly
incorporated into the new course. We will also leverage on, and contribute to,
the education and outreach activities of this initiative.&lt;br/&gt;
