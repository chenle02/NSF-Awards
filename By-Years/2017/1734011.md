Understanding, controlling, and utilizing the quantum world is challenging but
holds great potential for designing new forms of matter and new paths for
information processing. Ultracold atoms and atom-like systems provide a
promising avenue for pursuing these goals since they can now be controlled and
manipulated with unprecedented precision. The Center for Ultracold Atoms (CUA)
is a joint effort between Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard
University aimed at harnessing the power of quantum mechanics for new physics
and new applications. Through this Physics Frontiers Centers award, the CUA will
develop a variety of theoretical and experimental tools to study strongly-
interacting many-body systems of ultracold atoms and molecules, as well as
coherent single or few particle systems. The CUA will also advance education and
outreach, both for the scientific community and general public, with a broad
portfolio of activities. Among these efforts, the CUA will develop new online
education programs in partnership with the New Jersey Center for Teaching and
Learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CUA research activities are organized into
three areas. The first focuses on quantum gases of atoms and molecules and will
extend the scope of ultracold quantum gas physics with new experiments in areas
that are not computationally tractable and new probes and tools that will enable
improved levels of control. The second research area will focus on many-body
dynamics in atomic systems that are controlled by, and interact with, light. The
third area focuses on probing many-body phenomena related to the interplay
between non-equilibrium properties, entanglement, and topology in the quantum
dynamics of controlled solid-state and hybrid systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Physics Frontiers Centers award is co-funded by the
Division of Physics within the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical
Sciences, and by the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations within
the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.
