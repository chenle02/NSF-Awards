This is a renewal proposal with a two-pronged approach. The first approach
involves the development of new methodologies for the synthesis of metastable
oxides. The proposed methodologies involve the chemical modification of
materials at low temperatures. The oxides to be synthesized are the hexagonal
form of MoO3 and its modified oxides. The second approach involves the
development of new phases, and the intended oxides are the oxides related to
a-PbO2. The objective of this proposal is to develop an understanding of the
critical chemical factors affecting the synthesis of certain types of oxides.
%%%% This proposal outlined a very good quality basic solid state chemistry
research program dealing with specific types of oxides. It aims to provide
information about the critical factors which affect the synthesis of the oxides
chemically.
