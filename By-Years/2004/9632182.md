9632182 Thorpe The mechanical stability and associated properties of network
glasses can be analyzed by studying the floppy modes, the low frequency
eigenmodes. Using a recently devised algorithm, called the pebble game, in two
dimensions, the PI has been successful in calculating several measures of the
cluster statistics for a large number of sites. The current grant is to explore
extension of this work to 3 dimensions, to explore development of an associated
thermodynamic formalism and thereby study floppy- rigid transitions. This
research should produce an improved understanding of hardness, the structural
behavior of tunneling modes and the nature of fragile and strong glass formers.
%%% This grant supports research in the mechanical stability of glasses. The
research involves developments of measures of strength and mathematical
techniques for a reliable calculation of them. The various projects here are at
the forefront of the interface between applied mathematics and materials
science. This research should produce an improved understanding of hardness, of
its relationship to elastic waves and the nature of fragile and strong glass
formers. ***
