As the richness and volume of data maintained by a wide variety of businesses
and organizations increases, there is a growing need to derive useful
information, not only from data owned by individual parties, but also across
parties. The current data sharing practice is dominated by carefully negotiated,
mostly secret, one-on-one agreements between organizations, and is seriously
limited. It does not scale as the number of databases and organizations
increase, cannot be formally analyzed for unintended information leaks or other
violations, and may require unnecessary data exposure. This project explores a
collaborative multi-party data sharing mechanism that allows safe and convenient
sharing of databases in order to enable large-scale collaborative data analytics
and knowledge extraction applications.

Multi-party data sharing involves many challenges that the project attempts to
address. First, it is necessary to have an intuitive specification of access
control policies for data access across parties and an automated mechanism to
translate those into a concise set of access rules while resolving conflicts,
specification inadequacies, and other problems. Second, we need efficient and
scalable implementation of allowed queries in spite of complex access
restrictions. Third, it is necessary to handle both the traditional relational
databases, its variants, and the emerging graph databases. Finally, we need
mechanisms to efficiently check the integrity and completeness of the data
supplied as answers. By addressing these challenges, the research hopes to
establish the foundations of multiparty data sharing. Many of the formalizations
in this research will exploit Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) based methods
for testing assertions and for resolving conflicts.

With tremendous amount of data being generated by both cyber and cyberphysical
systems, this project will help devise practical mechanisms to share data in a
wide variety of scenarios and thereby accelerate the pace of data driven
innovation applied to information systems serving the society.
