OISE 11-30978

During this three year project, the PI will bring US students to the Lough Hyne
Marine Reserve in County Cork, Ireland to conduct ecological research. This
reserve is Europe?s first statutory marine reserve and is among the world?s most
studied protected shores with more than 70 years of ecological study. This sea
lough, known for extremely rich habitats and high species diversity, is faced
with imminent change due to a recent series of large-scale alterations in the
lough data. Each year two undergraduate and two graduate students will
participate in the project. The Irish collaborators are Colin Little (University
of Bristol) and Rob McAllen (University College Cork). Lough Hyne is an ideal
field model system and the location has many logistical scientific and
educational advantages. The unifying research theme is understanding the marine
benthic ecology of the Lough Hyne primarily by recording species abundance and
distributions and comparing these over time and over different spatial scales.
The students? participation in long-term monitoring of historical sites will
allow for detection of long term changes that are otherwise difficult to assess.
Working in a marine protected area with local scientists is an invaluable
experience for students that will translate well into their futures in marine
sciences.
