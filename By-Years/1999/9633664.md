9633664 Housner The 1996 International Conference and Exposition on Natural
Disaster Reduction (NDR'96) is to be held in Washington, D.C., December 3-5,
1996. It is organized by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) under
the auspices of the United Nations International Decade for Natural Disaster
Reduction (IDNDR), and supported by a number of United States Federal agencies.
The purpose of the NDR'96 is to promote and assess the role of civil
engineering, through its interaction with other disciplines, in mitigating,
preparing for a recovering from natural disaster impacts on the built and
natural environments. Sessions have been organized where the causes, effects and
mitigation of hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, landslides and other
natural hazards hazards will be discussed and where advances in knowledge
related to these types of disasters will be presented. Proceedings from NDR'96
will be given worldwide dissemination which will provide the natural hazards
international community with an up-to-date source of information on and a
research agenda for natural disaster reduction. ***
