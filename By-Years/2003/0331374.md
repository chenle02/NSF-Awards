0331374&lt;br/&gt;Frost&lt;br/&gt;In this project, biosynthetic pathways are to
be created for the synthesis of 1,2,4-butanetriol. Biosynthetic pathways are to
be designed and constructed for the synthesis of D-1,2,4-butanetriol from
D-xylose and the synthesis of L-1,2,4-butanetriol from L-arabinose. Biosynthetic
pathways will also be designed and constructed for the synthesis of
D-1,2,4-butanetriol, L-1,2,4-butanetriol and mixtures of these enantiomers from
erythritol. D-Xylose and L-arabinose can be derived from abundantly available
corn fiber. Erythritol is a fermentation product produced from D-glucose, which
can be derived from abundantly available corn starch. Each biosynthetic pathway
to be created will be expressed in a separate microbial construct. Fermentor-
controlled cultivation of the microbial constructs with pentose or erythritol
will lead to synthesis of the desired 1,2,4-butantriol enantiomer(s).
