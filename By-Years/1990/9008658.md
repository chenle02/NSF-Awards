This is an experimental research program designed to answer the following
scientific issues: how the electronic charge density at the surface is modulated
by adsorbed impurity atoms, how modulation of charge density affects the
equilibrium distribution of chemical species near surfaces and interfaces, what
are site specific binding energies, and how these modulations affect structure
at surfaces. The experimental techniques being used field ion microscopy and
time-of-flight atom probe. The main emphasis of the research is the dynamics and
energetics of surface atomic processes and how they are correlated to the atomic
structures as well as the equilibrium distribution of chemical species in the
near surface and interface layers of metals, alloys, semiconductors, and their
combinations.
