The objective of this work is to synthesize silver coated nanoparticles which
have, among other novel optical properties, the ability to generate phase
conjugate light with low incident light intensities. The experimental program
consists of two parts: 1) determining the experimental parameters required to
generate thin smooth coats of silver on nonlinear dielectric cores, 2) verifying
that the coated particles have the computed scattering and extinction spectra
and are able to generate phase conjugate light as predicted. The coated
particles will have applications in nonlinear optics, for example, in phase
conjugate mirrors or optical signal processing devices, and may also have
applications as optical filters. With these composite materials it should be
possible to make devices which can operate with less powerful and less expensive
light sources than those required now.
