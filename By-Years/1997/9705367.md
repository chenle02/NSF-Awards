w:\awards\awards96\num.doc 9705367 Gustafsson This experimental research
project is in the area of surface analysis based on the use of ion beam
scattering. A first project centers on study of the unexpectedly large spacing
observed between the two outermost layers on surfaces of Ag and Cu, at elevated
temperatures in ultra high vacuum. Study of this expansion effect will be
extended to binary systems, and will be compared with recently generated
theoretical predictions. The second major project is a study of initial stages
of oxidation, the first 1 - 10nm of oxide growth, making use of great advances
in surface analysis techniques that have been made since classic oxidation
studies. Emphasis is on the mechanism of growth and the microstructure of the
resulting oxide. A wide range of systems, including Si, Ni, Al, Cu, Ge and SiC
will be studied. A variety of additional tools, including STM, AFM and
photoelectron spectroscopy will be employed in the project. The primary
experimental tool is high-resolution medium energy ion scattering, which can
provide information on surface structure, growth mechanisms, and kinetics. %%%%
This experimental research uses advance surface science instrumentation to study
at the atomic level the process of oxide film growth on metals and
semiconductors. Oxide growth is of immense importance in wide areas of
technology, for example in the silicon technology where gate oxides are central,
to passivation layers on metals such as aluminum. Previous studies have been
limited in the availability of experimental techniques and equipment, leaving
many questions on how oxidation occurs, especially during the first few atomic
layers. This experimental study will depend primarily upon medium energy ion
scattering, supplemented by other techniques including scanning tunneling
microscopy and atomic fo rce microscopy. Materials of interest in this project
are Si, Ni, Al, Cu, Ge and SiC. Results from this research may include unusual
new effects which may find application in technology. This research project is
interdisciplinary in nature and involves graduate and postgraduate students who
will be excellently trained to enter positions in industry, government or
education. ***
