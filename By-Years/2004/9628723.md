Reddy, Sunita P Clark University When both a state and a local community claim
rights over the same resource by appealing to customary or statutory law,
territorial conflict may arise. The study will investigate territorial conflict
between the state and common property regimes in two Guatemalan pine forests:
San Francisco El Alto and San Jose La Arada. The objectives of the proposed
study are to determine how territorial conflict between states and communities
affects governance of resources, whether variation in customary law is a
significant influence on the mode of conflict negotiation utilized and the
social and environmental outcomes of conflict negotiation. The extended
comparative study will employ in-depth interviews of key informants, semi-
structured surveys, participant observation, oral histories and times series
analyses of aerial photographs. The result will contribute to further knowledge
on the relationships between property regime dynamics and landscape change in
tropical forests.
