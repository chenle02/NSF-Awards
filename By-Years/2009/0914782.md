Influencing and Improving Networks Formed by Strategic Agents

An increasing number of networks on the forefront of scientific research, and of
great importance to our world, are developed, built, and maintained by a large
number of independent agents, all of whom act in their own interests. Such
networks with strategic agents include the Internet, peer-to-peer file sharing
schemes, business contracts between companies, and social networks representing
relationships between groups of people. While these networks cannot be fully
controlled, they can often be influenced in a limited way, sometimes resulting
in dramatic improvement of the global network behavior. For example, this
influence can include giving a few agents incentives to behave differently,
altering a small part of the network, or even providing some extra information
that makes a huge difference. This project will develop methods and algorithms
with provable guarantees for influencing networks of strategic agents in order
to improve the overall network behavior.

This project will study the formation of various networks by strategic agents,
and will especially focus on the system of customer-provider and peering
contracts between Autonomous Systems (AS's) in the Internet. In the process of
this research, new approximation algorithm concepts will be introduced, and will
yield techniques for improving the global qualities of a network, and for
preventing undesirable entities from gaining undue influence over it. While
interactions of self-interested agents have been studied in numerous fields, a
systematic study of how to influence such agents with only a limited amount of
power has never been done. Besides contributing to algorithmic game theory and
the study of networks, this research will open up new research directions in
economics, AI, and the social sciences.
