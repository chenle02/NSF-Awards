In this project, based on applications in protein structure
alignment&lt;br/&gt;and its visualization, we will investigate several
fundamental problems&lt;br/&gt;regarding the discrete Frechet distance. These
include improving the&lt;br/&gt;computation time for protein structure alignment
by taking into account&lt;br/&gt;practical conditions (e.g. the lengths of the
segments connecting neighboring&lt;br/&gt;alpha-carbon atoms are almost
uniform), and simultaneously simplifying a pair&lt;br/&gt;of chains for
realistic visualization, etc. Based on these
theoretical&lt;br/&gt;investigations, we also plan to build a prototype software
system, available&lt;br/&gt;in the public domain, for these applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protein structure alignment is an important and
fundamental technique used to&lt;br/&gt;understand the evolution of proteins and
to predict their functionality.&lt;br/&gt;This understanding is crucial for the
identification of the cause of certain&lt;br/&gt;diseases and for the
development of new drugs. Here we propose a new approach&lt;br/&gt;based on the
discrete Frechet distance to improve the quality and speed of&lt;br/&gt;protein
structure alignment. Our proposal will consider fundamental
questions&lt;br/&gt;with regard to this technique. The resulting software tools
will be accessed&lt;br/&gt;by the public for education and research. This
project will help support&lt;br/&gt;and train several graduate students at
Montana State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
