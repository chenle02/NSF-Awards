Gilmer will continue the study of topological quantum field theories defined
over rings of cyclotomic integers. He will continue to study with Masbaum the
associated mapping class groups representations acting on modules over these
rings and also over their finite quotients. He will also study the related
infinite dimensional perturbative representation of the Torelli group that
Masbaum has defined. Gilmer will study strong shift equivalence class invariants
of knots and other spaces which are equipped with an infinite cyclic cover. He
will use these structures to study questions in low dimensional topology. Gilmer
will also study invariants of links that he has associated to collections of
curves in the real projective plane. This should lead to restrictions on
topology of real algebraic curves.

Topology is the study of intrinsic shape. It is sometimes called "rubber sheet"
geometry as frequently the objects one studies can be twisted and stretched but
not torn. Recently topology has had a large influx of ideas from physics.
Topological quantum field theory (TQFT) is an area of topology with intimate
connections to high energy physics, quantum computing as well as other areas of
mathematics, for instance number theory. The same topological quantum field
theories that Gilmer will be exploring have been proposed by others for
applications to quantum computing. Gilmer would also like to use TQFT as a tool
to study classical questions in topology. Low dimensional topology is important
for chemistry and biology as it has implications for the mechanism of DNA, and
other molecular configurations.
