This project provides funds to purchase a Nicolet gas chromatography/Fourier-
transform infrared (GC/FTIR) system, which is one of the primary instruments to
be used in a new laboratory course entitled Analysis of Complex Mixtures in
Complex Media. Used in conjunction with existing department analytical equipment
and a microwave digestion unit provided by a local manufacturer, this instrument
permits faculty to implement a program in which undergraduate chemistry majors
are taught the laboratory techniques necessary to perform organic analysis of
complex systems such as soils, water, biological samples, food, and other
multicomponent mixtures. The purpose of this is to provide undergraduates,
especially those whose terminal degrees are a bachelor's, the skills necessary
to perform well in areas such as industrial or environmental chemical analysis.
The GC/FTIR system plays an important role in these types of analysis, since the
more popular mass spectrometer (MS) or GC/MS techniques often fail to provide
the information necessary to distinguish between similar compounds (e.g.,
geometric and substitution isomers) of identical molecular weight.
