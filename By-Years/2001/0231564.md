This award provides funding to Colorado State University for Nancy Levinger with
the Chemistry REU Leadership Group to host a Workshop for selected REU (Research
Experience for Undergraduates) and LS-AMP (Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority
Participation) Program Directors to explore ways for these two major NSF
programs to operate synergistically to lead to mutually beneficial interactions
for both programs. Also funded will be travel grants for over 50 students each
year to participate in the spring ACS (American Chemical Society) Meetings in
2003 and 2004. These travel awards will leverage additional funds and facilitate
the attendance at both of these meetings for 100-150 students participants each
year. Inter-institutional interactions and possible collaboration between REU
faculty and site directors will also be promoted. Support is also provided for
regular meetings of the Chemistry Leadership Group to meet to proceed with
implementing the recommendations from the Spring 2001 Workshop for the Chemistry
REU Site Directors. Items that these meetings will address also include program
evaluation and development, and explore cooperative ventures between different
programs.
