Effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic depends on linguistic and cultural
factors as well as social and economic ones. This is a special concern for
indigenous and immigrant communities for whom information about the pandemic and
important health actions may not match their language or health practices. Given
the dangers of the pandemic and the importance of appropriate information
sharing, the project aims to answer an overarching question: What can be done to
increase understanding in a context of incipient multilingualism and
multiculturalism? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three stages. Stage 1
examines how bilingual individuals with low levels of proficiency in the
dominant language interpret healthcare messages related to COVID-19, and whether
their interpretation is dependent on language proficiency and cultural framing.
Phone/Skype interviews will be conducted in which target concepts/vocabulary
associated with COVID-19 will be discussed. The PIs will assess the extent to
which members of non-dominant linguistic and cultural communities display a
disadvantage in understanding health messages and, therefore, will be more
vulnerable to health crises. The interviews will be recorded, transcribed, and
translated. At Stages 2-3, the PIs will develop and field a procedure for
presenting the necessary concepts related to the COVID-19 and other potential
health crises which are linguistically differentiated and culturally appropriate
not only for the population under investigation but for general use in a
multilingual/multicultural context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
