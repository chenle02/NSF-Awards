The capability to cool high heat flux intensity components is the go no-go gate
for the next generation of electronic computers. This workshop is structured to
provide both a picture of the present state of the art and to set forth the
projected cooling needs of future generations of computers. Representatives of
all the major computer manufacturers will be in attendance as will the
university researchers active in the field. In addition, young university
researchers who are potential contributors will also be present. The workshop
will set the stage for the major thrust in thermal engineering for the remainder
of the decade.
