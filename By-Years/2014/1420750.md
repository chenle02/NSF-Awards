This project addresses the design and analysis of algorithms in number theory.
It focuses on three subareas in detail: problems related to the prime
factorization of integers, the behavior of iterated maps on finite algebraic
objects such as fields and rings, and the exploitation of ideas from
combinatorics and analytic number theory to further our knowledge about
polynomial factoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems studied in this project
are among the most important in computational number theory, and provide key
examples for computational complexity theory and the emerging theory of quantum
computing. Algorithms to solve these problems are also extremely useful for
secure and reliable electronic communication, for computer algebra, and for
pseudo-random number generation. Results obtained in the project will have the
potential to impact all of the above areas. They will also enhance the
connections between theoretical computer science and pure mathematics. This is
because the behavior of number-theoretic algorithms is intimately connected to
significant questions in analytic number theory, algebraic geometry, probability
theory, and dynamical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key component of the
project is graduate student support. Such aid, in the form of research
assistantships supervised by the PI, will help maintain the pipeline of
algorithmically trained researchers in the mathematical sciences. The project
will also help integrate research and teaching, by helping him to develop and
publicize interdisciplinary courses and seminars on topics such as applied
number theory, communication technology, and quantum computation.
