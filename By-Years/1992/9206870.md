The relationship between crystalline structure and magnetic ordering is being
studied in single crystal metal oxide superlattices of Fe3O4 and NiO.
Superlattices of these materials show strong lattice and chemical modulation
coherence, sharp interfaces, an interfacial strain that couples strongly with
other properties of the superlattices, magnetic ordering which is strongly layer
thickness dependent, and, finally, a highly anisotropic electron conductivity.
Extended study of these and similar layered magnetic structures should lead us
to an understanding of the fundamental physical mechanisms that lead to magnetic
ordering, as well as the interplay between electronic and structural ordering in
magnetic materials.
