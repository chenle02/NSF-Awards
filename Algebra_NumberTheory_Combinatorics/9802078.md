9802078 McNulty This award provides support for the Big Sky Conferences on
Discrete Mathematics. This is a series of three conferences to be held at the
University of Montana. The goals of the Big Sky are (1) to bring together
researchers from the geographical area with interests in discrete mathematics in
order for them to meet, share research interests, and present recent results,
and (2) to provide an opportunity for students, teachers, and other
mathematicians in the region to learn more about contemporary mathematics. The
conference will begin with a keynote address by a prominent mathematician that
will be aimed at a general audience. During the conference, there will be an
invited lecture from a successful researcher in discrete mathematics as well as
contributed talks by regional participants. In addition, there will be special
activities organized for undergraduate students giving them the opportunity to
interact with active researchers. This conference is in the general area of
combinatorics. One of the goals of combinatorics is to find efficient methods of
studying how discrete collections of objects can be arranged or effectively
enumerated. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern
communications. For example, the design of large networks, such as those
occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science
deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial
research.
