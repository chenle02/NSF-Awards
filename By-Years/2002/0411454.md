With NSF support, Bowie State University will develop further its STEM
capabilities involving minority students in greater numbers, paving the way for
eventual increase of underrepresented degree seeking students in STEM
disciplines. Project goals are (1) to develop an academic infrastructure that
produces quality STEM graduates, (2) to expand the participation of
underrepresented minority students and faculty, and (3) to strengthen a diverse
internationally competitive and globally engaged workforce of scientists,
engineers, and well prepared citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project synergistic
activities include (1) revising STEM gate-keeping courses and promoting
conceptual curricular continuity; (2) accelerating graduation and developing
STEM Honors Program offerings; (3) developing new undergraduate programs in Bio-
informatics and Computational Biology, and Computer Network Security; (4)
implementation of research-based teaching and learning techniques and practices;
(5) providing research and Internship opportunities to STEM undergraduate
students; (6) expanding tutoring opportunities and building an assessment,
intervention and advisement plan; (7) organizing Summer Academy for entering
STEM freshmen; (8) providing support for successful entry into STEM graduate
programs through a strong undergraduate curriculum and GRE preparation; (9)
organizing professional workshops for faculty development, and research
opportunities for faculty on/off campus, and (10) organizing an annual symposium
on undergraduate research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this
project lies in the proposed STEM infrastructure enhancements and their
potential to result in significant and sustainable improvements in the overall
quality of STEM instruction at the institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact
of the proposed efforts is to broaden the participation of under-represented
minorities in STEM disciplines and the national STEM workforce. &lt;br/&gt;
