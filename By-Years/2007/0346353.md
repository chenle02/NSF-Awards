Professor Bradley Jones of Wake Forest University and Professor Clifton Calloway
of Winthrop College are working to develop a novel, low-cost, portable
instrument for the simultaneous determination of trace radioactive elements in
nuclear forensic samples. At issue is the routine, inexpensive sampling for
radioactivity that could be released on transport or storage of potential "dirty
bomb" material. The device will employ a deuterium lamp as a light source, a
tungsten coil as the atomizer and an echelle spectrometer with a built-in
charge-coupled device as the detector. The package is expected to provide
analytical figures comparable to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS), but the instrument is much lower cost and more portable. The specific
objectives of the project include determination of the analytical figures of
merit for elements including cobalt, cesium, and strontium, and analysis of real
samples such as soil, urban dust, water and agricultural materials. Several
graduate students along with undergraduates from Winthrop College will be
involved in the design and testing of the instrument. Leeman Labs Inc will
collaborate for prototype development.
