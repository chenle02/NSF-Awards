The Belgrade rat has a severe microcytic, hypochromic anemia inherited as an
autosomal recessive trait. Iron uptake into Belgrade reticulocytes is only about
20% of normal. The Belgrade rat carries a mutation in an unidentified protein
that is involved in iron uptake through the transferrin cycle. Preliminary
evidence suggests the problem may occur in endosomal acidification, with
Belgrade vesicles not acidifying to the same extent as normal. If this is the
case, iron uptake through the transferrin receptor and/or receptor-ligand
systems other than the transferrin- transferrin receptor system may be affected.
Experiments to explore this are currently underway. The results of these
experiments may result in the Belgrade rat becoming an important model system
for the study of endocytosis and/or endocytic acidification. The world supply of
Belgrade rats, which are difficult to maintain in laboratory colonies, is in
jeopardy due to a variety of circumstances. This proposal requests funds to
maintain the Belgrade rat colony at the State University of New York at Buffalo.
