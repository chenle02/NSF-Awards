Sixteen teachers from Chicago, all inner city veterans who work primarily with
minority students, will be selected to attend a four-week summer science seminar
in chemistry. The seminar, to be held at the University of Chicago, includes a
set of lectures and laboratory exercises with full regard to giving the
participants material which can be immediately put to use in the laboratories of
Chicago Public Schools. Laboratory experiences, chemical demonstrations, the use
of computers in a chemistry lab as well as the unique strategies required to
teach chemistry effectively will be the foci of the seminar. Eighty percent of
the cost of the project is borne by private foundations and the University of
Chicago.
