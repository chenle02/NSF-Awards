9509997 Bond Fast paced cycles of two to three thousand years recorded in the
North Atlantic cores show apparently synchronous discharge of icebergs from at
least two sources on Iceland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence and may be related to
mechanisms originating in the ocean/atmosphere system. Each cycle also
correlates with cold pulses in Greenland ice cores and linked to Heinrich
events. The PI's research will further investigate the role of ice sheets in
forcing rapid climate shifts. If the 2 to 3 thousand-years cycles persist
through different glacial/interglacial periods then they would imply that the
oscillations operate independently of large glaciers and originate in the
atmosphere/ocean system. ***
