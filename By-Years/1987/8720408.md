The analysis of the light emitted by atoms and molecules in the upper
atmosphere leads to a knowledge of the chemical and physical reactions taking
place there as energy in the form of solar ultraviolet radiation is absorbed
during the day, and in the form of high speed streams of electrons and
positively charged atoms is absorbed at high latitudes at night. To relate the
optical observations to specific chemical reactions and to infer upper
atmosphere temperature and composition and energy inputs, it is necessary to
perform controlled laboratory experiments to determine the parameters that need
to be used in numerical models of the processes. This award is for laboratory
work to provide such parameters for reactions involving nitrogen and oxygen
atoms and molecules, and to help understand the production of nitric oxide in
aurorae, that is subsequently transported downwards into the middle atmosphere
and affects the concentration of ozone there.
