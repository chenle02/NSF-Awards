9353920 Gwozdz Workshops on microfabrication are provided for undergraduate
faculty. These workshops teach technology used for the manufacture of integrated
circuits and other miniature devices. Hands-on laboratory experience, under the
direction of experts in the field, is emphasized. The subject matter is highly
interdisciplinary, appropriate for faculty from most science and engineering
departments. Workshops are particularly appropriate for teachers of introductory
courses in materials science and engineering, electrical engineering, chemistry
and chemical engineering, and physics. ***
