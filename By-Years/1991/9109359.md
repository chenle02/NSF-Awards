NYSERNet, Inc. proposes NSFNET connection-assistance for adding the following
schools to NYSERNET: Marist College, Herbert H. Lehman College, Hamilton
College, and Brooklyn College. The following schools will be aided in upgrading
the speed of their current connection from 9,600 bits per second to 56 thousand
bits per second: State University at Fredonia, State University at Geneseo,
State University at Oswego, State University at Purchase, Skidmore College, Bard
College, Cooper Union, Union College, Alfred University, and Rochester Institute
of Technology. Research, education, and access to resources on the NSFNET are
all benefits for connection for these participating institutions. Each has
submitted a proposal requesting aid through NYSERNet. Each is presently
connected or is awaiting installation of a connection to the network. Each is
committed to supporting the full cost of networking once their subsidy support
is concluded.
