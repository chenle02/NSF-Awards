Abstract Technical abstract: Single-molecule transport will be studied using
evanescent-wave coupling of light to microscopic tunnel junctions. The primary
experimental tool will be a scanning tunneling microscope with optical access.
Alternative tunneling techniques will also be investigated. Molecular films to
be studied will range from simple molecules such as benzene to larger molecules
with chromophores. Non-technical abstract: Molecular materials are viewed as
potentially valuable in electronic and opto-electronic devices. There is
currently no adequate understanding of the electronic conduction pathways within
molecules at the single molecule level, or of the mechanism by which current can
enter and leave molecules through metal contacts. We propose to gain
understanding of these processes by probing suitable molecules in microscopic
devices with light pulses which can interact with current carried on the
conduction paths.
