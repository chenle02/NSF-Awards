Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposed to demonstrate a novel method of
externally modulating light in a waveguide, utilizing the surface plasmon
polariton (SPP), a two-dimensional electromagnetic wave confined to a metal-
dielectric interface by coupling with quantized charge oscillations. The
proposed SPP modulator device is in contact with a waveguide and consists of:
(1) a thin dielectric buffer layer; (2) a thin metal film of a few hundred
atomic layers; (3) an electro-optic material with voltage-controllable
refractive index; and (4) the outer electrode. A prototype modulator will be
fabricated on a single mode optical fiber by applying a thin-film deposition of
the layers. When the refractive index of (3) is made equal to that of the
effective mode index, there is full coupling of evanescent waves to SPPs and
consequent complete loss of light from the wavequide, so that modulation is
achieved by changes in the applied voltage. Unlike conventional devices, an SPP
device can be rugged and low cost, operating at very high frequencies with low
insertion losses and no back reflections. The high sensitivity of SPP excitation
means that such a modulator can operate at very low voltages. The feasibility of
two-dimensional switching and modulation matrices will be studied.
