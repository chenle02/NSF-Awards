Manufacturing is in the midst of change as Industry 4.0 advanced manufacturing
technologies are being implemented to bring manufacturers into the digital age.
These new technologies include recent advances in automation, computing, and
communications. Manufacturers need skilled technicians and advanced operators to
build, implement, troubleshoot, maintain, and modify manufacturing systems that
use these technologies. Students will learn Industry 4.0 competencies that are
based on local industry workforce needs. This project will focus on agriculture,
food and beverage processing, and oil and gas manufacturing sectors. Texas
A&amp;M University will collaborate with Clovis Community College and Lone Star
College on the development and evaluation of new curricula that will provide
instruction and hands-on learning experiences for students on Industry 4.0
concepts. Students will have the opportunity to earn a certificate in industrial
automation. The project will provide professional development workshops to train
community college faculty and high school teachers on Industry 4.0 technologies.
Working with local high schools, the project team will create dual enrollment
courses for high school students that can be taken at the community college
campuses, at the high school, or online.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
project is to help students learn the necessary skills to be successful in the
manufacturing technician workforce. This project will: (1) prepare new graduates
for local industry workforce needs by creating course content for Industry 4.0
concepts; (2) enrich skill sets of incumbent workers through certificate
programs; (3) create a pipeline for incoming students by working with school
districts and offering workshops for secondary school teachers; and (4) host
professional development workshops to disseminate project results to instructors
at community colleges. Subject matter experts will provide feedback to the
project team about the technical accuracy and relevance of the instructional
materials. To make hands-on learning experiences more accessible to learners
with limited instructional resources, online access to automated systems and
virtual/remote learning environments will be developed and pilot tested. The
impact of the courses and the online learning environment on student learning
will be evaluated using student surveys and learning assessments. This project
is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the
education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the
Nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
