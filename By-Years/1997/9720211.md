The next generation of high-performance machines will be shared-memory machines
with deep memory hierarchies. It is important to execute dense matrix
computations efficiently on these platforms, because a considerable portion of
the time spent in engineering or scientific simulations is spent in performing
dense matrix computations. However, there is as yet little experience in writing
portable software or in generating code automatically for machines with deep
memory hierarchies. Existing libraries like LAPACK are targeted for
uniprocessors with a two-level memory hierarchy, and must be rewritten for
machines with deeper memory hierarchies. Existing compiler techniques focus
mainly on so-called perfectly nested loops, and are inadequate even for two-
level memory hierarchies. The PI's have recently developed a novel approach
called data shackling to overcome the limitations of existing techniques. In
this project they extend this approach to uniprocessors with a deep memory
hierarchy, and to shared-memory multiprocessors.
