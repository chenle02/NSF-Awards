Lean premixed prevaporized combustor (LPPC) is the most promising solution for
elimination of NOx pollutant caused by conventional gas turbine engine. One of
the most significant obstacles of practical use of LPPC is the flame front
flashback, which is caused by the growing of the vortices inside the
recirculation zone formed by gas mixture flow over a rearward-facing step in a
channel. Removal of part of the boundary layer could effectively suppress the
growth of those recirculating vortices. The simulation of the boundary layer
suction of LPPC is carried out by using the revised MIMOC program (Ghoniem et
al., 1983). This program used the random vortex model of Chorin, 1973, 1978,
1980), which allows the turbulent field to evolve as a fundamental solution of
the Navier-Stokes equations without neither averaging procedure, which in turn
requires closure modeling, nor introduces extra numerical diffusion, which can
dampen the inherent natural instabilities of the flow field.
