In response to local workforce needs, Palm Beach Community College (PBCC) is
recruiting eighty-five financially needy, high achieving students into the STEM
disciplines. There is a special emphasis on recruiting area underrepresented
students. To this aim, recruiting materials are available in English, Spanish
and Creole. Recruiting objectives are 58% underrepresented minority students,
45% female students, and 30% nontraditional students in that they returned to
school 24 months after graduating high school. Students can either obtain an
A.S. degree intending to enter the workforce, or enter a B.S. degree program
with Florida Atlantic University (FAU). If transferring, project participants
receive S-STEM scholarship funds for their third year of studies at FAU, and FAU
scholarship funds for their fourth year. Student support systems include student
orientation, weekly online chat sessions, peer mentoring, biotechnology and
environmental internships, student success seminars; PBCC faculty plan to travel
to the FAU campus for the purpose of continued mentoring of transfer students.
Retention and placement targets are that 90% of the S-STEM scholars complete the
two-year program in which they enroll, and 90% of these graduating student are
employed or enrolled in a four year program related to their discipline within
12 months of graduation.
