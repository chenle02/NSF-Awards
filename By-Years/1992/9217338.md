Moving water can dislodge sessile marine organisms. Such physical disturbance
can be important in structuring benthic communities. Sessile organisms range in
stiffness from rigid corals to flexible macroalgae. The object of this
investigation is to study how the flexural stiffness and size of planar, sessile
organism (e.g. many macrophytes and invertebrate colonies) affect the
hydrodynamic forces they experience in unidirectional currents and in waves
(oscillating flow). Experiments using physical models in unidirectional and
oscillating flow tanks will systematically quantify the relationship of an
organism's size and stiffness to force and to local water velocities relative to
the organism's surfaces. These experiments will be complemented by similar field
measurements on real macroalgae and models. An example of the biological
consequences of the relationship between size, stiffness, and hydrodynamic force
will be explored by investigating the mechanical interactions between encrusting
epiphytic bryozoans and the algal hosts they stiffen. This study is significant
because it will provide basic rules about the consequences of size and
flexibility to the vulnerability of sessile organisms to physical disturbance in
wave-swept versus current-swept habitats.
