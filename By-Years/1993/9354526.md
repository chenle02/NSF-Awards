9354526 Wink The chemistry and mathematics departments of the University of
Illinois at Chicago propose to develop a common curriculum for preparatory
instruction in general chemistry and intermediate algebra. The course, dubbed
"The MATCH Program" to reflect its origins, will be offered to students who
require preparatory courses in order to succeed in college, because of
deficiencies in the their educational background or because they are returning
to their higher education several years after graduation from high school. The
impetus for the curriculum comes from a recognition that such students, who may
be very important in the composition of the nation's technical personnel in the
future, will likely do better if these courses are combined so that mathematics
and chemistry instruction reinforce each other explicitly. The proposed work
will be conducted over a three year period, with a planned transition from a
small developmental program through to one that can be used at other
institutions. Cooperative learning strategies and laboratory program will be key
elements of the instructional effort. The development, evaluation, and
implementation plans all include close consultation with faculty from other
schools, who have either had experience with similar programs or who recognize a
similar need for this program for their students. Finally, a careful and
rigorously controlled assessment program will be included. ***
