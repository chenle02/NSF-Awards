Neural networks offer a flexible, general purpose approach to building the
complex highly nonlinear models that are required for a complex system such as a
nuclear power plant. Recent developments in learning algorithms for neural
networks provide alternatives to the traditional pattern recognition techniques
for analysis of diagnostics. This research planning grant involves a
comprehensive bench mark test for feasibility study for nuclear reactor signal
analysis via a neural network approach. The test consists of a comparison
between equipment degradation monitoring by traditional time series analysis
versus a neural network approach.
