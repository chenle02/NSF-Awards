CTS - 9522159 Robin Rogers University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa ABSTRACT The goal
of the proposed research is to obtain a fundamental understanding of the factors
that affect metal ion partitioning in aqueous biphasic systems (ABS).
Thermodynamic parameters for metal ions in polymer/salt and polymer/polymer ABS
will be used to predict partitioning values. The effects of polymer
hydrophobicity on metal ion distribution will be studied using polyethylene
glycol/polypropylene glycol copolymers. The investigation of temperature
dependent ABS will focus on the differences in metal ion partitioning between
polymer/salt and polymer/water systems. This will help to define the role of
water-structuring agents in determining metal ion supported chromatographic ABS
will be compared. The research may lead to an efficient separation process that
will replace the use of toxic and hazardous organics for extracting metal ions.
Applications include waste remediation, hydrometallurgy and processing of
radiopharmaceuticals.
