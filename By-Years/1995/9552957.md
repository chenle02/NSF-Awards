9507079 Grodzicker The meeting on the Molecular Genetics of Bacteria and Phage
is a central forum for the presentation of new results in the general area of
prokaryotic molecular biology and genetics. Some 300 participants, representing
more than 200 laboratories (both in the United States and abroad) attend; the
vast majority present either short talks or posters. It is an important venue
for the cross fertilization of the discipline; it is also, for many graduate
students and postdoctoral fellow, the firs large meeting at which they have an
opportunity to speak. The abstracts cover a wide range and include fundamental
work on transcription, recombination, DNA synthesis, translation, pathogenesis,
and other areas. Although the specific subjects are wide ranging, the
commonality of approaches means that new conceptual and technical advances
rapidly become disseminated through the attending laboratories. The 1995 meeting
is special in that it includes a session dealing with the E. coli genome
project. This will be the perfect venue for a summary report of the genome
sequencing projects and analyses of how the sequence information can be used in
genome structure/function studies. More importantly, this meeting will provide
an ideal opportunity to stimulate the use of this information by the relevant
scientific community. The meeting will also include a session in which some of
the scientist who founded the field of molecular biology will discuss the
intellectual roots of the field in the context of the then available technology.
%%% The field of biotechnology is founded on research with bacteria and their
viruses. The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory has been the principal location where
the latest information on bacterial genetics is disseminated. This meeting will
provide a summary of where the field has come from as well as the latest
progress in microbial genetics. ***
