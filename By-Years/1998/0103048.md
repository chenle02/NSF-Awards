This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF-0019. The award supports the
construction and application of an electric Stark-effect coupled infrared near
field microscope. This will be a powerful new tool for the analysis of the
chemical composition of surface nanostructures on 50-100 nm length scales, which
are the critical scales for polymer nanotechnologies.
