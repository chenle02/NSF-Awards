The Convergent Technology Center (CTC) is a collaboration of several community
colleges in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and industries that use
telecommunications and information technology. Convergent technologies not only
merge voice, video, image, and data, but also require a resolution of
interoperability issues between technologies and vendors. The outcome must be
seamless and secure communications solutions to business needs. The CTC
determines the skills required in the region for convergence technology,
determines the gaps between required skills and existing curricula, and designs
and tests curricula that fill the gaps. Professional development needs of
faculty are met by workshops that include both content and pedagogical
strategies and by mentoring. Students in economically underserved areas are
recruited through academic programs to reinforce core competencies, service
learning projects, developing learning communities and student mentoring. Mobile
workshops are available for faculty in those areas as are materials for parents,
and community organizations. The CTC provides convergent technology access to
business and industry, and serves as a clearinghouse for educational
materials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
