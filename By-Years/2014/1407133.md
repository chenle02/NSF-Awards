Nearly every environment on earth contains communities of microbes, including
the guts of animals, where microbes are increasingly known to play a major role
in nutrition and disease. This project aims to develop a new technique for
measuring the abundances of the different types of microbes in the guts of the
closest relatives of humans, the great apes. Researchers will combine microscopy
and gene amplification and sequencing to quantify the total numbers of the
various bacterial species that reside within the guts of chimpanzees, bonobos,
and two species of gorillas. Results will provide new insights into how disease,
evolutionary history, geography, and diet shape the internal microbial
communities of primates.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this
project include the development of a molecular technique that could find wide
application in the study of microbes in medicine and biology. The project will
provide research training for a doctoral student and two undergraduate students.
The doctoral student will mentor the undergraduates and gain teaching experience
towards his goal of starting his own lab.
