Lake observatories produce data critical to the development of insights into the
response of ecosystems to the global demands on freshwater resources. To help
scientists study these issues, and to inspire educators and the public to learn
about and further appreciate the importance of lake ecosystems to human well
being, lake observatories need to accelerate the rate at which their
observational data can be discovered and used by others. Through organizing a
conference around the FAIR principles (data that are Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable), the PIs propose to engage members of both the
global lake ecology and the data and information science communities to identify
and develop a roadmap by which lake observatories of the future can deliver FAIR
data to researchers, managers, and the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A one-and-
a-half day workshop is planned for Spring 2020. Attendees will represent key
stakeholders from the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON), the
data and informatics community emerging around FAIR, and affiliated observatory
and international members. The agenda will include reviewing lessons learned
from current FAIR initiatives; gap identification and opportunities for lake
observatories of the future; framework for discussing data valuation and
longevity of data products from lake observatories; and use cases for edge
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
