9309678 Schwartz The objective of this proposal are to advance the electronic
and optoelectronic properties of Si1-xGex devices grown by low temperature vapor
deposition (LTCVD) and to extend the use of LTCVD to grow SiC on silicon. The
epitaxial reactor will be constructed to grow high-purity silicon-based
heterojunctions with layer resolutions of 10nm or less. The electronic and
optoelectronic characteristic of the Si1-xGex material will be characterized
with an emphasis on the optoelectronic properties. By exploiting the bandgap
tunability of the Si1-xGex, infrared photodetectors will be fabricated and
tested. The introduction of SiC to silicon-based electronics will extend the use
of silicon-based heterjunction devices into more demanding environments. The
focus of the SiC research will be in the area of electronic devices. The merging
of Si1-xGex, SiC and silicon technologies is made possible through low
temperature chemical vapor deposition. ***
