This project addresses computational issues for finite groups that are
currently beyond the scope of current algorithms and existing technology. The
groups are represented either as permutation groups or as matrix groups defined
over finite fields. The questions of interest concern both group theoretic
structure and applications of the group theory. A central motivation for the
research is the construction of representations for matrix groups defined over
finite fields. This is an important part of a large-scale international effort
to develop a suite of computational tools for performing matrix group
computations. The tools to be developed have application to problems in the
physical sciences, engineering, and those parts of mathematics dealing with high
dimensional matrix representations of groups. A second research area
computational techniques for solving the minimum word problem for finite groups.
This problem arises in many contexts, such as routing in interconnection
networks and coding theory, and is known to be computationally difficult. The
research will lead to new algorithms which use group automorphisms to prune the
search tree of possible solutions. A third research area is the development of a
software architecture to bring parallel computers to bear on large scale
problems in computational group theory, such as the construction of very large
matrix and permutation representations. Such as integrated, interactive
environment will enable researchers to quickly overcome the initial learning
barrier for effective use of parallelism. They will be able to combine readily
available networks of workstations at their home site (such as student labs),
with an already familiar language, such as GAP or LISP.
