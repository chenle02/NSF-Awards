9452621 Mignone A Macintosh based computer classroom/lab is being developed for
use in the three course calculus sequence followed by a linear algebra course.
The interactive learning capabilities, along with the symbolic, numeric and
graphical capabilities of Mathematica is being used in the computer
classroom/lab in conjunction with structured tutoring provided by the
mathematics tutoring lab. The focus group is a group of African American
students guided toward the two sections of calculus which will be participating
in the first stages of the project.
