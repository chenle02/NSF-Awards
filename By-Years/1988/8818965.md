The goal of this proposal is to define the molecular mechanisms of this
posttranscriptional regulation as part of the long-term objective to understand
the control of organelle gene expression and the role of the nuclear genome in
this process. Dr. Gruissem will examine in detail the function of inverted
repeat (IR) sequences at the 3' end on plastid mRNAs. These IR sequences are
ubiquitous, their sequences is conserved between evolutionary divergent plants,
and they do not act as efficient transcription terminators, but homogeneous
plastid mRNA 3` ends are established by processing. Preliminary experiments
suggest that proteins bind to the 3` IR sequences, and their abundance changes
during plant development are correlated with differential mRNA accumulation.
This RNA: protein interaction is of interest, because it may delinaeate a novel
regulatory mechanism in the control of plastid gene expression. This work should
provide new results to help fill the gap that currently exists in our
understanding of posttranslational regulatory mechanisms. Additionally the
studies may potentially lead to new insights into the role of the nuclear genome
in the control of organelle expression.
