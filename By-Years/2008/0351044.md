Teleconnection patterns such as the Pacific/North American and North Atlantic
Oscillation play an important role in climate variability. Contrary to the
research that focused on the monthly and seasonal averaged characteristics, the
dynamical properties of these patterns will be studied on the two-week time-
scale which underlies their cycles of growth and decay. The various
teleconnection patterns will be examined to find out if their dynamics can be
unified into a single coherent framework. Using reanalysis data and a numerical
model, the life cycle of teleconnection patterns will be studied using the
hypothesis of wave breaking. The grant will also address the question of the
relation of the North Atlantic Oscillation to the annular mode, how the North
Atlantic Oscillation influences the stratospheric jet, and what dynamical
processes determine the lower tropospheric temperature anomalies associated with
the teleconnections if the oscillation is driven by wave breaking
aloft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has the potential to improve weather
and climate predictions, which would have great benefit for societal activities.
A graduate student will be educated and trained under this grant.
