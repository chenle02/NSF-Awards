Our brains help us to adapt quickly to variable and unpredictable circumstances.
However, the neural processes that allow for this flexibility remain poorly
understood. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is a part of the brain
that appears to be critically important for multiple aspects of our thinking,
such as attention, learning, flexibility, and even creativity, but the specific
contribution it makes to these processes is unclear. This proposal seeks to
understand how dACC gives rise to flexible processing. Dr. Ben Hayden,
University of Rochester, will perform three experiments using single-neuron
recordings in dACC of rhesus macaques performing three novel decision-making
tasks. He hypothesizes that dACC computes and transmits control signals that
drive behavioral switching, learning, and maintaining the decisions that have
been made. These complex cognitive functions are at the root of the ability to
learn and to make good decisions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The anterior cingulate
cortex (ACC) is a region implicated in several psychiatric problems that are
debilitating both to patient standard-of-life and to worldwide medical
expenditure and economic productivity. Notably, these include long-term
depression, anxiety disorder, OCD, schizophrenia amongst many others. Therefore,
progress in understanding the computations performed by the ACC to control our
behavior is essential. This work will highlight not only underlying neural
mechanisms but also effective strategies for promoting such abilities, therefore
potentially impacting individual function within the society. Finally, the
researchers will participate in the big data effort by making the data available
to support other coordinated NSF efforts that aim to make use of real data in
the teaching of STEM related courses and to enable participation in discovery
science by those who would otherwise have no access to such data.
