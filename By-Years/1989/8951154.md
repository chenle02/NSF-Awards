In this project, students are introduced to modern separations by a series of
experiments starting in general chemistry courses and continuing through all of
the chemistry laboratory courses. In addition, students are exposed to computer
controlled instrumentation and data acquisition. The equipment consists of an
HPLC system, including a computer controlled diode array spectrometer as the
detector, and two student gas chromatographs and recorder. The experiments are
designed to give the students repeated exposure to separation techniques at
different degrees of complexity as they progress through the chemistry program.
In addition, experiments involving fast kinetics and simultaneous analysis of
mixtures are possible with the equipment. Both types of experiments give the
students experience with computer controlled data acquisition and processing.
The institution is overmatching the NSF grant by 180%
