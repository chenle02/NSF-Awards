This proposal involves compression techniques for voice or image data. Over the
past year Fastman has developed a new algorithm, the Adaptive Wavelet Transform,
which produces high-ratio data compression while maintaining the quality of the
original data. The goal of this SBIR project is to prove the feasibility of the
algorithm for real-time data compression of speech and image data.
