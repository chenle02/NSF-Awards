The long-term goal is to understand the molecular mechanism of quinone reduction
by photosynthetic reaction centers. The focus of the work in this area is to
define the unique role played by bound bicarbonate anions in plastoquinone
reduction and protonation by photosystem II of plants and cyanobacteria. Use of
site- directed and site-selected mutants of cyanobacteria has established the
involvement of specific amino acids of two separate photosystem II reaction
center proteins, D1 and D2, in the binding and functioning of bicarbonate. Using
the powerful combination of molecular biology and advanced biophysical
techniques, the experimental work proposed here has two specific goals.
Additional site-directed mutants of D1 and D2 in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and
D1 mutants in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii will be constructed. These will be used
to identify the amino acid ligands and structural requirements for bicarbonate
binding and resolve the unique role of bicarbonate in the protonation of
plastoquinone (i.e., QB- and/or QB2-) and define the identity and role of amino
acids involved in this function.
