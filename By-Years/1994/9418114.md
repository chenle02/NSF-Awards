Abstract This award supports a study of the technical feasibility of collecting
and analyzing broad-band teleseismic data from the Antarctic continental
interior using portable seismometers. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet overlies a
region of the Antarctic continent which may be in extension. However, very
little is actually known about the seismic structure of the crust and upper
mantle. The deployment of portable broad-band seismometers for passive
teleseismic studies may offer the most effective means of acquiring data on the
deep structure of this continent. Data collected with broad-band PASSCAL
seismometers deployed as an augmentation to the ICEQUAKE network in central West
Antarctica represents useful records with several well defined teleseismic
events (about 10-20 events) that were recorded over a period of five weeks. The
data are of sufficient quality to allow the estimation of fundamental mode
dispersion curves down to periods as low as 50 seconds, and the analysis of body
phases for boundary interactions and travel time anomalies. This should provide
first-order constraints on the shear velocity structure of the crust and upper
mantle down to a depth of approximately 200 km. Additionally, the data contain
sufficient information to develop ambient noise models for ice sheets.
Consequently, if successful, this work will lead to important guidance for the
technical design elements necessary for developing an important experimental
resource for seismic studies that may lead to significant advances in
understanding the Antarctic continent.
