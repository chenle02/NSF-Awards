The principal investigator will study non-adaptive differential systems. Non-
adaptive differential systems are stochastic (random) differential equations
whose solutions are not adapted to the driving noise, either because the
coefficients of the equation anticipate the noise or because boundary conditions
are imposed at the final time. The investigator will continue to study such
systems by using a new stochastic calculus developed by Nualart and Pardoux for
stochastic integral with anticipating integrands. One aspect of the research
involves collaboration with E. Pardoux. They will investigate Markov field
properties and filtering for stochastic bilinear equations with boundary
conditions.
