This small liberal arts college for women with a strong tradition of training
women in the sciences is reintroducing a course in Inorganic Chemistry and
requiring it for the Chemistry major. The course, as it is being offered, is
open to students of sophomore standing or higher. The instruments necessary for
an undergraduate course in Inorganic Chemistry, a fast-scan UV/Vis
Spectrophotometer, an Atomic Absorption Spectrometer, and a Magnetic
Susceptibility Balance, were chosen due to the ease of obtaining and
interpreting data, and the ability of these instruments to examine both gross
physical properties and molecular and atomic properties. The experiments being
performed with these instruments reinforce or substantiate the concepts
introduced in the classroom, rather than simply giving the student "experience"
doing a particular manipulation or using the particular instrument. For most
experiments the students are working independently in obtaining certain data,
but then, as a class, share and evaluate the data in discovering and developing
patterns. By allowing sophomores to take this course they are hoping to give
more students the opportunity to pursue advanced studies in inorganic chemistry.
