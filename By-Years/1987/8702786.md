Activated carbon adsorption is an established treatment technology for waters
and wastewaters contaminated by organic compounds, the adsorptive behavior of
which are affected by organic substances naturally present in water which are
not classified as contaminants. The proposed research will extend the
application of a recently developed micro-scale experimental system coupled to a
proven predictive adsorption model to waters containing potentially hazardous
organic substances in the presence of other dissolved organic matter. Results
will be used to correlate surrogate parameters of dissolved organic matter to
the adsorption of the target organic contaminants and to incorporate this
knowledge into engineering design of adsorption processes used in water and
wastewater treatment.
