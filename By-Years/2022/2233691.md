The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to transform current eye care by providing a
novel tool for ocular fluid biopsies. The fluid in the eye is isolated from the
rest of the body by a blood-ocular barrier, so obtaining blood work does not
help for diagnosing most ocular problems. Testing of ocular fluid has been shown
to decrease rates of blindness in cases of ocular infections. However, this
procedure is under-utilized due to the flaws with the current method for
collecting fluid. Because of this, ocular infections can be misdiagnosed and
undertreated, which can lead to increased rates of vision loss. Additionally,
ocular fluid is an untapped reservoir for emerging biomarkers which has created
an unmet need for better tools to collect this fluid. This project will result
in a new product that can be used to collect ocular fluid for analyses that will
guide treatment of some of the most common sight-threatening conditions
including macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetes. This technology will
open a new frontier in ocular diagnosis and improve vision outcomes for
patients. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase II project is focused on fabricating a new medical device for ocular fluid
biopsies. This project will create an instrument that is specifically designed
to collect of fluid from the front of the eye. The research will include
optimization of the needle to decrease the force of entry. This new tool will
enhance the surgeonâ€™s control during the procedure and decrease risk of injury.
This research will also investigate the fluid dynamics of collection with the
integration of a microfluidic chamber and specialized collection system that is
designed to handle small fluid volumes. A significant limitation of the current
procedure is that the fluid volumes collected are small and the current method
leads to fluid loss and inaccurate results. Additional development will evaluate
advanced engineering features to connect the device for drug delivery. The
expected outcome of this research is an innovative surgical tool that will
enable ophthalmologists to perform ocular fluid biopsies more reliably and
achieve better results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
