This is a request for partial support for the travel of a U.S. delegation to the
Assembly and Administrative Council of the International Federation for Medical
and Biological Engineering (IFMBE). The Council will meet in conjunction with
the 16th International Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering, to be
held in Kyoto, Japan, on July 7-12, 1991. The U.S. will be represented by a
delegation selected by the American Institute for Medical and Biological
Engineering. This Institute is a fledgling organization with the goal of
unifying bioengineering. Support for the delegation is important for aiding the
Institute to become a major unifying force in bioengineering, and to maintain
and enhance the leadership position the U.S. now enjoys in this rapidly growing
field.
