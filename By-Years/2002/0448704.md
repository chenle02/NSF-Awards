The proposal aims to advance statistical theory for random&lt;br/&gt;processes
that exhibit features like long-range dependence and&lt;br/&gt;nonlinearities,
and to educate both statisticians and others&lt;br/&gt;scientists in this new
exciting area. Compared to the&lt;br/&gt;well-developed theory under the
independence assumption, it is&lt;br/&gt;considerably more challenging to
establish a limit theory for&lt;br/&gt;processes with such features. The
Principal Investigator proposes&lt;br/&gt;a powerful martingale based method and
studies spectral&lt;br/&gt;estimation, empirical processes, nonparametric
estimation and&lt;br/&gt;other related asymptotic problems for such
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Processes with long-range dependence and
nonlinearities occur in&lt;br/&gt;various fields, including computer networks,
communication,&lt;br/&gt;finance, geology, hydrology, econometrics and
atmospheric science&lt;br/&gt;among others. Applications of the research results
developed in&lt;br/&gt;the proposal would help test and justify claims made by
scientists&lt;br/&gt;in such fields. In particular, the PI develops
statistical&lt;br/&gt;methodology to identify trends in temperature and ozone
sequences&lt;br/&gt;and provides statistical reasoning for meteorologists'
claims on&lt;br/&gt;climate change patterns.&lt;br/&gt;
