This proposal requests funds to assemble instrumentation for the Center for
Photochemistry and Photobiology devoted to x-ray crystallography, magnetic
resonance spectroscopy, and dynamic studies of photochemical reaction centers
from bacteria, cyanobacteria, algae, and plants. Modern molecular genetic
methods will be available for the production of mutant proteins to explore the
relationship between structure and function in the centers as well as to study
the assembly of the centers in chloroplasts. Major facilities will be created
for x-ray diffraction data collection and for magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
