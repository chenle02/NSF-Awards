This proposal is to explore a connection between the type-A affine
&lt;br/&gt;Weyl group and symmetric functions called k-Schur functions. The
&lt;br/&gt;k-Schur functions arose in a study of the Macdonald polynomial basis,
&lt;br/&gt;a basis for the symmetric function space that plays an important role
&lt;br/&gt;in geometry, representation theory, and physics. As the k-Schur
&lt;br/&gt;functions were investigated more deeply, it came to light that these
&lt;br/&gt;functions may not only offer an approach to difficult problems in the
&lt;br/&gt;theory of Macdonald polynomials, but also provide a fundamental
&lt;br/&gt;basis for a subspace of the symmetric space. A wealth of beautiful
&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial conjectures that extend and refine classical ideas in
&lt;br/&gt;symmetric function theory came out of the study of k-Schur
functions.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to work on these conjectures and to
further investigate&lt;br/&gt;the k-Schur functions. For example, recent work
with the k-Schur&lt;br/&gt;functions suggests a connection between the Macdonald
polynomials and&lt;br/&gt;the affine symmetric group.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics is a vast area of mathematics
loosely described as &lt;br/&gt;the study of counting collections of objects
that satisfy specified &lt;br/&gt;criteria. As such, combinatorics plays an
integral role in &lt;br/&gt;the development of many fields, and combinatorial
methods are employed &lt;br/&gt;by scientists ranging from biologists to
theoretical physicists.&lt;br/&gt;The PI seeks to understand a natural
refinement for the beautiful &lt;br/&gt;combinatorics that arises in the theory
of symmetric functions - &lt;br/&gt;a classical part of mathematics with a wide
variety of applications in &lt;br/&gt;fields including physics, engineering, and
computer science.
