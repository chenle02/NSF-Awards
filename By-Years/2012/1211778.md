This award will support an observational study of novae, which are eruptive
phenomena on stars that are the recipients of mass transfer in close binary
systems. The main goal will be to obtain radio imaging observations soon after
outburst. As part of this effort, the team will focus on understanding how
thermonuclear runaway proceeds, the ejection mechanism for the nova envelope,
and the processes that shape the nova remnants.

The project will include considerable involvement of the amateur astronomical
community in the identification of promising novae for detailed study.
