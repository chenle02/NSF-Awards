9725693 Kellogg Key Central and South American (CASA) GPS stations will be
reoccupied to analyze on-going convergent margin deformation. The three major
goals of this project are: 1) To monitor the strain accumulation preceding the
predicted large subduction zone thrust earthquake in the Ecuador trench. The
proposed measurements together with 3-dimensional elastic half space models will
map the rates of elastic strain locking and relate these to the rupture zones
for the 1906, 1942, 1958, and 1979 earthquakes, testing models for the mechanics
of subduction zone earthquakes. 2) Resurvey the network in northern Colombia to
study the kinematics and mechanics of an active arc - continent collision zone.
3) Reoccupy sites in the South Caribbean deformed belt to study deformation in
an accretionary prism to determine the location of the current Caribbean-South
American plate boundary. This study is jointly funded by a large group of
international agencies. ***
