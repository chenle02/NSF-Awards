This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the areas
of chemistry and chemical engineering. For a three- year period beginning April
1989, eight (8) undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks engaged in
research in the chemical sciences, under the direction of various members of the
faculty in both the Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Departments. The unique
feature of this REU site activity is that it brings together Chemistry students
and Chemical Engineering students in projects which are jointly monitored by
Chemistry and Chemical Engineering faculty.
