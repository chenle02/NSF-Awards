This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project combines high-
brightness semiconductor diode laser arrays and novel brightness-conserving
optics in a hundred-watt to kilowatt laser machining system. The performance of
such a system is expected to approximate that of conventional carbon dioxide and
YAG-based systems but at a fraction of the cost, size, and power. Laser
machining is a rapidly expanding in industrial materials processing, but the
size, cost, and efficiency of present systems limit their use. By combining
recent order-of-magnitude improvements in diode laser brightness with novel
beam-combining concepts, a low-cost architecture could be scaled for various
laser cutting, welding, and selective surface treatment applications. The
proposed laser machining system is expected to reduce the cost of laser
machining and will therefore expand its role throughout the U.S. automotive,
aerospace, and metalworking industries. This technology will enhance U.S.
competitiveness across the manufacturing sector.
