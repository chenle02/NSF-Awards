Galaxies are the birthplace of stars and planets, and act as cosmic signposts
for the invisible dark matter. The shapes and colors of galaxies provide
important insight into how and when galaxies formed their stars and merged to
become larger galaxies. Dr. Lotz and team will devise innovative software tools
to measure the structures of thousands of nearby galaxies, and compare the
distribution of shapes of today's galaxies to distant ones observed as they were
~10 billion years ago. By tracking the metamorphosis of galaxy shapes over
cosmic time, and by comparing with simulations of galaxy evolution, the project
will illuminate the physical processes governing the evolution of galaxies like
our own Milky Way. The tools developed by this project will help to fully
exploit future astronomy surveys with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and
James Webb Space Telescope. Besides its scientific significance, the project
will support the training of a postdoctoral fellow, and the education of a
graduate student and a Baltimore-city high school student. The broader public
will be engaged through a related citizen science project to study galaxy
images. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stellar and gaseous structures of galaxies
provide direct insight into their most recent assembly events, as well as longer
timescale internal secular processes, both of which drive galaxy star-formation
and quenching. However, the existing coarse structural classifications fail to
capture the complex assembly processes responsible for the morphological
transformation of galaxies over the past 10 billion years. Building upon working
currently being done for redshifts 0.5&lt;z&lt;3, this project will develop new
non-parametric, quantitative measures of galaxy structure, identifying galaxy
mergers and classifying galaxy morphology, and apply this approach to nearby
galaxies in the Pan-STARRS Optical Galaxy Survey. This low-redshift baseline
will be compared to high-redshift observations by the Hubble Space Telescope to
track the emergence of spheroidal galaxies and the frequency of different types
of galaxy mergers over time. In concert with this observational analysis, the
investigators will statistically compare cosmological hydrodynamical simulations
from Illustris to the distribution and evolution of morphologies of observed
galaxies at redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;3; this will provide physical insights into the
measured structural quantities and distributions, and place constraints on the
viable modes for galaxy assembly and evolution.
