The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project will make a significant impact on science and
technology, national emission reduction efforts, and the energy security of the
United States. The team aims to advance science by developing a low-cost and
low-emission method to produce hydrogen from hydrogen sulfide, a common waste
product found throughout the energy supply chain. This technology will help to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution and contribute to improving
public health in communities near industrial sites that adopt this technology.
From a commercial perspective, the project has the potential to lower costs and
carbon emissions of energy products made in the United States, such as hydrogen
production in oil refineries. Implementing this technology would provide
refineries with an onsite, low-emission source of hydrogen from waste streams,
reducing costs and emissions. Ultimately, this innovation will enhance the
energy security of the United States by enabling domestically produced, low-
emission hydrogen energy.

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop a
chemical cycle that generates hydrogen from hydrogen sulfide. This effort
represents an alternative hydrogen production technology tailored to large,
cost-sensitive firms. Despite the significant need to decarbonize current
hydrogen production, market adoption of low-emission technologies has stalled
because their cost precludes use in commodity chemicals. This project aims to
break this trend by using hydrogen sulfide, an abundant low-value waste stream,
as a feedstock for a chemical cycle that generates hydrogen gas without
significant greenhouse gas emissions. The project will have several technically
challenging objectives including optimizing the process to deal with orders of
magnitude higher hydrogen sulfide concentrations mixed with several highly
reactive and corrosive impurities and researching and developing product
separations from complex process mixtures. Additionally, the project will screen
materials and catalysts and prepare the process for integration into the complex
structure of a modern chemical processing facility. While already validated for
other markets, the experimental and modeling tasks will test the performance of
the technology on refinery waste streams and prepare for larger-scale,
industrial site demonstrations. It is anticipated that the completion of this
project will lead directly into a refinery site demonstration plant.
