This project involves investigations of the seismic response of a model of the
six-story steel structure which was tested by the psuedo-dynamic method of
applying forces to the building at the Building Research Institute Laboratory at
Tsukuba, Japan. This phase of the program is obtaining data on the response of
the steel model from various earthquake accelerograms applied to the Berkeley
shaking table. The steel model currently being tested on the shaking table is a
three-tenths scale model of the six-story, concentrically braced building.
Following the completion of this series of experiments, the model will be
revised to represent the eccentrically braced frame building which was also
tested in Japan. When all the experimental data have been obtained, correlation
studies will be made with the full-scale building data to compare results by the
two methods of experimentation, to determine scale factor relationships and to
verify and/or modify analytical procedures and construction practices.
