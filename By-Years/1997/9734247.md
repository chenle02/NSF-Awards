With the anticipated ability to build chips containing one billion transistors,
a larger amount of memory and functionality may be available on a single chip.
One challenge is how to manage and configure all these resources for optimal
performance and power dissipation. This research explores the problem of
determining optimal use of all available resources on chip on an application by
application basis. Where reconfigurable logic is available for use (either on
chip or off) synthesis tools can be used to determine optimal hardware/software
partitioning of the application as well as to architecturally synthesize the
hardware portions onto reconfigurable logic. Tools are being developed to
produce high-performance power-conscious designs. Various applications are being
explored to determine the effectiveness of these tools. The applications are
being run on reconfigurable computing platforms designed at Brown's computer
engineering laboratory. The topics of low-power and high-performance computer
design, and advanced computer architecture design are being introduced to the
curriculum via new courses and the modification of existing ones. Approaches to
advising and mentoring students at levels from pre-college to graduate are being
developed. Emphasis is in mentoring and outreach services to young women just
entering a career in science or engineering.
