9352346 Brown This project is designed to upgrade a laboratory which serves
sophomore-level courses in psychology and psychobiology. The equipment includes
microcomputers, networking equipment, and multimedia capacity for advanced
research and laboratory training. With the improvements provided by this
project, students can replicate and extend recent research, develop skills in
the use of advanced computer technology, develop skills for cooperative work in
groups, and improve their understanding of statistics. It is also expected that
students will develop a better understanding of basic scientific principles, and
improve their scientific writing. ***
