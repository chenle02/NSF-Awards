This action funds Sarah Morton of University of Connecticut to conduct a
research project, entitled "Using seismic techniques to understand soil behavior
in response to strong ground motions," during the summer of 2012 at National
Center for Research in Earthquake Engineering in Taipei, Taiwan. The host
scientist is Professor Kuo-Liang Wen.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to further enhance the basis
and understanding of geophysical techniques and their application to seismic
hazard analysis and soil mechanics.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
