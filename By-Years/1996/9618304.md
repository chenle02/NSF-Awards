The first generation of quantitative equilibrium models of international
fluctuations document that the standard complete markets models with
fluctuations driven solely by technology have a hard time accounting for many of
the observed features of the data. This research consists of three projects
which model specific fractions and assesses their ability to better account for
the observations. The first project introduces sticky prices and monopolists who
price to market internationally. It is motivated by the early observations that
nominal and real exchange rates are both highly volatile compared to domestic
price indices and by the more recent work which documents large deviations from
the law of one price for traded goods. The model blends together the real
business cycle models in which all fluctuations are driven by real technology
shocks with the sticky price literature in which fluctuations are driven
primarily by monetary shocks. The second project introduces a friction in
international credit markets. The standard model has perfect international
credit markets, and it generates cross country correlations of consumption that
are much higher than in the data and cross correlations of output that are much
lower than in the data together. This project introduces a friction in
international credit markets and assess if it can quantitatively help to account
for these anomalies. The third project is motivated by the evidence that the
movements in nominal exchange rates have been much larger than the movements in
inflation, money growth, or interest rate differentials across countries. This
project analyses the potential for a plausibly parameterized version of a model
with segmented asset markets to produce these features of the data. The model is
based on the idea that agents differ in the level of their participation in
asset markets.
