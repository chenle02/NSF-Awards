Computing-others(35)

A five-course interdisciplinary Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science
concentration, Technology Entrepreneurship, is being developed. The
concentration integrates the theories of computing, finance, health informatics,
and entrepreneurship with their applications through the aid of industry support
into a new discipline that focuses on knowledge transfer between the
disciplinary domains and between theory and practice. Students are acquiring the
knowledge, skills, and expertise needed to design and develop innovative and
imitative algorithms for competitive products, processes, or services in a
technology oriented financial and health informatics related company or
department. Additionally, student graduates are acquiring knowledge and skills
in entrepreneurship and its application as well as the application of computing
science and information systems theories and practices to other disciplines and
industries such as business and healthcare.

Algorithmic solutions to real world financial and healthcare problems that could
lead to beneficial discoveries are being developed by students working in teams
and assisted by industry experts.

The project is allowing the expansion of computing application capabilities
across disciplinary boundaries and the infusion of computing in finance and
health sciences to help extend computing instructional focus. A unique blending
of experiential learning and academic learning in an interdisciplinary computing
setting using teamwork, cooperative education, and industry experts in the roles
of mentors, project evaluators, and guest speakers represent the environment for
the program.
