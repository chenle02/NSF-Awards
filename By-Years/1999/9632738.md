9632738 SOLOW As part of the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studies,
Phase 2 program this project will conduct a retrospective analysis of data
previously collected from a moored array along the southern side of Georges
Bank. The goal of the project is to study interannual to interdecadal variations
in the relative abundance or composition of zooplankton communities on and
around Georges Bank. Three factors are hypothesized to control zooplankton
communities: 1) size-selective predation, 2) mesoscale advective or "wash-out"
events, and 3) vertical mixing. Tests of these hypotheses will be considered
during the three phases of this study. First, a newly developed statistical
technique will be applied to MARMAP zooplankton data to identify trends in
zooplankton composition on Georges Bank and the three adjacent regions, i.e.,
the Gulf of Maine, Southern New England, and the Mid-Atlantic Bight. Next,
historical data on predator abundance, sea surface temperature, and wind/thermal
stratification will be used to develop predictions about the expected effects on
regional zooplankton compositions. Third, the analyses will be extended beyond
the MARMAP period (1977- 1987), by incorporating data both from earlier surveys
(Atlantis, 1939-1941; Continuous Plankton Recorder, 1962-1989) and from Phase I
GLOBEC (1994-1996). ***
