This MRI award to North Dakota State University is for acquisition of a high-
resolution 200 KV remotely operable analytical transmission electron microscope,
along with sample preparation capabilities. This instrumentation will support
state-of-the-art imaging, spectroscopic analysis, research, training, class-room
education, and outreach, in advanced microscopy. High-resolution TEM imaging and
spectroscopic analysis will support existing research programs in design of
biomaterials and nanocomposites, engineered polymers and polymer matrix
composites, and other research areas in the fields of materials and
nanotechnology. The requested instrumentation will also be a much-needed
resource for NDSU's new PhD program in Materials and Nanotechnology, providing
necessary experimental capabilities. This instrumentation will also provide
hands-on experience that will broaden opportunities for research, training, and
outreach for faculty, graduate students, undergraduates from NDSU and other area
colleges, and K-12 teachers and students. This instrumentation will also provide
advanced microscopy services to industries in the region. The requested
instrumentation will also strengthen NDSU participation in outreach and
educational activities with native American colleges in the region.
