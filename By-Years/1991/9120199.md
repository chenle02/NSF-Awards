Theoretical research will be done on the structures, excitations and thermal
properties of physically adsorbed layers on solid surfaces. Modulated monolayer
lattices have domain wall structures with many similarities to structures which
occur in the surface reconstructions of metals and semiconductors. The domain
wall excitations also have analogies to these systems. Results are used for
statistical mechanical evaluation of thermal properties. These phenomena depend
on, and provide measures of, the energetic topography of the substrate surface.
The substrates treated include: the (111) faces of platinum, palladium, copper,
and silver, and the (001) face of magnesium oxide. The primary adsorbates are
the inert gas series, helium to xenon. Combinations are chosen which display
features present also in more complex systems; quantitative atomic scale models
are available or can be constructed by extension of previous work. The work has
ties to experiments with x-ray diffraction, thermal neutron scattering, thermal
helium scattering, ellipsometry, and microbalances. Theoretical study of the
methods for analysing inelastic neutron scattering from commensurate monolayers
will also be undertaken. The techniques in this work include lattice dynamical
analysis, continuum elasticity theory and variational quantum mechanics. %%%
