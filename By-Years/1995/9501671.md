activities for North Dakota State University to determine an industrially
relevant research agenda and industry's potential to support such an agenda in
the coatings industry. The planning meeting will explore the potential for North
Dakota State University to become a partner in Eastern Michigan University's
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Coatings. The North Dakota
State University researchers are recognized experts in coatings and well
qualified to undertake this project. This award has been coordinated with Dr.
Norm Bikalis MPS/DMR and Dr. Robert Powell of the Chemical and Thermal Systems
Division in engineering. The Program Manager recommends North Dakota State
University be awarded $10,000 for one year.
