the Brooks Range, provides access to unique artic terrestrial and freshwater
ecosystems. Since 1975 it has provided logistic scientific support for
scientists from throughout the United States. Passage of the Artic Research and

will provide funds for upgrading of living facilities, purchase of scientific
equipment, upgrading of the electrical system to meet code, soudproofing of the
generators and purchasing of snowmachines.
