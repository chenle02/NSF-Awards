&lt;br/&gt;Scholarships are being awarded to holders of bachelors degrees in
STEM subjects to enter a dual Masters of Science and Doctorate of Science
Education degree program. The scholars are academically talented and financially
needy individuals planning a career teaching science in a community college.
Starting with the second year of the project, three successive cohorts of five
students each receiving annual scholarships of $10,000 during the three years
that they are studying science and earning a Masters of Science degree while
enrolled in the five year long dual degree program. To enable the third cohort
to receive three years of scholarship support and graduate with a Masters degree
during the five year project period, the university has committed to providing
scholarships to the third cohort during their third year of study. All scholars
receive financial support from the university's Mallinson Institute of Science
Education as they serve in a mentored teaching role during the fourth and fifth
years of the program while also conducting their doctoral dissertation research.
