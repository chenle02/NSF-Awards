The objective of this research is to develop a method to enable architects and
their consultants to predict the acoustical qualities of buildings during the
design process in an economical and timely manner. The results of an earlier NSF
Research Initiation grant have shown that ultrasonic scaling of impulse response
tests made in small-size study models has the potential to provide a wide range
of acoustical information to designers. There are 4 main components to the
research: 1. An extensive series of acoustical measurements will be gathered in
many types of existing buildings with varying acoustical qualities to serve as a
design data base. 2. The objective measurements made in the buildings will be
related to the subjective assessment of the acoustical quality of the buildings
by listeners to determine which measures are useful as acoustical design
criteria. 3. Acoustical models of the buildings studies in item 1. above will be
tested to further understand which criteria provide the most useful design
information in the modeling process. 4. A multichannel data acquisition and
digital analysis system (Acoustical Research Instrumentation for Architectural
Spaces (ARIAS)) will be developed to enable detailed acoustical analysis at
multiple locations in occupied or unoccupied buildings and in acoustical models
ranging in scale from 1:10 to 1:100 to be performed.
