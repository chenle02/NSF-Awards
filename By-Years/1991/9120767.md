In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Michael Topp of the University of Pennsylvania will use picosecond-
resolution polarization spectroscopy in cooled jet expansions to study structure
and dynamics in molecular clusters. Using the time-domain rotational coherence
technique, Topp proposes to obtain structural information on clusters in order
to understand energy transfer and related processes in these organized systems.
Such information is difficult to obtain by more normal frequency resolved
spectroscopic techniques. The aromatic molecule perylene will be used in much of
the structural work, involving the complexation of different alkanes and various
polar and unsaturated molecules with large electrostatic interactions. %%% The
nucleation of small clusters of atoms or molecules by large organic molecules
which absorb and emit visible light presents valuable opportunities to study
intermolecular forces of the kind found on a larger scale in solutions and in
the adsorption of molecules onto extended surfaces. Lasers can be used to excite
these large organic molecules, and then the time evolution of the associated
cluster can be followed on very fast time scales in order to be able to
determine the structure and dynamics of these microscopic organized systems.
Such information can have a bearing on many fields, including catalysis and the
chemistry of life processes.
