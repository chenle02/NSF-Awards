This project is exploring a new approach to instruction-level parallelism. The
new approach, disjoint eager execution, uses branch prediction and eager
execution to maximize the number of instructions that can be usefully executed
on each cycle. The set of branch paths forms a tree, in which each node
represents a branch instruction and each edge represents the code executed
between branches. In disjoint eager execution, all of the most likely code
segments are candidates for speculative execution, rather than only those code
segments on the most likely path. In other words, a subtree of instructions is
executed that may not be a simple chain. Preliminary research has included some
simulations on benchmarks suggesting that speedup of about 30 is possible. This
project includes more comprehensive simulations to determine the benefits, along
with architectural studies to determine the effects of parallelism on cycle time
of the machine.
