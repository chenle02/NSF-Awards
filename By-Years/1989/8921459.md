The OCEANUS operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the WECOMA,
operated by Oregon State University and the ENDEAVOR, operated by the University
of Rhode Island are NSF-owned, sister ships devoted to the support of ocean
science research. These 177 foot research vessels, built in the mid 1970s, are
approaching the time for their mid-life refits. This project will conduct an
engineering design study of the feasibility and costs of operating improvements
and science support upgrades in preparation for mid-life refits of these three
ships. The project is under the direction of Joseph L.Coburn, Jr., Marine
Operations Manager, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The naval
architectural firm of Rodney E. Lay &amp; Associates of Jacksonville, Florida
will conduct the study.
