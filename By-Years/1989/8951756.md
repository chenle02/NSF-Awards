This project improves the quality work done by undergraduates in a required
laboratory in the measurement of electronic, magnetic and optical properties of
ceramic materials. Acquisition of an impedance analyzer and a temperature
controlled chamber allows students to collect data for a variety of electronic
materials over a wide range of frequencies and temperatures. A group of
instruments to measure the DC resistivity of materials from insulators to
superconductors, including a versatile constant current source, a digital
multimeter and a scanner were also purchased. Funding support for these items
represent the finalization of experiments that have been developed using
borrowed research equipment and the refinement of educational experiments by
instructors with over fifteen years experience in the teaching of materials
characterization. The permanent experimental systems also allow the completion
of a long desired laboratory manual. This award is being matched by an equal
amount from the principal investigator's institution.
