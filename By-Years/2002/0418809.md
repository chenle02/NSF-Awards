0418809&lt;br/&gt;Feng&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports continued
funding of a technical position in the stable isotope laboratory, Department of
Earth Sciences, Dartmouth College. The technical position has been supported for
the last three years under a previous Phase I grant (EAR-0111403). This grant
will support Dr. Anthony Faiia over the next two years to: operate and maintain
two stable isotope ratio mass spectrometers and related peripherals, an ICP-OES,
IC, and TOC analyzer; develop new analytical protocols; train students in lab
analytical techniques; and oversee safety and waste disposal procedures. Dr.
Faiia also continues to conduct research with collaborators outside of the
department and teaches a field course. Dartmouth College has committed to full
support of this position through 2008 after this two year funding period.
Research supported by this facility includes stable isotopic and elemental
tracer studies of seasonal snowpack influenced recharge of groundwater and
fluvial systems, general watershed hydrogeochemistry, studies of carbon cycling
in soils, and dendrochronological and stable isotopic studies of Holocene
paleoclimate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
