9310003 Dickinson Most of the movements that animals make can occur under a
variety of internal external conditions, thus placing different demands on the
animal. Consequently, the central pattern generators that are responsible for
producing the motor outputs to drive rhythmic movements are highly flexible.
Under the influence of different neuromodulators, these pattern generators can
produce a variety of different outputs. In addition, many movements require the
coordination of large numbers of muscle groups, including ones that may also be
involved in controlling other behaviors. This is particularly clear in the case
of functionally related rhythmic patterns, such as those that drive the four
parts of the foregut in crustaceans. Recent research on this system has shown
that the four pattern generators, which were once thought to be four discrete
entities, interact in a variety of ways. The research to be undertaken will
examine a number of aspects of the neuromodulation of the rhythmic motor systems
in the stomatogastric nervous system, focusing on the interactions of the
pattern generators. In addition, this research will address another issue that
has arisen recently, namely the effects of modulation on spatially distributed
pattern generating networks.***
