9353910 Geer The American Meteorological Society, in cooperation with the U.S.
National Weather Service/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, will
conduct an undergraduate faculty enhancement project for instructors of
introductory courses containing significant weather content. The purposes of the
program are to: (a) provide renewal and updating learning experiences that focus
on dramatic recent advances in operational meteorology and atmospheric research,
(b) make available pre-existing and participant-developed laboratory and other
student learning materials that emphasize the processes by which the workings of
the atmosphere are sensed, analyzed, and predicted on a real-time basis, and (c)
acquaint participants with the instructional and research potential (faculty and
student) of the meteorological data and information bases available via a
variety of data stream sources. Central to the program will be the offering of a
two-week workshop held twice (in Summers 1994 and 1995) to a total of 48
participants at the National Weather Service Training Center, Kansas City, MO.
