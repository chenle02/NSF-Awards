The proposed research program is a continuation of studies into the basic charge
transport and storage characteristics in multidielectric microstructures. In
this proposed program of one year, the PI will examine the electron and hole
components of the tunneling current which crosses the Si-SiO2 boundary with a
unique 'dual-channel' SONOS microstructure. (polySilicon gate blocking Oxide-
Silicon Nitride- tunnel Oxide-Silicon)
