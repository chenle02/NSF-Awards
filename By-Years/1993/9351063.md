Automatic Identification technologies include bar codes, magnetic stripe, radio
frequency identification, voice data identification, machine vision, optical
character recognition, magnetic ink recognition and smart card technologies.
They all have the same purpose - to rapidly and accurately capture data. The
current BSIE curriculum does not have any exposure to the technology of
Automatic Identification that is rapidly changing the practice of industrial
engineering. The equipment to be acquired under this project will address this
deficiency in the laboratory experience of undergraduate students in the
Industrial Engineering department. The equipment to be purchased in carrying out
this project will represent the variety of Automatic Identification tools. In
addition to learning the capabilities of each type of identification technique,
students will be required to demonstrate the usefulness of these techniques
within well defined projects.
