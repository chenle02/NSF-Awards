ABSTRACT This dissertation research project is a cross-linguistic and cross-
model study comparing the natural gestural-visual languages of the deaf and the
oral languages within which these sign languages are found for the purpose of
investigating questions about linguistic universals and human cognition in
general, as well as language contact phenomena, particularly with respect to
rhetorical practices and communicative conventions. The research focuses on
American Sign Language (ASL) and American English, Brazilian Cities Sign
Language (BCSL), a language of the urban Brazilian deaf, and Brazilian
Portuguese, and Urubu-Kaapor Sign Language (UKSL) and Kaapor, these latter two
being languages of an American Indian group native to the Amazonian region of
Brazil. Comparative work of this kind can provide crucial evidence for
distinguishing constraints imposed by the communication medium, both vocal-
auditory and gestural-visual, from linguistic universals. Scholars have tended
to approach the analysis of empirical linguistic data as if there were a binary
division between universality and relativity, without taking into account the
impact of communicative modality. The inclusion of sign language data is crucial
not only to the universality versus relativity debate but also to the
understanding of human cognition to the extent that such understanding relies on
linguistic evidence.
