This project will investigate the effect of elevated temperature on release of
symbiotic animals (zooxanthellae) by tropical corals and sea anemones. In the
field, studies will attempt to determine which taxa are susceptible to elevated
temperature-induced release, the time-temperature parameters which evoke
release, and the mode of release. In the laboratory, studies will investigate
the cellular mechanism by which elevated temperature evokes release of
zooxanthellae by host cells, using the sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella and
selected reef corals. Immunofluorescence and pharmacological agents will be used
to characterize levels of free intracellular calcium, integrity of selected
skeletal proteins in the cell, and synthesis of calcium-dependent adhesion
proteins. Individual host cells will be obtained by maceration. Cells subjected
to elevated temperature will be compared to controls at ambient temperature. The
results will indicate in ecological terms the potential impact of elevated
temperature on coral reef anthozoans, and in cellular terms how elevated
temperature causes cell detachment, loss of zooxanthellae and destabilizaiton of
marine symbioses which dominate tropical coral reefs.
