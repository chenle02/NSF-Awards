INT 9724925 Weerts This U.S.-Czech research project between Hendrik Weerts of
Michigan State University and Vladislav Simak of the Institute of Physics,
Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, will feature joint efforts to
understand the fundamental structure of matter using proton and antiproton
colliding beams at the Tevtron accelerator, Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory (Fermilab). In addition to optimization of neutron shielding, this
cooperative work will feature upgrades of the central tracking detectors and
muon detectors. Czech production of components for a high voltage distribution
system for the muon detector and their contributions to analysis of the multijet
interactions and triple boson vertex should substantially strengthen the total
"D 0" effort at Fermilab. Overall, results are expected to contribute to the
infrastructure for understanding the fundamental dynamics of electroweak
interactions in elementary particle physics. This U.S.-Czech cooperation
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents
and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
