ABSTRACT

Combinatorics is a growing and important area of mathematics. The states of
North Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee have recently
seen an influx of research strength in combinatorics and adjacent areas. In
particular, a remarkably large number of tenure-track combinatorialists
(including several from underrepresented groups) currently work at various
colleges and universities within about 5-6 hours drive of the Research Triangle
area of North Carolina. The proposal supports one-day conferences, on
combinatorial themes, to be held in the Triangle once a semester, with the aim
of fostering regular contact between researchers in the geographic region. Each
conference will bring four outstanding mathematicians from around the country to
give talks about some of the most significant cutting-edge developments in
combinatorics.

The focus of combinatorics is the structure of discrete (as opposed to
continuous) sets of objects. Combinatorics is critical to many areas of
mathematics, and plays a key role in computational, scientific, and engineering
applications. The proposed conferences will: enhance the national infrastructure
for research and education by creating and strengthening a regional network of
interacting researchers; facilitate the dissemination of cutting-edge research
ideas, methods and results among researchers in a large portion of the
Southeastern U.S.; promote the teaching and training of graduate students and
postdoctoral scholars by exposing them to the perspectives of leading
researchers; support the development of young faculty at various schools and
help them build local support and research networks; and broaden participation
of underrepresented groups, particularly women.
