9704653 McCollom The P.I. will conduct a series of laboratory experiments to
examine the reactivity of organic compounds under hydrothermal conditions.
Results of these experiments will be used to develop thermodynamic models that
link inorganic, organic and biological processes during hydrothermal alteration.
Experiments will be conducted on the role of sulfur compounds in organic
transformations and the reactivities or organosulfur compounds under
hydrothermal conditions. These experiments will complement current research on
the hydrothermal reactivity of other classes of organic compounds and
hydrothermal alteration of organic-rich sediments.
