Funds are sought to purchase the sound analysis programs known as SIGNAL and
REAL TIME SPECTROGRAPH (RTS) and the event recording program known as OBSERVER
and the computer equipment on which they can be run. The purpose of this
purchase is to help reinstitute courses successfully taught during the 1970's
which offered undergraduates the opportunity to collect original observations on
familiar bird species. These courses taught the fundamental precepts of science
as organized curiosity of focussing on the student's own perception of the birds
and on research problems of the students' own devising. Students came to
understand scientific methods not as arbitrary constraints as a way of
accomplishing goals of their own devising. Since bird song is the most salient
feature of bird behavior, these courses will be made much more effective if
students have access to a simple, convenient device for the display and analysis
of bird song. Such a device will enable many students, particularly the more
inventive and persistent, to develop and test hypotheses concerning the
relationship of bird song to other behaviors that they are observing.
