AST-9731180 Abstract A near-infrared multi-object spectrometer (The FLoridA
Multi- object INfrared Grism Observational Spectrometer or FLAMINGOS) covering
the spectral range from 0.9 micrometers to 2.5 micrometers is to be constructed.
The instrument will be fully cryogenic allowing background limited operation
through the entire H and K bands. The instrument is a combination of a wide-
field near-IR imager and multi-object spectrometer which will accept any input
beam slower than f/6. It will have a Lyot stop wheel carrying a number of stops.
