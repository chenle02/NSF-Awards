This work intends to increase the efficiency of ethanol production via
fermentation using thermophilic microbes to operate at higher temperatures in
conjunction with in situ gas stripping. It is suggested that this technology
will alleviate ethanol toxicity to the micro-organisms in the substrate
resulting in higher productivity and reduced cost of product concentrate and
purification. The proposed investigation has the following three specific tasks:
(1) To obtain quantitative information pertaining to the gas stripping in
ethanol fermentation (GSEF). (2) To investigate the stability criteria of the
steady state multiplicity in the GSEF system analytically and experimentally.
(3) To develop a theory of the gas stripping in bioprocess systems for design
and scale-up, so that improvements of the productivity can be achieved.
