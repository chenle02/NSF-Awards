An infrared spectrometer and liquid chromatographs (LC) are being used to
upgrade analytical, organic and health science chemistry courses at Dekalb. The
LC is used in conjunction with a variety of classical wert methods to strengthen
the analytic chemistry course. The Organic chemistry course is strengthened by
the use of the IR as well as the LC. Experiments include analysis of the
products of the conversion of cyclohexanol to cyclohexene and the conversion of
salicycilic acid to aspirin and methyl salicylate. The LC and IR are combined in
the separation and isolation of the compounds in various tablets such as
Excedrin. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of
funds.
