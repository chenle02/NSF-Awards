This proposal deals with chemically bonded ceramics (CBCs), materials formed by
direct chemical reaction a temperatures below 500oC. Research involves solution
chemistry and speciation, as well as processing and characterization of new
ceramic materials to determine their mechanical and dielectric properties.
Molecular species in reacting phosphate and silicate solutions are being
identified by Raman and other spectroscopic techniques. Specific projects will
emphasize use of organic templates in formation of CBC materials. Precipitation
reactions leading to fibrous and composite materials will also be investigated.
Research on the structure and composition of the solid/solution interface will
make use of fractal structures to interpret tails in Raman spectra, and the use
of strongly absorbing substrates to enhance spectroscopic ellipsometry
measurements.
