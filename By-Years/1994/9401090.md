In the past several years investigation of geometric and language-theoretic
aspects of finitely presented groups has engendered a remarkable interplay
between group theory, geometry, and the theory of automata and formal languages.
The introduction of automatic groups and the classification of groups with
context free word problem are significant developments in this area. The
contribution of formal languages to this interplay is that they afford new ways
of looking at the geometry of Cayley diagrams of groups. The goal of this
proposal is to develop this approach further by characterizing other classes of
groups in terms of the language-theoretic properties. This project is in the
general area of group theory and the computer-aided computational aspects of
this field. There is a growing interest in using computers to answer theoretical
questions in algebra and conversely, algebra is quite useful for the development
of algorithms. This research will not only aid in the development of computer
programs in group theory but will influence the development of computer programs
in other areas.
