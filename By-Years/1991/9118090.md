This research is to use tomographic inversion to determine 3- dimensional
velocity in the crust and upper mantle beneath Alaska. The area of highest
seismic station density, and therefore resolution, is in the south-central
portion of the state which has a high seismic activity. The main source of data
will be from local earthquakes recorded by the Alaska Earthquake Information
Center which is a joint effort of the University of Alaska and the U.S.
Geological Survey. Teleseismic arrival times will also be used for large scale
inversions that emphasize deeper structure that includes the subducting oceanic
plate. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program.
