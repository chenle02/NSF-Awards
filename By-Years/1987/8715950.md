This award will enable groups of investigators under the direction of Professor
Jerry P. Becker of Southern Illinois University and Professor Tatsuro Miwa of
the University of Tsukuba, Japan to collaborate in a cross-cultural study of
students' strategies and difficulties in mathematical problem solving.
Researchers will videotape students in both countries as they solve selected
non-routine problems with paper and pencil in an interview context. The
students' written work, interviewer/observer observations, and evaluation of the
videotapes will provide data for defining the degree of use and the roles of
pattern-finding and modelling in mathematical problem solving. The research to
be carried out follows directly from the U.S.-Japan Seminar on Mathematical
Problem Solving held in July 1986 under the auspices of the U.S.-Japan
Cooperative Science Program. Clarifying strategies and difficulties of students
in problem solving is indispensable in order to improve the teaching of
mathematical problem solving. The cross-cultural nature of this research will be
important in helping to define the various factors which influence a students'
strategies and difficulties.
