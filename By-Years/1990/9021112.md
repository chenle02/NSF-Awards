This project supports the dissertation research of a student in cultural
anthropology. The project is to examine the social conditions under which
evangelical Protestantism and "progressive" Catholicism have flourished to
challenge the long- dominant folk Catholicism in a proletarianizing peasant
village in Mexico. The project will assemble longitudinal data on socio-
economic class, organizational resources, doctrines, political practices and
beliefs of members of the three religious groups. Methods include survey,
genealogical interviewing, detailed life histories, interviews with government
and religious leaders, archival research and participant observation. The main
question to be dealt with is the relation of religious affiliation to changes in
socio-economic class position. This research is important because religious
change is a striking fact of life in Latin America, and increased understanding
of the conditions and consequences of this change will help us deal with the
changing sectors of these societies.
