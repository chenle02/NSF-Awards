Ten undergraduate students are engaged in a 10-week period of research at the
university. The program parallels an existing university program--Summer
Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF). The new project provides for more
participation by students from other institutions. The students come from local
and national areas; selections consider minorities and women. A broad spectrum
of research opportunities exist.
