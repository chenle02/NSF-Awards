HRD-0429913&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American Society for Cell Biology has
developed mentoring activities and strategies designed to create diversity in
research and learning environments, and to provide professional and career
development opportunities for women and minority students and teachers. It is a
scientific organization in which the exemplary work of several long-term
committees has permeated the entire organization. The organization has a strong
committee structure and uses networking as a mentoring strategy and to increase
information sharing with underserved populations. ASCB has a long history of
achievement in increasing the participation of women and minorities in research
and study in science disciplines. Women, minorities and other participants in
the mentoring programs have greater access to and interaction with well-known
scientists, including Nobel Laureates, and national policy leaders. Overall,
this organization is making a significant difference in the discipline by
extending its commitment to pursue diversity issues to other dimensions of the
organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The submitted nomination package is in
support of a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and
Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM) to recognize outstanding mentoring efforts or
programs that enhance the participation of historically underrepresented groups
in science, mathematics, and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
