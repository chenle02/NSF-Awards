9353549 Gonzalez University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez Campus proposes to
continue its Center of Excellence in Tropical and Caribbean Research. The Center
was established (1) to develop areas of research that will contribute to solve
the pipeline problem of minority access to careers in science, and (2) to
exploit and study the unique tropical advantages available within Puerto Rico.
The objectives of the Center are: (1) to develop a research infrastructure to
promote collaboration between the strongest research groups on the island, (2)
to compete for funding from major funding sources, (3) to strengthen the
instrumentation base, (4) to promote collaborations with other research entities
on a national and international level, (5) to provide collaborative research
opportunities for researchers at 4-year institutions, (6) to provide educational
improvement activities for faculty and graduate, undergraduate and precollege
students, and (7) to contribute to the strengthening of a competitive research
environment in Puerto Rico. The Center of Excellence for Tropical and Caribbean
Research was established in 1988 with funding from the National Science
Foundation under the Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) Program. The
Center of Excellence meets the goals of the MRCE Program especially (1) to
increase the minority presence in science and engineering by making substantial
resources available to upgrade the research capabilities of strong and
productive minority institutions, (2) to allow the institution to continue use
of research as a tool to increase the effectiveness of related science and
engineering activities for minority groups in its region, (3) to provide
opportunities for minority faculty and students at the University of Puerto
Rico, and (4) to engage in meritorious research that leads to publications in
refereed journals. ***
