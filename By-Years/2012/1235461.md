The research objective of this award is to develop methods for the feedback
control of the coupled engine and catalyst systems in automotive vehicles
seeking to further reduce fuel consumption and harmful emissions. The engine and
the exhaust catalyst sub-systems are highly interdependent based on coupled
operational constraints and interconnected dynamics with conflicting objectives.
The research will employ first-principles and phenomenological models of the
engine and the catalyst to address the air and fuel mixture regulation that
dictates fuel consumption and exhaust emissions from the after-treatment system.
Challenges to overcome are the varying transport delays in the feedback loop,
the varying sampling rates due to event-based sampling and the highly nonlinear
and varying dynamic of the coupled engine/catalyst system. A linear parameter
varying feedback control methodology that is appropriately modified to address
the above challenges will be investigated to regulate the engine air/fuel
mixture based on post-catalyst sensor measurements for varying engine speed and
load conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is successful, the results of this
research would lead to improvements in fuel economy and reduced harmful
emissions from automotive vehicles. Proposed cooperation with the automotive
industry will seek to transfer research results to technology that could impact
future production vehicles. The proposed modeling and control methodology could
benefit the other coupled complex systems, such as, material processing and
energy conversion systems. The project has an educational goal of promoting
inter-disciplinary teaching and research on electro-mechanical and chemical
reaction systems and producing engineers that are diverse and pursue the benefit
of society.
