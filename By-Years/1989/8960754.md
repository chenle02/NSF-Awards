Research into the area of automatically parallelizing programs for distributed
memory architectures is inadequate. Current models of parallelization ignore the
problems associated with the distribution of data structures and the
corresponding communication overhead. The objective of this research is to
establish mechanisms for the automatic distribution of FORTRAN programs for a
loosely-coupled, message passing parallel processing system. The Parallel
Fortran AnalyZER (PFAZER) will use three novel approaches to reduce the overhead
associated with interprocessor communication. First, PFAZER will utilize an
enhanced cost model which will more accurately estimate the overhead of
interprocessor commuication in a distributed processing environment. Second,
PFAZER will utilize a software cache management system which will provide access
to ambiguously referenced variables. Last, PFAZER will incorporate a new data
dependence decision algorithm which will reduce the number of data dependencies
in the source program which will further reduce interprocessor communication.
