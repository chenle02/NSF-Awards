This fellowship will support an investigation into the causes and consequences
of interpopulation diversification of behavior in the threespine stickleback
fish in northwestern North America. The Fellow will use a combination of
laboratory rearing and laboratory and field experimentation and observation to
provide unique insight into the evolution of behavioral phenotypes in natural
populations of a vertebrate. The Fellow has also detailed a plan for developing
a curriculum in evolutionary biology for undergraduates, graduate students, and
primary and secondary school teachers.
