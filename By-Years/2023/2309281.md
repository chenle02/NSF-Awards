Proteolysis, the breakdown of proteins or peptides to amino acids, is critical
for removal of unwanted or damaged proteins and regulation of cellular processes
such as metabolism. This Gordon Research Conference (GRC) will bring together
the rapidly growing international community of researchers focused on plant
proteolysis including a highly diverse group of graduate students, postdoctoral
scientists and new investigators. The interactive, informal environment will
lead to development of new contacts and collaborations. The anticipated long-
term impact of this conference is therefore to accelerate plant proteolysis
research across disciplines and its impact of agriculture and biotechnology, and
catalyze collaboration between researchers in the public and private sectors.

Proteases recognize their substrates in various ways, including post-
translational modifications and conditional degrons that allow the cell to
rapidly reshape the proteome and acclimate to adverse conditions. This new
Gordon Research Conference (GRC) will bring together researchers studying all
aspects of plant proteolysis and covering a wide range of disciplines, including
cell and molecular biology, chemistry and biochemistry, imaging, physics and
systems biology, to generate new research avenues and provide solutions to some
of societyâ€™s challenges. Added value will be provided by invited researchers
from non-plant fields to accelerate tool development and application, and to
understand evolutionary diversification of proteolytic systems. The new GRC
meeting will help grow the community of scientists in dispersed communities that
share common goals in unraveling the role of proteolysis in plant biology. NSF
support for this GRC will attract and broaden participation of early career
scientists, including URMs into this emerging field, and thereby strengthening
and accelerating future discoveries in Plant Proteolysis.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
