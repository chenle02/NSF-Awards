9632617 Demarest This project represents a university/industry partnership to
establish an applications-directed research laboratory in the lightwave
technology field. Contingent on an anticipated $1M award (75% of which is for
the purchase of state-of-the-art lightwave test equipment) by U.S. Sprint, a
Kansas-based corporation, four faculty researchers and eight graduate students
will initiate research in lightwave areas consistent with the researchers'
experience and interests. These include coherent modulation and detection,
soliton generation and transmission, and optical emission spectrometry for
plasma etching monitoring and diagnosis. The establishment of the laboratory
will yield benefits to both students at The University of Kansas and to Kansas
industry. It will be the only lightwave laboratory in Kansas and will be the
focus for higher education and human resource development in lightwave
technologies.
