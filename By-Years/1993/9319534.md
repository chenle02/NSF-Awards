Myelin is a multi-layered membrane that wraps around the axons of neurons,
insulates them, and allows nerve conduction to take place efficiently. One
protein of myelin, termed Po, behaves as an adhesion molecule and is believed to
hold the layers of myelin together. In addition, Po protein has been shown to
enhance the growth of a growing axon. We are investigating what precise regions
of the Po molecule are involved in interaction with the neuron to promote axonal
growth. Furthermore, we are beginning to characterize the component on the
neuron with which Po interacts to bring about this effect. Finally, for the Po
protein to function correctly it must reach its correct cellular destination. We
are characterizing how the cell that makes myelin, the Schwann, directs Po to
its final destination.
