9407256 Kunzelman The objective of this Planning Grant is to allow for further
study to characterize the biomechanical behavior of the mitral valve in health,
disease, and after surgical repair. To meet this objective, the mechanical
behavior of the tissue must be first determined based on its microstructure, and
then integrated into a finite element model of the valve. The specific aims are
to: (1) determine whether there is a difference between the biaxial mechanical
properties of normal and diseased mitral valve tissue, (2) determine whether
there is a difference in microstructurreal makeup between normal and diseased
mitral valve tissue, (3) determine whether there is a relationship between
biaxial mechanical properties and microstructural makeup, and (4) analyze the
effect of diseased tissue properties on overall mitral valve function. ***
