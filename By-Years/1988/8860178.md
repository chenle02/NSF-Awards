In this research the principal investigator will explore the extent to which
cognitive biases have an impact on knowledge engineering, particularly in the
area of uncertainty handling. He will demonstrate that not only are experts
subject to biases while solving problems, but that they are also likely to
exhibit "reporting biases" when they articulate the knowledge they use to solve
problems. In addition, knowledge engineers will be shown to be subject to the
same biases as domain experts and therefore unlikely to catch biases in
knowledge elicited from domain experts. An Automated Knowledge Elicitation Tool
(AKET) will be developed and used in the research effort.
