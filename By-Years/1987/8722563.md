This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides support for
challenge travel grants for approximately 40 U.S. academic participants in the
XII IUPAC Symposium on Photochemistry, to be held in Bologna, Italy, 17-22 July,
1988. Challenge grants will provide a portion of the participants' travel
expenses. Participants will be expected to obtain the balance of their travel
and conference expenses from other sources. This funding will assure the
attendance of a significant number of U.S. photochemists at the Symposium and
will, thus, contribute importantly to furthering communication and collaboration
across international boundaries in a major subdiscipline of chemistry.
