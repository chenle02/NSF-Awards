This project is creating a new Biomedical Engineering Technology degree program.
The state-of-the-art biomedical equipment allows students to participate in the
study of the maintenance, calibration, and safety checking of biomedical
equipment. Completion of laboratory experiments, answering medical terminology
questions, and solving troubleshooting problems prepares students fro the
clinical biomedical engineering internship at a local health facility or
hospital as part of this project. This project is being matched at an amount
equal to the award.
