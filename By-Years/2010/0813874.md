Herrenkohl (U. Washington) &lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Research: Building capacity
and collaboration at the intersection of the Learning Sciences and Informal
Science Education&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the University of Washington propose a
conference, conference proceedings, and book that will build capacity and new
collaborations at the intersection of the learning sciences and informal science
education. These activities continue to expand on the outcomes of several recent
conferences, publications, and projects related to research on the learning
sciences and their application to varieties of educational settings. Fifty
participants in this initiative will include both emerging and established
researchers and practitioners, as well as international professionals.
