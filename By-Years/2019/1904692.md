This award provides travel support for US-based researchers participating in the
symposium "Hodge theory, Moduli and Arithmetic" to be held May 13-17, 2019 at
the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences at the University of British
Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. The broad themes of the conference are Hodge
theory and its applications to questions in moduli theory and the arithmetic of
period integrals. The funds will support ten early career researchers.

The specific research goal of the symposium is to survey recent developments in
the field with emphasis on the following topics: (1) compactifications of the
images of the period maps; (2) height pairings, regulators and the irrationality
of special values of higher normal functions; and (3) construction of
hyperkaehler manifolds and the study of their involutions. More information
about the conference is available at: https://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
