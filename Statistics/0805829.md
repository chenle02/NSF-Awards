The investigators propose to develop new innovative approaches for modeling and
analyzing carcinogenesis models involving multiple pathways with each pathway
being a stochastic multi-stage model and with intermediate initiated cells
subjecting to stochastic proliferation and differentiation and genetic and
epigenetic changes. The investigators also propose to apply these new innovative
approaches to develop carcinogenesis models for some human cancers for assessing
risk factors and to develop predictive procedures for these cancers.
Specifically, the investigators will apply the methods to develop new stochastic
models for human liver cancer because of the importance of this cancer and
because of the availability of some precious data for this type of cancer. The
investigators note that the similar methododology can be applied to other human
cancers as well, which will be investigators' future research.

The investigators study some cancer models for human liver cancer based on the
existing data already collected. Such models are considered to follow EPA
proposed cancer guidelines (Federal Register 51(85), 33992-34003, 1996). The use
of such model is possible because sufficient biological information on the human
liver cancer is available. The end result of this research should be useful for
cancer prevention and cancer control. The investigators believe that this along
with other advances will render many current practices in experimental biology,
including many steps of drug development, unnecessary. This will in turn make
the drug development process become more productive and efficient.
