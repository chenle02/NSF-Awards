This award will support participant travel costs to the international workshop,
"Thought to Speech" Step 3: Science, Engineering and Clinical Planning of an
Intracortical Communication System for Adults with Cerebral Palsy (BrainGate-
CP)", being held at the Hilton Chicago O`Hare Airport on November 28, 2018. The
summit will bring together people with expertise not only in brain-computer
interfaces (BCI's) and cerebral palsy, but also in neuroscience, language
development and related fields to promote a comprehensive understanding of the
challenges involved in creating BCI's for this purpose. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
"thought-to-speech" BCI would provide an opportunity for people born without the
ability to speak as well as relieve the burden of acquired speech impairments
from those who acquire such a condition later in life. The intelligence of
people with motor and communication impairments is routinely underestimated. A
thought-to-speech or rapid-text BCI would circumvent this fallacious
assumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
