This award provides support for a meeting, held at Brown University in the
spring of 2008, on current topics in analysis of nonlinear wave equations, with
presentations by leading researchers in the areas of harmonic analysis
techniques, dispersive waves, stability analysis, kinetic theory, free
boundaries and relativistic equations. The conference encourages and financially
supports participation by students and members of groups underrepresented in the
mathematical sciences.

Nonlinear waves occur in many fundamental many physical problems and have a
central place in modern theory of nonlinear partial differential equations.
Historically the foci of research for nonlinear wave equations have been in
classical field theories, such as in the study of nonlinear Klein-Gordon
equations, the Maxwell- Dirac system, and the Yang-Mills system. More recently
there have been explosive and exciting developments in many new directions for
nonlinear wave equations, including for dispersive equations such as KdV and
nonlinear Schrödinger equations, for kinetic equations including Boltzmann and
Vlasov models, in fluid dynamics including the incompressible Euler equations,
for free boundary problems, for the Einstein field equations in general
relativity, and for geometric wave equations such as wave maps and Schrödinger
maps. This conference brings together leading experts in a great variety of
different areas of research in nonlinear wave equations, to stimulate
interactions between their different points of view that should be of mutual
benefit to all the participants. In particular, the conference will be
especially beneficial to young researchers, including graduate students and
postdocs.
