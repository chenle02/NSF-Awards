The steroidogenic enzymes involved in androgen biosynthesis are present and
functional in the Leydig cells of rat testes throughout all stages of sexual
maturation. However, the type of testicular androgens secreted changes
significantly with age. Sexual maturation marks the shift from testicular
secretion of 5a-reduced androgens to testosterone, the principal androgen that
is secreted in the adult. Although the biosynthetic pathway from progesterone to
testosterone has been well established, the maturational change in testosterone
accumulation is not fully understood. The activity of steroid 5a-reductase, an
enzyme that converts 3-oxo-4-ene steroids to 5a-reduced metabolites, plays a key
role in determining the final steroid products secreted by the testis. The
steroid products secreted may have widely differing peripheral and testicular
biological actions. In the proposed research, a polyclonal antibody to rat liver
5a-reductase will be make and used to localize the protein in the testis by
immunofluorescence. The levels of steroid 5a-reductase protein and mRNA in the
testis will be determined throughout puberty in the rat. Results of these
studies will provide a basis for studying the regulation of this enzyme and the
mechanisms involved in qualitative changes in steroid biosynthesis.
