This award provides NSF funding over 36 months to acquire basic biogeochemistry
instrumentation for carbon and nutrient cycling studies at Rice. A CHNSO solid
sample analyzer and a total carbon analyzer will be purchased and installed.
Several research projects would utilize the requested instrument suite: soil
black carbon (BC) pool stability and pryolysis analysis; natural aluminosilicate
nanoparticles impacts on carbon and nutrient cycling in soils; paleoclimate and
paleo-productivity indicators in Holocene Antarctic Peninsula (AP) sediments
using carbon and nutrient distributions; and ecosystem nutrient cycling studies
to evalute Gulf coast restoration and mitigation efforts. The equipment, in
addition to the PIs' research projects, will support an upper level
environmental chemistry lab course. Funds are requested to sponsor two high
school teachers for a summer program through the Rice Center for Biological and
Environmental Nanotechnology. The instrumentation will be primarily administered
by the PI but will placed under the Rice Shared Equipment Authority which will
ensure long-term maintenance. Use statistics will be compiled and evaluated for
setting reasonable cost-recovery user fees after the first year of the award.
