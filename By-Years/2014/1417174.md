The grant provides travel support for graduate students to attend the 2014 Logic
and Computational Complexity Workshop that will take place in Vienna, Austria,
on July 12-13, 2014, which is taking place during the Vienna Summer of Logic
event, which encompasses the Federated Logic Conferences (FLoC'2014). Funding
for student travel has significant broader impacts because of the opportunity it
gives the students to become part of their research community, discuss their
research with others, listen to and meet with leaders in the field. This
workshop is international and provides an international dimension, because
students will have experiences relevant to becoming part of a global workforce.
