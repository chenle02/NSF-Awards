This award supports the purchase of a fluorescence spectrometer interfaced with
a fluorescence microscope. The system will be capable of nanosecond resolution.
Planned uses include measurements of fluorescence with high sensitivity and over
wide ranges of excitation and emission wavelengths; spectral and lifetime
measurements on long-lived luminescence; and time-resolved measurements of
fluorescence anisotropy of chemical and cellular samples. The spectrometer will
serve the research needs of nine users from a total of four University
departments, all of whom conduct research in NSF-supported areas. Research
projects that will take advantage of the instrument include studies of the
motion of water at biological interfaces, of the regulation of a microtubule
motor protein from Arabidopsis, of the organization of luteinizing hormone
receptors, and of molecular mechanisms controlling progesterone secretion. The
instrument will also be used to develop optical strategies for detecting weak
magnetic fields and for improvement of methods for measuring molecular rotation
in membranes. The shared use of the equipment will facilitate interaction and
collaboration between researchers in diverse fields, and will also promote
teaching, training and learning through use in specific undergraduate and
graduate courses. In addition, the researchers plan to incorporate the results
of instrument use into a variety of formal and informal activities that
disseminate information about modern science to various audiences.
