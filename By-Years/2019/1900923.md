The kinetic theory on rarefied particles have played an important role in the
understanding of problems in gas dynamics, plasma physics, and fluid equations.
In many physical situations (for example, plasma in tokamak fusion reactor), the
particles interact with boundaries and their interaction affects global dynamics
significantly. Singular behavior of particle distribution near the boundary is
major difficulty in both mathematical understanding and the experiment. This
project aims to develop new mathematical tools to handle these problems and
answer several fundamental questions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
project studies several important boundary problems arising in kinetic models
and fluid equations. In particular, the PI plans to study regularity property of
the Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system with boundary conditions. The equation is
nonlinear, nonlocal, and degenerated dissipative coupled with hyperbolic
equation (wave equation). Due to the characteristics boundary condition, the
solutions are singular in general. Successful investigations for the proposal
would mark a significant development in the PDE theory with singularity. Results
of the project are expected to improve modeling capabilities for a wide range of
problems of interest to other scientists and
engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
