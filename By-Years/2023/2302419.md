Traditionally, North American Indian Sign Language (NAISL), also known as Hand
Talk, was a vital inter- and intra-tribal language passed down through the
generations across North America. In recent times, however, the number of NAISL
signers has declined at an alarming rate. Without extensive and immediate
documentation, the remaining signers today are likely the last carriers of
tribal sign language knowledge. The creation of a NAISL video dictionary, made
possible by this award, represents a significant step towards preservation of
this rich cultural and linguistic resource for future generations. The NAISL
dictionary project represents an important cultural contribution to Native
Peoples as well as to fields of study such as American Indian studies,
linguistics, anthropology, Indigenous education, history, and Sign Language
studies. This project is a community-driven effort that gives tribes the tools
to study their own unique sign languages and bring them back into use in their
communities.

The NAISL dictionary contains video recordings of signs demonstrated by signers
from multiple tribal communities. Signs are categorized by tribal NAISL variety,
meaning, and linguistic identifiers including handshape, location, movement,
palm orientation and facial expression. Supplemental cultural and etymological
information is also given for each entry. In addition, signs are classified as
either public or private; private signs containing sensitive cultural
information are retained and managed by relevant tribal language programs, while
public signs are accessible to all. This project addresses the
underrepresentation of NAISL in language and culture preservation as well as in
scholarly research. Robust documentation and revitalization of NAISL is also
motivated by a recent upsurge of interest in using traditional sign languages in
Native communities. The video dictionary is shared with participating tribes and
available to the public for research purposes. It is also distributed to tribes
for use as educational material in language and culture. This award is made as
part of a funding partnership between the National Science Foundation and the
National Endowment for the Humanities for the NSF Dynamic Language
Infrastructure â€“ NEH Documenting Endangered Languages Program.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
