The objective of this research is to develop a methodology to analyze the effect
of geomagnetically induced on the cores of high voltage transformers. Three
dimensional finite element analysis will be used to develop such models.
Magnetic fields, stray flux patterns, and eddy currents within the core will be
predicted using this methodology.
