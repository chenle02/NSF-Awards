This award supports collaborative research between teams of US and Chinese
ecologists, geochemists, and palynologists on the study of sedimentary histories
of selected lacustrine ecosystems of the Yunnan Plateau in southwest China.
Cores collected from five Yunnan lakes will be studied to determine rates of
ecosystem response to natural and anthropogenic stresses. Measurements will be
made of changing rates of accumulation of aquatic and terrestrial, biological
and chemical fossils between isotopically dated levels in lake sediments. This
part of China is well known for its floristic similarity to the southeastern US.
It is also one of the world's oldest centers of intensive agriculture. Through
this cooperative project, it is hoped that our understanding of the
environmental consequences of agricultural, industrial, and urban development
will be improved.
