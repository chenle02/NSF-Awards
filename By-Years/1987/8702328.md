This Long-Term Ecological Research Project on Arctic tundra ecosystems has five
related sections: (1) baseline data collection, (2) experimental manipulations
of whole ecosystems from the "bottom up" (i.e., nutrients, light, and
temperature), (3) manipulations from the "top down" (grazers and predators), (4)
linkages of land, water, and the atmosphere through exchanges of elements, and
(5) regional extrapolations. Research in all five sections will involve
terrestrial ecosystems, lakes, and rivers. The major strengths of the research
include the ability to apply experimental techniques to whole ecosystems, both
terrestrial and aquatic, and the application of new methods using stable
isotopes. The relative simplicity of arctic ecosystems makes them particularly
good models for whole ecosystem research, and their location in a region of
climatic extremes makes them particularly important to include in the family of
Long Term Ecological Research projects. This research project comprises a true
interdisciplinary research team from several different academic and research
institutions. The team is headed and led by a very senior scientist of
international reputation whose personal performance record is remarkable. Based
upon the accumulated scientific productivity of the past one may expect
outstanding performance in the future by this formidable array of expertise. In
addition to coordination and collaboration among the principal scientists and
their institutions this project also requires close contact with several
federal, state and local agencies. These aspects of the organizational burden
are also well managed to the benefit of the project. Facilities at the parent
institution, the Marine Biological Laboratory, are excellent as are the adjunct
support laboratories of collaborating scientists. Field facilities provided
through the University of Alaska are more than adequate to the task. The
Ecosystem Studies Program recommends funding for the first year of this new,
five-year continuing award.
