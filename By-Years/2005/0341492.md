Interdisciplinary (99) This project is developing a set of teaching tools that
integrate engineering and technical business courses for use in an industrial
engineering curriculum. The Active Learning in a Virtual Enterprise (ALIVE)
System gives students a series of short intern-like projects in the "Virtual
Enterprise," a full-scale supply chain, integrated using information technology,
and producing an actual product - desk clocks. Laboratories, either physical or
virtual, are organized as business departments. The ALIVE System develops
requisite skills in systems engineering, information technology, and business,
and addresses visual, active, collaborative, experiential, deductive and global
learning styles. ALIVE System modules are also highly portable and configurable
to a variety of school environments, sizes, and disciplines. Evaluation plans
include extensive host and remote testing of the system and dissemination
through two focused symposiums and relevant conferences.
