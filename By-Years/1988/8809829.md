The objective of this project is to develop and integrate a decision analysis
tool based on with artificial intelligence methodology which will facilitate
optimal design at the initial concept stage. A methodology is planned which
facilitates the incorporation of multiattribute utility analysis, a decision
analysis tool, into other computer aids for the design of complex, engineered
systems at the most basic level. The goal is multiattribute utility analysis of
materials selection decisions in complex structural systems. The approach is to
divide the system into subsystems, each consisting of individual components
delineated on the basis of functional performance requirements. Multiattribute
utility functions are assessed for each subsystem, and used in the design of
each subsystem. A method for combining these utility functions to provide one
expression for the overall utility of the entire system is presented. The result
will be a tool with which to evaluate completed alternative designs and quantify
tradeoffs which provide direction to design modifications, and the development
of more efficient design concepts.
