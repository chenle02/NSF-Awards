The main goal of this research is to understand how an individual modulatory
neuron uses a peptide and a conventional transmitter to influence the activity
of a well-defined neural network. Although neural network activity in many
systems has been shown to be influenced by exogenously applied peptides, few
studies have detailed the effects of peptide-secreting neurons. The projects to
be performed focuses on the paired modulatory prolactin-containing neurons, two
homologous peptidergic neurons that modulate the activity of the pyloric
network, the best described neuronal ensemble which generates a rhythmic,
patterned activity, and is located in the stomatogastric nervous system of the
crab. This project combines biochemical and electrophysiological techniques to
address a related series of questions. This work is important because it uses a
model system to attack important cellular questions about neuronal circuits
which are similar in man.
