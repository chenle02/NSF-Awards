A systematic study will be performed on the structural optimization of GaAs-
based and InP-basedstrained resonant tunneling devices. The two additional
variables which result from using the strained layers, namely the lattice strain
and the band gap, will be considered in designing the structure. The I-V
characteristics and tunneling escape times will be calculated using available
theoretical methods such as, for example, the Airy function approach.
Theoretical results are expressed in terms of the barrier height & thickness and
well depth thickness. Based on the simulation results, device structures will be
grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition or by molecular beam epitaxy.
Tunneling diodes will be fabricated and characterized. Correlation studies will
be made of the device performance characteristics with the various theoretical
simulation results and the structural characteristics such as interface
roughness, lattice strain, interface mismatch, and layer thicknesses
compositions . Nondestructive structural characterization will be performed by
the x-ray rocking curve (XRC), photoluminescence (PL), and photoreflectance (PR)
techniques.
