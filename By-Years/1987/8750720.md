Instrumentation appropriate for use in a microscale organic laboratory has been
recently acquired by the Chemistry Department at Stetson University. This
includes toploading electronic balances for rapid and accurate weighing of
milligram quantities, an infrared spectrophotometer for identification of small
quantities, a recorder for a gas chromatograph to provide rapid analysis of
volatile samples, and a refractometer for rapid assay of liquid fractions.
Conversion of the laboratory to microscale increases student efficiency in
laboratory operation, permits more sophisticated laboratory reactions, increases
the number of experiments, increases the interest in and retention of
principles, markedly cuts the annual expense for chemicals and glassware, and
decreases laboratory air pollution and the amount of toxic chemical waste
disposal.
