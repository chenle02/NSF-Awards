The recent construction of radio millimeter wavelengths has permitted the
imaging of outflows from stars in advanced stages of stellar evolution in lines
of various molecules. This accomplishment permits the kinematics of these
outflows to be studied, leading to an understanding of how nonspherical
planetary nebulae form, as well as the chemical interactions between gas and
dust particles as a function of distance. The Principal Investigator (PI) will
use the "BIMA" radio array at Hat Creek, California and the new Arizona-German
millimeter-wave telescope on Mt. Graham to study these questions. These studies
are expected to lead to a better understanding of why about one half the
planetary nebulae around these stars are significantly nonspherical and to lead
to a better understanding of the chemistry of interstellar grains. The latter
question is of importance to the thermodynamic conditions of interstellar gas
and ultimately to the condensation of new generations of stars.//
