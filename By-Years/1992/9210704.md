The objective of this project is to develop techniques for searching for and
sharing software using wide-area networks. This will enable software reuse to go
beyond libraries; a program written for a single project may not be used
directly, but instead be used as a template for similar programs in other
projects. The principal investigator is conducting new research into indexing
and querying software databases. Indexing information must be generated
automatically, with no extra effort by the program creator. Initially he is
augmenting an existing CASE tool to generate such indexing information. Later
research will integrate other mechanisms for categorizing software. Another part
of the project is to develop a distributed query mechanism for widely
distributed, autonomous, software databases. This will incorporate features such
as automatically canceling queries which generate too many results. An interface
which helps user specify and refine queries is being designed. Although the
focus of this work is on sharing computer software, the techniques developed
could prove useful in sharing other information, such as data from scientific
experiments or limited interest (and therefore unpublished) studies.
