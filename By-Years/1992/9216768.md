This proposal presents a two-year research project to investigate the
functionality of devices based on single electron charging and quantum waveguide
phenomena. This is a collaborative program of work between the University of
Oregon and ETDL, Fort Monmouth. The objective of the proposed research is to
achieve specific devices characteristics by designing an array of gate
electrodes to control simultaneously the charge storage and transport properties
of the two-dimensional electron gas in a semiconductor heterostructure. The
dimensions and spacings of the electrodes will be sufficiently small that the
width of the undepleted regions in the electrons gas will be comparable to the
Fermi wavelength. In this manner we will realize interconnected quantum
waveguides and cavities. Following the results of the previous collaborative
award, we have identified two particular devices to study; a lateral resonant
tunneling diode that will act a coupler (switch) between two waveguides, and a
dynamic memory element. We will fabricate these devices using electron-beam
lithography, and characterize their transport properties from DC to above 1GHz
over the temperature range 77 - 0.05 Kelvin.
