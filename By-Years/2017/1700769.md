This project in the field of algebraic geometry concerns aspects of valuation
theory. Valuations appear naturally in many branches of mathematics. Spaces of
valuations, as a whole, capture important information, for example in connection
with the problem of resolution of singularities. There are many natural ways of
looking at valuations and packaging them into spaces, and each provides useful
tools for studying algebraic varieties. The focus of the proposed research is on
two valuation spaces: the space of arcs and the Berkovich analytification of an
algebraic variety. These spaces come equipped with interesting structure and can
be used to answer important mathematical questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nash
investigated the space of arcs in connection to singularities; the same space
serves as the underlying space in motivic integration, and has been applied to
study invariants of singularities in the minimal model program. Berkovich's non-
Archimedean geometry has been used in a variety of contexts, from p-adic
geometry to dynamics, geometric group theory, mirror symmetry, and tropical
geometry, and most recently in birational geometry. Many interesting questions
about the structure of these spaces remain open, and a better understanding of
their geometry will lead to new applications. One specific goal of this project
is to study the local rings on the arc space of a variety, a problem motivated
by Shokurov's semicontinuity conjecture on minimal log discrepancies and
therefore, indirectly, by the conjecture on termination of flips, one of the
missing steps in the minimal model program. Another objective proposes a new
point of view on motivic integration where Berkovich spaces are used in place of
arc spaces. The project also addresses some questions about links of isolated
singularities, their contact structure, and their CR structure. While these are
apparently unrelated questions, there is an underlying connection between the
contact structure of a link and valuation theory.
