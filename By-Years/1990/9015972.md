With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Rudolph A. Abramovitch will
study the synthesis and chemistry of five-membered heterocyclic nitrenium ions.
These species are highly reactive intermediates whose chemical reactivity is of
interest to physical organic chemists and to theoretical chemists. In addition
to their inherent theoretical interest, these species are of potential
importance as a new class of electrophilic primary aminating agents that are of
interest to synthetic organic chemists as well. Of particular interest is the
potential ability of these species to undergo isomerization to other cationic
systems. The generation and trapping of these heterocyclic sigma-cations by
nucleophiles will be studied via ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry in an
effort to obtain information concerning the operation of pi-to-sigma "electronic
isomerizations" in the nitrenium ions. Trapping experiments will also be
performed in solution with the same objective in mind. Detailed analysis of the
various reaction products thereby obtained is expected to afford insight into
the nature of the reactive intermediate(s) present in each case.
