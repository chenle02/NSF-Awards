Information about the species of the earth resides in a wide variety of
databases scattered over the earth. Four institutions that each support
environmental and species information across many taxa will do a feasibility
study on the development of software tools that will enable cross platform
querying and virtual integration of the data. The team will use common data
exchange standards to insure the broad utility of their developed software. The
consortium will develop this prototype infrastructure framework for retrieving
and disseminating comprehensive information on species of the world. This
prototype can then be extended to other species related data resources and may
form the basis for future development of a widely accepted standard for species
data exchange. All of the documents generated will be available on the
Species2000 web site.
