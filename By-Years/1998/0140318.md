The research is divided into two parts; 1) low dimensionality effects on
melting, and 2) stick-slip experments in 2-d crystals. The PI will search for a
possible intermediate hexatic state between liquid and solid and study the
response of 3d structure's to mechanical stress. The approach should be able to
yield direct measurements of exact individual particle dynamics and provide
answers to many fundamental questions.
