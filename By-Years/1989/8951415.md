A new laboratory course in Plant Cell and Molecular Biology will be developed,
and laboratories in the existing courses in Plant Physiology and Plant
Development will be modernized. The equipment to be purchased includes
electrophoresis modules, an inverted microscope, an upright microscope with
fluorescent light source, a laminar flow sterile transfer hood, a shaking water
bath with temperature control, a wavelength scanning spectrophotometer with
linked computer, growth chambers, and plant growth tables. The new course will
focus on the isolation, characterization, and analysis of plant proteins and
nucleic acid; techniques of cell transformation using Agrobacterium; culture
manipulations. This will give the department an up-to-date curriculum in modern
plant biology. The college will provide 50% matching funds.
