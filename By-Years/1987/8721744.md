Drs. John Moore and John Tossel from University of Maryland, and Dr. Judith
Giordan, an employee of Aluminum Company of America are supported by a grant
from The Physical Chemistry Program to study various aspects of the interaction
of low energy electrons with gas phase molecules. An improved understanding of
physical processes of this type has important commercial implications in the
plasma etching and plasma deposition industry. Moore and coworkers are studing
three separate aspects of electron molecule interactions. Electron Transmission
Spectroscopy (ETS) is being used to study the low lying unoccupied molecular
orbital energy levels (LUMO's) which are of fundamental importance in explaining
pi bonding and chemical reactivity. This research group has also recently
modified their basic ETS instrument to make measurements of total inelastic
cross sections for electron scattering. Measurements which have required many
painstaking hours to collect in other laboratories are now possible to obtain in
about 30 seconds using only a slight modification of the original instrument.
Inner Shell Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (ISEELS) is being used to study
the lowest lying unoccupied molecular orbitals of the molecular cation. ISEELS
involves the trapping of knocked-out inner shell electrons in the valence region
of the molecular energy levels. Moore and coworkers have found a definite and
chemically important correlation between the results of the ETS and ISEELS
spectra. New experiments are also being conducted in the area of free radical
reactions. Moore and coworkers have found that they can produce reasonably
intense molecular beams of neutral free radicals by dissociative electron
attachment followed by removal of the charged anionic fragmentation products.
They plan to study the reactions of the product free radicals with various
target gasses.
