9352631 McShane Based on the success of our students in learning electronics in
the course of their research projects, the introductory electronics program has
been revised to provide a similar contextual setting. Experience in a goal-
oriented project environment enables students both to learn more effectively and
to make significant research contributions much earlier than previously. From
the beginning of the course the students are involved with the type of modern
instruments they will use at various levels in the larger community: with their
fellow students in upper- division laboratories, with local industry, and at
several national laboratories and CERN. Two sets of equipment are utilized. The
first set is used for learning the basic fundamentals and building blocks of
electronic devices. In this category is a digital storage oscilloscope
controlled by a microcomputer. The computer also controls a multifunction I/O
board, and programs for analysis and simulation. The second set is used for
student projects. This category comprises specialized equipment in the areas of
communication, data acquisition, and control. Included here are microcontroller
modules joined to other and supervised over a microcomputer link. ***
