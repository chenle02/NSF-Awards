Each year billions of dollars of goods and services are acquired through
auctions. By analyzing data that are generated in these transactions, key
insights can be obtained on critical issues such as auction design. The data
also may be used to understand the competitive character of these markets and
bring information to bear on possible collusive behavior and market performance
as reflected in economic efficiency. "Structural" analysis of auctions
traditionally is based on game theoretic models that assume perfect rationality.
Yet, the findings from auction experiments are pervasive and consistent: The
behavior of auction participant deviates significantly from theory
prescriptions. The extent of deviation sharply contradicts the assumption of
perfect rationality that is so fundamental to structural analysis. The objective
of this proposal is to bridge the gap between experimental economics and
empirical auction modeling. We will explicitly allow bidders to deviate from the
theoretical solutions of an inherently oversimplified "benchmark" theory model.
Such deviations could be non-strategic (mistakes), or they may be strategic in
the sense that they reflect real-life factors that are not appropriately
captured by the benchmark model. Traditional bid functions, which assign a
single bid to a player's valuation, are replaced by a full probability
distribution for bids, conditional on valuations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposal develops operational numerical procedures for the analysis of bids
under this new class of "semi-structural" models and explains their statistical
properties. The analytical tools developed in this framework will be applied to
several real-life situations: (1) Auction data from timber sales in the
Northwest Pacific will be analyzed, with a specific focus on the identification
of possible collusive behavior. (2) Data related to school milk procurement in
Georgia will be analyzed, where issues of market efficiency may be highlighted.
(3) Internet auctions, where observed behavior sharply deviates from standard
theory prescriptions, will be used to demonstrate the explanatory power of the
techniques developed. These empirical studies are expected to provide critical
new insights in the operations of real-life auctions and result in suggestions
for corresponding adjustments in their design.&lt;br/&gt;
