This research will concentrate on the study of the vertical distribution of
zeros of L-functions and, in particular, to try to prove the existence of small
gaps between zeros of the Riemann zeta-function or of a Dirichlet L-function.
The research in this proposal concerns one the most venerable problems in number
theory, namely the study of the various L-functions of classical analytic number
theory. They encode various number theoretic facts. It turns out that their
zeros are fundamental to the solution of the number theory problems that they
are set up to solve. This research will undoubtedly yield much insight into
these important problems.
