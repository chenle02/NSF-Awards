9424385 Domaradzki The Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of
Southern California will purchase computing and visualization equipment
dedicated to support computational research in engineering. The equipment will
be used for several research projects, including: subgrid-scale modeling based
on properties of energy transfer in turbulent flows, a computational
investigation of swirling jets, a study of spray dispersion in free shear flows,
numerical modeling of oceanographic convection in the polar regions, wave
interactions in weak turbulence models, and a study of nonlinear ring defects
and their dynamics. ***
