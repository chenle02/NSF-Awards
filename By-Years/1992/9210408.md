This project investigates the combination of error correcting codes and
equalization on storage system communication channels, seeking maximum
performance with minimum decoding complexity. These channels incur significant
levels of interference between successively transmitted symbols (ISI) when
operating at high linear densities and require constrained input alphabets, yet
they must operate at extremely low error rates. Achieving high performance with
minimum complexity under these restrictive conditions will extend and optimize
the use of error correcting codes and equalization on storage systems. Specific
topics addressed are: (1) Optimal division of computational complexity between
coding and equalization functions on magnetic, magneto-optical and optical
recording systems, (2) Analysis and theory of decision feedback equalization
designed for minimal error propagation, (3) Analysis of storage systems as
concatenated coding systems using inner modulation codes and outer Reed-Solomon
codes, and (4) Theory of multi-dimensional equalization and coding for increased
areal density. Results should apply to storage channels and to more general
nonideal communications channels.
