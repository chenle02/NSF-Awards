Abstract OPP-0090453

The Alaska Native Science Commission was created to bring together research and
science in partnership with Native communities. The Commission provides
information, referral, and networking services for researchers seeking active
partners among Alaska Native communities. This cooperative agreement will
provide a continuation of services to Native communities, scientists, and
researchers. The Commission's concerns include Arctic climate systems and
ecosystems, environmental change, links between environmental change and human
activity, and the inclusion of Native people in the planning, implementation,
and interpretation of scientific research.
