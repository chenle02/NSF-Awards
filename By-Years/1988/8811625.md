Atomization of fluid flow requires that fluid flow breakup quickly and produce a
spray of small droplets. Present methods produce a random distribution of
droplet sizes. The objective of this research program is to theoretically
investigate and to determine the feasibility of a laser actuated atomizer. The
atomizer should be capable of producing a controllable mean droplet size and a
narrow size distribution. A theoretical study of the behavior of a jet with a
high frequency, periodically applied side, or axisymmetric force will be
undertaken. The results of this study will determine the laser pulse rate,
radiation pressure and contact area required for atomization of a given fluid
flow. Water, hydrocarbons (gasoline) and variouis points will be evaluated.
Study of the laser interactions with fluid jets would define the wavelength of
the laser beam required for proper energy coupling to the fluid and the means by
which to obtain the proper pulse switching frequency. The laser actuated
atomizer would be constructed and an experimental analysis of its performance
made in the laboratory. The droplets formed by the laser actuated atomizer would
be analyzed either by high speed photography or laser vizualization.
