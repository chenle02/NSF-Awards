Accurate Automation will investigate a new control architecture in which a
neural network is used to set the coefficients of the Youla parameter for the
controller. By so doing one achieves all of the "design by learning" benefits
associated with neural control while simultaneously guaranteeing that the
resultant system will be stable. Moreover, the proposed network automatically
updates the Youla parameter whenever a new reference input or performance
criteria is specified. Specific research objectives include the: - development
of neural network architectures and training methods applicable to the proposed
system, - formulation of methods for updating the network training each time
this system is operated, - implementation the controller as an auto-
reconfigurable system, and - application of the proposed neural controller to
flight control systems and robotics.
