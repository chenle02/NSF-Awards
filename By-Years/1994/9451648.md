9451648 Orvis Georgia Southern University requests matching funds to purchase a
300 MHz Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer (FT-NMR). This
purchase will greatly enhance the laboratory experience of undergraduate
chemistry students across the chemistry curriculum. This instrument will provide
a capability not currently available at this school or the entire South Georgia
region: structural determination and observation of dynamic processes using the
most powerful of spectroscopic techniques. Student exposure to the instrument
will begin at the sophomore level and continue throughout the chemistry
curriculum, affecting all classes above the general chemistry level and playing
a central role in two new courses under development. Additionally, dozens of
chemistry students and faculty from three other area colleges will have
controlled access to the instrument. Through the cooperation between these
colleges and GSU, the benefits of this powerful NMR spectrometer will be felt
beyond GSU itself.
