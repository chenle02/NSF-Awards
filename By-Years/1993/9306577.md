This research Planning Grant for Women is aimed at gathering data that will
direct future investigations into the role of physiological processes in plant
speciation. The first objective is to explore physiological adaptations to low
water and nitrogen availability in a single species, the desert annual
composite, Townsendia annua by estimating correlations of water- and nitrogen-
use efficiency with fitness, measuring heritabilities and trade- offs, and
evaluating phenotypic plasticity and ontogenetic variation for physiological and
other adaptations to low resource availability. This work will assess the
genetic limitations to adaptations and will set the stage for later studies of
physiological evolution. Botanists have long recognized that the distributions
of plants are limited by their ability to tolerate stressful environments such
as deserts. But this begs the question of why some plants can adapt and others
cannot. This project explores the genetic potential for physiological adaptation
in a desert plant in the sunflower family.
