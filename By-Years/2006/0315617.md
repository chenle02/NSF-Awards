The marine bacterium Vibrio parahaemolyticus is adapted to communal life on
surfaces. When grown on a surface or in a viscous layer, the organism induces a
large gene system and differentiates to a swarmer cell. Differentiation allows
movement over and colonization of surfaces. The long-term focus of this work is
to elucidate the regulatory networks than enable bacteria to develop as
multicellular communities on surfaces. This type of colonization, known as
biofilm formation, results in heightened resistance to environmental insult as
well as increased degradative capabilities. Thus, microbial interactions with
surfaces have significant implications with respect to environmental issues such
as biofouling. V. parahaemolyticus is an excellent model organism for studying
surface adaptation by bacteria. This project will investigate how bacteria
sense, integrate and respond to multiple signals in their environment. With
respect to broader impact, a gene discovery plan is proposed that will integrate
teaching and research by allowing undergraduate students to directly participate
in the research process.
