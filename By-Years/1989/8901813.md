This award supports cooperative research in cellular biochemistry to be
performed by Arthur I. Cederbaum of Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York and Susana
Puntarulo and Alberto Boveris, both in the Department of Biochemistry at the
University of Buenos Aires in Argentina. Metals, especially ferric complexes are
required to promote the formation of oxidizing species responsible for DNA and
cellular damage. This work will study the interaction of various ferric
complexes, including ferritin, with organelles such as isolated nucleii and
their ability to catalyze the generation of oxygen-active radicals in rat liver
nucleii. This collaborative effort will bring together the expertise of two
laboratories concerned with the role of transition metals in catalyzing the
production of active oxygen radicals by biological systems. The work will
provide new insights into oxygen radical formation and lipid peroxidation in
such systems.
