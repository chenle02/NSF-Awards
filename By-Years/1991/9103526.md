This research is to construct a global-scale mantle and core structure which
satisfies waveforms of P-SV type body waves as well as SH type body waves.
Previous global body wave inversions were attempted only for SH type waveform
data. The new methods are possible because of advances in computer speed and
storage and improvements in theory. Simultaneous inversion for both P-and S-
velocity provides possible clues as to the nature of seismic anomalies, that is,
thermal versus compositional cause of anomalies. This in turn will aid in our
understanding of the dynamics and composition of the mantle and core.
