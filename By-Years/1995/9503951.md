9503951 Kempf This award supports a 14 month postdoctoral fellowship for Dr.
Carl Kempf. This fellowship opportunity will enable Dr. Kempf to undertake a
collaborative research effort with Dr. Tadao Inomata of NSK, Ltd. The
investigators intend to develop and implement control algorithms for high speed,
high precision mechanical systems. Objectives include development of
compensators for systems utilizing variable-reluctance, direct-drive electric
motors that will reduce step and settle times, increase tracking accuracy, and
reduce the effects of friction. Advanced power amplifiers and drive electronics
will also be investigated. Results of this research will be applied to high
speed, automated wire-bonding equipment and will be relevant for similar devices
employed in precision manufacturing. As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Kempf will
have the opportunity to become familiar with research techniques and equipment
at NSF, Ltd. while contributing to the overall research effort. Therefore, this
proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of
scientific knowledge through an international collaboration. ***
