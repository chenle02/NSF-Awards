The purpose of this research is to investigate a number of open problems
concerning the distribution of zeros and the mean values of Dirichlet series.
The first problem is to prove asymptotic mean value estimates for Dirichlet
polynomials whose lengths are much longer than the interval of integration or,
in the case of discrete means, than the range of summation. An immediate
application of such results is to the study of gaps between zeros of the Riemann
Zeta function. The second problem is to show that certain functions defined by a
Dirichlet series have a functional equation like that of the Riemann Zeta
function and have infinitely many zeros off the critical line, but still have a
positive proportion of their zeros on it. The third problem is to widen the
range of application of the pair correlation method and thereby establish
(conditional) mean value estimates for the zeta function and arithmetical
functions that have so far been unobtainable. Another problem is to obtain
asymptotic estimates for fractional moments of the zeta function. The approach
envisioned will require some kind of assumption on the vertical distribution of
zeros. The final problem is to study the distribution of zeros of the zeta
functions attached to function fields.
