Among the potentially most important results of cosmology in the last decade is
the realization that the star formation rate at redshifts z &gt; 1 is higher
than at present by about an order of magnitude, and that half of the energy
produced since the surface of last scattering has been absorbed and reemitted by
dust. Most of the light produced by stars at high redshift thus reaches us in
the far infrared. This radiation is referred to as the cosmic infrared
background (CIB) and is emitted primarily by dusty, star-forming galaxies at z =
1-3. Embedded in far infrared emission of the CIB is the history of star
formation, dust production, and the growth of large scale structures. Most
lately, several new observational projects (ACT, SPT, Planck, Herschel) released
their &amp;#64257;rst measurements of the CIB. This award will support the
development of the theoretical understanding required to make the best of these
new observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work promises original insights into
the high redshift star formation history of the universe, directly at a period
where the star formation peaked. Since this period of galaxy evolution is hard
to probe by any other means, the research will help address fundamental issues,
such as: (1) the fossil record of galaxy assembly from the &amp;#64257;rst stars
to present, (2) the connections between dark and luminous matter, and (3) the
formation and evolution of cosmic structures. The results from the research will
be broadly disseminated in scienti&amp;#64257;c journals, conferences and public
media. The research team will also participate in numerous outreach projects via
the Caltech Classroom Connection.
