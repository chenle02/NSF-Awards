*** CMS-9730779 Bogy Numerically efficient and mathematically rigorous tools are
developed for theoretical study of problems of wave propagation in composite
wedges. Experimental and theoretical studies are conducted for the scattering of
surface acoustic waves by a solid wedge adhered to a solid half-space made from
another material. These developments have a broad variety of technical
applications in seismology, geophysics, acoustoelectronics, ocean acoustics,
nondestructive ultrasonic evaluation, radar, and mobile telecommunication
systems.***
