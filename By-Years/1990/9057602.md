This PYI award will support research in two topics including advanced mechanical
systems, and advanced electrical components. The first research activity focuses
on the dynamics of systems comprising rigid and flexible bodies. A unified
formulation of such systems will be developed within the framework of
geometrically-exact structural theories. Nonlinear characteristics with the
development of robust continuation methods for singular points/surfaces for
nonlinear systems. The second research topic focuses on the development of a
finite element based computer aided engineering system for the next generation
of advanced multilayer capacitors (AMLC). Formulation of field equations derived
from Maxwell's equations will be developed. This will be followed by the
development of algorithms for the resulting differential/algebraic equations,
and of methods to synthesize the equivalent series resistance and inductance of
AMLC for subsequent circuit simulations.
