Much remains to be understood about how small faults grow into large faults and
how the propagate through the crust. Such knowledge has considerable
significance for evaluation of seismic hazards and the exploration for
petroleum. This study will address this issue through the construction and
refinement of computer programs which simulate faulting and the growth of folds
related to the faults. Two different approaches will be utilized and the
combination of these should reveal aspects of the phenomenon which have not yet
been determined. A limited set of field examples will be studied to determine
the extent to which computer models produce realistic results.
