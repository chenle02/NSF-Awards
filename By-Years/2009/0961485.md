This project addresses the dissipation of mesoscale, balanced flow in the ocean
through the use of high resolution nesting experiments in two different
numerical models (ROMS and the MIT general circulation model). The work
specifically addresses the generation of sumesoscale, ageostrophic flows by
mesoscale interactions with topography by explicitly resolving the relevant
scales of 0.1-10 km in the horizontal. Numerical simulations will be designed to
calculate the cascades of energy, enstrophy, and tracer variance and compare
with theories, which will also be developed and improved within the scope of the
project. The high resolution simulations will be performed in the Kuroshio
region where strong topographic features and the the western boundary current
dynamics will allow robust testing of the hypotheses. It is hoped that the work
will lead to new understandings of the submesoscale regime, the dynamics that
connect balance and unbalanced flows, and perhaps even lead to new
parameterizations which can be used to represent these processes in ocean and
climate models.
