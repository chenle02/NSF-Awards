This project will investigate automated deduction and logic programming based on
some recent developments in Multiple- Valued Annotated Logics. These logics have
been advocated as a way to a uniform formalization of automated reasoning
systems that often have to perform reasoning tasks which classical logics cannot
handle naturally. These logics have been used as tools to explore areas such as
reasoning with uncertainty, temporal reasoning, as well as reasoning with
inconsistent information. This research will examine frameworks for automated
deduction in Annotated Logics. The adaptation of a resolution proof procedure
will be studied for another class of Multiple-Valued Logics, call Signed
Formulas to perform automated reasoning in Annotated Logics. Based on this
study, a unifying proof theoretic framework will be developed for the various
classes of Annotated Logics. The question of efficiency and control strategies
for reducing the search space of the inference rules will be investigated, and a
prototype system based on the theoretical results will be implemented.
