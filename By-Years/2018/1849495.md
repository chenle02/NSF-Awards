This project draws together scholarship from history and geography to uncover
the history of scientific research on ice and how it has been used by
naturalists and scientists to understand geological timescales and to predict
future ecological change. Evidence extracted from ice has fundamentally
recalibrated scientific conceptions of earth's deep history: the theory of the
Ice Ages revealed the planet's radical changeability, and evidence from ice
cores showed a globe that rapidly flickers between different meteorological
states. Data for the project will come from documents gathered at national
archives in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, and these will
be complimented by analyses of published scientific papers and visual materials.
Overall, this project traces our changing scientific conceptions of ice over the
past two hundred years to highlight its importance for advancing scientific
understanding of the planet as an interconnected system with a deep past and a
deep future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an investigation into the cryosphere -
those portions of the Earth's surface that are covered in solid ice - and into
the ways in which scientists have studied and conceptualized it over the past
two hundred years. Analyses of ice have provided critical ecological data that
has enabled scientists to appreciate the true depth of the Earth's history and
to understand patterns of environmental change and systematic meteorological
variability over time. Data for this multi-method project come from collections
at several national archives and from historically relevant scientific papers
and visual models. Systematic qualitative documentary analysis will be used to
analyze these data and enhance our understanding of how research on the
cryosphere has shaped our collective understanding of the environmental history
and future of Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
