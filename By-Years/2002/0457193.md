&lt;br/&gt;0457193&lt;br/&gt;Horch&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study proposes the
use of a prosthetic gripper as the test vehicle. The study proposes the
integration of tactile sensors (e.g., force) and position sensing functions.
Furthermore, the study proposes evaluation of the new gripper in human subjects.
The sensory functions will be interfaced with the amputee nerve stump using
electrode technology already under development in the Horch laboratory. The
proposed work will advance knowledge through the study of controlled feedback
sensory functions into prosthetic hand technology. It will also further basic
understanding of how to engineer interfaces between prosthetic devices and the
human body.&lt;br/&gt;
