This research involves an experimental investigation of the thermodynamics of
nanophase materials. Mechanical attriting is the technique employed to process
various nanophase metallic systems. Associated effects of environmental factors
during attriting are determined. Both positive and negative heats of mixing are
represented in the materials' systems proposed. Grain boundary segregation
tendencies are noted and related to the potential for grain growth during low
temperature annealing and consolidation. Several experimental characterization
methods are proposed to examine the chemistry on a nanoscale, including
calorimetry, electron energy loss spectrometry (EELS), Mossbauer spectrometry,
and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). %%% Nanostructured materials are a
class of new materials whose properties are expected to be markedly changed by
the consequences of the fine structure. This research explores factors affecting
the stability of such materials.
