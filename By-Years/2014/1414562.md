This project is to create some components to aid in the forthcoming joint
scientific conference on Water Systems, Science, and Society Under Global Change
to be co-sponsored by UCOWR, NIWR, and CUAHSI and held on June 18 - 20, 2014 at
Tufts University. The goals of the joint conference are (1) Integration of
National Water Resources Communities to Advance Science. (2) Translating
Research to Practice and (3) Networking and Mentoring of Early Career
Researchers.

This conference will trigger intellectual conversations relating to future
directions in water system research with a particular emphasis on identifying
those potential areas of new scientific knowledge discovery that will amplify
our ability to solve future water management challenges under global change
impact. The participants will benefit from understanding new possibilities and
opportunities provided by the three national level organizations and the
communication that will essentially leverage the intellectual strengths and
reputations of these organizations including CUAHSI, UCOWR, and NIWR. The
feedbacks from the audience will also impact the three organizations.
