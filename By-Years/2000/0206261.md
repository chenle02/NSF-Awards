AST 0206261&lt;br/&gt;Wills, B J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For low redshift quasars,
the awardee and others have demonstrated clear relationships between black hole
mass, the Eddington ratio, and spectroscopic properties, showing that copious
dense, possibly metal- enriched, emission-line gas is present in the QSOs with
highest Eddington ratio. The awardee will apply these relationships to QSOs at
higher redshifts (1.2 -2.7), to explore the accretion history of the black hole.
At these redshifts the important diagnostic lines of hydrogen H B, [OIII], He II
? 4686, and blended Fe II emission are shifted into the 1 um -5 um atmospheric
'windows ', and the UV emission and broad absorption lines shifted into the
optical region. This program will involve near-infrared spectroscopy on national
facilities as well as at 1 um -1.3 um with the Hobby-Eberly telescope. Existing
UV rest-frame spectra will be used, with additional ground-based optical
observations where needed (McDonald 2.7m and the HET). A pilot program by the
awardee and student has demonstrated the feasibility of these observations,
analysis, and interpretation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
