The physics department at Wells College will buy Data Acquisition
Instrumentation for acoustic Spectrum Analysis. The equipment will be used
primarily in an undergraduate interdisciplinary course in musical acoustics, for
laboratory demonstration instruction in harmonic analysis of sound. Other uses
include undergraduate research in harmonic analysis of musical instruments, in
conjunction with the Music department; demonstration and lab work in
microprocessor interfacing and experiment control, in conjunction with the
Computer Science department; and demonstration of principles of the physics of
signals and waves, and the Fourier transform, in mainstream introductory Physics
courses. The instrumentation is IBM PC-based, and so is versatile, reasonably
priced, and representative of current technology. The University will contribute
an amount equal to the award.
