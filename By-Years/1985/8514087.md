This project is based on the proposition that industrial and commercial
machinery as well as robotic systems can be reliably operated at high speeds,
and hence productivity increased, if the moving elements are fabricated from
polymeric composite materials, as opposed to traditional commercial metals.
These composite materials have high stiffness-to-weight ratios and thus minimize
the problems associated with component flexibility. The behavior of polymeric
composites is dependent on the ambient hygrothermal environment and it is
important that this dependance be understood before mechanisms using such
material are designed. This project undertakes that task. It is a combined
theoretical and experimental study with the goal of distilling design guidelines
for industrial machine systems utilizing polymeric composite components.
