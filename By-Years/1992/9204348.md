We propose that essential fatty acids are very important for hibernation and
reproduction in mammals. The proposed research will focus on fatty acid
composition, uptake and utilization in the white adipose tissue and liver of
marmots (Marmota flaviventris) by season and will directly assess if one
particular essential fatty acid, linoleic acid (18:2, n-6), is spared Beta
oxidation to a significant degree within these tissues during the hibernation
period, October to March. It is well known that linoleic acid is very important
not only as an energy supply, but also as the precursor for arachidonic acid
(20:4), and perhaps is important for changes in reproductive condition and
thermoregulatory capabilities during, and at the end of hibernation. As marmots
are mammals, the results from these experiments may be directly applicable to
the human metabolic disorders. Several human pathological conditions are
associated with essential fatty acid deficiency. Consequently, conclusions drawn
from these experiments will enhance our knowledge about the role of essential
fatty acids in physiological processes.
