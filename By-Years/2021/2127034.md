This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the power output of solar cells
and sensors to accelerate generation of clean power. This technology can be
applied to industries such as solar panels, optics, imaging, and display
devices. The proposed project will advance a manufacturing process to make the
coatings at scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance translation
of multi-layered nano-optical coatings for photovoltaic panels, architectural
glass, and opto-electronic devices. The technology uses photonic crystals
guiding photons through a plasmonic resonance microstructure for efficient down-
and up-conversion of spectrum of light. Technical objectives are to demonstrate
and validate efficacy of the large-scale manufacturing of this coating on glass
substrate for photovoltaic panels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
