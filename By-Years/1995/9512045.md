9512045 Cypess This award renews funding of the Bacteriology Collection of the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The collection includes over 15,000
strains representing most of the known species of bacteria. Approximately 500
strains of bacterial viruses are also included in the collection. About 20% of
the bacterial strains are type cultures particularly useful as reference strains
in identifying new isolates, performing microbiological assays and other uses
where repeated use of the same strain is critical. Samples of collected
organisms are available to researchers in universities, research institutes and
industry for a small fee. In the last five years, the size of the collection has
increased by about 7%, and over 200,000 samples have been distributed. Funding
provided through the award will support continued growth in the size of the
collection, improvements in the quality-assurance procedures, and progress in
providing detailed, current information about the collection through the
internet and a printed catalogue. ***
