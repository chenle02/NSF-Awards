This collaborative project between Idaho State University (ISU), Utah State
University (USU), and USFS Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS) will develop
the next generation of analytical and processing tools for new airborne and
ground-based LiDAR monitoring data. The tools will help earth scientists and
natural resource managers exploit these data streams to address some of our most
pressing environmental questions and management challenges. The software tools
will target Earth Science-specific analysis of 3-D point cloud data from
platforms like airborne LiDAR (ALS), ground-based LiDAR (TLS), multi-beam SONAR
(MBS), and/or Structure from Motion (SfM). The tool development will scale-up
existing documented and proven algorithms to be more accessible, as well as
build new algorithms that are necessary to address emerging challenges such as
change detection analysis from repeat surveys, improved bare earth surface
generation, and novel fusion of point clouds collected from different platforms
(e.g. ALS and TLS). The new software will be developed collaboratively between
geoscientists and computer scientists to optimize performance when handling the
large and often problematic data volumes associated with point clouds. This work
will provide a suite of community software that will permit innovative and
potentially transformative data analysis with the potential to enhance our
understanding of numerous earth surface processes.
