This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Award to Texas State
University, located in San Marcos, TX, supports the training of 10 students for
10 weeks during the summers of 2022-2024. In this program, funded by the
Division of Chemistry, participants engage in research in chemistry,
biochemistry, and materials science. REU Scholars also participate in a
professional development course, which combines their research lab experiences
with field trips and workshops to explore careers in the academic, government,
and private sectors. Participants develop a robust understanding of how
innovation bridges basic research and entrepreneurship. This site broadens
participation in STEM by preparing participants for the wide variety of career
opportunities in the molecular sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants
conduct individual projects that span all fields of chemistry. These projects
include the characterization of electronically active polymers and
nanoparticles, the synthesis of natural product derivatives with potential
biologic activity, and analysis of proteins to build structure-function
relationships. The professional development series includes seminars on
scientific communication and careers in chemistry. To increase diversity in the
chemistry workforce, this site recruits students from regional institutions,
including public and private 2- and 4-year colleges, Hispanic-Serving
Institutions (HSIs), and Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
