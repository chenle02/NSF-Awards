This award is for the establishment of a new REU site in Astronomy at the
University of Texas (UT Austin). The site will take advantage of the strong
connection between the Astronomy department and the Texas Advanced Computing
Center (TACC), the Texas Institute for Discovery Education in Science, and the
McDonald Observatory to provide a wide range of research topics and professional
development opportunities for participants. UT Austin will host 8 participants
per year for 10 weeks summer internships, with emphasis placed on recruiting
from underrepresented groups and colleges with limited opportunities for
astrophysical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eight student participants will
conduct research in the areas of planetary astronomy, stellar formation and
evolution, galactic astronomy, cosmology, and instrumentation. The participants
will also be trained in modern computing techniques at TACC, and will have the
opportunity to perform observations using the facilities at the McDonald
Observatory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
