The objective of this project is to provide a sound theoretical basis for
estimating gaseous emission fluxes at soil/air interfaces which arise from
volatilization of subsurface contaminants, including those released at leaking
or uncontrolled treatment, storage and disposal sites for hazardous waste.
Research on this topic involves the theoretical development of a physically
based mathematical model for predicting soil/air fluxes of contaminants,
application of geostatistical and other optimal estimators for calibrating model
parameters and quantifying model uncertainty at the field scale, and validation
of the model using field data. The project emphasizes consideration of the gas
phase transport and sorption processes in the unsaturated zone for volatile
organic compounds and will explicitly represent temporal and spatial
heterogeneities in contaminant and media properties, soil temperature changes,
and determined in simulations of representative field conditions. Kriging and
Bayesian estimation will be used to calibrate spatially and temporally
correlated model parameters. A data collection effort will supplement the
limited field data available for model validation. Emissions to the air of
hazardous substances released at sites where they are buried may pose
significant environmental and health risks, however, the current capability to
assess and predict these emissions is extremely limited. Results of this project
are likely to provide a better basis then is possible now for engineering design
of soil-containment systems for hazardous wastes.
