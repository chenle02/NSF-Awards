Strategic planning in ecology is important and timely. New technologies,
interdisciplinary challenges, and significant progress on many ecological fronts
provide exciting opportunities for advances in the 1990's. Furthermore, urgent
problems such as environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, and change in
global climate emphasize the need for sound ecological information and
understanding. Resources to obtain this basic ecological knowledge are limited,
and a comprehensive evaluation of research priorities is therefore crucial for
the wise use of research support. The Ecological Society of America will publish
the revised report "The Sustainable Biosphere Initiative: An Ecological Research
Agenda for the Nineties" with funding provided by this award. In addition the
Society will conduct a workshop to plan the further dissemination of the report
and to organize subsequent, topical workshops which will further define the
research opportunities, needs and priorities for the 1990's. These activities
will provide valuable input for the ecological science community and for the
federal government as both strive to improve the base for more cost effective
research in ecology//
