The project will examine the predictive value of dynamic failure computations
when progressive degradation of the structural properties takes place due to
elastic damage and softening. Dynamic stability predictions require on one hand
robust solution strategies which survive material instabilities in the small
region when localized failure mechanisms remain confined. On the other hand, the
underlying mathematical model and its computational implementation must be
sufficiently sensitive to capture progressive failure and to control its
propagation in a realistic manner. To this end, different failure indicators
will be implemented for tracing dynamic instabilities and for monitoring dynamic
failure calculations within explicit and implicit solution strategies. The
principal objective is the development of an adaptive solution method based on
Lyapunov stability indicators which capture bifurcations both in the space and
in the time domain. The novel methodology will be illustrated with realistic
structural problems which exhibit degrading stiffness and strength properties
due to damage and softening behavior on the material level.
