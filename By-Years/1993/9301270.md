This Americas Program award will support attendance to a workshop on the
theoretical and computational aspects of molecular and materials sciences. The
workshop, organized by Dr. David A. Micha of the University of Florida, will
bring together advanced doctoral students and research scientists to review
recent developments in the field, with emphasis on methods and computer programs
of general applicability with mid-range computing facilities. Participants are
well-known investigators, and the topics to be discussed will address new
methods to interpret data and to predict phenomena in areas of theoretical
chemistry such as molecular clusters, polymers and proteins, solid surfaces and
others. The meeting will address issues of human resource development, both in
this country and throughout the hemisphere, in an area of much current activity
and promise.
