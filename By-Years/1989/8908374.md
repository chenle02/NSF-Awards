Colony dynamics and conflict between queens and workers over the production of
male brood are central issues in the study of social systems in the Hymenoptera
(ants, wasps and bees). Success of workers (and of the queen) is heavily
influenced by direct, worker reproduction. If colonies in a social species
typically include workers that are reproducing directly, it is of great
importance to be able to characterize those workers in both morphological and
behavioral terms in order to understand the proximate mechanisms controlling
worker egg laying. In order to do this it is necessary to unambiguously identify
laying workers and also to clearly quantify the brood they produce. A molecular
genetics technique, DNA "fingerprinting", can be used to obtain the necessary
information. DNA "fingerprints" are individually specific patterns of DNA
fragments that can be used to determine which female is the mother of any of the
offspring produced by a colony. Comparison of these distinctive yet heritable
DNA patterns ("fingerprints") among females and the offspring they jointly rear
will be used to determine precisely which females are the mothers of which
offspring. This information will be used in combination with behavioral and
morphological data to investigate the proximate control of worker reproduction
with the overall aim of understanding the evolution of social systems.
