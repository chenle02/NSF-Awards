This award supports the fifth "Gone Fishing" meeting on Poisson Geometry to be
held at the University of Colorado at Boulder from March 31 to April 3, 2016.
The "Gone Fishing" workshop series consists of regular meetings in North America
of mathematicians interested in Poisson Geometry and its applications,
attracting leading experts and young researchers alike. The aim of the series is
to promote interaction between mathematicians, physicists, and groups working on
related areas having different perspectives. As these various fields continue to
progress further, it is becoming increasingly urgent to encourage more
interaction and cross fertilization between them. Last but not least the "Gone
Fishing" meetings provide a unique forum forjunior mathematicians from all over
the United States to learn about cutting edge developments in Poisson Geometry
and to disseminate their own research results in the field.

Poisson Geometry originates as the mathematical formulation of classical
mechanics as the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics. Its history begins
with 19th century classics by Poisson, Hamilton, Jacobi, and Lie, developing
into a separate field in its own right around 1980 via the works of Lichnerowicz
and Weinstein. Today, Poisson Geometry intersects and is applied to many areas
of mathematics, including symplectic geometry, generalized complex geometry, Lie
algebroids and Lie groupoids, geometric mechanics, cluster algebras, integrable
systems, quantization, non-commutative geometry, stratification theory, and the
geometry of singular symplectic and Poisson structures. The "Gone Fishing"
workshops provide an excellent opportunity for scientists based in North America
to exchange ideas and stimulate collaboration. Each workshop has a goal to
address important questions and future directions of the subject.
