Chandra Abstract Studies of Polarimetric Signatures in Winter and Spring Time
Storms Using the CSU-CHILL Radar The objective of this research is to study
polarimetric signatures in winter and spring time storms using the CSU-CHILL
radar. Special emphasis will be placed on Neural network/Fourier descriptor
based image classification techniques to process 2D-PM images of hydrometeors
for insitu comparison with polarimetric signatures. The significance of the new
high performance low side lobe antenna system of the CSU-CHILL radar for
studying polarimetric signatures will b observed. Spatial and temporal evolution
of polarimetric radar signatures will be studied to develop average signatures
in several hydrometeor habit regions. Multidimensional parameter set will be
used for classification of hydrometeor and precipitation types. The overall goal
is to study the application of polarimetric radar signatures to study the type
and distribution of precipitation in winter and spring storms.
