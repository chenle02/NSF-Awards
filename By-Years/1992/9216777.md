In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Kevin Lehmann of Princeton University will develop two spectroscopic
tools to aid in studying intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR)
in small polyatomic molecules. The first technique is an optical-optical double
resonance method which allows very highly vibrationally excited levels of the
ground state to be populated in order to study the effect of the large
anharmonicity on the vibrational motion. The other technique is a time-resolved,
infrared-pump/Raman probe method for exploring the final IVR distributions after
vibrational excitation of hydrogen atom stretches. Finally, Lehmann will develop
theoretical tools to interpret the newly acquired spectra. %%% An understanding
of the effects of large amounts of vibrational excitation in a molecule directly
impacts our understanding of the fundamental processes by which many types of
reactions occur. In this research Lehmann will study the effects of vibrational
energy on the motions of bonds in a molecule as well as the elucidation of the
pathways by which this excess energy is dissipated. This information has impact
on the basic understanding of many reactive processes, from atmospheric
chemistry to combustion to synthesis using plasmas.
