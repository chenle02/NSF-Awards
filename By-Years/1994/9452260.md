9452260 Loffredo The FT-NMR requested in this proposal will be used to
strengthen laboratory instruction in organic chemistry, physical biochemistry,
physical chemistry, instrumental analysis, inorganic chemistry and research.
This will be accomplished by enhancement of existing experiments currently in
use in courses utilizing NMR, introduction of new experiments into courses
currently providing NMR instruction, and introduction of new experiments into
courses not presently using NMR. All of the enhancements and additions to the
program require the use of high-field, broadband FT-NMR. The request for this
FT-NMR coordinates well with the completion of the renovation project for the
Gessner Science Building which includes all new laboratory facilities, new
additional instrumentation, matches for NSF grants for instrumentation, and
support services and personnel. The acquisition of the FT-NMR will complete the
improvement of the chemistry curriculum at East Stroudsburg University and will
improve the vitality of the programs offered to its students.
