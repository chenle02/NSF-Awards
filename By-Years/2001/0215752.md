DNA segregation is a fundamental process that is poorly understood in bacteria.
Recent work shows that E. coli plasmids are targeted to specific regions within
the cell, rather than being randomly distributed in the cytoplasm as long
thought. Multicopy plasmids form clusters that are targeted to the cell midpoint
where they are duplicated. Following duplication, plasmids migrate with rapid
kinetics from midcell to the future midpoints of the nascent daughter cells.
Little is known about the mechanisms underlying plasmid localization or movement
in bacteria. While a set of par genes important for DNA partitioning have been
identified, how they contribute to plasmid localization is not understood. The
goal of this study is to identify genes encoded by plasmids and their hosts that
are directly responsible for mediating plasmid targeting, clustering and
movement. Since bacterial DNA segregation is a fundamental process about which
so little is currently known, the impact of this study will be extraordinarily
broad, potentially affecting any area of research where bacteria are involved.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some areas that will be impacted include microbial ecology
and evolution, pathogenesis, genetics, genomics, and bioremediation. For
example, understanding the details of DNA segregation could contribute directly
to the development of new antibiotics designed to inhibit the process. Since one
of the plasmids used here is a broad host range antibiotic resistance
determinant, these studies will also impact our understanding on the evolution
and spread of antibiotic resistance. This work will also have a significant
impact on undergraduate education by contributing to the training of students in
the biological sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
