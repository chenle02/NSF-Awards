Epigenetics (inherited changes in phenotype not due to changes in DNA sequence)
is a critical mode of gene control recently realized to have far reaching
effects. It is caused by modification of the chromatin (DNA plus associated
proteins) and acts at a level above normal gene control. How changes in
chromatin cause changes in gene expression is a major area of research activity
in both animals and plants. Understanding epigenetic control of genes will
elucidate gene control of development, response to climatic stresses such as
drought and heat and interaction with disease causing organisms. Several plant
genomes have now been sequenced so it is feasible to examine the epigenetic
changes occurring during development or in response to the environment in these
organisms. The goal is to determine, as part of an international collaboration,
the epigenetic marks on chromatin at particular genes in different tissues, at
different stages of development and in response to biotic and abiotic challenges
and to see how they differ, potentially leading to ways of manipulating the
expression of these genes. This workshop, to be jointly sponsored by NSF and
science funding agencies in the UK and Australia, will bring together
approximately 40 scientists, both leading experts and early career, to
participate in a forum for discussion of cutting edge research in this area and
the setting up of an international Plant Epigenome Consortium. The 'state-of-
play' internationally will be reviewed and then the 'nuts and bolts' of setting
up a collaboration will be worked out. In addition, early career stage invitees
will have the opportunity to visit nniversities and institutes in Australia
after the meeting to further these international collaborative goals.
