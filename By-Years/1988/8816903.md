Objective of this project is to understand role of fractional crystallization
in generating magmatic diversity of mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) by carrying
out phase equilibrium experiments at pressures of up to 15 kilobars on selected
MORB compositions. Will also compare lab results with data from a number of
spreading centers in Atlantic and Pacific. %%% Experiments on melting and
fractionation of MORBs of different compositions, temperatures and pressures are
needed to understand the formation of the oceanic crust. Dr. Grove is perhaps
the only scientist who is presently doing the necessary experiments in the
pressure range covered in this project. The data that will be generated are
essential.
