Butterflyfishes make excellent models for studying patterns of genetic
variation and diversification in marine organisms. They are common and
conspicuous members of coral reef communities and display considerable
ecological diversity. This study is designed to integrate population genetics
(using both nuclear and mitochondrial gene markers) and ecology in an effort to
examine overall patterns of variation seen in related species of Indo-west
Pacific Butterflyfishes. Indo-west Pacific coral reef communities are some of
the most diverse, and possibly threatened, marine systems. Research on
Butterflyfishes will provide valuable information on how such coral reef
communities form from an historical perspective. In addition, the combined use
of genetic and morphological markers will provide a better assessment of the
uniqueness of various Butterflyfish stocks occupying these coral reef
communities, an absolute necessity for the preservation and management of
biodiversity.
