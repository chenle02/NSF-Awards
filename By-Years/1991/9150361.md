Galveston College is modernizing its freshman/sophomore physics laboratory with
microcomputers, interface equipment, measurement probes, printers and data
acquisition and analysis software. New laboratory instructions are being
developed and written to incorporate the microcomputer instrumentation with the
current laboratory apparatus. This includes measuring procedures and computer
analysis techniques to guide the student to a better understanding of physics
principles. The use of a spreadsheet is being emphasized for data analysis in
many of the experiments. The spreadsheet serves as a tool for students to select
and manipulate collected data, produce graphs and make theoretical comparisons.
The computer system expedites data collection, calculations and graphing,
providing more time for the student to analyze and comprehend the physics
principles involved. The power of the computer system allows for more in-depth
analysis and for new types of experiments. Careful consideration is given to the
writing of the laboratory instructions so as not to overwhelm the student with
the computer operations.
