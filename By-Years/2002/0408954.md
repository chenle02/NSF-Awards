The PI proposes to study aspects of particle physics beyond the standard model
that will potentially be tested within the next decade, and that may fill some
of the gaps in our current understanding of particle physics and cosmology. The
PI has proposed several new ideas which deserve exploration This proposal
focuses on studying aspects of Supersymmetry, Higgs physics and the possible
role of extra dimensions, all of which will be studied in upcoming collider
experiments at the LHC, or possibly even at the Tevatron. The PI also proposes
to study the interplay of neutrino physics and cosmology, a timely endeavor now
that observational cosmology and the various neutrino experiments have posed
certain puzzles in the neutrino sector that require explanation. The major part
of the proposal is devoted to supersymmetric extensions &lt;br/&gt;of the
standard model. First there is a plan to improve a theory with an interesting
pattern of the soft-breaking terms, in which the gauginos obtain Dirac masses,
rather than the usual Majorana masses. &lt;br/&gt;Such scenario faces several
tight experimental constraints. The second project concerns the fine-tuning
associated with the bounds on the Higgs mass. A theory that is less fine tuned
might be obtained &lt;br/&gt;by using little Higgs mechanism that operates at
low energies after supersymmetry is broken. The third project proposes to
increase the upper bound on the mass of the lightest Higgs particle in the
minimal supersymmetric standard model. &lt;br/&gt;
