Abstract

Problems in model selection, mixtures and weighted likelihood

We study problems in model selection, mixtures and weighted likelihood. In
particular, we first discuss extensions of the weighted likelihood methodology
introduced by Markatou et al (1997,1998) in the context of regression models and
its connection to model selection issues with emphasis in the mixture model
context. We then generalize these ideas to study general model selection
problems. The role of the disparity measures that are associated with weighted
likelihood, and several others, is studied in detail in connection with goodness
of fit approach to model selection.

The point of view we take here is that parametric models can provide
informative, parsimonious descriptions of the data. Then, the test statistics
for testing the model adequacy are constructed and the asymptotic distributions
under the null hypothesis and under contiguous alternatives are studied. The
theory here is based on empirical processes. To practically implement the
methods we propose to bootstrap the test statistics to obtain appropriate
p-values. We consider bootstrapping from a hybrid between the model distribution
stipulated by the null hypothesis and the data and study the consistency of it.
When the model is false we prefer nonparametric bootstrap. The performance of
Bickel's m out of n bootstrap will be examined.
