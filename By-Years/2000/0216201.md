With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program at NSF, and
the Department of Defense, Profs. Gina Hoatson and Robert Vold at the College of
William and Mary will acquire a high field (18 tesla), multinuclear solid state
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Spectrometer. This equipment will enable
researchers to carry out studies on a) ferroelectric and piezoelectric
materials; b) high performance carbon nitride films; c) technologically
important conducting polymers; and d) biologically important amino acids and
cyclic dipeptides. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation
of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential for carrying out frontier research. The
results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas
including development of wear-related coatings, ultrasonic transducers and
electronic actuators, and electrochromic devices. In addition, amino acids and
cyclic dipeptides are important to study because these model systems yield
insight into problems of protein folding, molecular recognition and enzyme
activity.
