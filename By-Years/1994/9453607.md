The purpose of the Georgia State University Mathematics Teacher Education Co-
Reform Project is to initiate collaboration on professional practice among
faculty contributing to our teacher education programs and to reform the first
two courses based on collaboration. The first goal is to establish intra-
university collaboration between Education and Arts &amp; Sciences and
university-school collaboration between university faculty and public school
teachers. The second goal is to integrate mathematics content, pedagogy,
technology, and field experiences in preserve secondary mathematics teacher
education courses.
