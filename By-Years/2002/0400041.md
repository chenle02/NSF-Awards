HRD- 0400041&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infrastructure Support for Doctoral Research
in Optics &amp; Photonics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hampton
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Hommerich, Uwe
H.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hampton University will strengthen the education and
research&lt;br/&gt;capabilities of its Ph.D. program in physics by (1) enhancing
the institution's research infrastructure and productivity in optics &amp;
photonics; (2) increasing the number of students from underrepresented minority
groups earning Ph.D. degrees in physics; and, (3) building a pipeline of
undergraduate students pursuing advanced degrees in science and engineering.
Project activities include faculty professional development, postdoctoral
researchers, visiting scientists, student outreach, student assistantships,
supplies, and research equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research in optics &amp;
photonics will focus on luminescent materials development and nonlinear optical
spectroscopy of oxide nanoparticles. Outcomes of this research impact a wide
range of technological developments in the area of electro-optics and lasers.
This research also advances the fundamental understanding of structure-property
relations in luminescent materials and provides deeper insight in the nonlinear
optical properties of nanoparticles.&lt;br/&gt;The multi-disciplinary nature of
the program will enhance the quality of education and research in several
science and engineering disciplines at Hampton University. Educational
enhancement activities include curriculum development in optics and photonics,
student research experiences, outreach, and the development of student
internships with external partners.&lt;br/&gt;
