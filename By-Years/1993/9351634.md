This project is to implement a professional workstation laboratory for the new,
interdisciplinary, undergraduate course sequence in massively parallel computing
which is being introduced this year with support from the NSF ?CDR/CISE!. The
laboratory will be equipped with advanced software tools on a network of high
performance graphics workstations from which the students will access the
University's massively parallel computer. The workstations have been choosen for
their computational speed and 3D graphics capabilities. In addition to the basic
software package, which includes C, C++, Pascal, FORTRAN, X11 and Motif, the PIs
plan to provide Mathematica, Linda and ID to ensure a full spectrum of tools for
a professional high performance computing environment. The workstations will be
used to gain access to the CM-5 complex, for the visualization of Connection
Machine computations and results, for program development, for data preparation
and analysis, and for studying networked distributed computing models. The
laboratory, which will be designed to serve as both a workspace and
demonstration/teaching environment,is intended to reinforce the
interdisciplinary nature of the curriculum by establishing a central location
for the full range of interdepartmental undergraduate activity connected with
the new curriculum. The PIs believe that this project will demonstrate the
viability of incorporating frontier technologies into undergraduate education
and serve as a prototype from which other educators can borrow.
