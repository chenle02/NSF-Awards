The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary mathematics research project between
Dr. Stephen BLoom of the Stevens Institute of Technology and Dr. Zoltan Esik of
the Bolyai Institute, Szeged, is to study special classes of iteration theories
that pertain to three areas: algebraic automata theory, program correctness and
sematics of concurrent processes. In particular efforts will address matrix and
matricial iteration theories and the theory of synchronization trees. These
efforts should yield new knowledge of equational properties of formal power
series and a new treatment of total correctness. Collectively the results are
expected to help unify a body of work in theoretical computer science, expressed
inside a framework of iteration theories. This project in computational theory
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary
talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interests and
competence.
