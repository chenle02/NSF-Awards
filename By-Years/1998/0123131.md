Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI) in partnership with the
National Science&lt;br/&gt;Foundation will increase the number of Native
Americans matriculating into science,&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, engineering and
technology (SMET) baccalaureate programs and/or entering &lt;br/&gt;the science
and technology workforce. This will be accomplished through a
comprehensive&lt;br/&gt;program, irVision-21le which includes: a) curriculum
development in calculus, physics and&lt;br/&gt;chemistry; b) standards-based
faculty development in problem-solving instructional &lt;br/&gt;strategies and
in the use of instructional technologies; c) two-year student
experiences&lt;br/&gt;in research; and, c) an expanded program for networking
professionals leading to&lt;br/&gt;industry certification to address the need
for information technology workers in&lt;br/&gt;Native American
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is designed to improve student-
learning outcomes in calculus, physics, and&lt;br/&gt;chemistry. Students will
participate in inquiry-based learning strategies delivered through&lt;br/&gt;a
technology-enriched curriculum that is delivered/facilitated by a skilled
faculty. Native&lt;br/&gt;American undergraduates will also participate in
meaningful research experiences that &lt;br/&gt;will lead to improved diverse
career opportunities, particularly in the SMET fields. &lt;br/&gt;Students will
learn and write about the research process, and develop
presentations&lt;br/&gt;for professional student forums. This is a learning
experience that is rarely afforded &lt;br/&gt;to two-year undergraduates.
Finally to address the need for certified information &lt;br/&gt;technology
professionals in the U.S., and especially among Tribal Nations, SIPI
will&lt;br/&gt;expand its networking training program, allowing for industry
certification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project staff in collaboration with faculty
will develop an extensive evaluation&lt;br/&gt;and assessment program. Staff
will encourage and monitor student enrollment &lt;br/&gt;and success in college
courses that will prepare students for science,
mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;engineering and technology careers. Curricula products
will be packaged and shared &lt;br/&gt;with Native serving institutions, and
evaluation and assessment results will be &lt;br/&gt;electronically
disseminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
