A conference will be held on Nuclear Physics Near the Drip Lines, sponsored by
Michigan State University from August 21-24, 1996. The conference will focus on
the latest theoretical developments of the properties of nuclei near the proton
and neutron limits of stability and the implication for nuclear structure and
astrophysics. With the many new and planned radioactive beam facilities,
including the one at MSU, there is a renewed interest in nuclear structure and
to what extent the traditional models are still valid to explain the properties
of these exotic nuclei. The nuclear astrophysics component will be oriented
toward an improved knowledge of nucleosynthesis. Education of graduate students
and postdocs who will attend is central to this activity.
