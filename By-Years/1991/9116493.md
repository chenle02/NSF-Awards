This work involves a short cruise off northern BajaCalifornia where the Miocene
East Pacific Rise flank containsare cord of the orgin and demise of short
transfrom offsets ofthe rise crest, and extensional and compressional effects of
plate motion changes on the structure of major, long-lived tranforms. The
Seabeam 2000 multibeam sonar sounder, a single-channel profiler, and a
magetometer will be the principal survey tools. Results will be applicable to
studies of the evolution of rise-crest segmentation.
