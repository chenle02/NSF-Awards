Algebraic topology is a subject that studies topological spaces via associated
algebraic entities. One of the most important such entities, or invariants, is
the homotopy groups of a topological space, which measure whether or not the
space can be continuously deformed into a single point. The computation of
homotopy groups of spheres has been a driving force in the development of
algebraic topology with wide applications to many other fields of mathematics,
including number theory. The overarching goal of this project is to further
explore the profound connections between number theory and homotopy theory.
Broader impacts of this project focus on graduate curriculum development in
chromatic homotopy theory, student mentoring, and conference organization.

The PI plans to investigate various aspects of the connections between chromatic
homotopy theory, algebraic K-theory, and L-functions. Building on his previous
work, the PI will explore generalizations of the Quillen-Lichtenbaum Conjecture
to various L-functions associated to abelian characters of Galois
representations, using tools from equivariant algebraic K-theory. Algebraic
K-theory spectra have a coherent multiplicative structure. The PI plans to give
explicit algebraic formulas for this structure and investigate its implications
in zeta functions. Another question the PI will study is how to relate
Eisenstein series and Hidaâ€™s L-functions of two variables to power operations on
elliptic cohomology. Finally, the PI plans to use tools from arithmetic geometry
to investigate the Vanishing Conjecture and Picard groups in chromatic homotopy
theory.
