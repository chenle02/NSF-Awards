Based on a temporal model of relativistic space-time, the expression of
distributed system behavior is studied in order to permit partial automation of
the process of checking requirements and specifications, analyzing debugging
information, and verification for concurrent and distributed systems. The
temporal approach being studied combines relativity, to allow expression of true
concurrency, and interval algebra, to allow representation at various levels of
abstraction. The research exploits both a general temporal representation, and
an efficient constraint propagation implementation of a reasoning technique to
achieve practical applications of the theoretical model. A prototype, minimally
intrusive debugging tool, FORESEE, can compare actual and expected program
behavior, flagging inconsistencies. The project extends the expressiveness of
the method, seeks further efficiencies in the representation, and studies the
effects of the incompleteness of the constraint propagation algorithm.
