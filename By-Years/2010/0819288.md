Based upon a submitted Scientific Program Overview (SPO) document for the PRE-
Depression Investigation of Cloud-systems in the Tropics (PREDICT) project, this
preliminary effort will focus on completion of travel required for coordination
of potential PREDICT investigators and limited site surveys needed to identify
suitable location(s) for operations involving research aircraft and associated
personnel. If ultimately supported, the PREDICT field campaign will conduct
detailed investigations of smaller-scale atmospheric disturbances within the
tropical and sub-tropical reaches of the central and western Atlantic basin,
with particular attention to gathering data needed to evaluate the so-called
"marsupial" theory of tropical cyclone formation. This paradigm centers on the
hypothesized existence of a zone within traveling wave-like atmospheric
disturbances that effectively isolates growing convective cloud systems from the
deleterious effects of deformational shear and dry airstreams, thus allowing
them to grow into more vigorous disturbances (termed tropical depressions) and,
in some cases, into full-fledged hurricanes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If supported,
PREDICT will utilize the NSF/NCAR GV aircraft as a platform for combined
dropsonde and in situ atmospheric measurements in close coordination with
additional observational platforms provided by other federal agencies. The
project's intellectual merit is centered on improved understanding of
atmospheric processes involved in hurricane formation and the ability to more
reliably differentiate those disturbances that will grow to become significant
tropical cyclones from those that fail to do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts of the planned field program will include training of graduate students,
increased collaboration and coordination among multiple research agencies and
hurricane researchers, and societal benefits growing out of more reliable
hurricane forecasts.
