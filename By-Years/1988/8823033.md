This award to the Elementary Particle Physics Group at the University of
Chicago is to support research on several projects: (1) the CDF detector at
Fermilab; (2) several experiments on CP violation at Fermilab; (3) the OPAL
experiment at LEP (CERN in Geneva, Switzerland); (4) the MEGA experiment at Los
Alamos; (5) a magnetic monopole search; and (6) an extensive air shower detector
array at Dugway Utah. The Chicago particle physics group performs experiments in
particle physics at many different laboratories. Their work is recognized as
among the most interesting and significant in the field. It will lead to greater
understanding of the fundamental forces and constituents of matter.
