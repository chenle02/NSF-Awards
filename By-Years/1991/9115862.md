A new console for a 500 MHz GE GN500 NMR spectrometer is requested. The
spectrometer will be used for two-and three- dimensional NMR studies of
macromolecular structure. The structural studies to be carried out include
investigations of the solution conformation of (1) DNA triplexes, (2) DNA
quadruplexes, (3) other unusual DNA structures, including oligonucleotides
containing B-Z junctions, (4) drug-DNA complexes, (5) protein-DNA complexes, (6)
designed peptides- protein complexes. The new console is essential for these
studies in order to be able to implement new three-dimensional NMR experiments
and experiments which require shaped pulses and to obtain higher quality two-
dimensional NMR spectra. The new console will replace a 6 year old Nicolet
1280-based GN500 console with a console that contains a computer that can handle
more sophisticated pulse sequences and modern electronics.
