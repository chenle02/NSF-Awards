This is an award to support for Phase II of a project initiated under NSF Grant
No. 88-60919 under conditions outlined in the Program Solicitation for Small
Business Innovation Research, NSF 88-8. The work under Phase I resulted in
demonstration of the feasibility of an innovative concept using microbes to
biologically degrade volatile halogenated aliphatic organic contaminants of
soil. The process achieved as much as 99.9 percent destruction of
trichloroethylene. In Phase II, the scope of the work will be narrowed to a
liquid-phase reactor that is of sufficiently large scale to facilitate full-
scale design and construction of prototype bioreactors and determine the
commercial applicability of the process by determining its efficiency and
economic feasibility. The contamination of ground and surface waters by organic
compounds that are the target of this research is a matter of great National
concern. It is imperative that technologies be developed that are more
efficiently responsive to decontamination of soil.1 Results of this project are
expected to be useful in this respect.
