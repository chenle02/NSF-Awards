This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study solutions to
the Cauchy-Riemann equations on domains with corners. The Cauchy-Riemann
equations are the fundamental differential equations in several complex
variables, and their study involves tools from potential theory, complex
geometry, and boundary value problems in partial differential equations. This
project will address qualitative questions, such as compactness for the solution
operator, and quantitative questions, such as regularity in Sobolev spaces. Much
is known about these questions when the boundary is smooth (although many open
problems remain), so this project will focus on the behavior of the solution
near corners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because so many phenomena in
modern physics are best described using the language of complex analysis, the
Cauchy-Riemann equations are a crucial tool for mathematical physics. In
addition to physical applications, they are also significant as models of
partial differential equations which behave with great regularity in the
interior of a domain but lose regularity at the boundary. Hence, results for the
Cauchy-Riemann equations provide a natural starting place for a much larger
class of equations with even greater applicability. These equations have been
studied extensively when the boundary of a domain is smooth, but in mathematics
as in the physical world, many domains have corners, so it is important to
understand how the properties of a solution change near the corners of a non-
smooth domain. Because these problems are related to harmonic analysis, complex
geometry, partial differential equations, and mathematical physics, the
potential for collaboration is high.
