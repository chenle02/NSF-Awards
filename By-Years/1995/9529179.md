The key objective of this research project is to discover principles that
underlie and enable the semantic interoperation of heterogeneous information
systems. Such systems comprise widely diverse and locally autonomous components
with potentially intricate mutual constraints. A major technical challenge is to
design activities that may execute over a number of components, but nevertheless
preserve the global semantic requirements, i.e., the integrity of the
information at large. This research project addresses the above challenge by (a)
innovating representations that capture the semantics of data and activities in
a unified mathematical framework; (b) developing techniques for reasoning about
the above semantics to derive the maximally relaxed semantic constraints on
data; (c) formulating design rules through which complex activities can be
systematically specified; and (d) implementing the design rules in a prototype
automated reasoning tool to assist in capturing and validating specifications of
heterogeneous activities. A centerpiece of this project is the evaluation and
iterative refinement of the developed techniques with respect to a taxonomy of
problems. Continuous evaluation, greatly facilitated by the automated reasoning
tool, is essential for discovering the lasting scientific principles of semantic
interoperation.
