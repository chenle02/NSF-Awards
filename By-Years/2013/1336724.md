The PIs request funding to acquire a spectrum-spanning (UV-NIR) raman-atomic
force microspectrometric system for submicron 3-D chemical mapping of cellular,
natural and synthetic materials. This instrument enables 3-D mapping of topology
and chemical functional groups across surfaces, and in and around cells, as well
as any other particle. The instrumentation will be used for analyses of single
cells, aerosols, surfaces, biofilms, coatings, and both natural and novel
synthetic materials. It will be used for projects in marine, atmospheric,
environmental, biological, chemical, and materials sciences, and biomedical
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
instrumentation will benefit a broad portfolio of research fields including
ocean and atmospheric sciences, material science, and medical science. The
research projects have important applications toward understanding global
geochemical cycling, atmospheric aerosol physics, materials development,
materials degradation, and medicine. The training of students at all educational
levels appears guaranteed by the track record of SBU in general, and the PIs.
