This research project is aimed at developing a knowledge- based process
planning system for dimensional inspection of discrete-part products using
coordinate measuring machines in a computer-integrated manufacturing
environment. The project is structured to rigorously investigate critical issues
in such dimensional inspection, including evaluation of software algorithms,
evaluation of uncertainties in measurement results, design of inspection
strategies, capturing of dimensional inspection knowledge in computer systems,
and generation of standard inspection programs. The system uses product
definition data, dimensional inspection expertise, and knowledge-based expert
systems to generate process plans for dimensional inspection applications. The
system also generates part inspection programs to be executed on coordinate
measurement machines, which represent an emerging automated dimensional
inspection technology widely accepted by industry. The research is a pragmatic
problem and contains a wealth of research problems that require innovative
ideas. Major improvements in product quality, inspection throughput and
flexibility for moderate to low volume applications are anticipated. The
research focus is on seamless flow of product and production information. The
research results will be applicable in establishing a critical link between the
islands of automation of design and inspection. It may also advance the state of
the art of automated dimensional inspection technology.
