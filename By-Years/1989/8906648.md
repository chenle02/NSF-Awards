This award supports the research in Algebraic and Analytic Number Theory of
Professor Eduardo Friedman of the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Friedman's
project involves using analytic methods to investigate the behavior of the ratio
of the regulators in an extension of number fields. Also, in the related
geometric situation, the function field case, Professor Friedman will be
examining the distribution of divisor class groups of curves over a function
field. The subject of Analytic Number Theory applies to the discrete realm of
the whole numbers the techniques of Analysis, dependent on the notions of
continuity and limit, originating in Calculus. The idea of using continuous
methods to investigate the discrete is two centuries old, but with the work of
the modern analytic number theorists such as Professor Friedman, the field has
had a new rebirth.
