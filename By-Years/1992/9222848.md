Neuropeptides, a very heterogenous group of compounds located throughout the
brain, play an important role in the communication of signals between neurons.
Some neuropeptides function as traditional neurotransmitters while other perform
modulatory or regulatory roles. The proenkephalin peptides function as signaling
molecules in the brain and hormones in the peripheral system. Dr. McMurray is
interested in the mechanisms by which cell surface receptors can signal the
turning on and off of the proenkephalin gene. By using an experimental approach
that includes a powerful combination of biophysical and molecular biological
techniques, she will characterize protein-DNA interactions involved in the
transactivation of the human enkephalin gene. Dr. McMurray has developed
genetically- engineered regulatory proteins to examine the signals that occur
between the cell surface and the gene. Moreover, she will use both natural genes
and genetically altered genes to determine how the regulatory proteins interact
with brain signaling genes to "turn on" expression. The results from these
studies will provide a detailed molecular structure and function of the
proenkephalin gene. These findings may lead to new insights in the fundamental
processes underlying gene expression and begin to unravel the receptor-mediated
pathways that are commonly used in both hormonal responses and
neurotransmission.
