This project supports research conducted by Dr. Rozeanne Steckler, a research
scientist, at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) Advances in electronic
structure software and in computer hardware have made the calculations of
energetics of experimentally interesting chemical systems a reality. Dr.
Steckler will work on the development of a software program called CADRATE,
which will be an integration of CADPAC3 and POLYRATE4. THis effort will also
include the development of a better user interface to POLYRATE. THe results of
this project will further enable chemists of all disciples to use the power of
the supercomputer to model chemical reactions being studied in the laboratory.
