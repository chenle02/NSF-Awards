This Leadership Activities program will provide enhancement and professional
development experiences for 24 teachers in the earth, physical, and biological
sciences, who have demonstrated potential leadership abilities in science
education. The participants will be recruited Nation-wide with special efforts
to include individuals who have been selected as presidential scholars or
identified as exceptional science teachers. Three high-ability geology majors,
who have not yet opted for a science teaching career, will be invited to
participate in a workshop for credit. It is hoped that this involvement will
kindle an interest in a science teaching career. The objectives of this program
are to provide formal classroom instruction on the evolution of the Cascade
volcanoes including magma genesis and plate tectonics, and to include
information about the economic, social and environmental impacts of the
eruptions of Mt. St. Helens from 1980 to present. The instructional vehicles
will be field trips, field exercises, laboratory exercises, discussions,
computer simulations and group work. The workshop is scheduled for two weeks
August 4-16, 1986. Most of the formal workshop instruction will take place at
the University with provision for field trips and field work taking place on
site at Mount St. Helens and other locations. Follow-up activities will include
participants sharing their acquired knowledge and skills with colleagues and
students and expanding the literacy of the community at large about science.
Project information and results will be available through commercial and
participant- prepared materials, both photographic and textual.
