Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) integrate devices that can interact with each other
and the physical world around them. With CPS applications, engineers monitor the
structural health of highways and bridges, farmers check the health of their
crops, and ecologists observe wildlife in their natural habitat. Using sensory
side-channels (e.g., light, temperature, infrared, acoustic), an adversary can
successfully attack CPS devices and applications by (1) triggering existing
malware, (2) transferring malware, (3) combining multiple side-channels to
increase the impact of a threat, or (4) leaking sensitive information. This
project develops novel security tools and techniques to protect CPS devices and
applications against sensory side-channel threats. The project results are
released as an open source project, so interested software developers can extend
and reuse them in other CPS research. Broader impacts include educational
training and tools for the CPS field, and a collaboration with the Miami-Dade
County Public Schools (M-DCPS), to expose underrepresented middle school
students to state-of-the art technology topics to pique students' interests in
cyber-security and cyber-physical systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
investigates the sensory side-channel (e.g., acoustic, seismic, light,
temperature) threats to CPS devices and applications and evaluates the
feasibility and practicality of the attacks on real CPS equipment. The result is
novel sensory side-channel-aware security tools and techniques for the CPS
devices. Specifically, the principal investigator (1) analyzes the physical
characteristics of the sensory CPS side-channels to understand how the physical
world impacts the cyber world of CPS devices; (2) investigates the information
leakage through the sensory side-channels on the CPS devices; (3) develops a
novel IDS particularly designed to be aware of the sensory CPS side-channels;
(4) designs and develops a CPS security testbed for test and experiments on real
equipment and simulation tools.
