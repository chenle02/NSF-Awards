The focus of this research is to develop new methods for sterically controlled
carbon-carbon bond formation. The use of the reaction of lithium enolates with
excess aldehyde to afford anti 1,3-diol derivatives via a sequence of addition
followed by an intramolecular Tishchenko-type hydride-transfer reaction will be
explored. The scope, mechanism and application of the methodology to organic
synthetic problems will be stressed. With this new award, the Synthetic Organic
Program is supporting the research of Dr. Keith A. Woerpel, a young investigator
in the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine.
Professor Woerpel will focus his work on developing methods for stereocontrolled
carbon-carbon bond formation . The methodology, which uses a sequence of
addition and reduction reactions, will offer new pathways for the syntheses of
biologically active molecules.
