This award supports the research of Professor E. Canfield to work in
combinatorics. He intends to investigate asymptotic behavior of solutions to
recurrence equations, maps on surfaces, cycle sizes in permutations, random
partitions and Hamiltonian cycles in a class of random degree restricted graphs.
The research is in the general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to
find efficient methods to study how discrete collections of objects can be
organized. And, so it is extremely important to modern communications, for
example the design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of
algorithms in computer science.
