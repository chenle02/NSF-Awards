This project is designed to engage early childhood teachers and early childhood
staff development efforts of Alaska in science education. Content and
methodologies of science education will be taught within the framework of
developmentally appropriate, emergent curriculum for young children. The initial
staff development activity of the project is a four week summer institute.
During the subsequent school year, mentoring, computer networking, and
presentation of district and statewide inservices will support the summer
instruction. The project will use the existing organization, instructional
strategies, and staff of the successful Alaska Science Consortium and meld these
with early childhood methodologies, leaders and networks. This project is
appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement Program because of its systemic plan to
enhance the science teaching of all teachers of elementary science in the
district. Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 48% of the amount requested from
NSF.
