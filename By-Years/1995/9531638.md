9531638 Giordano Advanced lithographic techniques will be used to make several
different types of extremely small metallic structures. These structures, which
will have one or more dimensions in the 100 - 300 , will be used to study
fundamental problems in condensed matter physics. Issues which will be addressed
include the behavior of magnetic impurities near surfaces and in the presence of
a disordered environment, quantum mechanical behavior off magnetic domain walls
in ferromagnets, and fluctuations near critical points in ultra-small systems.
In addition to providing new insights into these fundamental problems, this work
should also be relevant to the technological problems associated with advanced
micro-fabrication processes, and to high density information storage in magnetic
media. %%% This continuing improvements in micro-fabrication techniques, such as
those used to make hgth density integrated circuits, provide unique
opportunities for basic physics research. Many interesting phenomena occur only
in extremely small structures. This work will use small structures as tools to
address several fundamental questions in condensed matter physics. These
questions include the behavior of magnetic impurities in metals, and the quantum
mechanical behavior of domain walls in magnets. This fundamental work is also
for technological interest, since the physics that will be elucidated will be
relevant to future generations electronic devices. In particular, the work on
domain walls will be of direct relevance to high density magnetic storage
devices. Moreover, the lithographic methods that will be used are prototypes of
the methods that will be required to produce future generations of electronic
devices. Progress made now in developing and refining new laboratory scale
lithographic techniques may prove useful in the fabrication of the next
generation of devices. ***
