This significant upgrade of the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) facilitates
controlled studies of fundamental plasma processes in the behavior of naturally
occurring plasmas in the auroral ionosphere, magnetosphere, solar wind, solar
corona, and interstellar medium. Upgrade activities include a 1 1/2 increase in
length, doubled magnetic field strength, 100% increase in diagnostic port
access, auxiliary ion heating capability, and dual sources for counter-streaming
studies. The device will continue to provide new results and training for young
researchers.
