New laboratory experiences for undergraduates in three Biology courses which
have a substantial Physiology component (Human Anatomy and Physiology,
Principles of Biology, and The Biological World) are being developed using new
equipment acquired through this grant. The project has three major foci:
teaching students how to interface computers with laboratory equipment, how to
use computers to acquire data, and how to manipulate and analyze data with
computer assistance. This equipment makes it possible to consider aspects of
cardiovascular physiology, respiratory physiology, and the physiology of
reflexes that previously could not be addressed in these courses because the
requisite equipment was lacking. Laboratory experiments in other areas also are
being upgraded by involving students more directly. Laboratories being improved
in this way include the EKG labs; lung physiology labs; exercise physiology
labs; and labs in biochemistry and human genetics (where computer simulations
are being used extensively). A laboratory manual is being prepared that reflects
the hands-on experiences of this P.I. and his students.
