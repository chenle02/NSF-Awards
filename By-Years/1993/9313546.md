9313546 Hayes This award will allow the University of Indiana to modernize its
laboratory space that was originally built to accommodate classical rock
analysis in 1962 and now must be adapted for research in isotopic
biogeochemistry. New hoods and lob benches will be installed, a computer and
data facility will be established, and a core-storage and layout room provided
with this renovation project. The biogeochemistry labs at the University of
Indiana are used by four senior faculty and serve as an important training
center for individuals establishing biogeochemistry research groups at other
university locations. Through geoscience research, the focus of this lab is on
the cycling of carbon in modern and ancient environments. To provide a basis for
interpretation of ancient records, members of this research lab study structured
fractionation of stable isotopes in modern environments and microbial cultures,
the stabilization of sedimentary chemical systems in contemporary settings, and
the distribution and abundance's of molecular structures in modern organisms.
The origin and development of fossil fuels, the geochemistry of sedimentary
carbon, and the development of instrumentation and techniques for both the
analysis of stable isotopes in traces of organic material and organic molecules
are additional research themes. The modernization of this laboratory is very
important for the training of the next generation of biogeochemists, low-
temperature geochemists, and geochemically-oriented geobiologists and
sedimentologists who will give us new knowledge about global change issues. ***
