9400889 Keisler Many existence theorems in analysis have standard proofs using
convergence arguments and nonstandard proofs yielding stronger results using
lifting arguments. The investigator has recently introduced a new model-
theoretic method of proving existence theorems, where one can often make an easy
computation to obtain an approximate solution to a problem, and then invoke a
general forcing theorem to get a harder result giving an exact solution. The
present project will continue development of this method. For a variety of
problems in both pure and applied mathematics, it is easy to show that there are
approximate solutions but very difficult to show that there are exact solutions.
This is typical for stochastic differential equations, optimization problems,
and equilibrium problems. Keisler's new approach to such problems, which is
justified by a theorem in mathematical logic, can often dramatically simplify
the construction of exact solutions. This method has already produced several
new results and has the potential of becoming a valuable and broadly applicable
tool. ***
