9603264 Vashishta This award supports a three-year collaborative research
project between Professor Priya Vashishta of Louisiana State University at Baton
Rouge and Professor Hiroshi Iyetomi of Niigata University in Japan. The
researchers will undertake studies of molecular dynamics simulations of
synthetic functional materials on parallel computers. The focus of the project
will be on large-scale atomistic simulations of materials used in the
electronics industry. They plan to carry out the following activities: develop
parallel algorithms for electronic structure calculations and MD simulations;
perform electronic structure analyses of targeted materials; perform large-scale
MD simulation; and carry out neutron-scattering experiments. The proposal brings
together two groups that have complementary computational skills and
experimental expertise in order to investigate various properties and processes
in these materials: electronic structure calculations; parallel algorithms;
large-scale molecular dynamics simulations; and neutron scattering experiments.
Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base
of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation. ***
