Late-Quaternary paleoenvironments of southwestern Alaska have received little
study, and the relationship of past environmental changes in this region to
those in more-interior regions of Beringia is not yet completely understood.
Analyses of fossil insect and pollen assemblages from late-Quaternary sediments
of the Nushagak, Holitna, and Upper Kuskokwin lowlands have yielded significant
new information on this previously neglected region of the Beringian refugium.
Conditions somewhat more humid than those at interior sites apparently persisted
in southwestern Alaska during the late-Pleistocene, and this region may have
provided refugial environments for insects that could not survive at more-
continental localities. Fossil assemblages of stenothermic insect taxa also
provide a means of constraining past summer temperatures in this portion of
Alaska, contributing to our knowledge of climatic conditions in Beringia as a
whole. One of the strengths of the research project is the analysis of multiple
sites from the southwestern Alaska region, allowing a clearer picture of the
regional paleoenvironmental signal and the degree of local variability. These
paleoentomological and palynological studies will provide a more complete late-
Quaternary paleoenvironmental record for southwestern Alaska, with emphasis on
(1) the transition from last-glacial to Holocene climates and (2) the
possibility of a Middle Wisconsinan warm interval previously recognized only in
interior regions of eastern Beringia. The results of the study will contribute
substantially toward the determination of late-Quaternary climatic and
environmental gradients across the Beringian subcontinent and toward an
understanding of the ecological dynamics of this late-Pleistocene refugium.
