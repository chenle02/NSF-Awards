The study of social interaction, the observation of behavior in its social
context, is a central endeavor of developmental, personality and social
psychologists. Accordingly, this project establishes a "Social Interaction
Laboratory" for undergraduate instruction in a range of seven courses from
Introductory Psychology to upper-level research seminars. Funds support the
purchase of a) videotape equipment to allow students to make permanent records
of interaction in laboratory or natural settings, b) an integrated
video/computer system for on-line coding of interaction data, and c) software
for the analysis of interaction data. This laboratory enhances the current
curriculum, and in some cases allows for the first time, students to observe, be
trained, and actively participate in the study of human social interaction.
Applications include studies of mother-infant interaction, dominance hierarchies
in children's play, the dynamics of gender in small group discussions, analyses
of political debates, and a number of other projects. The institution is
matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
