9321346 Kangari The objective of this research is to establish an innovative and
creative engineering solution to the existing construction by exploring new
ideas and developing a generic framework for utilization of automation
technology in flexible construction of an automated building. This allows for
the identification of major systems variables which must be considered. The
scope of the research is limited to: 1) Development and investigation of
innovative concepts for automated building construction materials transfer
operations, 2) Development and investigation of new concepts for flexible
automated building construction resources.
