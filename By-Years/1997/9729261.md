Abstract ATM-9729261 Clark, Peter Oregon State University Title: Support of a
Chapman Conference on Mechanisms of Millennial- Scale Global Climate Change;
June 1998 This award will support a Chapman Conference on "Mechanisms of
Millennial-Scale Global Climate Change," in June 1998. This conference will
provide an international forum for discussion of mechanisms that may account for
millennial-scale climate change. Unlike orbital-scale climate change. which has
a well-defined forcing mechanism in changes in solar insolation, the cause(s) of
millennial-scale climate variation remain(s) unknown. The growing paleoclimate
database relevant to this issue is now of significant breadth to provide
critical information required to address these issues. The central themes of
this conference will address two key questions: (1) what is the sensitivity of
various components of the Earth's climate system to millennial-scale climate
change? (2) What are the mechanisms, linkages, and feedbacks which produce
millennial-scale climate change?
