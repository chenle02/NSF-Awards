9352282 Veldkamp Precalculus students and preservice teachers are the primary
beneficiaries of expanding the use of the computer laboratory concept at Dordt
College. A computerized approach to mathematics instruction is enabling
undergraduate students to discover mathematical theories and use electronic
technology to come to a better understanding of mathematical concepts. With
secondary education mathematics majors as assistant instructors, preservice
teachers are obtaining hands-on experience using electronic technology in the
classroom and teaching students to use such technology appropriately. ***
