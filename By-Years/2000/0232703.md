This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves
developing an ion-assisted plasma-enhanced deposition process for producing
solid-state proton-conducting hydrated metal oxygen cluster-based materials to
serve as electrolytes in electrochromic (EC) devices. Recent developments in
infrared and THz sensors, superconducting electronics and EC thermal control
systems require rugged solid-state electrolytes for low temperature high speed
operation. Hydrated metal oxygen clusters deposited from solutions can extend
the performance of existing EC systems but are not compatible with solid state
vapor phase deposition processes. Eclipse suggests developing a modified
duoplasmatron system to deposit thin-films of metal clusters serving as ion
conductors in EC devices. The objectives include fabrication of a microplasma
cluster deposition system, selection of metal oxide precursors, deposition and
characterization of thin film electrolytes, fabrication and performance
evaluation of EC devices. The proposal innovation is the use of enhanced
microplasma deposition to prepare ionic conductors with controlled
microstructures for use in EC systems. This effort will result in improved
control of the microstructure of intercalation materials afforded by the
proposed plasma deposition technique leading to advances in batteries, catalysts
and nano-structured materials for electronics, optics, and low temperature
applications. Successful completion of the program will result in the
development of EC devices having substantially lower operating temperature,
improved contrast ratio, faster switching speed and greater mechanical stability
for use in terrestrial and space-based thermal control systems, in visible and
IR sensors, and in optical data storage systems.
