Earlier work by the PI and other investigatiors suggest that boron isotopes may
be valuable and unique tracers of fluids derived during dehydration of the
subducting slab at island arcs. This project will study the extent of
lithosphere recycling back into the mantle as expressed in inter-oceanic island
are basalts using boron as a tracer. Approximately 40 samples from the Halmahera
arc have already been subjected to extensive petrologic, geochemical and
isotopic analysis, and these will be used for the boron studies. This work is
expected to confirm the usefulness of boran as a tracer, and to shed new light
on the role of fluids from the subducting slab.
