This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2009. The
fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "Characterizing the
molecular basis of muscle contraction using a white-noise method of system
analysis" for Bertrand Tanner. The host institution for this research is the
University of Vermont, and the sponsoring scientist is David Maughan.

Biological systems generally exhibit complicated behavior driven by underlying
spatial, chemical, and mechanical processes. This research develops and applies
engineering techniques of system analysis to identify and describe molecular
processes that underlie contraction in muscle tissue. This technique uses small,
random changes in muscle length (white-noise length stimuli) to distinguish
linear and non-linear portions of the muscle response. Specifically, this
research utilizes flight muscle fibers stripped of their cellular membranes to
allow control of their chemical environment. This methodology will facilitate
measurements over a physiological range of muscle distortions, while
simultaneously sampling a broader frequency range of the muscle response than is
available with current measurement techniques. These proposed measurements will
reveal dynamic properties of invertebrate muscle in unprecedented detail, and
set the stage for applying white-noise analysis to vertebrate muscle and other
biological systems.

The training goals are development of computational tools used to predict
complex biological behavior and for study of biomechanics. Broader impacts of
this work include training undergraduate students to use mathematical models to
study muscle contraction. This research provides a basic framework for study of
biomechanical systems at various levels, from individual molecules to entire
organisms.
