The goal of this project is to build a domain-independent, language-independent,
statistically-trained shallow semantic interpreter. This is a sophisticated,
robust, widely-available tool that takes text sentences as input and provides a
`shallow' representation of the meaning of the sentence. The research addresses
key scientific questions including the nature of automatically-extractable
linguistic features that link surface form with semantic structure, the extent
to which features and representations are robust across languages, and the
combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shallow semantic interpreter works in both English and
Chinese by analyzing sentences into propositions involving predicates together
with their arguments, labeled by sets of semantic roles (Agent, Patient,
Instrument, Location, etc). The project relies on a statistical machine-learning
paradigm, including supervised approaches in which features are extracted from
two large semantically-labeled databases (FrameNet and PropBank), as well as
unsupervised and lightly-supervised methods like clustering with graphical
models, co-training, and active learning, including various sophisticated
linguistic features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the project will allow
shallow semantic representations to be incorporated into an entire range of key
Natural Language Processing applications, including information extraction and
machine translation. The research will also provide important knowledge about
the linguistic features that are cues to meaning. Finally, the project will
provide key publicly-available databases for other research. These include the
combined FrameNet and PropBank database, which will be a rich resource for
applications using the Semantic Web and ontologies in general, as well as a
richly-annotated Chinese PropBank, and aligned English and Chinese corpora
useful for machine translation research. &lt;br/&gt;
