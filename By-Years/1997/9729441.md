This research is on hierarchical and symbolic test generation and design for
testability techniques for core- based systems. The system can be a combination
of soft, firm and hard cores. In the case of untestable soft cores, hierarchical
testability techniques are being applied to make them testable. Also techniques
of adding hardware so the cores are functionally transparent and can propagate
test data without information loss are being developed. The approach is to
integrate testable and transparent cores to ensure justification of precomputed
test sequences. This test generation approach is independent of the bit-width of
the cores. The case of firm and hard cores which have testability features built
into them by core providers is also being explored. Approaches here include:
using information supplied by the core vendor; use of in-built testability
features; and providing transparency through glue logic outside the core.
