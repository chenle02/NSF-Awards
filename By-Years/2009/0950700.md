Symbiotic associations between two organisms cost each organism resources in
exchange for the benefits they receive from the association; thus they are
tightly regulated by both partners. In the case of the relationship between the
legume plant M. truncatula and its bacterial partner, a major plant regulator of
the number of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing nodules that form is a protein called
SUNN. SUNN regulates the interaction systemically (throughout the plant) and
thus must communicate regulation through other proteins not yet identified. This
project addresses the question of what proteins interact with SUNN by taking the
critical first step of creating a tool to answer the question. The investigators
will create a plant carrying a version of SUNN with a tag to allow retrieval of
SUNN and interacting proteins from whole plants for analysis. The tag is a short
piece of protein for which commercial antibodies are available, allowing the
investigators to isolate SUNN through standard techniques and then identify the
interacting partner proteins. The investigators will prove that this tagged
protein behaves like the normal version of SUNN by a genetic technique called
complementation, in which the tagged SUNN placed in a mutant plant with no SUNN
protein restores the mutant plant to normality. Because legumes contribute to
33% of humankind's protein intake and serve as an important source of fodder and
forage for animals as well as a source of edible and industrial oils,
understanding the signaling involved in regulating legume symbiosis will allow
scientists to develop strategies to maintain soil quality and sustainability
while protecting the environment over the long term, reducing costs for food and
biofuel production. Undergraduate students, including members of under-
represented groups, will be trained as part of this project, and will be
recruited every year through existing programs.
