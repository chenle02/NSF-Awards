The objective of this project is to continue collaborative efforts between
Michigan State University and North Carolina State University to explore the
thermophilicity of class II xylose isomerases (XIs) with the ultimate goal of
providing the scientific and engineering bases for a superior isomerization
process. The specific research objectives include: (1) to use protein
engineering to develop a superior XI able to produce a 55% fructose syrup at
high temperature and low pH in the absence of unwanted by-product formation and
without the requirement for a chromatographic enrichment step; (2) to address
the bioprocessing issues relevant to such biocatalysts; (3) to examine the
differences and similarities among class II XIs as a basis for developing
thermostabilization and thermoactivation strategies useful for other enzymes;
and (4) to consider other monosaccharide biotransformations that operate at
elevated temperatures and that have technological potential. &lt;br/&gt;
