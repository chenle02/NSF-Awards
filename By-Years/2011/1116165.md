Intellectual Merit: This project aims to help Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) to more successfully compete for funds that support STEM
education. To achieve this aim, the Capstone Institute at Howard University
proposes to conduct a needs assessment of and develop an intervention plan to
help level the playing field. The goal ensures that HBCUs become a vital part of
grant application and funding processes available through federal agencies and
private and public foundations. The Capstone Institute offers 25 of 105 HBCUs an
opportunity to participate in grant-related activities that include: a
comprehensive needs assessment, customized workshops based on the outcomes of
the needs assessment, access to experienced grant writers and expert mentors,
and technical assistance through extensive follow-up interactions and services.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: To broaden participation and improve STEM
opportunities more evenly, the Capstone Institute intends to help build capacity
on participating HBCU campuses. The big idea is to enable HBCUs to contribute
more successfully to rapidly expanding STEM fields while promoting awareness and
interests of their students in STEM careers.
