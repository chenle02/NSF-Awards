9421125 Bradley An important problem in understanding brain/behavior
relationships is to determine how neural programs that generate and coordinate
movement are established during early development. With this award Dr. Nina
Bradley will use an important model system, the chick embryo, to describe the
coordination that develops between the limbs during development. The studies
will be conducted to describe the normal developmental sequence, and also to
learn about the relative importance of intrinsic developmental changes in the
nervous system versus changes in mechanical input from the environment for
producing developmental changes in motor coordination. This work will greatly
enhance our understanding of the control mechanisms that lead to appropriate
maturation of behavior, and is likely to suggest ways that environmental
influences can positively influence brain and behavior. ***
