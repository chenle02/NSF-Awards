A new, unified approach for estimating spectral densities of spatial processes
is proposed. The theoretical properties as well as practical implementation
issues of this approach will be thoroughly explored. The completion of this
project will provide powerful new tools for kriging, or optimal prediction in
certain situations in spatial data analysis. Based on the relationship between
the generalized covariance and the spectral density, a new approach is
formulated for estimating the spectral density in terms of solving a regularized
inverse problem. The generalized covariance can then be estimated thorough the
estimated spectral density, which paves the way for kriging. The regularized
inverse problem is solved in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space essentially as a
constrained optimization problem. A number of crucial issues arise from that.
Candidate procedures based on the ideas of unbiased-risk and generalized cross-
validation will be studied for the determination of the optimal smoothing
parameters from data. Theoretical properties, including mean squared error
bounds and asymptotic properties, will be investigated to assess the performance
of the approach. Efficient computational algorithms will be sought to overcome
the difficulties brought by the high-dimensional nature of the data.

The research in this project offers a new perspective on the analysis of spatial
data. The kind of data that the investigator has in mind are data observed at
multiple spatial locations and possibly also at multiple time points. The
general goals are to identify the data generation process and to make
predictions beyond the spatial-temporal region where data are available. One of
the keys in such problems is to understand the dependence relationship between
the various pieces of the data. The approach in this project targets this
problem for a broad class of models. Potential applications of the new theory
and methodology exist in numerous contexts, including the environment,
geography, and sensor networks.
