9411487 Rowlands This Research Equipment Grant will make it possible for the
Department of Engineering Mechanics and Astronautics at the University of
Wisconsin to purchase a Moire Interferometer which will be dedicated to the
support of research for several ongoing fundamental research projects dealing
with metal-plate wood connectors, superconductors, electronic devices and
composites. The Moire Interferometry system will enable attainment of the
fundamental scientific and engineering information needed to formulate better
design criteria, develop new and innovative materials, improve the safety and
reliability of the nation's infrastructure and conserve natural resources. ***
