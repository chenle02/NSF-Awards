*** 9660090 Genders This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
study the electrochemical synthesis of propylene oxide. This proposal describes
novel composite electrode structures that are expected to offer a low cost route
to the electrosynthesis of propylene oxide. The primary focus of the proposal
will be on the electrochemical epoxidation of propylene to form propylene oxide.
The incorporation of specific electrocatalyts into high surface area electrodes
will be examined. The techniques used are also expected to be of general use in
other epoxidation reactions. Propylene oxide production represents an annual
market value of $2 billion in the US alone. A new low cost route to propylene
oxide and/or propylene glycol would have significant economic benefit. In
addition to the commodity market, an electrochemical route to propylene oxide
will also offer a cost effective method for smaller scale on-site manufacturing.
