This research is focused on two key enzymes involved in antibiotic
(ansatrienin) synthesis and one that plays a role in fatty acid synthesis and
oxidation in Streptomyces collinus. Continued biochemical characterization and
cloning of one reductase will be accompanied by efforts to isolate, purify and
characterize a second such enzyme, but here one that is connected with primary
metabolism. Cloning of this enzyme is expected to follow, as are studies of a
second of the enoyl reductases. Sequence studies should permit a comparison of
the primary and secondary metabolism enzymes and lead to a better understanding
of the interrelationships of the relevant genes. //
