The source of quartz in sedimentary rocks has been a topic of intense interest
to sedimentary petrologists for more than 100 years, with the major effort
devoted to sand-size grains. However, at least half of all detrital quartz is of
silt size and the origin of these grains has proved to be a more difficult
problem. PI will examine grain size, petrographic and oxygen isotopic changes in
coexisting quartz and illite during the transition from shale to slate to
phyllite in pelites of the Stanley Formation (Mississippian) in the Ouachita
Mountains of Arkansas. In the core area of the Ouachitas these pelites have
developed slaty cleavage and in the central part of the core they have developed
the sheen associated with growth of phyllosilicate minerals that characterizes
phyllites. The results of this study, when correlated with published vitrinite
reflectance data, will establish (1) the temperature at which detrital quartz in
shales reequilibrates with the sediment pile during very low- grade
metamorphism; (2) the relationship between oxygen isotopic values in quartz and
metamorphic grade in the slate-phyllite series; (3) the conditions during very
low-grade metamorphism in which grain size and proportion of polycrystalline
quartz increase; (4) the relationship between field appearance (shale, slate,
phyllite) of pelites and the various petrographic and isotopic variations.
