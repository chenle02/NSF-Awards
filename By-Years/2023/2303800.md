Devontae Baxter is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Fellowship to carry
out a program of research and education at the University of California, San
Diego. Baxter will combine cutting-edge observations and state-of-the-art
simulations of galaxy groups and clusters to determine what drives the
suppression (or quenching) of star formation in satellite galaxies, and whether
the process is different in the early cosmos. Baxter will also launch the
Computational Astrophysics Research Preparation (CARP) program to provide
prospective community college transfer students with i) the computational skills
necessary to begin academic research and ii) relevant mentorship to aid in their
transfer process and subsequent success at and beyond the four-year university.
This project will combine large volume, high-resolution cosmological N-body
simulations with observations from the most comprehensive spectroscopic and
multi-passband imaging surveys of galaxy groups and clusters to (1) isolate the
dominant quenching mechanism responsible for breaking the gas-star cycle in
satellites of massive groups at z ~ 1; (2) place robust constraints on the halo-
mass dependence of environmental quenching at z < 1; (3) constrain the redshift
evolution of the quenching timescale for group and cluster populations over the
last 8 billion years; and (4) make physically motivated predictions for the
poorly constrained quiescent population of the progenitors of massive clusters â€“
i.e. protoclusters.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
