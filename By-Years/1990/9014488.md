With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Gellman will evaluate the
contribution made by hydrogen bonds that involve amide groups toward determining
the overall conformational stability of globular proteins. The project utilizes
small, flexible molecules that contain a limited number of amide groups to
dissect the contribution of this one particular class of non-covalent
interaction. Results obtained from this work are expected to afford increased
understanding of the factors that determine three-dimensional protein structure
and, accordingly, that direct the biological function (enzymatic, regulatory or
structural) of a globular protein. Conformational preferences in the various
model systems will be studied spectroscopically under conditions in which
internal hydrogen bonds are energetically significant. Conformational
preferences observed in a series of closely related oligoamides should provide
information about the manner in which hydrogen bond strength is affected by the
spatial orientation of the bonding partners. This analysis also should reveal
the manner in which hydrogen bonds are affected by other internal non-covalent
interactions, and also how they are affected by the environment (e.g., solvent).
