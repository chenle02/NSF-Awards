The aim of the project is to explore relations between quantum theory,
computational complexity, and geometry and topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the
intersection of geometry/topology and computational complexity, the project will
research the computational difficulty of topological properties of knots and
links in ordinary 3-dimensional space, and of 3-dimensional manifolds. For
instance, when are two 3-manifolds the same? Or, given a diagram of a knot, is
it the unknot? The project will explore both easiness results, that certain
answers can be computed quickly, possibly with artificial help; and hardness
results, that certain answers are intrinsically difficult to
compute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the intersection of quantum theory and
computational complexity, the project will consider both easiness results and
hardness results for core problems in quantum computation. One of the most
exciting mathematical discoveries of our era is the concept of a new type of
computer, a quantum computer, that would be able to run new algorithms that
cannot be run on a standard computer. A fundamental question which will be
addressed by this research is what quantum computers would be able to do, if
they were built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the intersection of quantum theory and
geometry and topology, the project will consider geometric problems with
implications for quantum non-locality as described by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
and by John Bell. The project will also consider new geometric spaces motivated
by the theory of quantum error correction in quantum
computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project begin with
the importance of its research areas. In particular, if quantum computers are
eventually built, then their impact on society will be substantial. The proposed
research has various implications for quantum computation. The project will
disseminate its results through the arXiv e-print server, and help support the
arXiv. The project will also develop expositions in quantum computation and
computational complexity.
