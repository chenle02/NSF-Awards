This multi-disciplinary exploratory research work involves sensor design and
signal processing in magnetic recording systems. It involves the use of multi-
sensor head structures (which is different from multi-track structures) along a
track, signal processing techniques applied to these multi-sensor signals to
increase the signal to noise ratio and hence the clarity of magnetic recording
and characterization/analysis of track edge noise. Also, the multi-sensor data
are used to implement a high resolution, continuously monitored track-edge
following servo system for very high density application. This would free up the
5%-30% of track width that is being used to store information for present
embedded servoing methods and hence increase the recording density.
