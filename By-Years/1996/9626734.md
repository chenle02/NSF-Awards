The objectives of this project are to determine what spider species live in the
Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which has a very rich but relatively
unknown invertebrate fauna. In fact, the PI anticipates that as many as 60
species of spiders previously unknown to science will be discovered during the
course of the study. Eighteen target habitats will be thoroughly sampled within
the 207,000-hectare Park. The results of the inventory will be distributed in
the form of an online database and spider identification guide that will be
useful in managing Park resources, providing an educational experience for Park
visitors and others, and in future ecological and systematic research on
spiders. The PI will involve students in all aspects of the study, providing
them with a rich experience in natural habitats and in sampling and analytical
protocols. | H H + (á▀áG À F G ( n H H + ( d ' ╔ @ -- aÝª ▀ ªá = ÓaOÀ h¢µ +'ª`0
