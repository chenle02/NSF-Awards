This Small Business Innovation Program (SBIR) Phase I project advances antenna
technology and wireless network performance by developing a basis for a new kind
of wireless mesh network node, i.e. integrated router, radio and antenna.
Networking has proven to be an important productivity resource, but can come at
a high cost especially for high-­&#8208;data rates. Dramatic capacity gains in
urban networks are achieved by deploying directional antennas at higher
frequency to minimize interference and allow substantial frequency reuse. Indoor
mounting of nodes in windows is desirable to avoid complications with landlords,
avoid weather, and decrease RF path loss. Finally, larger antennas produce more
directionality, so the desired wireless node needs a large surface area and yet
must be something that people are willing to hang in their windows, i.e.
transparent and attractive. This project will use transparent conductive
coatings in combination with Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) radio
technology to establish the feasibility of a mostly transparent wireless node
that achieves a 6 degree wide beam that is electronically steerable over >120
degrees.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes increased US
competitiveness by facilitating the spread of high speed Internet access and
through the sale of innovative new devices in the US and worldwide. Community
networks will deploy these nodes, as they are the lowest cost and simplest way
to create an inter-­&#8208;building network. In particular, delivering signals
via windows overcomes RF absorption in the masonry structures typical of public
housing projects. Successful commercialization of this technology will
significantly reduce the cost and increase the performance of urban wireless
networks, thus helping extend Internet access to un-­&#8208; and
under-­&#8208;served neighborhoods and reducing the cost of offloading 3G/4G
wireless traffic to local Wi-­&#8208;Fi hotspots.
