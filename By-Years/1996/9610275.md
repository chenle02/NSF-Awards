9610275 Hamrick The proposed research will measure several factors involved
with the breeding structure of populations of three Neotropical tree species,
Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Hymenaea courbaril and Spondias mombin. These three
species are pollinated by different pollinators, have different seed dispersal
mechanisms and occur at very different population densities. Study sites will be
located in disturbed and relatively undisturbed habitats located in the vicinity
of Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panama and Palo Verde National Park, Costa
Rica. Genetic analyses of the progeny of several adult trees in each site will
be used to determine relative levels of male and female reproductive success,
levels of pollen and seed movement into each population and the genetic
relatedness of the adults within each population. These data will be used to
determine whether the small fragmented populations in disturbed habitats are
likely to lose genetic diversity or will suffer the consequences of increased
rates of inbreeding. The expected results should prove useful for managing
disturbed habitats to maximize species diversity and genetic diversity and for
the restoration of forest habitats.
