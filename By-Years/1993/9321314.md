9321314 KENNEY This proposal will examine the administrative development of the
European Court of Justice, focusing on comparing the role and power of legal
secretaries at the ECJ with those of law clerks at the U.S. Supreme Court. Legal
secretaries at the ECJ are lawyers, judicial administrators, and legal
academics, and they perform many professional roles within the administrative
structure of the high court. The bureaucratization of appellate courts is an
important aspect of their political power because it increases staff, and
therefore judicial, capacity and permits judicial specialization. This research
is the first effort to build an extensive data base on the workings of the ECJ,
thereby providing the basis for comparison with other high courts. The Principal
Investigator will interview a number of judges and legal secretaries at the ECJ,
observe the working interactions between legal secretaries and judges, observe
oral argument and gather descriptive materials on other internal aspects of
judicial procedure. ***
