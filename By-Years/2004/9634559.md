The search for efficient algorithms to produce primes is motivated largely by
the needs of cryptologists and number theorists. Many open problems in these
areas rely on very large tables of primes for their solution. The Sieve of
Erathosthenes is a well known method for generating tables of primes up to a
given natural number, N. Significant work has been published that improves on
the original sieve to generate primes, some in sublinear time. This project will
investigate six variations on the sieve to generate large tables of primes
efficiently using parallel architectures. Initial testing and implementation of
the algorithms will be based on selected mapping and communication structures
that are determined to be optimal. The most effective architecture will be
identified for each algorithm. Preliminary data will give insight into the scope
of memory limitations that must be addressed in order to generate primes to N =
10^18. Break even points between the various algorithms will be provided because
it is important to determine how feasible it is to reach a certain point given a
particular algorithm. ***
