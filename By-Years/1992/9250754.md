Students of mathematics, science, and engineering, working in pairs, are
enhancing their learning of calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra
using Mathematica in an instructional laboratory of networked MacIntosh
computers. The goals are: to elucidate selected important concepts by engaging
students in carefully designed experiments; to produce intelligent problem-
solvers who appreciate the value of preliminary analysis of problems for the
purpose of devising strategy, who have a sense of when to use computers and when
not to, and who understand the importance of interpreting and reflecting upon
computer output; to teach students to compare pictorial with analytic and
computational ways of viewing a problem; and to allow students to take
responsibility for the correctness of their own work by cross-checking
theoretical considerations, common sense, pencil-and-paper computation, machine
computation, and graphics.
