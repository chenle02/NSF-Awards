This award will support an NSF/CMBS regional conference to be held at the
Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics in
Providence, Rhode Island in the summer of 2012 on the topic of finite element
exterior calculus. The principal speaker will be Douglas Arnold, McKnight
Presidential Professor of Mathematics at the University of Minnesota. This award
will support 25 participants at different stages of their careers.

Finite element exterior caluculs (FEEC) is a recently developed theory that
provides a framework for understanding and constructing numerical methods that
are used for solving partial differential equations. It touches on many
different fields of mathematics, including differential geometry, algebraic
topology, and homological algebra. This conference will demonstrate how these
areas of mathematics can be linked together to better understand the structure
of underlying problems and develop computational methods.
