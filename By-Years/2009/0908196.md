This project is aimed at investigating regularity and possible blow-up of
solutions to partial differential equations of fluid mechanics and related
mathematical models. Understanding of properties of these models is a
fundamental challenge both for mathematics and science. The regularity and
stability of the solutions are strongly related to complex multiscale physical
phenomena such as turbulence and phase transitions. A principal goal of this
project is developing new techniques to tackle the problem of global regularity
for super-critical systems including reaction-diffusion systems or the 3D
Navier-Stokes system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program will make some
significant progress in the fundamental understanding of the mathematics
involved in fluid mechanics and chemistry. It will help also to train new
graduate students in this important field. The discovery of mathematical
structure in physical models will lead to a deeper understanding of the physical
phenomena themselves. It will also provide some information about the limits of
validity of the theoretical physical models that are used to describe physical
phenomena. &lt;br/&gt;
