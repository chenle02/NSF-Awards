Careers in High Performance Systems (CHiPS) Mentoring Workshop is a mentoring
workshop to attract and encourage women and under-represented minority (URM)
computer science undergraduate students (specifically those students in their
sophomore and junior years) to obtain a Ph.D. in computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will engage women and under-
represented minority undergraduates specifically interested in HPC research. A
set of mentoring panels will focus on motivating and preparing students to get a
Ph.D. A tutorial session on GPU programming techniques taught by leading
academic and industry experts is planned. This panel will be hands-on with the
students actually doing coding. Researchers from several areas of HPC will hold
panels discussing past research and the current state-of-art in HPC, and present
a number of future problems that we, as a society, should be prepared to tackle
in the coming decade. &lt;br/&gt;
