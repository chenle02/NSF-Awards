EIA-0103642&lt;br/&gt;Gary W. Howell&lt;br/&gt;Florida Institute of
Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CISE NGS: Cache Efficient and Parallel
Bidiagonalization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache efficient reduction to bidiagonal
form allows a significant speedup in computation of the singular value
decomposition (SVD) for rectangular matrices. The SVD provides the most standard
and stable means of solving least square problems and of providing low rank
approximations (allowing compressions of data stored in matrix form). As such it
is used constantly by researchers around the nation and the
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will result in speedups in the
standard LAPACK implementation and also in the parallel computation package
SCALAPACK. The work will also extend to the parallel case with a view for
inclusion in SCALPACK. In the parallel case the optimizer must take into account
not only details of the local computer architecture and memory hierarchy but
also communication among the processors.&lt;br/&gt;
