9501272 Garland This project is a three-year program of experimental research
directed at understanding the properties of weak coupling effects in
superconductors, with an emphasis on dimensionality effects, vortex dynamics,
and non-linear transport. Two categories of experiments are planned. The first
involves measurements of interlayer coupling and dynamics of vortex lines and
Jospphson vortices in layered high temperature superconductors. The second
category involves transport and radio frequency spectral response measurements
of inhomogeneous non-linear superconducting media, including measurements of
two- dimensional granular composite films and of phase correlations and
fluctuations in Josephson junction arrays. %%% This project is a two-part
program of experimental basic research on the electronic properties of high
temperature superconductors, and also on the properties of microcircuit arrays
of superconducting tunnel junctions. In the first project, the research will
explore the response of high temperature superconductors to magnetic fields,
with the ultimate foal of explaining the underlying physical principles that
determine their technical and scientific applicability. The second project will
investigate microcircuits of superconducting tunnel junctions, in part to
elucidate fundamental physical principles and in part to determine the potential
usefulness in electronics applications that require extreme sensitivity. ***
