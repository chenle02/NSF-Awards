This award provides funds to the Biology Department of Furman University to
establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates SITE. With this support the
department will recruit talented women and minority students, rising juniors
studying biology at neighboring institutions in South Carolina, and extend to
them the benefits of this NSF-REU program. Student groups of two or three will
work closely with each faculty member in full-time summer laboratory research.
The student-faculty research projects span many of the sub-curricula of the
department, including gene expression studies in seed development,
immunocytological studies on phytochrome activity in plant development,
isoenzyme studies in plants, ultraviolet absorbing and fluorescing molecules in
insects, isolation of active compounds in plant defense mechanisms, community
ecology, and neurobiology. In the selection process faculty mentors will be
matched with appropriate student co- workers. Student participants will submit a
formal written summary of their summer's accomplishments. A regular schedule of
special scientific, social, and athletic events will round out the program and
provide an added mechanism for developing esprit de corps among the diverse
group of participants.
