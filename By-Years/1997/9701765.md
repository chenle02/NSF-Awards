9701765 Robertson While the loss of organic carbon and nitrogen via soluble
forms has implications both for source and sink ecosystems, the extent and
magnitude of fluxes are poorly known. Preliminary data from a range of
ecosystems in an agricultural landscape in southwest Michigan suggest that
fluxes of dissolved organic nitrogen can be quite significant. A review of the
literature on leaching of soluble organic carbon and nitrogen, primarily studied
in forests, suggests only abiotic controls. Several biotic controls are proposed
here, given their large effect on the abiotic controls shown to significantly
affect leaching of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen(DOM). To better
understand controls, an idea of the source of the leached DOM is critical. This
study proposes a two tiered approach to looking at both aspects. A broad study
of different ecosystems along a successional gradient and an intense study using
isotopic tracers on the sources of leached DOM in one ecosystem. It is
hypothesized that those factors which influence hydraulic flux will have the
greatest effect on the mass loss of C and N through leached organic forms.
