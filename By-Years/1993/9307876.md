The project contributes to our understanding of the characteristics of important
social insurance structures. It continues research on the pricing of alternative
health insurance options, including analysis of whether premiums should be
different for individuals changing policies and individuals continuing with the
same policy. It examines the way retirement benefits should vary with the age of
retirement in a model that recognizes individual differences, stochastic
employment possibilities, and limited observation of work opportunities. It
studies the way taxes and expenditures should vary with the outcome of aggregate
risks. The project also continues research on the micro foundations of
macroeconomies. It examines the importance of labor market tightness and of
impediments to labor mobility for the efficiency of the allocation of labor. Of
special interest will be estimates of the loss in efficiency due to the way the
existing system of health insurance locks workers into existing employers.
Another is the determination of the endogenous distribution of ownership of
purchasing power and its effect on aggregate efficiency. The CRAY supercomputer
will be used to simulate this extremely complex model. A third is the effect of
different forms of money illusion on equilibrium in the housing market. This
research will be undertaken jointly with a psychologist and will explore
alternative ways of modeling individual decisions on selling houses that
integrate psychological and economic concerns.
