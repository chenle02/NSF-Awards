Co-Designed Virtual Machines use a combination of concurrently designed hardware
and software to implement a conventional instruction set architecture (ISA). An
implementation-specific instruction set is directly supported by hardware, and a
co-designed dynamic binary translation system completes the processor
implementation by translating binaries of conventional ISAs. Translated
implementation-specific binary code is cached in a concealed region of memory
and executed directly by the processor core. The obstacles to using this
approach involve potentially detrimental overheads -- at startup, during steady
state, and in required memory resources. The proposed research will tackle each
of these overhead problem areas by 1) providing micro architecture support to
improve translation times by an order of magnitude, 2) adding features to
eliminate steady state overheads of executing cached translated code, and 3)
using memory compression to reduce the fraction of physical memory that must be
dedicated to holding translated code.

The co-designed virtual machine paradigm will greatly simplify the hardware
design process and enable performance improvements by providing a better match
between computer hardware and software. A simpler design process will lead to
reduced design times, lower engineering costs, and hardware innovations coming
to market sooner. Performance improvements will be accompanied by better energy
efficiency because some hardware-intensive tasks are shifted to less- Frequently
used software tasks.
