Dr.Herbert Edelsbrunner is a young computer scientist who has already made
fundamental contributions to the emerging field of computational geometry. The
Alan T. Waterman award committee has recommended Dr. Edelsbrunner for this
award, selecting him from among 97 nominees. This award carries a grant of
$500,000 for three years. Dr. Edelsbrunner will be the sixteenth recipient of
the Alan T. Waterman award. Dr. Edelsbrunner is a pioneer in the field of
computational geometry which deals with the representation and manipulation of
geometric shapes and patterns. Coping with the real-world objects requires
taking into consideration their real geometries rather than treating them as
idealized, oversimplified shapes. Computational geometry is thus going to be of
utmost importance in computational science and computer-aided design. Dr.
Edelsbrunner has had a tremendous impact on computational geometry by his own
research as well as by his l987 book Algorithms in Combinatorial Geometry which
systematized the field in its early days. This book is considered by many people
to be still the best textbook and reference source on computational geometry. He
has also influenced the field by being active professionally in it. He has
organized a number of conferences and workshops on the subject. He has also
served as editor for several journals on computational geometry and related
subjects. There is no question that Dr. Edelsbrunner's work is of the highest
research quality and is having far-reaching impact. This award is highly
recommended.
