9416190 Rose This project is being funded as part of the National Earthquake
Hazards Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and effects of the
January 17, 1994 earthquake. The study will formulate, apply, and validate a
methodology for analyzing the economic impacts of earthquakes. The core of the
model will be an input-output table of the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power Service Area, as well as the surrounding region. The basic I-O model will
be able to estimate insurance payments and outside aid. The model will be
extended to disaggregate the impacts according to income bracket and
ethnic/racial category. Finally, a linear programming reformulation of the model
will be used to analyze policies that can minimize the decrease in the flow of
goods and services and provide insight into recovery and reconstruction
policies. ***
