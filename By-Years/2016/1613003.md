With recent technological advances and increased network connectivity, many
environmental, biological, and socio-economic datasets are collected on a global
scale. However, many of the current statistical models and methods are not
suitable for environmental applications where the data cover the surface of the
sphere. The goal of this project is to develop spatial and spatio-temporal point
process models on a global scale. The research is motivated by a study of global
lightning occurrence, and the impact of climate change on global lightning
occurrence patterns. The research will provide useful information for
scientists, policy makers, and the general public. The proposed models will
address the spatial inhomogeneity of the intensity functions as well as their
nonstationarity, both of which are essential for environmental applications. In
the spatio-temporal case, parametric covariance models for the stochastic
intensity function that can represent complex spatio-temporal interactions will
be studied, and univariate as well as multivariate point patterns that account
for the cross-dependence between multiple point patterns will be considered.
