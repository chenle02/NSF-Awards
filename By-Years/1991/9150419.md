This project will prepare software and associated written material to introduce
computational chemistry into the first two years of the chemistry curriculum.
Computational technology is one way to illustrate chemistry as it is practiced
today. It gives students hands-on experience with the models that we use at the
molecular level in a way previously unavailable. The software will enable
students to carry out atomic and molecular electronic structure calculations on
simple atoms and molecules that are discussed in introductory courses. IBM PC
and Macintosh computers will operate the software. The software and written
materials will be disseminated widely via organizations such as Quantum
Chemistry Program Exchange and Project Seraphim. Work will also be submitted for
publication in JCE:Software and the Journal of Chemical Education, and to
software firms that market molecular modeling (molecular mechanics) software.
This inexpensive technology could be used by any two-year community college or
four-year undergraduate institution.
