Different animals often evolve similar adaptations, reflecting similar
functional pressures acting on different species. This phenomenon is known as
convergent evolution and, although it has been widely acknowledged by biologists
for more than a century, its genetic and molecular basis remains poorly
understood. Our previous work has shown that seemingly identical traits can
evolve by changes in different genes in different species. In this project, a
combination of genomic, molecular-genetic, embryological, and comparative
approaches will be used to identify the responsible genes in each of several
independent cases where similar traits have evolved. Two key questions will be
addressed by this work. First, what features of animal development allow it to
translate different genetic changes into outwardly identical morphological
characters? Second, since evolution can clearly take different genetic paths to
produce the same trait, is the course it actually takes determined primarily by
the intrinsic features of the organism, by its population history, or by the
vagaries of chance that are known to play a large role in the origin of genetic
variation? As synthetic biology (the design or artificial biological organisms
with desirable properties) begins to move from speculation to reality,
understanding the flexible wiring of natural genetic pathways that permits
multiple solutions to the same functional problem will inform the design of
synthetic gene networks. The wide variety of techniques and integrative
approaches used in this project will advance the training of young scientists
who will be able to understand the inner workings of biological systems and to
apply these lessons to practical problems.
