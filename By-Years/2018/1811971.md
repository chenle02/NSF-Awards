This research project concerns algebraic topology and symplectic geometry.
Algebraic topology is the theory of those properties of space that are unchanged
by large continuous deformations; for example, the property of having a hole.
Algebraic topologists organize their subject using number systems called ring
spectra or extraordinary homology theory. Symplectic geometry is a mathematical
formalism for classical mechanics. Many questions in symplectic geometry have
been resolved through use of a tool called Lagrangian Floer theory. This project
aims to develop a single tool that generalizes both theories, forging new
connections between the subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Floer homotopy theory is
an emerging refinement of Floer homology. It bears the same relationship to
Floer homology that extraordinary homology bears to ordinary homology.
Ultimately it should attach a category, enriched in spectra, to a symplectic
manifold. This project aims to construct this category using the microlocal
theory of sheaves, to give new techniques for computing it, to use it to prove
some conjectures about the algebraic topology of symplectic manifolds, and
conversely to symplectically illuminate some aspects of the category of
spectra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
