9452176 Klotz The aim of this proposal is to infuse quantitative and
experimental investigations into field and environmental biology courses at the
institution. Students utilize modern techniques to study a diverse array of
species, investigate natural processes in different habitats, and examine how
human impact may be influencing them. The acquisition of field equipment allows
for the quantification of experiments, a determination of plant and animal
diversity, image analyses, and allows students to learn modern techniques and
concepts in quantitative species identification. Other computers and appropriate
software enable students to experiment with an electronic identification system
and to add their field collections to a databased inventory. The project is also
expected to impact approximately 900 students per year in 14 courses.
