DNA sequences that act to determine where, when, and to what degree genes are
expressed are called cis-regulatory elements. It is estimated that these
elements outnumber genes over 20 to 1 in the human genome, and it is becoming
increasingly clear that much of the morphological diversity we see in nature is
related to variation in these elements. This is true for both complex and simple
traits, for variation within and between populations, and for changes at micro-
and macro-evolutionary time scales. Although variation in the traits of
organisms often traces to these elements within the genome, they remain poorly
understood relative to protein-coding sequences of the genome. This projects
seeks to gain a better understanding of how regulatory elements can drive the
adaptation of complex traits. Specifically, the research will characterize the
cis-regulatory architecture driving adaptive evolution of wing pattern
coloration in Heliconius butterflies, an organismal system that has emerged as
an important model for understanding the genomic dynamics of adaptation.

This research will address several fundamental questions including: (1) How are
regulatory elements structured around genes that control rapidly evolving,
highly variable traits? (2) How does regulatory element structure and activity
evolve during the adaptive radiation of complex morphologies? (3) To what degree
is similarity in morphology controlled by similarity of regulatory elements?
This work will also help develop and adapt important new functional genomics
techniques to facilitate the broader study of cis-regulatory elements across
species. This project will also engage the public through the production of an
IMAX documentary film that will incorporate stop action animations of butterfly
wing development.
