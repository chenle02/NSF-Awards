0242474&lt;br/&gt;Peng&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a two-year
dissertation enhancement project submitted by Dr. Kaiping Peng, and Julie
Rodgers, Ph.D. student, University of California at Berkeley, in collaboration
with Professors Lei Wang and Yubo Hou, Beijing University, to conduct three
experiments on dialectical thinking, stereotyping and inter-group relations. The
proposed work addresses an important question on cultural differences in
cognition science. The award would support the career development of a Ph.D.
student of promise and would support international collaborations that benefit
research on culture and cognition. This project is jointly supported by the
National Science Foundation of China and NSF.&lt;br/&gt;
