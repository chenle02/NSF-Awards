This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Biology Department at Indiana
University of Pennsylvania is housed in Weyandt Hall, a 1960's era structure
built to serve as a general-purpose facility for a state teachers' college. The
layout and infrastructure of the building were designed for low-impact classroom
demonstration activities but not for high-impact modern research. Research
efforts are currently hampered by poorly-configured spaces, insufficient access
to utilities and fume hoods, deteriorated facilities for shared instruments and
problematic climate control and HVAC. This award provides funds to renovate and
upgrade research and research training spaces in the Department of Biology.
Funds for ceiling, ventilation system and HVAC upgrades, new casework, flooring,
sinks, and chemical fume hoods for safety and additional utilities along with
installation of equipment for specialized facilities (such as a large freezer
units, wash units, and temperature control systems) are provided to increase
usefulness and efficiency. Renovations funded by the NSF upgrade will improve
research and research training spaces and create 12 laboratories that correspond
to areas of research emphasis within the Department. These renovations will
create a modern, efficient and effective research and research training
environment. The award supports Department's educational philosophy that
emphasizes active learning, with integral laboratories with the courses and
multiple opportunities for hands-on learning outside the formal classroom
structure.
