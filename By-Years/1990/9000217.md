Nitrification Rates and Controls: The Deep Oligotropic NitrogenCycle
Water.column nitrification (NH.3 .. N0.2 and N0..2 .. N0>0.3) is thecrucial
biogeochemical PON/DON sink and source of N0.3 for newprimary production.
Measuring these rates directly will requireadvances in (1) measuring substrate
levels, (2) detecting smallchanges in incubations, and (3) >in situ> incubation
technology. The first real nitrification rates in the subsurface
Nremineralization region will use new .1.5N..1.80.2 double.labellingisotope
techniques. Natural rates of N0.2 oxidation will bedetermined from
transformation of tracer.level .1.5N.1.80..2 to.1.5N..1.80.3; isotope dilution
of .1..5N.1.8.0.2 and Ä±N0.2! pool size changeswill give rates of oxidation of
NH.3 to NO.2. Time.course >in situ>incubations will utilize a modified
Taylor/Doherty SubmersibleIncubation Device (SID)...
