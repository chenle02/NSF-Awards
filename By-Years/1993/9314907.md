9314907 Chung Calculations for ionization potentials, excitation energies, fine
structures, oscillator strengths and isotope shifts in atomic systems of greater
than four electrons will be performed using the full core plus correlation
method. The computer code will also be extended to treat a relativistic
hamiltonian and the program will be made user friendly and available to
experimentalists. ***
