The National Science Outreach Network will provide school children, teachers,
and the general public with highly accessible interactive exhibits dealing with
popular topics in science and technology. The network, initiated as a
partnership between regional science centers and public libraries, will be
modeled after the highly successful statewide Oregon Library Exhibits Network
established in 1987. Through this smaller network, the Oregon Museum of Science
and Industry, a nationally recognized pioneer in science exhibitry and outreach
programming, circulates small hands-on exhibits to rural population centers
through installations in public libraries, where school groups and families have
free and convenient access. This national dissemination project will be
initiated in five regional sites across the country (Colorado, Minnesota, New
York, Tennessee, and Oregon) to further establish the model in rural, inner-
urban, economically disadvantaged, and culturally diverse regions. With support
from both the NSF and the regional networks, The National Science Outreach
Network will design and duplicate six exhibits for circulation to dozens of
local communities in each designated region. Over the next seven years, over six
million individuals, many of whom do not currently frequent a local science
center, will be introduced to popular science in a non-threatening, resource-
rich setting. This will encourage further exploration and possible future visits
to an accessible science center, and ultimately establish an ever-expanding
network of museum and non-museum partners providing science and technology
learning opportunities to millions of individuals each year.
