This research will evaluate recent variations of surface air temperature over
the Arctic and subarctic through consolidation and comparison of existing data
on Arctic surface air temperature from high-latitude land stations, Arctic Ocean
ice stations and from sub-arctic sea surface temperatures. These data will be
examined for evidence of changes consistent with model projections of greenhouse
warming, which has been shown to be amplified in polar regions during the non-
summer months. The dataset will span the past several decades, 1950 to present,
and will cover the region pole-ward of 45 degrees north latitude. The study will
also assess the magnitude of the urbanization effect at northern land stations.
This research is collaborative with DPP 9214857.
