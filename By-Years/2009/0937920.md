This large-scale national project is investigating how undergraduate students in
STEM disciplines use digital learning materials. Much of the work already done
by the National STEM Digital Library (NSDL) - especially by the NSDL large
"Pathways" collections - assumes that students will be directly connected to the
content in the collections, or that they will otherwise find and use the digital
resources from collections in ways that assist the depth of their learning.
However, little is known about how undergraduates use digital resources. This
study will develop a better understanding of the extent and nature of
undergraduate use and it will begin to determine the value of digital learning
materials to undergraduates. The project is: 1. Examining how undergraduates use
digital and distributed learning resources and collections 2. Documenting how
and why they use these resources 3. Examining the impact of that use on their
learning 4. Exploring student perceptions of barriers to the use of NSDL
services and programs

Following these information collection tasks, the project will begin a second
stage to: 5. Identify possible strategies for overcoming barriers to use of
digital libraries and distributed learning resources by undergraduate STEM
students 6. Disseminate the tools developed in this study for use by NSDL
projects in developing individual benchmarks regarding their own usage, and 7.
Establish baseline data for future studies of NSDL usage and impact
