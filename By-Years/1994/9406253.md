9406253 Hollister It is widely recognized that in the development of many
orogenic belts there was a phase of rapid exhumation of hot crystalline rocks,
giving rise to nearly isothermal decompression at peak temperature and clockwise
PTt paths. Several recent studies in the Himalayas have focused on phases in the
development of the Himalayan orogen consisting of high temperature
decompression. One of the continuing problems is identifying the heat source for
forming the migmatites in the middle crust, and several conflicting models have
been proposed. This research is to obtain well constrained metamorphic P-T data
and interpretation of P-T-time-deformation paths in order to constrain models
pertaining to the question of how migmatite can be formed in or tectonically
transported into the middle crust. Results will help understand the common
occurrence of rapid exhumation of hot crystalline rocks in the cores of many
orogenic zones.
