9451522 Sprinsky The purpose of this project is to improve the curriculum for
students pursuing careers in Civil Engineering Technology. Fundamental skill
areas of land description and analysis and surveying are strengthened by
adding/enhancing instruction in several essential competency areas, including
(1) Non-line-of-site Positioning: use of satellite technology to measure
position of land forms accurate to one part in one million; (2) Subdivision
design, land use analysis, transportation network design, and environmental
husbandry: significantly improved synthesis/integration of data from multiple
sources through application of Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques;
(3) Line-of-site surveys and measurements: improved precision through electronic
distance measuring applications; and (4) Computer-based engineering problem
solution via application of interfaced equipment networks and increased data
base integration. Outcomes of the project will strengthen significantly student
knowledge of state-of-the-art technology essential to meet effectively the
critical challenges of infrastructure development and utilization.
