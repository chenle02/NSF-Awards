The participation of vinyl isocyanates as 4-electron partners in various
cyclocondensation reactions will be studied in order to extend the reactivity
profile of these interesting reagents. The program will focus on novel reaction
partners such as nucleophilic carbenes, isocyanides and other species in an
attempt to make a wide range of heterocyclic ring systems easily accessible.
Also, an important objective will be the development of intramolecular versions
of these newly discovered reactions. A second area will be to examine the unique
characteristics of vinyl isocyanides. It is envisioned that these species
represent an effective equivalent to an "umpoled" version of the vinyl
isocyanate series. The usefulness of these compounds in a range of synthetic
problems will be investigated. %%% With this award the Synthetic Organic Program
of the Chemistry Division will support the research of Dr. James H. Rigby of the
Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University. The program will develop
synthetic methodology for the preparation of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic
compounds using vinyl isocyanates and vinyl isocyanides as reagents. The
structural features of the heterocycles are found in a wide variety of important
natural products and thus are significant synthetic targets.
