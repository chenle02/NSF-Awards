This conference will feature a number of talks by Tao Li and by other experts on
Heegaard splittings and ranks of fundamental groups. A Heegaard splitting is a
decomposition of a 3-dimensional manifold into two simple pieces called
handlebodies along a surface. A Heegaard splitting defines a presentation for
the fundamental group of the 3-manifold in which the number of generators is
equal to the genus of the surface. Thus the rank of the 3-manifold (the minimal
number of generators) is less than or equal to the genus of the minimal Heegaard
surface. In most cases, rank and genus are equal, but a small number of examples
have been found in which the rank is strictly less than the genus. Tao Li
recently discovered the first examples of hyperbolic 3-manifolds with rank
strictly less than genus. This raises the question of how common these examples
are and how big the difference between rank and genus can
be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When we look at the surface of the earth from ground
level, it appears to be a flat plane that goes on forever in all directions.
However, from world navigation and viewing the earth from space, we know that it
is, in fact, a completely different shape - a sphere, or the surface of a ball.
Similarly, the universe that we live in appears to be a flat 3-dimensional space
that goes on forever in all directions. Unfortunately we have no way of checking
what the shape actually is, but we can study the possible shapes that it could
be. This is the focus of 3-dimensional topology. This conference will bring
together experts from around the world to discuss recent developments at the
interface between algebraic methods and geometric methods for studying
3-dimensional spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://comp.uark.edu/~matthewd/redbud
