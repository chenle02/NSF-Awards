The goal of the Science Minders project is to increase the interest and self-
esteem of girls relative to science. Since many early adolescents seek economic
independency by "baby-sitting," the Science Minders project will develop
materials designed to permit early adolescents to teach science to small groups
of young children. The materials will make the early adolescents' child-caring
providing more successful and significantly enhance their attitudes and comfort
with science. These materials will include a book containing informal science
activities and activity resources, a child-development guide, first-aid and
emergency procedures and child-care tips; and two training videos, one to
demonstrate how to use the materials effectively with young children, and one to
train adults to train adolescents as child-care providers. These materials will
be nationally promoted and disseminated by a commercial publisher and through
the national network of 400 YWCAs in 4,000 locations throughout the United
States.
