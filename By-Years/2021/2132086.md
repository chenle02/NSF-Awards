This award supports the first South Central Topology Conference (SCTC) taking
place September 25-26, 2021 at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station,
Texas. The primary goals of this regional conference include: developing a
community of collaborators and experts of varied interests in topology in the
region, showcasing a sample of current research directions in topology in the
South Central region and beyond it, and communicating developing and exciting
results in ways accessible to topologists of all ilks. This conference is timely
in light of the research growth in topology in the South Central Region in
recent years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modern topology is a large and
active field. The conference will be broad in its focus, and will provide a
sample of recent research developments in fields such as chromatic and
equivariant homotopy theory, higher algebra, symplectic and contact topology,
mirror symmetry, and the topology of embedding spaces. The six plenary speakers,
Anna Marie Bohmann (Vanderbilt University), Kristen Hendricks (Rutgers
University), Robin Koytcheff (University of Louisiana at Lafayette), Jo Nelson
(Rice University), Paul VanKoughnett (Texas A&amp;M University), and Abigail
Ward (MIT), will give one-hour colloquium-style presentations. There will also
be eight short talks given by graduate students and postdocs on a wide range of
topics. More information can be found on the conference web page:

NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
