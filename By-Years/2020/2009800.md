This research addresses problems emerging from the physics of large systems of
interacting quantum mechanical particles (of boson or fermion type), analyzed
with rigorous mathematical methods. The PI will study the effects of impelling a
heavy quantum tracer particle into a gas of bosons, and investigate the
dynamical behavior of quantum fluctuations when the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein
condensation occurs. In addition, the PI will study the motion of electrons
(which are fermions) in disordered media, describing systems such as
semiconductors. In another line of research, the PI and his collaborators have
recently introduced an approach to study equations describing classical gases
and fluids with methods in quantum mechanics, using a mathematical device known
as the Wigner transform; this method will be further developed in this project.
The projects includes training opportunities for graduate students and
postdoctoral researchers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The PI will study the
fluctuation dynamics around a Bose-Einstein condensate on the level of the
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation and beyond, using a combination of methods
from nonlinear partial differential equations and renormalization in quantum
field theory. Moreover, the PI will study the derivation of effective equations
for systems of fermions propagating in a random medium, in the context of the
weakly disordered manybody Anderson model with mean field interaction. The
analysis of classical Boltzmann equations via Wigner transform and methods of
dispersive nonlinear partial differential equations will be further developed.
An important outcome of the analysis of these problems is the development of new
mathematical techniques merging methods from nonlinear partial differential
equations, harmonic analysis, and quantum field
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
