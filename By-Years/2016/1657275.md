Industrial networks typically connect hundreds or thousands of sensors and
actuators in industrial facilities, such as steel mills, oil refineries, and
chemical plants. Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in adopting
wireless sensor-actuator network (WSAN) technology for industrial networks. This
project will develop highly self-adaptive WSANs, enabling a broad range of
industrial process applications, which affect economics, security, and quality
of life. Successful completion of this project will significantly spur the
installation of WSANs with the potential of greatly improving industrial
efficiency, leading to a significant reduction of the operating costs, which can
help create more jobs. The end objective of this project is to incorporate the
project outcomes into the next generation of industrial WSAN standards and real-
world products. Project findings will be presented at major international
conferences and published in their proceedings and high-impact journals and also
used for enriching education and outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IEEE 802.15.4
based WSANs operate at low-power and can be manufactured inexpensively, which
makes them ideal for industrial process applications where energy consumption
and costs are important. However, the stringent and diverse quality of service
(QoS) requirements and dynamic industrial environments make managing WSANs a
daunting task. A key missing piece of the WSAN management puzzle is a self-
adaptation component, which allows WSANs to adapt themselves to consistently
satisfy the dynamic QoS requirements in uncertain environments. Industry
consequently has shown a marked reluctance to embrace WSAN technology. The
overarching goal of this project is to accomplish runtime parameter self-
adaptation for industrial WSANs in uncertain environment. This project will
develop rigorous scientific methods for equipping industrial WSANs with
capabilities of optimally configuring themselves based on specific QoS
requirements and adapting the configurations at runtime to consistently satisfy
the dynamic requirements in uncertain environments. This project aims to advance
the state of the art of industrial WSANs through creating a new paradigm of
parameter self-adaptation, resulting in improved network performance and better
network resource management. This project will also accomplish an increased
understanding of the performance tradeoffs that exist in WSANs and enable the
development of new solutions to inform users with accurate user-appropriate
information on network performance tradeoffs and configuration choices.
