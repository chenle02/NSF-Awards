on Learning Technologies: Building Virtual Places for Collaborative Simulations:
A Heterogeneous Network Architecture to Support Distant Learning SRI
International has been awarded $599,947 over 25 months for an effort to study
collaborative learning within two learning communities: undergraduate chemistry
students and science teachers involved in professional development. The results
of the research will be used to design and develop a network-based learning
environment that supports a range of asynchronous and synchronous collaborative
interaction among distributed teams on heterogeneous platforms. The project will
involve collaborations between social scientists studying social and task
environments in learning, and computer scientists developing collaboration
technologies that will support these environments.
