This SBIR Phase II research project strives to develop an Advanced Ultrasonic
Beamformer that is unparalleled in its scalability and signal processing
features. The ultrasonic beamformer architecture will be unique in its breadth
of features. The architecture was developed as the superset of features across
several fields including medical imaging, medical therapy, bone density
measurement, vascular imaging, and materials characterization. This approach
provides each field with an instrument capable of operating outside the normal
performance envelope, thereby presenting opportunities for the development of
new uses of ultrasound. The benefits of this array include better frame rates,
crisper images, and more accurate surgery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The higher
frequencies used in materials characterization, when brought to medical imaging,
will allow array transducer to be used where only conventional, single element
probes could used in the past, for example in intra-cardiac imaging for surgical
instruments, and also for tumor ablation. By design, the proposed architecture
encompasses the abilities of many different fields. Each field then enjoys
performance capabilities beyond what is normally available, providing a general-
purpose tool for research. &lt;br/&gt;
