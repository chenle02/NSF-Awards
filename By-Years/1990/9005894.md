This proposal requests funds for the purchase of an electronic area detector
diffractometer for use in x-ray crystallographic studies of protein structures.
It is an updated version of the proposal originally submitted Dec. 9, 1986.
Proteins currently being investigated include a variety of complexes and mutants
of E. coli, chicken and human dihydrofolate reductase, and mutants and complexes
of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase. Additionally, crystals of two proteins
relevant to DNA replication and repair have been crystallized and are being
studied to establish their suitability for structure determination: repA1 of an
E. coli plasmid and rat B-ploymerase. Still other proteins are undergoing
crystallization trials. Acquisition of an area detector diffractometer will
allow the PIs to collect data when crystals are ready for mounting and eliminate
the need to wait, often several months, for access to a diffractometer in
another laboratory; enhance the rate and flexibility of data collection; permit
complete data sets to be collected from a minimum number of crystals; and
provide accurate high-resolution data for structure refinement.
