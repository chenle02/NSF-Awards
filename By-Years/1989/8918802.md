This award will support a conference on Continuum Models of Phase Transitions,
Fronts, and Interfaces. The conference will be held on January 25-27, 1990 in
Salt Lake City, Utah at the University Park Hotel. The purpose is to bring
together researchers in various areas of mathematical, physical, and biological
sciences to discuss work on continuum models that arise in studies of phase
transitions and the motion of fronts and interfaces in reacting and non-reacting
systems. Ten principal speakers will give lectures and other participants will
present posters. Principal speakers include D. Aronson, A. DeGregoria, P. Fife,
M. Glickman, C. Jones, A. Libchaber, J. Strain , P. Sternberg, B. Taccardi, and
D. Terman.
