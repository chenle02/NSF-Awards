This project will give undergraduate students in the field of communicative
disorders an opportunity for hands-on experience with the most modern scientific
equipment used in the investigation of normal and disordered speech production
The acquisition of the following equipment allows the project to achieve this
goal: the MacSpeech Lab II allows analysis of the complex acoustic information
in speech, clarifying the speech production and perception theories presented in
lectures. Linearized magnetometers provide the students with information
concerning the coordinated movements of the respiratory system. A
pneumotachograph setup allows measurements of airflow patterns within the vocal
tract, and when combined with input from an electroglottograph, yields valuable
information about the activity of the vocal folds during voicing. Laboratory
courses accompanying each of the undergraduate speech science lecture sections
will employ the new equipment both in demonstrations and in student experiments.
By bringing students into a scientific environment where they become active
participants, this project opens the door to a greater appreciation for the role
of science in the service of individuals with communicative disorders.
