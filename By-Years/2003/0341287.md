This project is developing and disseminating integrated Web-based instruction
material (the Virtual PLC) to help overcome the resource limitations that often
prevent students from gaining the experience needed to become proficient PLC
users. Objectives include the expansion of the graphical environment where users
may build and test programs, the addition of 25 more case studies and 10 more
laboratory exercises, the extension of the intelligent tutoring system component
to teach troubleshooting, and the development of support materials to help
instructors use the Virtual PLC. The project includes an effective evaluation
effort involving several other institutions, including minority-serving schools
and two-year technology programs. The dissemination effort includes the
development of a Website, demonstration kit, textbook, and workshops.
