9413858 Freeman This award provides funding for acquisition of a real-time
multiprocessor host computer system for the Iowa Driving Simulator (IDS) at the
University of Iowa. The addition of the new host computer system will create a
unique facility to support research ranging from development of new engineering
design and analysis methodologies to the study of basic human factors problems.
The IDS is a fully-immersive ground vehicle driving simulator that provides high
fidelity visual, motion, audio, and force feedback cues to the driver. The new
host computer will enhance IDS performance in the areas of high-fidelity vehicle
modeling and realistic representation of the external driving environment. The
additional modeling fidelity will allow experimentation with advanced operator--
in-the-loop virtual prototyping concepts for vehicle and heavy equipment design,
and will provide a rich environment for the study of human behavior and
performance issues. The upgraded facility will support the research and academic
programs of ten faculty, approximately seventy-five graduate students, and a
dozen undergraduate from four engineering disciplines, computer science, and
several other departments.
