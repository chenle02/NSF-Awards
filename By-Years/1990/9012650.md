Pockmarks are errosive features found on the seabed that record the recent
activity of fluid seepage --primarily gas -- through the sediments. These
craters-like features have been extensively documented on continental shelves
throughout the world oceans and are thought to be primarily associated with the
seepage of hydrocarbons from sediment reservoirs. In spite of their common
occurrence, active systems are essentially unstudied and the biogeochemical
impacts of these systems on shelf sediments and coastal waters are almost
completely unknown. The gas released is primarily methane (both biogenic and
thermogenic) and the significance of this source to the marine and atmospheric
budgets is completely unknown. It has recently been hypothesized that these
systems may even plan an important role -- enhancing fisheries production on
continental shelves. Following up on the pioneering studies of fluid venting
along the shelf and slope of the Oregon convergent margin and upon the guidance
of local fishermen, the existence of an extremely active methane vent in a pock
mark on the continental shelf off Oregon has been verified water and sediment.
This research is an exploratory effort to demonstrate that samples can be
obtained without loss or alterations of the contained gases and analyses to
identify the gases.
