Custom integrated circuit technology has played a signif- icant role in the
development of digital systems. It is impor- tant that all electrical engineers
become familiar with designing, testing, simulating, and verifying the digital
systems in a Computer Aided System. Therefore, there is much interest in
introducing this technology into the undergraduate curriculum. The goal of this
project is to develop the Advanced Digital Design and Interfacing course around
ALTERA EPLDs (Erasable Programmable Logic Devices). The equipment acquired is
for the design of digital circuits, interfacing circuits, peripherals,
microcoded and hardwired controllers, and computer communication devices. This
development system enhances the electrical engineering curriculum and improves
the quality of the education offered to students. The award is being matched by
an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
