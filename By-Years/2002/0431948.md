The School of Engineering & Applied Science at Washington University in St.
Louis has a new Program in Aerospace Engineering leading to a B.S. degree. This
major was created based on student demand and strong endorsement from the
Boeing, their principal aerospace employer. This planning grant has four
objectives for modernizing their aerospace engineering curriculum: (1) Teach
aerospace design through hands-on design/build/fly projects; (2) Integrate these
design projects into the classroom at all grade levels; (3) Integrate research
into undergraduate-focused design projects; and (4) Improve the recruitment and
retention of underrepresented groups in aerospace engineering: An essential part
of the improvement in curriculum is an improvement in the diversity of the
student body. A student-built project is a natural showcase for outreach events
and recruiting visits, which should be intentionally used to attract pre-college
students from underrepresented groups. In addition, retention of students will
be improved through the program's improved connection with faculty and mentoring
opportunities across grade levels. At present, these four objectives are
informally implemented for spacecraft design; students in aerospace, mechanical,
electrical and computer engineering are developing a 30-kg nanosatellite through
coursework and volunteer project work.

Intellectual Merit: The goal of this planning grant is to define a process for
an integrated hands-on project oriented curriculum for both the aircraft and
spacecraft design tracks. These tracks will be available not only to aerospace
engineering students but to students from other disciplines as well.

Broader Impact: The reformed curriculum will enhance the critical thinking &
communication skills, provide cross-disciplinary exposure, encourage teamwork,
mentoring and participation of minorities, and improve employment opportunities.
It will provide a model for curriculum reform at other institutions. The state
of Missouri has a four-university consortium in Aerospace Research & Education,
with Boeing as an industrial partner, which is also very interested in this
modernization effort.
