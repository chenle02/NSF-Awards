*** 9722639 Kleppner This program is the continuation of a set of experiments
which have as their goal achieving Bose-Einstein condensation in atomic
hydrogen. The first step of the process is the trapping of the atoms in a
cryogenic trap, where densities approaching 10 14 atoms cm-3 have been achieved.
Observation of the trapped hydrogen is made by two-photon spectroscopy of the
atom. Observation of the condensate will be via a recoil-shifted line that is
unique to the condensate. ***
