Genetic engineering techniques may provide useful protection to agricultural
plants. There is considerable controversy, however, over the potential
environmental consequences of applying these technologies. Through document
analysis and fieldwork, consisting of approximately 25 in-depth interviews with
significant figures in the debate, this dissertation project will explore the
diversity of positions over these issues. The different values, beliefs, and
ethical concerns which underlie the controversy will be identified and examined;
competing concepts of the public interest in biotechnological plant protection
research will be articulated; and the potential for common ground will be
assessed. Results will provide a useful historical record and information about
the justifications associated with different positions. The project goals and
credentials of the dissertation student and her advisors are very meritorious;
the funds are necessary to support the special costs associated with the
fieldwork and analysis; results will be recieved with interest; so support is
recommended in the amount of $5,300.
