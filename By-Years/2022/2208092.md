The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of an accelerated growing platform for the efficient production of
high-quality tea. Camellia sinensis, the plant from which tea is extracted, is
an evergreen woody plant. It takes approximately 2 years to propagate liners
from mother stock and an additional 5 years of field growth before reaching a
steady production potential of approximately 0.5 lbs dried tea per plant per
year. It costs ~$100K/acre to establish a 3,600-plant density, not including
land costs. The proposed technology has the potential to reduce the time to
harvest from 7 years to 6 months, it may be rapidly scaled, and the chemical
profile of the leaf grown is tunable through specific nutrient applications. In
addition, the technology may be used to produce novel tea products for
consumers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development
of platform technology to accelerate tea plant growth that, in conjunction with
proprietary nutrient solutions, reduce the time to tea harvest from years to
weeks. In addition, the health and sensory attributes of the tea leaf produced
in the proposed technology are tunable to desired qualities and consumer
preferences. The technology may be easily adopted by farmers wishing to
diversify their crops. The proposed technology system is especially well suited
for growing tea in automated controlled indoor environments. Indoor production
of tea may have a commercial advantage compared to existing tea production
approaches because the chemical content of the leaf may be controlled by
nutrient application and limited exposure to microbes and pathogens. Combining
the rapid growth platform with tuning of sensory and health attributes offers
enormous tea marketing potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
