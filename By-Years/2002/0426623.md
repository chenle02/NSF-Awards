Proposal Number CNS-0426623&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: ITR: Secure Remote
Computing Services&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jason
Nieh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Secure remote computing
services (SRCS) will be developed as a critical information technology (IT)
infrastructure. SRCS will move all application logic and data from insecure end-
user devices, which attackers can easily corrupt, steal and destroy, to
autonomic server farms in physically secure, remote data centers that can
rapidly adapt to computing demands especially in times of crisis. Users can then
access their computing state from anywhere, anytime, using simple, stateless
Internet-enabled devices. SRCS builds on the hypothesis that a combination of
lightweight process migration, remote display technology, overlay-based security
and trust-management access control mechanisms, driven by an autonomic
management utility, can result in a significant improvement in overall system
reliability and security. The results of this effort will enable SRCS
implementations to provide many benefits, including persistence and continuity
of business logic, minimizing the cost of localized computing failures, robust
protection against attacks, and transparent user mobility with global computing
access. SRCS in time of crisis specifically addresses a major concern of
national and homeland security. The substantially lowered total cost of
ownership of applications running on SRCS is anticipated to dramatically reduce
the gap between IT haves and have nots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
