The Hawaii EPSCoR Planning grant continues to assess the strengths and
weaknesses of the current R&amp;D system in Hawaii and design an NSF Research
Infrastructure Improvement project to materially strengthen the competitiveness
of the State's academic institutions in research areas of national and local
importance. The two major universities, the University of Hawaii-Manoa and the
University of Hawaii-Hilo, have established a team that is taking a system-wide
approach to the EPSCoR planning effort. The process also encompasses Hawaii's
system of Community Colleges to increase entry into science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics career tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning
process is designed to: (1) assist the state in better aligning University of
Hawaii system priorities with NSF EPSCoR goals; (2) use applicable best
practices from other states; (3) better coordinate all Federal EPSCoR programs
to maximize their impact in Hawaii; (4) select research focus areas that are of
high importance to Hawaii and where a strong collaborative relationship can be
developed between the Manoa and Hilo campuses; and (5) advise on the best
strategies to build nationally-recognized programs in the selected research
focus areas. These goals will result in a coordinated state-wide effort to
improve academic R&amp;D capabilities in targeted disciplines, enhance training
and education for students in science and engineering, and increase efforts to
promote transfer of technology from the state's universities to Hawaii's private
and public sectors.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
