Human leadership is thought to be unique compared to other animals in that it is
often rooted in prestige rather than dominance. That is, instead of coercing
others using physical intimidation, prestigious human leaders attract followers
through admiration. Our closest living relatives provide crucial comparisons for
understanding how the transition to prestige-based leadership happened in human
evolutionary history. In some species, individuals maintain hierarchies that are
defined by aggression but also show relatively extensive cooperation, which has
been proposed to underlie human prestige. This doctoral dissertation research
project investigates whether wild nonhuman primates exhibit some features of
prestige-based leadership while at the same time keeping the dominance-based
leadership seen in other animals. As part of this project, the investigators
offer a leadership workshop for primary schools that emphasizes the value of
cooperative leadership and opportunities for girlsâ€™ leadership while supporting
scientific engagement and student-centered STEM
learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators integrate an intensive field
study with long-term hormonal and behavioral data from the community of wild
nonhuman primates to be studied to conduct a comprehensive non-invasive
exploration of leadership in these primates. To do so, they develop a novel
statistical method to assess whether longitudinal stability of stress physiology
is indicative of individual variation in temperament. Next, they examine whether
consistently moderate stress responses and non-reactive temperaments that
distinguish prestigious human leaders also predict tolerant, prosocial
behavioral strategies in nonhuman primates. Finally, they probe how behavioral
strategies contribute to leadership pathways rooted in dominance versus
prestige, specifically asking whether prosociality incurs benefits via social
attractiveness independently of conventional dominance
rank.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
