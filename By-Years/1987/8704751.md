The Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar began in 1982. It now holds four
3-day meetings and several shorter meetings per year. The seminar covers a broad
spectrum of mathematical logic with particular emphasis on complexity theory and
theoretical computer science, models of arithmetic, model theory and model
theoretic algebra, set theory, sub-systems of analysis (the "reverse
mathematics" program of H. Friedman and S. Simpson) and topos theory. Foundation
funding permits bringing speakers from outside the geographic area, also
attendance by graduate students and others without outside support, as well as
some incidental expenses. The quality of the seminars has been remarkably high
and the cost modest.
