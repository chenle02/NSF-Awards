The Kewalo Marine Laboratory of the University of Hawaii has acquired a suite of
instrumentation for gene delivery and microscopy with support from the National
Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program. Because of
their proximal location to marine fauna, marine laboratories provide
unprecedented access to a diverse array of research opportunities unavailable at
most university campuses. Researchers at the Kewalo Marine Laboratory, uniquely
situated adjacent to living coral reefs near downtown Honolulu, use cellular and
molecular approaches to investigate a wide variety of biological phenomena
utilizing a full range of marine organisms. Research at the Kewalo Marine Lab
runs the gamut of studies that includes the evolution of body plan diversity,
life history evolution, regeneration, symbiosis, and effects of biofilms and
environmental stressors on developing embryos and larvae. This grant funds an
integrated system for labeling, tracking, and documenting living single cells
over time within the intact organism. Cell labeling strategies include a
precision intracellular microinjection apparatus and a gold particle ballistic
delivery system, both of which have advantages in particular preparations.
Imaging of labeled cells will be performed by multi-channel confocal microscopy
that can image the variety of fluorescent proteins/reagents simultaneously
required for each preparation while eliminating background noise. The integrated
system is effective and adaptable to the wide array of animal models currently
utilized at the Kewalo Marine Lab. This system of cell labeling and
documentation will allow students/trainees to exploit the most modern techniques
to address fundamental problems in cellular, developmental, evolutionary, and
environmental biology. Results from the studies will be disseminated by student
and faculty presentations at local and national meetings, and in peer-reviewed
journals.
