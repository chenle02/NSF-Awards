This award provides partial support for the Fifth International Conference on
Arabidopsis Research to be held at the Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, on
August 19-22, 1993. The aim is to provide an opportunity for researchers to
exchange ideas on all aspects of Arabidopsis research, including genome-related
efforts. The conference will include sessions on embryo, vegetative and
reproductive development, cell differentiation, phytohormone,s photobiology,
metabolism, pathogen and strews interactions, gene regulation, genome research,
and new technologies. This is the first international Arabidopsis conference to
be held since 1990 and the number of researcher using Arabidopsis as an
experimental system has been growing at a tremendous rate. Thus, it is timely to
hold this conference at this time. The conference is designed to maximize
participation of young scientist and provide an opportunity for graduate
students, postdoctoral students, and established investigators to exchange
research results and ideas on the full range of topics that are being
investigated in this important model system.
