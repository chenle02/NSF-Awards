Interdisciplinary (99) This is a 3-year curriculum adaptation and implementation
project that focuses on a set of 4 new science courses (three 4-credit hour
courses and a 1 credit-hour project-based capstone seminar) for elementary-
education and non-science majors at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC)
and Chicago-area Community Colleges (CCs). The new courses are based on guiding
principles, and incorporate elements, that derive from the rich literature on
science teaching and learning and the overarching goals of national and local
standards. These courses are resulting from collaborations between UIC and the
CCs, among faculties in UIC's Colleges of Education and Liberal Arts and
Sciences, and the CCs, among specialists in different sciences, and between K-12
teachers and college faculty. The courses are enhanced by adapting and
implementing elements of the innovative set of courses developed by faculty at
the University of Michigan at Dearborn. Three elements of the UMD program are
being adapted: inquiry labs, assessment practices, and emphases in capstone
course. The quality and impact of the project is being assessed by gathering and
analyzing data on (1) faculty views on the adaptation and implementation of
these courses, (2) fit between planned and enacted curriculum and pedagogy, and
(3) student learning.&lt;br/&gt;
