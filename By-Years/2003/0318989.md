ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0318989&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
2003, the first ever Permeable Sediment Gordon Research Conference will be held
on June 15-20 at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine to discuss the geochemistry,
biology and physical dynamics of surficial permeable sediments. A major
objective of the Gordon Conference will be to bring together members of the
scientific community, along with post doctoral fellows and graduate students, to
discuss new and exciting research in the emerging field of permeable sediments
within an informal setting. Presentations and discussions at the 2003 Gordon
Conference will center around the potential global importance of permeable
sediments, connection between ocean chemistry and climate change, the chemical
processes in marine sediments and the development of new analytical techniques
and their applications. The Gordon Conference has become recognized as an
important venue to exchange ideas in interdisciplinary fields and forge new
scientific alliances. For this reason the National Science Foundation, along
with the Office of Naval Research, the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research
and the Gordon Research Conference, will co-sponsor the participation of 26
session chairs, speakers, post doctoral fellows and graduate students in the
2003 Permeable Sediment Gordon Conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
