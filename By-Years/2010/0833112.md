The University of Puerto Rico, Mayag√ºez (UPRM) seeks to integrate education and
research by establishing a Nanotechnology Center for Biomedical and Energy-
Driven Systems and Applications (NCBEDSA). The overall Center strategy will
secure national competitiveness of UPRM in the area of materials engineering
research and nanotechnology. The Center?s mission is to integrate ongoing
research and education efforts in engineered nanostructured materials focused on
two strategic areas for the institution and the island: biomedical and energy-
driven systems. Within this framework, the NCBEDSA faculty will broaden and
strengthen graduate and undergraduate education throughout the institution by
supporting existing and upcoming pertinent graduate programs and developing new
ones. This will form a cadre of lifelong-learning materials professionals with a
robust interdisciplinary training. To achieve the aforementioned goals the
Center will be organized into four interdisciplinary research groups (IGRs) and
one interdisciplinary educational group (IEG). The Center?s transformative
research focuses on fundamental and applied aspects of nanomaterials
encompassing: IGR1) multifunctional nanoparticles for magnetically actuated
siRNA delivery; IGR2) quantum dot systems for cancer therapy; IGR3) nanoporous
materials for separations and catalysis; and IGR4) nanoengineered composite
materials for energy efficient devices and applications. The Center?s research
will impact society by developing novel nanomaterials to be used in improved
therapies and diagnostics, cleaner and more efficient energy alternatives. In
addition, the Center?s proposed activities will foster the in-corporation of
Hispanics in the workforce pipeline leading to advanced degrees in engineering
areas related to Nanotechnology.
