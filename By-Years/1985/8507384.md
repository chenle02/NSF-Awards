The Microwave Electronics Group at the University of Massachusetts has
established strong research programs in the areas of microwave materials,
devices, circuits, and systems with special emphasis on precision microwave
instruments that can be used to remotely sense geophysical parameters on the
Earth's surface. The Microwave Remote Sensing Laboratory plans to develop a
special purpose, multifrequency coherent radar that can be used to measure ocean
surface currents. This grant provides equipment to support the research needed
to develop this instrument and to establish the ability of coherent
multifrequency radars to measure ocean surface currents.
