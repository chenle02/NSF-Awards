Checkpoints were first identified as regulatory controls that stop the cell
cycle after DNA damage. Such arrests of the cell cycle allow time for efficient
replication and repair. Checkpoint genes are those that cause these arrests
after DNA damage; checkpoint mutants fail to do so and either exhibit genome
instability and/or die. The mechanisms by which wild-type checkpoint genes
ensure genome stability are still poorly understood, mainly for two reasons.
First, individual checkpoint genes have roles in multiple checkpoints (e.g., one
gene is essential for arrest during both DNA replication and chromosome
segregation) and can have roles in other aspects of DNA metabolism as well
(e.g., dNTP synthesis, stability of DNA replication forks, telomere synthesis).
Second, genome instability is itself a complex process involving the gain or
loss of whole chromosomes, and novel, sometimes complex chromosomal
rearrangements. To understand how checkpoint genes stabilize a genome, the
investigator has developed a model of chromosome instability termed "fragile
site instability." This instability can involve DNA breaks and recombination in
a defined chromosomal region (a fragile site), the formation of multiply
rearranged chromosomes, and a high frequency of aberrations in checkpoint
mutants. Recent data from the investigator's laboratory suggest that fragile
site instability may be linked to defects in DNA replication. This project is
designed to reveal how instability is linked to specific DNA sequences in the
fragile site, to checkpoint gene dysfunctions, and to DNA replication.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multiple links between checkpoint gene function and
genome stability are important to understand because perturbations of genome
stability have profound effects on the functioning of all organisms. Thus this
project may lead to insights that will benefit all of society. In addition, the
investigator will continue his educational activities, which in the past have
included mentoring individuals from the level of high school students to
postdoctoral fellows.&lt;br/&gt;
