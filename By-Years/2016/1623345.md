The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and
study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the
preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue
STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Norfolk State University
seeks to raise the passing rate of pre-calculus by actively engaging students
through implementation of the flipped classroom. As HBCUs produce the vast
majority of African Americans entering the STEM workforce, these efforts will
not only help this trend but also produce STEM graduates who are better
prepared. These efforts will have a big impact on bolstering students'
completion of STEM degrees, thus increasing the number of STEM majors entering
graduate schools and the work place. In addition, this course structure will
also be presented to secondary education professionals in workshops in the
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goals of the project are to increase
the success rate in the STEM pre-calculus course and to deepen math connections
to boost student learning. The specific goals are to: 1) increase the passing
rate in pre-calculus; and 2) to provide a strong foundation in pre-calculus to
bolster an increase in STEM major retention. Through the more hands-on approach
via the flipped model, this project will strive to strengthen quantitative
abilities, reasoning and critical thinking skills. The benefits to STEM
education and NSU in achieving these goals include greater retention of
undergraduate majors in STEM fields with a stronger foundation in STEM topics
and development of autonomous learners which leads to a higher rate of students
obtaining degrees and entering the workforce.
