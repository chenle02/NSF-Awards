This project at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Department&lt;br/&gt;of
Mathematics, will establish a three-pronged program. First, it
will&lt;br/&gt;position talented young students to move directly from high
school into an&lt;br/&gt;accelerated university concentration leading to the
B.S. and M.S. in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics in four to five years. Secondly, it will
smooth the student's&lt;br/&gt;transition from undergraduate to graduate student
with increasing emphasis&lt;br/&gt;on independent research. Thirdly, it will
supplement the traditional&lt;br/&gt;teaching/research basis of our mathematics
doctoral program with emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;breadth in mathematics, exposure to
another science, and development of&lt;br/&gt;interpersonal and communication
skills that will be of use in pursuing a&lt;br/&gt;life-long professional career
in mathematics or a mathematics-related area.&lt;br/&gt; This program provides a
template for selecting and guiding talented&lt;br/&gt;U.S. citizens and
permanent residents from the high school experience&lt;br/&gt;through a program
of broad training for a mathematics career. Currently this&lt;br/&gt;country
sees very few of its most able high school graduates pursue the
B.S.&lt;br/&gt;in mathematics. Of these, fewer still go on to higher degrees or
a profession in mathematics. A plan is established for identifying, attracting
and retaining prospective mathematicians, from high school through to the
doctorate, and offers broad-based training in skills critical to functioning in
today's workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
