This project will develop a better understanding of the formation of galaxies at
high redshift by using numerical N-Body simulations with high resolution and
physical detail in a full Cold Dark Matter cosmological context. The simulations
will follow the evolution of early galaxies up to the present time to connect
their properties with those of present-day galaxies. The project will relate
directly the spatial distribution and physical properties of the particles in
the N-Body simulations with the quantities actually measured for real high
redshift galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include a program to
help underrepresented minorities in their transition to college and possibly an
astronomy major, and research opportunities for undergraduates.
