The computer system at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill will be
upgraded to support research which emphasizes quantum mechanics and molecular
dynamics in understanding molecular structure and biological activity. Specific
projects include: 1) fundamental physical problems of molecular structure, 2)
physical chemistry of molecular interactions in aqueous solution, 3) problem
related to protein folding and the stability of folding conformations and 4)
conformation of proteins of the hemostatic pathway.
