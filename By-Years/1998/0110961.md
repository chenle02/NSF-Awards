Thyroid hormones have profound effects on growth and development of many cell
types (including brain cells) and also regulate the basal metabolic rate and
other functions of adult tissues. The actions of thyroid hormones in brain were
believed to be limited to effects on gene expression during the early
developmental period, but new evidence has shown that the hormones can influence
the adult brain. Biochemical and molecular approaches are used to study the
mechanism of actions of thyroid hormone in adult central nervous system. Using a
synaptosomal preparation of brain tissue without cell nuclei, the details of
regulation of protein phosphorylation by thyroid hormones will be examined. The
research will increase the understanding of a novel mechanism of action of
thyroid hormones in adult brain.&lt;br/&gt; The significance of the findings
will extend beyond the field of neuroendocrinology to add to the general
comprehension of cell signaling pathways in cell biology. The project also
offers undergraduates opportunities for neuroendocrinology research training in
a laboratory that has an excellent history of such
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
