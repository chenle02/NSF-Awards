The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 300 MHz FT-NMR for use in both lower
and upper division chemistry and biology laboratory courses and for
undergraduate research. Students in general chemistry are performing kinetic
measurements, while their counterparts in introductory biology are studying in
vivo glycolysis by 13C NMR. Examples of upper division student use are
investigations of enzyme stereoselectivity, and the structure of natural
products by multiple pulse experiments.
