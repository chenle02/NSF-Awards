This research addresses primarily the air-sea interaction problem from a GCM
perspective. The focus is on two major issues: 1) Variability of the Atlantic
climate, including the sensitivity of the atmospheric circulation to sea surface
temperature (SST) anomalies, inter-basin relations of SST anomalies, and
feedbacks on the ocean of the altered atmospheric circulation, and 2) The impact
of improved parameterizations of clouds processes and cloud amount on modeling
water vapor feedback in the atmospheric response to change in SST of the type
expected due to increased concentration of greenhouse gases. The approach for
investigation is based on numerical experimentation with the UCLA atmospheric
general circulation model (AGCM). This research is important because it seeks to
give a predictive understanding of the most important processes affecting
climate variability and change.
