Understanding transient behavior of engineering systems is becoming increasingly
important in designing, optimizing, and controlling high technology products. As
such, engineering programs should provide opportunities for undergraduate
students to learn about the significance of dynamic phenomena and the tools that
the engineer uses to examine them. This plan will focus on dynamic measurements
of phenomena in fluid dynamics and hydraulics, vibrations, and combustion
engines. To initiate the laboratory development plan it is necessary to
establish three lab computer workstations which can perform high speed data
acquisition, conduct extensive data analysis, and present graphical and tabular
results in a flexible manner. These workstations will be used to illustrate the
theory of dynamic instruments discussed in experimental methods courses and will
allow dynamic phenomena to be routinely studied in undergraduate laboratory
projects. Possible topics include investigation of wing tip vortices on wind
tunnel models to gain insight into ways of controlling the accompanied induced
drag, selection of structural members with acceptable damping characteristics,
and comparison of burning rates in diesel engines fired with various biomass
fuels.
