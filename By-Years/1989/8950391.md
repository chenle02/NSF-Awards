The college will acquire lasers, optical equipment and related electronic
instrumentation to equip a new intermediate-level laboratory course in lasers
and optics for physics, chemistry, and biology majors. The equipment will also
be used to provide significantly enhanced capabilities for student research
projects, both for summer research and for the senior honors program, utilizing
lasers and optics in physics and chemistry. The college will match the award
with an equal amount of funds.
