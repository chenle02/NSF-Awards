This research project studies several problems in discrete geometry, which lies
on the interface of combinatorics and geometry. Problems in the field are often
simply described, and typically involve fundamental objects in Euclidean space
such as points, lines, spheres, etc. While many questions in discrete geometry
are worth studying for their own sake, others are motivated by their
applications in computer science and engineering. More recently, discrete
geometry has seen tremendous growth, and numerous unexpected connections to
other fields of mathematics are being discovered. One of the main goals of this
project is to further explore these connections, and to apply new tools and
techniques to several long-standing open problems. The PI will also continue to
encourage high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students to work in
combinatorial research, and continue to teach courses that cover the latest
results and open problems in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two main
areas under investigation: geometric Ramsey theory and incidence geometry. Over
the past few decades, Ramsey numbers have been applied extensively to give upper
bounds on homogeneity problems arising in geometry. For many of these
applications, one can obtain much better bounds by exploiting the fact that the
edges are defined algebraically. The PI will continue a sequence of recent works
on Ramsey-type problems for hypergraphs defined algebraically, which includes
the famous Happy Ending Problem of Erdos and Szekeres, and finding large
independent sets in intersection graphs of geometric objects. Another major goal
of this project is to explore various extensions of the Szemeredi-Trotter
theorem and its applications to additive number theory. Specific problems
include characterizing dense point-line arrangements and estimating the number
of incidences between points and d-dimensional varieties.
