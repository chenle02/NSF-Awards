This project serves financially needy, academically talented students through
its Next Generation Tech Stars Scholarship program. The program assists
promising students in completing associate degrees (with the option of
transferring to a four-year program) in the closely aligned disciplines of
Engineering Technology, Industrial Technology, and Computer
Technology/Telecommunications Management. This project is built on strong
partnerships with industry and is designed to increase the number of well
educated and skilled employees in high demand technical areas. Diverse cohorts
of full-time, talented students have been recruited who meet NSF-required and
project-specific selection criteria. Extensive student support services exist,
e.g., on-campus child care, tutoring, industry internships, and open/staffed
computer laboratories. New services are: Success Coaching, mentoring, Loan-to-
Own laptop computers, recognition of success, and academic, personal, and career
assistance.

The project objectives include providing 30 scholarships annually, and financial
support from industry will ensure that no worthy Tech Star are left without the
financial assistance needed for degree completion when the project ends. The
Tech Stars Scholarship program fosters diversity. At least 40% of scholarships
are awarded to African American students and 35% to female students. Through
enhanced student support services and industry involvement, 100% of Tech Stars
are retained through graduation. Of those who graduate, 100% who desire
enrollment in a four-year institution are assisted with the transfer process.
Career awareness and job placement assistance ensures that 100% of graduates who
want to enter the workforce are employed in jobs related to their major within
three months of graduation. The current CSEMS grant has already resulted in an
on-time graduation rate of 87% for STEM students compared to 9-14% overall for
the college.
