In this award, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Division of Chemistry, Professor Patrick H. Vaccaro of Yale University, together
with his graduate and undergraduate student researchers, will study the
structure and properties of a number of gas-phase chemical systems. Included
amongst these will be laser spectroscopic studies of the hydrogen-bond tunneling
dynamics in tropolone and the low-barrier hydrogen bonding and conical
intersections in ÃŸ-diketo enols. In addition, Prof. Vaccaro and his group will
continue their pioneering efforts in developing ultrasensitive methods for
measuring the optical activity (optical rotatory dispersion and electronic
circular dichroism) in gas-phase chiral molecules, using cavity-ringdown
techniques.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Hydrogen bonding is important in a number of
contexts, including giving water its unique chemical and physical properties, as
well as being a vital component of biomolecule interaction. Vaccaro's group will
study the behavior of the hydrogen bond in a number of its guises. Vacarro's
work in gas-phase chiroptical spectroscopy is providing theorists with important
solvent-free measurements with which to compare with computer-based calculations
of optical activity. Already, this has provided a number of important, non-
intuitive, insights and will continue to do so. The students trained in the
Vaccaro laboratory will be trained in modern methods of laser spectroscopy, and
will be important additions to the technical workforce. Vaccaro's research group
is majority female, and hence Prof. Vaccaro is contributing to an increase in
the number of scientists in this particular underrepresented group.&lt;br/&gt;
