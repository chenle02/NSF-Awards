This is a project to develop a production function which captures how
technological improvements impact the work force. The impact of lead times and
lags is a key innovation. Then using optimal control, the optimal mix and
expansion/contraction of these elements is determined in an uncertain
environment. In a longer term scenario, a model is developed to determine
optimal sizing and capacity of new production capacity. The completion of this
project should give new insights into the strategic planning process, and help
to lead the way to improved corporate and governmental planning.
