PI: Fisher, Jonathan Proposal Number:1541612

This proposal, whose driving goal is the need for a portable device capable of
quantifying biomarkers of traumatic brain injury (TBI), focuses on determining
the utility of Electroencephalography (EEG) and Diffuse Correlation
Spectrography (DCS) for detecting TBI biomarkers in an animal model.

TBI is a very significant issue in both military and civilian medicine.
Diagnosis and assessment of TBI patients is generally performed using clinical
imaging modalities (MRI, CT). However, the future availability of portable
devices for assessing TBI would fundamentally improve the outlook for TBI
patients. The diagnosis and treatment of TBI is impeded by gaps in regulatory
science due to a lack of quantifiable biomarkers. Two complementary measurement
parameters have potential to fill this gap. (1) measurement of somatosensory
evoked electrophysiological potentials (SSEPs); and (2) diffuse correlation
spectroscopy (DCS). This proposal seeks to evaluate the utility of these
parameters for detecting TBI in an animal model without the need for a baseline,
pre-injury measurement.
