Laplacian eigenfunctions are the fundamental modes of vibrations which are
modeled by the Laplace operator in partial differential equations (PDE). PDE are
used to model various phenomena in the physical world. In music, eigenfunctions
are, for example, oscillations of a guitar's string or vibrations of a drum's
membrane. In mathematics, eigenfunctions are the higher dimensional analogs of
the familiar trigonometric functions. In quantum mechanics, eigenfunctions are
known as the energy states. The study of nodal sets (that is, zero-level sets)
dates back to the eighteenth century with the discovery of the Chladni patterns.
These nodal sets are places where a metal plate vibrate the least. In quantum
mechanics, nodal sets are where quantum particles are least likely to be found.
Understanding the profile of eigenfunctions of a given energy (i.e., eigenvalue)
hinges on our ability to answer the following questions: (i) How large are the
sizes of level sets of eigenfunctions with respect to the frequency?; and (ii)
How does the information about eigenfunctions on some given set propagate to
nearby sets? This project provides training opportunities for undergraduate and
graduate students, as well as outreach activities aimed at K-12 students and the
general public.

The research objectives of this project focus on quantitative studies of level
sets of eigenfunctions for the Laplace operator and related topics for solutions
of PDE. The principal investigator (PI) aims to study the upper bounds on the
measure of nodal and singular sets for various Laplace operators on smooth
surfaces. The PI will also study bounds on nodal sets of eigenfunctions in
periodic elliptic homogenization. This line of investigation will contribute to
the understanding of quantitative properties of heterogeneous media. Another
research direction that will be pursued as part of the project is the study
quantitative unique continuation for elliptic PDE with regular and singular
potentials. The outcome will be a better understanding of the strong unique
continuation property for various types of PDE. This will lead to a number of
applications in inverse problems and control theory.
