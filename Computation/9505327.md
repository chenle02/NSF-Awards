Powell The investigator and his colleagues study the spatial dynamics of
populations, developing and analyzing models that incorporate biological data
and investigating the way individuals of a population aggregate and disperse.
Aggregation leads to spatial complexity through feedback. The feedback is
nonlinear when the cues individuals use to aggregate depend on the number of
individuals. In a population model that allows for movement, aggregative
feedback causes nonlinear self-focussing, the organization or `focussing' of
population groups on small scales. Decreases in the scale of spatial correlation
make the dispersal pattern more complex, leading to complicated spatial
structure. Mathematically, issues of pattern formation are related to the
structure of invasion waves or `fronts' between ecological states. When the
structure is known, stability analyses of states behind the front or along the
front determine how complexity is generated. A body of mathematical work has
focussed on predicting the speed and shape of invasion waves in biological
problems. Unfortunately, known techniques only address the invasion problem in
systems of low dimensionality (one or two dependent variables), and do not lend
themselves to general ecological application. Techniques to predict front
propagation in systems of many variables are therefore at the center of the
research. Front solutions, or waves of invasion, are the basis for stability
analyses at invasion boundaries, which predict how curvature instabilities
produce complexity at the invasion boundaries. Results of these mathematical
efforts are used to understand complexity generation in the mountain pine
beetle/pine system. Results from the mathematical model are compared with data
on size, shape, and structure of known infestations. In short, the idea is to
determine how much focussing, or clumping, of a species determines the natural
formation of patterns in ecosystems. Aggregation, or clumping, of spec ies
occurs naturally, and can be predicted mathematically. The researchers examine
how this mechanism creates complexity in ecosystems, and study how to determine
how much of ecological complexity is self-generating, as opposed to being
generated by the complexity of the environment. The Mountain Pine
Beetle/Lodgepole Pine ecosystem is studied because elements of the spatial
pattern (attacked and killed trees) are distinctive and easy to measure.
Moreover, understanding the predictable aspects of the course of pine beetle
infestations is important to understanding the role this pest plays in western
forests, including the relationship between beetle-killed pines and forest fire.
