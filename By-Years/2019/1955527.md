Professors David P. Goldberg and Sara Thoi of Johns Hopkins University seek to
understand how biomimetic iron complexes react with nitrogen oxide (NOx)
species. NOx species and their interactions with metal ions in biology have been
implicated in cellular stress, signal transduction, and enzymatic functioning.
Other, similar nitrogen oxides (HNO) is of significant interest because of its
unique biological activity, including its possible roles as a signaling
molecule, an antioxidant, and as a pharmacological agent for
heart&lt;br/&gt;failure and cancer. An understanding of the biological
mechanisms of NOx reactivity will be advanced by examining the synthetic,
biomimetic systems. In particular, the research of Goldberg and Thoi give new
fundamental knowledge about pathways to and from nitric oxide and other
nitrogen-containing gases as well as ammonia. One objective is to examine the
effect of acids on the way iron interacts with nitrogen oxides. The team also
examines new ways to generate HNO, a proposed, key intermediate in the iron-
based reactions. The catalysis research entails the use of electrolysis to
evaluate the reaction pathways. Students involved in this project are trained in
the scientific method, preparing them for occupations in education, research,
and industry. Outreach efforts to neighboring middle and high schools broaden
participation in STEM-related fields, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the
scientific workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project
involves the design, synthesis, and mechanistic study of nonheme iron complexes
for the activation of NOx species in the Goldberg laboratory, combined with
electrochemical and electrocatalytic studies in the Thoi laboratory. This
synergistic approach leads to new information on how structure relates to
function for complexes of biological relevance and environmental significance.
NOx species and their interactions with metal ions in biology have been
implicated in cellular stress, signal transduction, and enzymatic functioning.
The environmental significance of M/NOx species arises from the global nitrogen
cycle, which involves both oxidative and reductive pathways that interconvert
N2, NH3, and NOx species. Graduate students are trained in experimental chemical
science, with a focus on bioinorganic chemistry, electrochemistry, synthesis,
catalysis, chemical instrumentation, and mechanism. The investigators and their
graduate students participate in both elementary and high school outreach
programs in Baltimore City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
