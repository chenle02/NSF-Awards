Recent experiments by the applicants have shown that the glycogen- deficient
phenotype of the glc7- (ppy1-1) mutant of S. cerevisiae is a result of a
mutation in the gene for the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1. This
gene, which has been cloned an named PPY1, shares 81% sequence identity at the
amino acid level with phosphatase 1 from rabbit skeletal muscle. The first major
objective of the proposed studies is to determine the DNA sequence of the mutant
PPY1 gene and to compare wild type and mutant protein phosphatase 1 with respect
to substrate specificity, turnover number and association with regulatory
proteins. The association with regulatory proteins is of particular interest
since preliminary experiments indicate that chromatographic properties of the
enzyme are affected by the mutation, a finding which is most readily explained
by altered association with regulatory subunits. In rabbit skeletal muscle,
protein phosphatase 1 exists only in association with one of the three
regulatory subunits, which are know as inhibitor 2, G-subunit and M-subunit. The
second major objective of the proposed studies is to characterize regulatory
subunits or heat-stable inhibitor proteins that interact with the phosphatase 1
catalytic subunit and to determine if they are homologous to the regulatory
proteins that have been identified in mammals. Association with regulatory
subunits will be evaluated by identification of holoenzyme forms by
chromatographic and immunological methods. The results of these experiments will
help to elucidate the regulation of an important class of enzymes.//
