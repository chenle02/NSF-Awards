ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0352756&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An investigator
from Stanford University proposes to utilize fresh suspended matter samples
recovered from sediment traps in September 2003 at two sites in Monterey Bay
(S2-300m and 1200m; S3-300m and 2400m) to study the composition of particulate
organic carbon (POC) and particulate organic phosphorus (POP) using 13C and
31P-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectra. The investigator also plans to
determine the P content in different operationally defined fractions (e.g.,
exchangeable P, Fe-bound P, apatite, carbonate bound P, detrital/inorganic P and
organic P) of the suspended matter samples using SEDEX sequential leaching. The
goals of the study are to evaluate the utility of NRM spectra to determine the
composition of particulate organic matter (POM) in sediment traps, as well as
investigate the seasonal and depth variability of the molecular composition of
POM and P associations. Results from the project will be related to the
availability and regeneration rates of P, as well as biological productivity and
ecosystem structure in the water column. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
