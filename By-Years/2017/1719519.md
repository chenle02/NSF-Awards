The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program
provides support projects to design, implement, and assess strategies that can
lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students
receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening
STEM education and research. The project at North Carolina Central University
seeks to produce the next generation of scientists who are creative problem
solvers, self-directed learners, innovators, knowledge generators, and economic
stimulators. The overall goal is to significantly increase the retention and
graduation rate of underrepresented minority students at the University choosing
career paths in STEM majors, graduate programs, and workforce.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The activities and strategies involve: implementing a proactive
advising system; contributing to students' science identity development;
launching problem-based learning pedagogy in undergraduate mathematics and
science courses; and stimulating innovation and entrepreneurial thinking. The
activities and strategies are evidence-based and what is learned through this
project can serve as a model for other institutions. The project is informed by
an on-going evaluation.
