of curriculum resource guides; (2) a restructuring of the state's elementary and
middle school teacher preparation programs through the development of new
approaches to teaching science at the postsecondary level; and (3) developing
teacher and community support for these Ä±and other! systemic changes through
interactive communications networks. Cost sharing: 170%.
