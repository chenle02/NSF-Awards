This is a proposal to intestigate the celebrated Hirsch conjecture using the new
theoretical framework that was developed recently by the investigator and
collaborators for resolving the conjecture. In contrast to all of the previous
attacks on the conjecture which were inherently combinatorial, the new strategy
brings to bear on the conjecture the powerful machinery of continuous analysis
and representation theory of continuous groups. Preliminary results from the new
approach include (i) the discovery of a new formulation of the Hirsch conjecture
with connections to Gaussian elimination, and (ii) the emergence of the most
compelling theoretical and empirical evidence to date about the validity of not
just the Hirsch conjecture but a considerably stronger version of it. The
project aims at proving the strong Hirsch conjecture by employing powerful
techniques from differential geometry and cohomology theory. The strong Hirsch
conjecture, if proved, would show the existence of exponentially many paths of
linear length between the initial and optimal vertices of a polyhedron, and
would hence revitalize the research for polynomial-time Simplex algorithms. ***
