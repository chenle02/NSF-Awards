This project will develop an interdisciplinary, on-line database on
environmental issues in the U.S. Northwest, for use by teachers, scholars,
researchers and members of the public who wish to understand their ethical,
legal, social and scientific aspects. Called NWEST Values, the database will
include summary, review, and related publications from a wide range of
specialists working on social, legal, and scientific questions in the
environment, and full-text reports from government agencies. The project team
will collaborate with researchers in the humanities, social sciences, biological
and physical sciences, law, mining, agriculture, forestry, and environmental
engineering. It will compile an extensive annotated bibliogaphy of
interdisciplinary references. The database will specifically include a large
amount of information relating to Native Americans and to rural concerns.
Information will be available on-line through the CARL System that links over
350 libraries nationwide, through Internet worldwide, and diskettes and paper
copies of the material for those without computer access.
