This award provides one-half the funds required for the acquisition of a
digitized microscope system that will be used for research in the Department of
Geological Sciences at Brown University. The University will be providing the
remaining funds. The microscope system will be devoted to data acquisition in
petrological research involving the study of strain and volume loss associated
with the metamorphism of sediments accreted at convergent plate boundaries, and
will also be used in fission track dating applications.
