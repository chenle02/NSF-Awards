This award supports the development, assessment, and dissemination of resource
material for "Peer Instruction" in quantum mechanics, from sophomore-level
modern physics to the junior-senior level courses, to prepare future scientists
and engineers for the demands of a high-tech workplace with its growing
dependence on quantum phenomena. The resource material includes the
"ConcepTests" for formative assessment, standardized assessment tools for
summative assessment and the material for Just-In-Time Teaching (JITT) including
"Reactive Homework" problems for modern physics and quantum mechanics courses.
The research-based material will continue to be developed using findings of
student misconceptions and difficulties in learning quantum mechanics. A major
goal of this phase of the project will be a rigorous assessment of the material
at other colleges and Universities. Control studies comparing similar courses in
Modern Physics and Quantum Mechanics in which Peer Instruction was employed with
those for which this pedagogical method was not employed are ongoing. Such
studies will be extended to other colleges and universities. Standardized
assessment tools involving multiple-choice questions will continue to be
developed and refined for assessment purposes. Peer Instruction material
developed will continue to be disseminated through workshops at professional
meetings, publications in journals, personal and professional society websites,
and presentations at colloquia and seminars at various universities and
colleges. The resource material developed as part of this project will be
published as a reference book suitable for instructors towards the end of the
project period.
