Dynamic programming is one of the older general algorithmic techniques that has
been used widely in such diverse fields as molecular biology, control theory,
economics and operations research, as well as in many areas in computer science,
such as computational geometry, string editing and VLSI layouts. Until recently,
most applications were tackled with the general dynamic programming technique.
Recent years have witnessed a renewed interest in dynamic programming as
researchers have begun to uncover that many of these applications satisfy
additional conditions which can be exploited to yield significant improvements
in both the sequential and the parallel complexity of some problems. This
project examines methods for speeding up the dynamic programming technique. The
PI will work to significantly improve the sequential and parallel solutions for
classes of dynamic programming problems, and seek to find ways to identify and
exploit extra constraints often found in many problems in a class. There will
also be work on finding efficient solutions to some specific problems that fit
into the dynamic programming framework. These problems are important in their
own right, and furthermore, their solution should lead to useful insights in how
to handle the more general cases.
