This award supports a feasibility study to test a new system for the
quantitative release of oxygen from the surfaces of thick sections of silicate
rocks or minerals by use of a pulsed excimer laser emitting in the ultraviolet
(193 nm). The system will be designed to release molecules from the surface by
breaking bonds without heating the sample significantly. The released molecules
then are reacted with fluorine gas to liberate oxygen which is fed to a mass
spectrometer in the form of CO2 gas. The system is expected to improve existing
laser sources for stable isotope mass spectrometry which use longer wave length
lasers that melt the sample before releasing oxygen-containing molecules,
thereby causing spurious isotope fractionation and a degradation of the spatial
resolution of the method.
