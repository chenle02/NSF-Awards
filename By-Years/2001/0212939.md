The inside of a cell is a crowded place where macromolecular solutes, mostly
proteins, reach concentrations of hundreds of grams per liter. However, almost
all in vitro studies of protein biophysics are conducted at solute
concentrations that rarely exceed a fraction of a gram per liter. This
discrepancy poses an important question: do the observations made in dilute
solution always coincide with what happens inside cells? Preliminary data show
that the answer is no. Specifically, NMR data show that FlgM, a protein that is
unfolded in dilute solution, gains structure inside living Escherichia coli
cells. Additional data show that FlgM gains structure in vitro on adding high
concentrations (400 g/L) of glucose, bovine serum albumin, or ovalbumin. Given
these data proving the biological significance of crowding, the objective of the
research is to understand the effects of physiologically relevant crowded
environments on protein equilibria, particularly direct studies in living cells.
The proteins to be studied are FlgM, alpha -synuclein, and cytochrome c. Like
FlgM, alpha -synuclein is unfolded in dilute solution. The first hypothesis is
that there are two classes of natively unfolded proteins. Class 1 (FlgM)
collapses and folds under physiologically relevant crowded conditions. Class 2
(alpha -synuclein) collapses but does not fold under these conditions. The
second hypothesis is that macromolecular crowding stabilizes globular proteins
in cells. The globular protein cytochrome c will be used to test this
hypothesis. The methods to be used include, heteronuclear multidimensional NMR,
especially NMR detected amide proton exchange experiments, circular dichroism
spectropolarimetry, and directed mutagenesis.
