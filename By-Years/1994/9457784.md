Molecular biology is becoming a major source of new open problems for
theoretical computer science. This research identifies emerging combinatorial
problems in genome rearrangements and DNA physical mapping and to solve open
biological problems using combinatorial techniques. In particular, this work
develops algorithms for the open biological problem of constructing evolutionary
scenarios of genome rearrangements in herpes viruses. In considering possible
vaccine strategies for human herpes viruses, systematic knowledge of their
genetic capabilities will be invaluable.
