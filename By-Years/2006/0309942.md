Physics (13) The National Research Council calls for all students to learn
science "through methods and processes of inquiry". The Muhlenberg College
Physics Department offers inquiry-based courses for humanities and social
science students. The Physics of Music also serves this population. The course
explores the scientific bases for the observable phenomena of the art of music.
The course is an adaptation of many resources including a module from Workshop
Physics developed by Priscilla Laws, and web resources such as
http://faculty.millikin.edu/~jaskill.nsm.faculty.mu/musicinfo.html, and Reginald
Bain's, "A Web-based Multimedia Approach to the Harmonic Series" published in
2002 CMS/ATMI Conference, ATMI Program Kansas City, MO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
course provides an attractive entry point to exploring rigorous scientific
principles, by sparking student curiosity and encouraging a scientific approach
to problem solving which can be applied across the curriculum. The active-
learning approach of this inquiry-based course develops technological literacy
through use of current technology for experimental observation. Classroom
assessments developed by an evaluator measure the students' abilities to connect
abstract concepts with concrete examples from the world of sound. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The course is designed and taught by professors from the two
disciplines, physics and music. By demonstrating that concepts in physics may be
applied to music through activities that relate to students' everyday
experiences of listening to music, the course enhances student learning. Project
results are disseminated through conference presentations and articles. The
course offers a novel and engaging approach to science and technology that can
be embraced by other liberal arts institutions. &lt;br/&gt;
