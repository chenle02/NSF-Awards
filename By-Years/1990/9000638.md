SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience) is a multi-week, university-
level research experience focused on modern geophysical exploration. In 6 years
of operation since 1983, 163 undergraduate students (including 33 women) have
participated in research using seismic reflection and refraction, gravity,
magnetics, electrical resistivity, electromagnetics, and magnetotellurics. The
SAGE field area in the Rio Grande rift near Sante Fe, New Mexico provides a
stimulating tectonic research environment as well as an opportunity to study
occurrences of groundwater and hydrocarbons. SAGE students participate in every
phase of the field research from the collection and processing of data to its
interpretation culminating with both an oral and written report. SAGE research
is now focused on characterizing a classic rift accommodation zone. SAGE is
sponsored by the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Branch of the Institute
of Geophysics and Planetary Physics of the University of California and six
universities who furnish faculty and over $2,000,000 worth of geophysical
equipment. Students are accepted from any school. There is enthusiastic support
from industry; for example, ARCO Oil and Gas Company donated an entire Vibroseis
crew to the SAGE 89 effort.
