9402775 Longo This award will support Kael Hanson's dissertation research in
particle physics at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory near Rome, Italy,
under the direction of Professor Carlo Bemporad of the University of Pisa,
Italy. Mr. Hanson will use data from the Monopole and Astrophysical Cosmic Ray
Observatory (MACRO). He will study upward-going electron neutrino interactions
and will measure the ratio of upward-going electron neutrinos to muon neutrinos.
While considerable effort has been devoted within the MACRO collaboration to
upward-going muons, it has not been possible to look at upward-going electrons
until the addition of an "attico," which makes it possible to identify upward-
going electron events at a modest rate. This is a topical problem. There is at
present a discrepancy in some published measurements of the muon neutrino flux
which hints at neutrino oscillations and a non-zero neutrino mass. * * *
