The proposed studies intend to develop a generalized method for cell activation
using immobilized growth or differentiation factors. The experimental studies
will initially involve a step by step investigation of methodology for
immobilization of active Interleukin-2 (IL-2) on the surface of several
supports. A simple proliferation assay will be used to evaluate the
effectiveness of the immobilized lymphokine for supporting growth. The overall
objective of the proposed research is to demonstrate the feasibility of using
lymphokines immobilized on solid surfaces to stimulate and activate lymphokine-
sensitive cells. IL-2 activation will be used as the model system for these
studies. Successful implementation of such a technique would provide a
generalized and more efficient method for stimulating cell growth and/or cell
differentiation in general cell cultures.
