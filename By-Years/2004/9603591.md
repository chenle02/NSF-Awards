96-03591 Massey 1. Technical This investigator has isolated milk xanthine
dehydrogenase in a stable state, which can be converted reversibly into the
oxidized form, where the preferred electron acceptor is oxygen rather than NAD,
as it is with the dehydrogenase form. This work indicates that the major effects
of this reversible interconversion, which is brought about by oxidation of
spatially adjacent thiol residues in the dehydrogenase to oxidase conversion,
involve conformational changes in the protein which affect mainly the flavin
redox center. The major thrust of this research is to study in detail the
physicochemical properties of the two forms of the enzyme, with the aim of
defining the parameters that give the two forms such different catalytic
properties. This study involves extensive use of rapid reaction
spectrophotometry, flavin replacement studies, catalytic properties of the
enzymes with different classes of substrates, and examination of the modes of
binding and mechanism of potent inhibitors of the enzymes. 2. Nontechnical The
ability of xanthine oxidase to exist in two stable forms with very different
catalytic properties makes it a very unusual enzyme. It is widely believed that
this interconversion forms the basis of a variety of oxidative stress phenomena,
because of the ability of the oxidase form to generate oxygen radicals. In order
to assess such hypotheses, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of
the properties of the two enzyme forms. This project is focused on such a study.
