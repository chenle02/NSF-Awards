This grant in the Organic Dynamics Program will provide partial travel and
conference costs for approximately 40 U.S. scientists attending the XIII IUPAC
Symposium on Photochemistry, to be held in Warwick, Coventry, England from July
22-28, 1990. Challenge grants in the range of $500-$1,000 will be awarded to
successful applicants (to be selected by the Principal Investigator in
consultation with the U.S. invited speakers and U.S. members of the organizing
committee for the Symposium). The selection process will emphasize efforts to
invite and assist the participation of women, underrepresented minorities, and
younger chemists. The IUPAC Photochemistry Symposium traditionally has a broad
scope, fostering the fruitful exchange of ideas and information among scientists
from the diverse areas that comprise the field of photochemistry. Many strong
international collaborations have resulted from interactions that were initiated
at previous Symposia, and this benefit is anticipated to continue.
