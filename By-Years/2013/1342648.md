In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, M. G. Finn of The Scripps Research Institute
will design and prepare dynamic polymers based upon reversible covalent bonding.
The approach is to develop rapid and quantitative nucleophilic substitution
reactions based upon reversible intramolecular anchimeric assistance, to apply
these methods to dynamic polymer synthesis and dynamic polymer crosslinking, and
to adapt the reactions to building dynamic surfaces. The broader impacts involve
training undergraduate students and graduate students, enhancing infrastructure
for research and education through collaboration between groups at The Scripps
Research Institute and UC Santa Barbara, and hosting a local high school or
teacher for summer research in each year of the project.

This work will enhance our fundamental understanding about dynamic polymers:
long chain molecules that have an average length at any given moment but
constantly break apart and reform over time. Polymer chains are the fundamental
units of many materials, including plastics, and the development of new types of
polymers could lead to new applications in biomedical materials, coatings, and
composites.
