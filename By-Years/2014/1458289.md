The Science Learning Community (SLC) Scholarship Project at the University of
Pittsburgh at Greensburg will provide scholarships and academic support to 24
academically talented and financially disadvantaged students from rural areas in
Pennsylvania. The SLC Scholars will receive a liberal arts education solidly
rooted in science and mathematics. The scholarship support will remove the
financial and societal barriers to earning a college
degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective is to graduate the SLC
Scholars successfully with baccalaureate degrees in Biological Science or
Chemistry, and to facilitate their entry into STEM careers or graduate programs
through enhancement of support services via curricular and co-curricular
activities. Some of these activities include a summer bridge program, a science
seminar for freshman scholars, the establishment of study groups, opportunities
to develop a mentee/mentor relationship with a faculty member which could lead
to undergraduate research, and training as peer mentors, teaching assistants for
labs, or tutors for courses to enhance scholars' leadership skills and learning
experiences. Career services will also be available, such as a career seminar
course, graduate school prep course, and development of relationships with
faculty and staff. Additionally, SLC Scholars will help build the next
generation of science students by assisting during the university's middle and
high school Summer Science and Math Experience and Quest Career camps. The
project outcomes, lessons learned, and best practices will be broadly
disseminated, contributing to the body of research on model approaches to
supporting undergraduate student retention and educational success. Assessment
of the efficacy of these different activities will help contribute to expanding
the knowledge base regarding the circumstances under which scholarship projects
of this type are successful.
