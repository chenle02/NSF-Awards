PolyFlow: An Architectural Model for Highly Concurrent Instruction Execution

Abstract

The PolyFlow project will investigate new dynamic techniques for using control-
dependence information to find and exploit global instruction-level concurrency
within a single thread of execution. PolyFlow builds on compiler-assisted thread
level parallelization mechanisms that concurrently fetch, rename and execute
multiple, widely separated, portions of the program. Based on the insight that
the control dependence graph provides concrete information about the
instructions that will be fetched in the future, the PolyFlow compiler provides
this graph, rather than thread boundary information, directly to the micro-
architecture, allowing the micro-architecture to make feedback-directed dynamic
and speculative instruction prioritization and resource utilization decisions.
The project will investigate the specific architectural, feedback, compilation,
and resource management mechanisms necessary for PolyFlow to attain high levels
of concurrency on a single thread. PolyFlow may fundamentally change how we
approach single-threaded computation from a parallelism perspective, potentially
opening up fresh avenues of research in architecture and compilation. PolyFlow's
performance gains can be molded by system designers throughout the information
technology sector into better system attributes such as reliability, security,
innovative human-computer interfaces, system autonomy or application
intelligence.
