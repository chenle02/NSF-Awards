93 21683 Bowen This project involves a cultural anthropologist studying the
changing relationship between Islamic legal institutions, civil courts, and
customary law procedures in Indonesia. Indonesia is the largest Muslim society
in the world. Using ethnographic techniques of intensive interviews and
participant observation as well as reviewing court cases, the project will study
the shift away from local customary law procedures towards more universalist
Islamic legal code. The universalist rules clash with local values around the
important theme of inheritance, and this brief project will focus on a community
first studied by the anthropologist in 1978 to see how local authorities deal
with the problem. By understanding how the local community reacts to the
religious-legal proscriptions of the central national authorities, this project
will provide important information about the abilities of Islamic society to
adapt to changing local circumstances. Increased understanding of Islamic local
diversity and reactions to change will better enable our society to deal with
Muslims. "
