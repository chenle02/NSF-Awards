Topology is the study of objects up to stretching, and geometry the study of
rigid bodies. Work on this project will lead to advances in our understanding of
both subjects by combining surprising relationships between them and deep
connections to other areas of mathematics and computer science. Both topology
and geometry are playing an increasingly important role in applications such as
data mining and engineering design, and this project includes collaboration with
computer scientists as well as the development of open-source software for
exploring aspects of these problems. Graduate students will be trained in this
project.

The first topic of this project is effective Mostow rigidity and torsion growth
in homology, questions motivated in part by number theory and global analysis.
The project will explore how topological and geometric invariants behave under
towers of finite covers and other geometric limits, and also study the extent to
which different topological, geometrical, and arithmetic notions of complexity
coincide for hyperbolic manifolds. The second topic of the project is counting
essential surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds and, in particular, divining the
basic structures of such counts. This will involve placing these questions into
the setting of measured laminations as well as relating them to the work of
Mirzakhani and to dynamical questions about orbits of integer points under a
family of interval isometries.
