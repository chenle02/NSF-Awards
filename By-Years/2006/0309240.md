Most theories on the evolution of parasite virulence assume a positive
relationship between transmission success of the parasite and its virulence, but
there are few experimental tests of this relationship. Understanding the degree
to which the host, versus the parasite, controls transmission mode would
contribute substantially to models of parasite evolution by testing this common
assumption. This research exploits a variable plant-fungus interaction to
explore the phenotypic and genetic relationships between virulence and
transmission mode (horizontal or vertical). Experiments are planned to determine
if horizontal transmission is positively related to parasite virulence, the
relationship between horizontal transmission and vertical transmission, if
parasite growth rate predicts transmission success or parasite virulence, and if
the parasite or the host - or their interaction - controls the mode of parasite
transmission. The proposed studies will provide empirical data on the
relationship between parasite transmission mode and virulence, which is broadly
applicable to human health and agriculture. The project will support the
training and development of a non-traditional graduate student.
