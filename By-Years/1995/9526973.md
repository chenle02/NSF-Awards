This award is for support for a one year pilot study to work on atmospheric
dusts from ice cores that already exist. Specifically, the deep ice cores from
Byrd Station and a shallow core (160 m) that was drilled at Siple Dome during
the 1994/95 field season will be sampled and analyzed. The objective of this
work is to characterize the dust from these ice cores in order to identify, or
at least constrain, the continental source areas of the dust, using a suite of
chemical and isotopic tracers. These tracers include a combination of the fine-
fraction clay mineralogy, strontium and neodymium isotope compositions and
concentrations, and the rare-earth element patterns. By analyzing dust from
multiple sites, an idea of the compositional variability throughout Antarctica
can be determined.
