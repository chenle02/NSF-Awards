This award provides one-half the funding needed for the acquisition of
computing equipment that will be installed and maintained in the Institute of
Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP) at the University of California, San
Diego. The institution is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary
for this acquisition. A consortium of investigators at IGPP will use the new
computer system in their work in marine seismic methods, interpretation of mid-
ocean ridge processes, global seismology, mantle convection, geomagnetism,
space-based geodesy and other computer-intensive research projects.
