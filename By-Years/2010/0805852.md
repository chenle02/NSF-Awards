Abstract-DMS-0805852

This project systematically studies spectral theory of complex Laplacians and
its applications to complex and algebraic geometries. The main focus of the
project is the interplays between the spectrum of the complex Laplacians and the
geometric and algebraic structures of the underlined spaces.

Complex analysis and differential equations arise naturally in engineering and
physical sciences. Spectral analysis of differential operators plays an
important role in quantum mechanics. This project will also have impacts on the
development of human resources. It will support development of a new topic
course as well as summer research of a student. It will also help facilitate
interdisciplinary research activities with other scientists.
