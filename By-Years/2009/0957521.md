William Hase of Texas Tech University is supported by the Theory, Models and
Computational Methods Program to enhance algorithms and software for studying
chemical dynamics phenomena at short times. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research goals
comprise the development of accurate numerical implementations to compare
results with experimental measurements, to determine fundamental information
about intramolecular dynamics, energy transfer, and chemical dynamics. Four
specific applications will be studied: i) soft-landing and reactive-landing of
peptide ions on hydrocarbon surfaces for specific surface modifications; e.g.
biological modifications to prepare protein microarrays, ii) surface-induced
dissociation (SID) of protein multimers, iii) intrinsic non-RRKM unimolecular
dynamics of low barrier isomerization reactions, and iv) post-transition state
dynamics of organic reactions in condensed phases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemical
dynamics simulation studies will be compared with experimental results and are
expected to provide new chemical knowledge. The computer programs and simulation
models to be developed during the course of this project will be distributed to
the scientific community, and will serve to enhance the
theoretical/computational chemistry infrastructure.
