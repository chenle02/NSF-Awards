Narrative: The project conducts a market analysis for the purpose of
determining the feasibility of launching a successful profession wide news
publication for the engineering profession. The market analysis examines the
potential audiences for such a publication, and their level of interest; the
content and format that would be most appealing to the intended audiences; and
how such a publication would be funded on a continuing basis. A consultant,
experienced in market analysis for startup publications, would be retained to
conduct an unbiased analysis and make recommendations that could be followed to
launch a new periodical that would have appeal and provide a forum for the
exchange of ideas and information across all segments of tne engineering
profession. The consultant is retained by and supervised by the National Society
of Professional Engineers, whose executive director serves as chairman on a task
force to examine the feasibility of a professionwide news publication for the
engineering profession.
