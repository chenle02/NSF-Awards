This project continues prior research to elucidate mechanisms responsible for
the tropical intraseasonal oscillation, also known as the Madden-Julian
Oscillation. Successful dynamical forecasts of this oscillation may bridge the
gap between medium-range weather forecasting and seasonal climate prediction.
This study will examine the underlying physics controlling the boreal summer
intraseasonal oscillation and attempt to understanding its relationship to air-
sea interactions and summer mean precipitation. Attention will also be given to
explaining why the equatorial eastern Indian Ocean is a preferred region for
amplification of the intraseasonal oscillation. Both diagnostic and modeling
studies are supplemented by long-term NCEP reanalysis data and high-resolution
satellite data; these will be used to validate the multi-model ensemble
simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject of the research is considered
important by the community, and may lead to better medium-range forecasts and
better forecasts of El Nino, while making a positive impact on poor countries
which would benefit greatly from improved medium-range to seasonal forecasts.
Based on the P.I.'s prolific publishing history, it is expected that the results
of this research will be disseminated via meetings and publications in
internationally-recognized scientific journals.
