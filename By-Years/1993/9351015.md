A revolutionary teaching microscope will be introduced into the introductory
biology laboratory classroom as part of a major revision of the curriculum. The
efficiency and dramatic effect of this instrument has been demonstrated in a
pilot project, Exploring Microstructures: Introducing Biology Students and
Teachers to Images, Tools and Applications of High-Tech Microscopy. The
technologically-advanced microscope consists of a tiny, hand-held, self-
illuminated video camera with interchangeable magnifying lenses attached by a
fiber optics cable to a television monitor. By touching the tip of the lens to
any object under scrutiny, a user of any age or ability immediately produces a
well-lighted, in-focus image of the appropriate magnification on a regular
television monitor. This tool will improve the investigative biology laboratory
for non- science majors. Video recordings can be made in the normal fashion.The
number of applications that can be developed is virtually unlimited and will
serve as a generator of ideas for K-12 as well as undergraduate curricula. The
preliminary excitement elicited by the entry of our pilot scope into K-12 and
undergraduate classrooms merits the expansion of the program into this larger
scale project.
