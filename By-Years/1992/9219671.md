Passage of the High Performance Computing Act of 1991 initiated an active cycle
of planning for implementation of the National Research and Education Network
(NREN) by federal agencies, educational institutions, and private sector firms.
Many of these agencies and organizations have previously been active in
networking but a number are new to the field as a result of expansion o the
scope of the NREN during Congressional deliberations. To assist the study
process and NREN constituent organizations in their own activities, a two day
policy and planning workshop is planned. The workshop will serve several
important goals: -bring together in a single forum one hundred o the individuals
most directly concerned with NREN planning and implementations; -provide an
informed critique of policy proposals and positions from organization with roles
in the implementation and operation of the NREN; -reduce to written form the
consensus of the workshop on the major policy issues on which the Congress has
requested an Executive Branch study. The consensus of the workshop does not
imply unanimity with respect to proposals for future Congressional or Executive
Branch actions involving the NREN. However, it is expected that illumination of
agreements and differences in policy positions, and the reasons for deferring
assessments, will be valuable to federal agencies and to the Congress in the
evolution of the NREN program. This conference will bring together policy level
representatives from the numerous constituencies which are essential for the
design, development, deployment, and operation of a robust, high performance
computer network to meet pressing needs for improved research collaboration and
productivity in the United States.
