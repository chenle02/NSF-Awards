The Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium is held each
February in San Diego, CA. It is a three day conference that brings together
innovative and forward thinking members of the Internet community who design,
develop, exploit, and deploy the technologies that define network and
distributed system security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funding to
assist US-based graduate and undergraduate students to attend this event.
Participation in symposia like the NDSS are a critical part of these students'
educational experiences by providing them the opportunity to interact with
senior researchers and to be exposed to leading-edge work in the field. The
support provided by this grant enable the participation of students who would
otherwise be unable to attend the NDSS.
