Women's Introduction to Engineering (WIE) was initiated in 1981 to attract
academically talented students to the field of engineering. The program is
designed to provide a comprehensive exploration of career opportunities and a
realistic introduction to engineering education before career decisions are
made. Supporting objectives include: a) to introduce participants to the
academic demands of college engineering study through direct experience; b) to
assist students in planning preparatory coursework at the secondary level,
increasing their chances of admission and retention in college engineering
programs; c) to enhance career planning skills and promote consideration of non-
traditional fields of study. The geographic target region includes the 32
southernmost counties in Illinois, a rural area with 112 secondary schools and a
median enrollment of 300. The 1988 summer program will be a two-week residential
session for 15 students on the Southern Illinois University Carbondale campus,
complemented by a research presentation follow-up activity and a secondary
educators'workshop.
