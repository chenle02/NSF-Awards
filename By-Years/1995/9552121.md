80217-3364 ILI - Leadership in Laboratory Development: Physics Title: Course
Modules in Apparatus Design and Experimental Techniques Insufficient attention
is given in science curricula to training students, at an early stage, in the
practical techniques of laboratory work. When students begin undergraduate
research projects, industrial co-ops, and jobs, many are ill-prepared to
construct, select, adapt, and use scientific equipment. This project introduces
a series of self-contained course modules in practical methods that will come
after the first year of college laboratory courses. Six foundation modules form
a one year course: (1.) materials, mechanisms &amp; machining; (2.) basic
electronic circuits &amp; measurements; (3.) signals &amp; electronics for
signal conditioning; (4.) computer-assisted experimentation; (5.) introduction
to metrology &amp; transducers; and (6.) optical systems. Upper division
elective modules are: (7.) vacuum systems &amp; surface technologies; (8.)
feedback control; and (9.) lasers &amp; optoelectronics. In five weeks, each
module will cover a small number of the most basic methods and technologies of a
topic. There will be 90 minutes of discussion, lecture, and demonstration and
four hours of lab per week. Students will document their practical experience
through individual portfolios of their projects. The modular form of this course
material makes it readily adaptable to other colleges, where further topics can
be developed in the same format. Student lab manuals, exercises, suggested
projects, lecture transparencies, demonstrations, software, designs, and parts
lists will be available and continuously updated over the Internet.
