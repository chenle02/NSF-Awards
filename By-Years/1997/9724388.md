This award is for the purchase of two pieces of equipment that are essential
for the overall research program in mechanics of materials, particularly on high
strain rate research. The first is electrodischarge machining equipment that can
be used to cut samples of advanced materials to a high degree of precision. The
second is an argon ion laser to be used for interferometric monitoring of the
stress waves induced during plate impact testing. The new equipment
significantly strengthens the existing experimental infrastructure for research
in mechanics of materials and provides new capabilities for further research
developments. The new equipment provides new materials processing and monitoring
capabilities and will have a catalytic effect on the existing research program
by providing a missing link in a comprehensive effort to synthesize advanced
materials, characterize their microstructures, measure their mechanical
response, and analyze the resulting changes in microstructure.
