This investigation will focus on the development of algorithms, codes, and
supporting mathematical analysis for adaptive local grid refinement and moving
finite element techniques applied to the discretization of underground
contaminant flows. These algorithms will be designed specifically to take
advantage of new supercomputer architectures. The program of study also includes
research into preconditioning methods for iterative solution of the large matrix
equations that arise in the linearized discrete formulations.
