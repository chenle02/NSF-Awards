A combined experimental/numerical analysis approach is underway to address
hydrodynamic problems arising in the interaction between water waves and various
floating and fixed bodies. The focus is on non-linear wave/body interactions and
non-linear instabilities in the interaction between waves and bodies. Issues to
be addressed specifically include improved methods for predicting the region
near the body and the free water line, evolution of wave envelopes, and the
development of efficient numerical schemes for predicting such flows.
