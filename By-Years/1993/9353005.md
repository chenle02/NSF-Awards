9353005 Connolly California State University at San Bernardino will sponsor a
six week, residential, multi-disciplinary Young Scholars project in physics,
mathematics, and astronomy. Enrichment activities will be provided for 39
students entering grades 11 and 12. Research will emphasize the determination of
asteroid orbits. Classroom lectures will develop the scientific tools and
research methodologies underlying this central problem. Hands-on activities will
include photographic plate development, manipulation of a wide field
astrographic telescope and precise measurements of photographic plates using a
measuring engine. Career activities include guest lectures/informal discussions
from NASA astronauts and scientists. Field trips to local universities complete
the program activities. ***
