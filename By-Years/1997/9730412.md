This proposal seeks funds to establish a regional coordination office for the
Northeast Pacific project of the U.S. GLOBEC program. The office will be
responsible for coordinating the many, diverse research activities that are
beginning in the two Northeast Pacific regions that are the focus of U.S. GLOBEC
- the California Current System (CCS) and the Coastal Gulf of Alaska (CGOA).
Specifically, the office will 1) develop and implement a framework for local
administration of the NEP program, 2) produce recommendations for a data
management plan, 3) provide coordination among GLOBEC NEP projects, and 4) build
cooperative bridges between U.S. GLOBEC NEP efforts and the efforts of other
national and international programs in the Pacific. It is important to the U.S.
GLOBEC program that the NEP research is more than a few isolated, individually
funded projects; the regional coordination office will be crucial in ensuring
that the GLOBEC NEP program is coordinated into an integrated, truly `regional`
program.
