Among the most exciting and unexpected findings related to plate tectonics was
the discovery of the hydrothermal vents that populate the earth?s mid-ocean
ridge system. Not only do these deep hot springs support a variety of exotic
life forms, they are now known to be a primary means by which heat is extracted
from the earth?s interior and to be a primary means of chemical exchange between
the seafloor and the oceans. But just how heat is supplied to these systems, and
how they relate to the tectonic environment remains poorly understood. This
project will employ a combination of 3D and 2D high resolution seismic
tomography, 2D multichannel reflection and micro-earthquake modeling define the
relationship between magmatism, faulting, substrate lithology (rock types) and
hydrothermal circulation at the Rainbow Hydrothermal Field on the Mid Atlantic
Ridge. This integrated approach is designed to test several hypotheses related
to hydrothermal activity and its relationship to the geological environment.
Broader impacts include a substantial contribution to international studies of
the mid-ocean ridge system, support for two Ph.D. thesis projects and experience
for undergraduate interns.
