During the special year on Algebraic Geometry at the Institute for Advanced
Study, we will have a sub-program on Homological Mirror Symmetry. The main goal
is to put Homological Mirror Symmetry on solid Mathematical basis.

Besides weekly seminars we will have two conferences:

1) One on Derived Categories in January 2007.

2) One on HMS, Geometric Langlands and Generalized Geometries in March.

We plan to produce proceedings which will help make available these new results
to everybody. Supporting graduate students and new postdocs, who would like to
participate in the program, will be a priority.
