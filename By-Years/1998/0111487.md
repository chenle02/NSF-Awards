With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Martha Macri and her colleagues
will conduct two years of linguistic research on the J. P. Harrington Database
Project. The goal is to increase access to the linguistic and ethnographic notes
on Native California languages collected by J. P. Harrington during the first
half of the twentieth century. The people Harrington interviewed were often
among the last remaining speakers of their languages. His notes thus represent
knowledge that would otherwise be lost. Over half of an estimated 500,000 pages
of Harrington's notes are on California languages. Researchers will begin by
transcribing these. They will then code the materials for linguistic and
ethnographic categories that maximize their usefulness to linguists, biologists,
geographers, historians, anthropologists, archaeologists, and also to Native
American communities. The transcribed and coded notes will be available through
a database on the web. It will be possible to search these notes by language
(e.g., several Native California languages), semantic domain (kin terms,
toponyms, flora, etc.), and other cultural and linguistic categories. The
database will also generate a running text of Harrington's notes as well as
lexicons for each language with Harrington's English and Spanish glosses.

Each of the world's languages represents a unique solution to the expression of
human cognition and to the variety of ways in which humans categorize and
interact with their social and physical environment. Most of the Native
California languages that Harrington recorded are no longer spoken, or now have
only a few elderly speakers. Harrington's materials are thus cherished by Native
American communities engaged in language and cultural revitalization and
valuable to scholars from a wide variety of disciplines. The J. P. Harrington
Database Project will increase access for Native American communities as well as
linguists and other scholars to these materials.
