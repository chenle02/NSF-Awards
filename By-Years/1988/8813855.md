The essence of planning lies in deciding a course of actions for achieving the
desired goals. This project extends planning paradigm to a distributed
environment with real-time requirements. In distributed planning, multiple nodes
must take independent decisions to achieve a common goal with possibly
conflicting and partial information about the global state. Distributed planning
paradigm would be useful for applications like air traffic control and
distributed defense systems which must deal with a dynamic situation in real-
time with each node having its own view of the global state. The planning is
carried out in two steps: (1) generation of plan specifications from goals and
(2) derivation of executable code from plan specifications. A collection of
cooperating experts use a cooperation policy, such as contract net to generate
plan specifications. The cooperation policy is implemented by a cooperation
mechanism. We propose to extend the network event manager, a rule driven
program, for providing the cooperation mechanism. Derivation of executable code
from plan specifications will be done through extension of Berkeley
Specification System.
