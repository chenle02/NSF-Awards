The project requests funds for participation of 50 faculty members from
minority institutions to attend the 1992 National Education Computing Conference
(NECC'92) in Dallas, June 15-17, 1992. This is an extremely worthwhile endeavor
which expands on support we have provided for faculty from minority institutions
to attend the Computer Science Conference. The NECC provides a broader view of
computers in education focusing on the use of computers across all disciplines.
It is critical that faculty at minority institutions attend national conferences
of this type in order to become better integrated into the research and
education communities. This project represents a strong effort in that
direction.
