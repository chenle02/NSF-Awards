The University of Florida will host the Thirteenth Conference on Production
Research and Technology. This is one of a series of annual conferences which
have been sponsored by the Production Research Program (now the Manufacturing
Systems Program) of the National Science Foundation. The conferences serve
several purposes: they permit assessment of the research supported by the
program; they aid in program planning; and they disseminate research results to
other investigators in the research community, and to potential users in
industry. They also provide opportunities for investigators who want to enter
the program to find out what kind of research it supports.
