The Georgia Algebraic Geometry Symposium will be held at Emory University, in
Atlanta in 2019, University of Georgia, in Athens in 2020, Georgia Tech, in
Atlanta in 2021. The conferences will expose students, postdocs, and faculty to
the latest and greatest in the field of Algebraic Geometry. The meetings will
also help early career mathematicians from outside of Georgia to get to know the
state and its universities. The annual event will help to significantly
strengthen the ties between the members of the algebraic geometry community in
Georgia and the neighboring states. The majority of funding will be used to
support early career mathematicians. The organizers' goal is to provide an
opportunity for them to network with each other and with senior people at the
conference, and to be exposed to the cutting edge developments in the field. As
has been demonstrated in the previous Georgia Algebraic Geometry Symposia, the
organizers are committed to supporting members of the community from
underrepresented groups. At each of the past events there was a significant
percentage of female speakers. In addition to the talks by invited star
speakers, there will be sessions of mini-talks by early career researchers:
postdocs and graduate students.

Since 2012 the Principal Investigators have been organizing an annual event
called the Georgia Algebraic Geometry Symposium. The first three installments
were held at the University of Georgia, and the last three were a collective
effort, with conferences held at Emory University, at the University of Georgia,
and at Georgia Tech, which together comprise the main three research
universities in Georgia. Following a well working scheme, each conference will
be held over a weekend with 8-10 speakers and 80-100 participants, of which
about half will be local and the other half non-local.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
