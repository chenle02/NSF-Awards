Several projects in the areas of solid state devices and circuits will be
conducted. Fundamental physics and engineering applications of epitaxially grown
thin layers of lattice mismatched semiconductors in which the mismatch is
accommodated as elastic strain rather than by misfit dislocations (pseudomorphic
layers) are studied. Applications include high speed digital and microwave
devices and integrated optoelectronics. Fundamental physics and engineering
applications of germanium/insulator systems (especially Ge/Ge N) are examined.
Applications include passivation of germanium and germanium "MOSFETs" for
optoelectronic applications and high performance CMOS circuits. Attention is
focused on the design and implementation of high-speed, low-cost monolithic
germanium fiber-optic receiver/amplifier circuits for long wavelength (1.3um or
1.55um) optical communications systems.
