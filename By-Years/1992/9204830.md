The principal investigator will study the behavior of hornblende in both vacuum
and hydrothermal environments. Transmission electron microscopy, scanning
electron microscopy, electron microprobe analyses, and 40Ar/39Ar analyses all
will be utilized in the investigation. The goal of the study is to better
understand diffusion kinetics in hornblende, and to apply the results to
geochronologic determinations.
