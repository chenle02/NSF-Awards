A grant has been awarded to Dr. Samuel Galewsky and Dr. Thomas McQuistion at
Millikin University. The grant is for the acquisition of a video microscopy
system: including a research compound microscope equipped with DIC, phase
contrast and fluorescence optics; a high resolution digital video camera for
fluorescence imaging; a zoom stereo microscope with an S-video color low
resolution camera attached to it; a color printer; a dedicated computer equipped
with a ZIP drive; and software for morphometric and image analysis as well as
time lapse videography. In Dr. Galewsky's laboratory, which focuses on the
developmental regulation of genes during Drosophila embryogenesis, the system
will provide significantly better image quality and resolution, enabling student
researchers to thoroughly analyze complex staining patterns. In Dr. McQuistion's
laboratory, which is devoted to identifying and classifying intestinal parasites
in South American birds, the system will enable further work in determining
parasitic prevalence and diversity among different South American host
populations. And in Dr. Judith Parrish's laboratory, the system will enable
researchers to view clear images of pollen grains, making possible many
additional research projects in the area of pollination ecology. Students
working in the laboratory will be responsible for independently using the system
and its many capabilities in the course of their work. The system will also be
used in multiple teaching laboratories and will thus be introduced to all
Millikin biology majors (which number approximately 200 at any one time.) It
will even be introduced to all Millikin students via their required science
laboratory course, which features a biology laboratory component.
