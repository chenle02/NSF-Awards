This project is aimed at implementing a multipurpose geo- techniques training
facility for instructing undergraduate students in methods used to integrate and
display land resource and atmospheric information. Geography majors and students
from other natural resource programs taking courses in Computer Cartography,
Remote Sensing, Physical Geography, Meteorology, and Geographic Information
Systems will utilize the laboratory. The integrated approach planned stresses
compatibility and data interchange between software and hardware providing
undergraduates with opportunities to exchange data among previously incompatible
formats. The requested equipment includes microcomputers, software, networking,
and hard copy generation capabilities which can support a variety of computer
mapping, remote sensing, geographic information systems, and real-time weather
analysis activities within a common laboratory. The creation of this lab will
greatly increase the amount of "hands-on" time available to undergraduates. In
addition to providing a unique and valuable service to campus programs which
stress the measurement and analysis of natural resources, the lab provides a
facility for undergraduate students to participate in supervised research
activities. The proposed undergraduate laboratory will serve as a prototype to
test new curricula and as a model for other geography programs wishing to
develop geo-techniques laboratories which take advantage of convergent
technologies.
