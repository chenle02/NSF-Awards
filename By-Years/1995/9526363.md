This research, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode, investigates
the area of fault tolerance for robotics. This activity has produced a series of
potentially valuable individual ethods. The goal of this project is to develop
the foundations for a rigorous approach to robotic fault tolerance. The research
involves synthesis of a protective operating system shell environment for
robots, and incorporation of this environment into a new approach for provably
fault tolerant robotic systems. The operating system shell is designed to
protect the robot from the effects of errors in the lower level manipulator
system and the higher level plan. This shell is composed of a number of fault
tolerance tasks at a discrete decision making level. These tasks will be
identified and outlined for a three link planar robot during the year of
exploratory work. The robot will be enhanced with two sensors per joint and will
be kinematically redundant for positioning tasks in the plane. This level of
hardware redundancy will provide fault tolerance capabilities to the robot. A
formal model will be developed for this simple example robot and used to
demonstrate the potential benefits of the research approach. This work will
provide formal methods to verify fault tolerance for lower and higher level
subsystems of a robot system. The key overall goal is to combine diverse
techniques for robotic fault tolerance into a provably correct methodology. The
development of formal tools for the approach will be important in proving
rigorous results about robot fault tolerance. In the one year of the SGER
project, a series of fundamental examples will demonstrate how the above
approach can significantly impact this emerging research area.
