This proposal will provide a completely independent new data taking system from
the ADC onward as well as a new radar controller, both interfaced to the DEC
MIPS computer. This hardware will just be a copy of existing CUPRI/RS hardware,
but with a new interface for the DEC machine. The equipment will be completely
checked out at Cornell before taking it to Jicamarca. The changeover at
Jicamarca will consist of simply moving the receiver output cables and radar
controller cables. The complete existing ADC/Controller system at Jicamarca will
still be available for emergencies and/or to run old programs while new software
is being written.//
