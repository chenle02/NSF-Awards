Funds for the proposal will be used for completion of post-conference
activities, including publication of a volume of invited presentations on Global
Change and Arctic Terrestrial Ecosystems. The international conference was held
on August 21-26, 1993 in Oppdal, Norway. Since the cessation of the
International Biological Program of the early 1970's, the arctic reqearch
community has not maintained an active and effective system of meetings and
communication. This meeting represented the first global conference directed
towards arctic terrestrial ecosystems in 20 years, and was a truly rare
opportunity for a large, open meeting, involving both Russian and western
scientists, to evaluate the potential effects and associated feedbacks of
climate change on the arctic tundra. The main goal of the conference was to
foster international cooperation, collaboration, and the exchange of ideas among
arctic systems scientists. The proposed book is expected to be an authoritative
evaluation of the current state of knowledge regarding the anticipated effects
of global change on arctic ecosystems. It is anticipated that the proceedings of
the meeting will lay the foundation for continued integration and evaluation of
arctic research in relation to global change.
