The goal of this project is to conduct a workshop on the topic of governance of
artificial intelligence in a range of organizations. A wide range of scholars
from different disciplines will be invited to share their perspectives and learn
from each other in a two-day meeting, with the goal of producing white papers
and videos to share with the broader community of interest.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experts will be identified and invited to represent
particular industries, disciplines, and perspectives, with the goal of inclusion
of diverse voices and backgrounds. Speakers will participate in themed sessions
and discussions. Videos of the event will be distributed
freely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
