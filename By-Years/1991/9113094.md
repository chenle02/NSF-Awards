Dr. William Matthews is an aquatic ecologist at the University of Oklahoma. He
proposes to establish an aquatic research park adjacent to the University of
Oklahoma's Biological Station located along Lake Texoma, a large reservoir
created along the Red and Washita Rivers. Artificial streams would be
constructed to simulate quiet pools of water interspersed with "riffle"
intervals of more turbulent water. These artificial stream systems would be
available for research by resident and visiting investigators. The streams would
be used for a diverse array of studies, including experiments on predator/prey
interactions and population dynamics, factors influencing the composition of
fish assemblages, and the role of animal populations in the decomposition of
wood in streams. These and other projects conducted at the Oklahoma Biological
Station will greatly increase our understanding of the ecology of natural
streams.
