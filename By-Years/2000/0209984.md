Tourism is a major industry in the world, and poorer countries have invested
resources in developing tourist attractions to showcase their natural
environment to wealthy tourists. This dissertation research proposal by a
cultural anthropology student investigates the impact of one such project in
Huatulco, Oaxaca, Mexico, on the lives of local residents. The study will
investigate three broad questions: how the direction of public resources to the
tourist infrastructure affects local residents' perceptions of the resources
available to them; how the redirection of resources towards tourism development
and the growing tourist presence has changed the actual and expected standard of
living for local residents; and how emigration is perceived by local residents
as a strategy to accommodate expectations of higher living standards that may
have been thwarted by tourism development. The methods include participant
observation, semi-structured interviews, the analysis of social networks, and
the collection of household histories. Aside from contributing to the education
of a young social scientists, this research will advance our understanding of
the sources of Mexican migration to the US, and the social as well as economic
costs and benefits of tourism development.
