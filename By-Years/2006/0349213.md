AST-0349213 Caldwell

Dr. Robert Caldwell, at Dartmouth College, will undertake a program to
investigate the physics of the Universe. He will focus on the problem of dark
energy, the dominant form of energy in the cosmos, which is responsible for the
cosmic acceleration and has transformed our picture of the Universe. Discovery
of the physical nature of dark energy would have a basic impact on many branches
of physics. Combining cosmology, fields and gravitation, the PI will carry out
analytic calculations and numerical computations to investigate: constraints and
clues to the basic properties of the dark energy; fundamental physics models of
the dark energy, such as quintessence; and the behavior of quintessence in
rapidly varying gravitational fields and near black holes. These investigations
are well timed to coordinate with the many current and planned experimental and
observational programs poised to reveal the nature of the dark energy.

The PI will build upon his commitment to education through a program of student
mentoring and curriculum development at Dartmouth. To advance scientific
literacy in the wider community, public lectures and outreach activities with
local schools, through a partnership with a local science museum, will be
undertaken. The centerpiece of these efforts will be a teacher enhancement
workshop, to help teachers bring the excitement of cosmology back to the
classroom.
