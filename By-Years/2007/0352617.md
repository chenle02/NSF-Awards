This research project focuses on the development of a protocol for the simple
and rapid preparation and screening of new photosensitizers for titanium
dioxide. The technique involves the stepwise synthesis of transition metal
complexes anchored to semiconductor surfaces by carboxylate bridges. The
anchoring ligand, metal, and auxiliary ligands are incorporated on the
semiconductor in a stepwise fashion using a dipping procedure, allowing the
rapid screening of many combinations of anchor ligand, metal, and auxiliary
ligand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Randolph P. Thummel, of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of Houston, is supported by the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies of new approaches to more
effective photosensitizers for solar cells. Such sensitizers, for which design
and stability issues offer extreme challenges, are required to take solar cell
science and technology from the laboratory to the practical venue. Professor
Thummel is developing a new approach for the simple and and rapid preparation
and screening of new photosensitizers for titanium dioxide, a semiconductor used
in photovoltaic solar cells. This method enjoys the advantage of not requiring
the isolation or purification of any of the target complexes or intermediates,
and only small amounts (&lt; 1mg) of material are needed for the initial
analysis.
