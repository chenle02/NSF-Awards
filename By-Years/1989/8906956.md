The theoretical underpinnings of contemporary ecological genetics are mainly
borrowed from the literature on quantitative genetics and the breeding of crop
plants and domesticated animals. A number of fundamental issues remain to be
resolved before the mapping of quantitative genetic methods from the realm of
plant and animal breeding to the less controlled world of natural populations
can be accomplished. One of the most serious difficulties in applying
quantitative genetic methods to natural populations is that one of the
assumptions of this approach is that the members of the population under study
are mating at random. This is an assumption that is unlikely to be fulfilled in
most natural populations. When there are complex forms of genetic variation,
such as interactions among genes at different loci, violation of the assumption
of random mating may have profound effects on the potential for evolutionary
changes to occur. This research will use Plantago lanceolata to examine the role
of population subdivision and localized mating in influencing estimates of the
genetic variation in a population, and the potential for selection to bring
about evolutionary change. The basic approach will be to compare genetic
variance components estimated in a population by using the resemblance among
relatives when the parents are chosen based on their probability of mating in
the nature with similar estimates of genetic variance components when the
parents are chosen at random from the population at large. If estimates of the
genetic variance components under these two mating systems are different it will
indicate that the mating structure can have a strong influence on the potential
for evolutionary change to occur. If they are different the estimates based on
localized mating, which are expected to be larger, will give the best
predictions of the response to selection.
