Wingfield 9631350 The environmental factors, such as daylength, temperature and
humidity, play an important role in the regulation of reproductive success in
animals in the wild. These factors affect neural and endocrine function that
facilitate adaptive behaviors of animals to their environment. Dr. Wingfield is
conducting laboratory and field studies to determine how environmental signals
interact with social cues to regulate neuroendocrine and endocrine secretions
that orchestrate reproductive development and success. Identification of sensory
modalities and neural pathways by which environmental information impinges upon
the brain are also under investigation. These studies represent a highly
integrated blend of field investigations coupled with mathematical treatment of
natural history data that will then interface directly with physiological, cell
and molecular mechanisms. The results will provide crucial new information on
how organisms interpret environmental information which in turn could have
practical application as to how animals, particularly vertebrates, may respond
to global change in the near future.
