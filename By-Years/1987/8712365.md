Pennsylvania State University is being supported to establish a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to
provide meaningful hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for
outstanding undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research
chemists. The Program will support 10 students for the summer of 1987, of which
almost half will be recruited from other institutions. The research activities
will include the following: o Synthesis of macromolecules for new materials
applications o Thermochemistry of Cluster Ions o Surface Structure
Determinations using Ion Beams o Organometallic Chemistry of Condinated Nitrene
Ligands
