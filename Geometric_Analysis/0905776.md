The PI's research is in the two closely related areas of asymptotic geometric
analysis and convex geometry, and their applications. Classical convexity
studies the geometry of convex bodies in Euclidean space of a fixed dimension.
Asymptotic geometric analysis deals with geometric properties of finite
dimensional convex bodies as the dimension grows to infinity. In her research
the PI uses methods from both areas, as well as probabilistic tools and
concentration phenomena, to get a better understanding of the structure of
convex sets. The PI was able to prove a variety of results where such structural
aspects of convex sets play a role: in approximation of convex bodies by
polytopes; to establish a link between the so called order statistics (which are
fundamental objects in statistics) and Orlicz norms; to determine the ``sizes"
of certain (convex) sets that appear naturally in quantum information theory. A
further focus of the PI's research is the development of affine invariants. The
PI and her collaborators started the systematic study of (affine invariant)
functionals associated with convex bodies and their corresponding inequalities.
Among the most important such functionals are affine surface area and p-affine
surface area . The affine isoperimetric inequalities related to them are more
powerful than their Euclidean relatives and related to other important
inequalities, e.g. the Santalo- and Inverse Santalo- inequalities. The latter is
related to Mahler's conjecture which is still open in dimension 3 and higher.

A mathematical description of a scientific or engineering question often
requires lots of independent numbers, leading to a geometric space of high
dimension. For example, if you want to specify the location of one gas molecule
in a room then you need to report the front/back, side-to-side, and up/down
locations of the molecule, using three numbers. The direction and speed of the
molecule's motion takes another three numbers, and so to describe enough of the
molecule's current state to allow us to predict its future motion from position
and velocity we would need six separate numbers in all. If you want to track 100
distinct molecules of the air in the room then you will need 600 independent
numerical coordinates to collect all of the relevant measurements. As these
dimensions increase then the difficulty of sampling and computation go up
rapidly, a phenomenon scientists and mathematicians sometimes call "the curse of
dimensionality." However, there are also patterns that emerge as dimension
increases which are not visible in low dimensions. We can exploit those patters,
thus taking advantage of the "curse of dimensionality" to make it the "blessing
of dimensionality". It is one purpose of this grant to study such high
dimensional phenomena.
