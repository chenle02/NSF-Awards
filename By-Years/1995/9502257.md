The objective of this research is to develop a system that reliably resolves
ellipsis in English. The system will accept syntactically annotated input, and
it will produce output in which elliptical expressions are resolved, either by
producing a non-elliptical paraphrase or by linking the elliptical expression to
its antecedent. The system will be develmped using the Penn Treebank, a
syntactically annotated corpus of several million words, containing a wide range
of texts of varying styles. This research makes crucial use of newly available
syntactic annotation and associated tools in the Penn Treebank. The system will
be tested on examples from the Treebank to determine the percentage of cases in
which ellipsis is correctly resolved. The primary goal of the system is to
develop a practical solution to a major outstanding problem in computational
linguistics: determining the antecedent for ellipsis occurrences. The project
will also have an important secondary benefit: it will result in a massive
amount of valuable data for theoreticians studying ellipsis and related
phenomena.
