9600282 Moore This U.S.-Argentina collaborative research project will explore
conditions under which photochemical reactions of carotenoids (pigments found in
living organisms) can be elicited. In nature, they play a role in
photosynthesis, but in solutions they are not photochemically reactive. The
Argentine collaborators, Leonides Sereno and Juana Silber at the Universidad
Nacional de Rio Cuarto in Cordoba will bring to the collaboration both the
laboratory facilities and the expertise for the electrochemical experiments,
while the PIs, Ana Moore, Thomas Moore, and J. Devens Gust at Arizona State
University, will carry out the synthesis of new carotenoids and spectroscopic
work. A number of students and post doctoral researchers in both countries will
be involved in the studies. The grant will include support for some of these
younger people to travel to Argentina with a PI. Support for the Argentine
scientists will be provided by CONICET in that country, including travel to the
U.S. ***
