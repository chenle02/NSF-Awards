This award supports a conference on iterative methods for the solution of
linear and nonlinear systems of equations. The conference will be held in Copper
Mountain, Colorado at the Village Square Lodge from April 1 to April 5, 1990.
The topics of emphasis are nonsymmetric linear systems, parallel
implementations, and novel preconditioning techniques. The speakers include Olof
Widlund, Michael Overton, Ahmed Sameh, Nick Trefethen, and Paul Saylor. Papers
submitted at this conference will be refereed and published in the SIAM Journal
of Scientific and Statistical Computing.
