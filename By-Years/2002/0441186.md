&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together many of the most distinguished
scientists and engineers from academia, industry and the government for the
purpose of exploring recent advances in multiple antenna wireless
communications. The workshop will span two days with over 17 invited
presentations and associated discussions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit of the workshop is the exchange of research results between the
participating institutions, and the creation of a platform on which these
results can be discussed and evaluated by the scientific community. As broader
impact we see that the workshop will generate recommendations on areas of
research that are critical to advancing smart antenna technology. The workshop
is summoned to help shape the direction of future research in this
field.&lt;br/&gt;
