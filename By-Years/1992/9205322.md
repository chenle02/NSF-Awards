The Laurentide Ice Sheet was the largest of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets
that developed during the last glacial maximum. An accurate reconstruction of
this ice sheet has significant implications for late Quaternary paleoclimatic
reconstructions, including interpreting global sea-level history. A significant
point of debate concerning the dynamics and form of the Laurentide Ice Sheet
involves specifying whether the dominant mechanism of ice movement was internal
deformation, sliding, subglacial sediment deformation, or some combination of
these. The fundamental question is whether rigid-bed processes, such as sliding,
or soft-bed processes, particularly pervasive deformation, were dominant. This
project will attempt to answers this question by developing aa numerical model
of the ice-till dynamics of the Lake Michigan Lobe during the last glacial
maximum. Parameters for sediment rheology derived from geotechnical analyses of
glacial sediment will form the basis of the model, and they will be integrated
with an examination of the sediment record and sediment transport fluxes of the
lobe with respect to its dynamics. The model will test the deforming bed versus
sliding hypotheses through a quantitative assessment of the physical conditions
under which sediment deformation could or could not have occurred beneath the
Lake Michigan Lobe. The results of this research will have significant
implications for understanding and modeling the dynamics of ice sheets as well
as for interpreting the origin of massive, homogeneous till units in mid-
latitude regions. Understanding the dynamics and behavior of an ice sheet during
its decay is important for constraining potential behavior of modern ice sheets.
