Using an ultrastable low temperature scanning tunneling microscope, Professor
Paul S. Weiss of Pennsylvania State University is examining the effects of local
chemical environment on the chemistry of adsorbed molecules. With the support of
the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Weiss's group is imaging and
analyzing spatially dependent perturbations of the surface electronic structure
at adsorbates and surface defects. Using the ability to characterize and control
defects in monolayer films, selected molecules are inserted into these defects
in order to probe the chemistry of these species in this local environment.
Single molecule vibrational spectroscopy of the adsorbed molecule is carried out
as well, using inelastic electron tunneling
spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The detailed interactions of adsorbed
molecules can be examined using scanning probe microscopy and inelastic electron
tunneling spectroscopy. Professor Weiss and his group at the Pennsylvania State
University are using these methods to examine the effect of the local chemical
environment on the chemistry of adsorbed molecules. This information is useful
for the fundamental insights it provides for a number of important technologies,
including molecular electronic devices, micro-sensors, and heterogeneous
catalysis. &lt;br/&gt;
