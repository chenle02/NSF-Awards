Professor Fleming Crim is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to observe bimolecular reactions of highly vibrationally
excited polyatomic molecules and to exploit the special nature of these states
to directly control the course of chemical reactions. The object is to develop
and test out schemes to control bond breaking in larger molecules and to make
fully quantum-state-resolved measurements which can be compared with theoretical
dynamical calculations. The essence of the technique is to excite an isolated
vibration in a polyatomic molecule and to turn that vibration into a reaction
coordinate by a collision with a reactive atom such as H or O. Reactions to be
studied involve HCN, acetylene, ammonia, methane, propane, and methanol, using
techniques such as stimulated emission pumping and laser-induced-fluorescence at
vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths. %%% In this research the course of a chemical
reaction between a polyatomic molecule and an atom is directly controlled by
making use of vibrational excitation, based on the fact that the geometry change
that occurs in going from reactants to products requires the stretching and
breaking of bonds. Reactions involving collisions of energized molecules are
central in atmospheric chemistry, combustion, and plasmas.
