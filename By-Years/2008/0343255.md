This planning grant will provide a roadmap for estabilishing a new student
pathway through engineering study which is tailored to his/her individual needs.
Engineering colleges are facing extreme performance pressure as society depends
on them to produce the generations of graduates necessary to accelerate the pace
of technology development and to assure our future global competitiveness.
Complicating this task is the need for colleges to bring their students to
proficiency in the practice of an ever-expanding knowledge base, without
continuing to increase the time investment required to earn an undergraduate
degree. To solve this puzzle, engineering colleges must engage their entire
university, synthesizing new approaches that bring new areas of knowledge into
revitalized college-level engineering undergraduate curricula. The University of
Arkansas (UA) College of Engineering will use a broad based approach in planning
the incorporation of our research in emerging knowledge areas, our partnerships
in research commercialization, and our new graduate educational methods into a
new undergraduate culture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
