This award to the University of Wisconsin supports the research of a cultural
anthropologist studying an indigenous Andean form of historical record-keeping.
In pre-Hispanic times the Andean peoples recorded information through the medium
of knotted cords, called khipus. The investigator has discovered a remote
highland community of Quechua Indians who still maintain a set of khipus, which
they use as ceremonial objects displayed in order to validate possession of
local political office. The investigator has conducted ethnographic research on
usage and has photographed these objects, and will analyze the internal
structure of the knots, comparing them to other similar objects; computerize the
data, perform radio-carbon tests to establish the age of the objects, and carry
out numerical and statistical analysis by experts. This research will document a
unique and endangered dataset for Andean studies and for the social science of
numbers and record-keeping. By studying how present day people use this sort of
object to record important information, the study can help shed light on the
pre-Hispanic patterns of use and advance our understanding of indigenous, pre-
literate record-keeping systems. The new knowledge to be generated from this
project could help shed light on the meaning of similar archaeologically
recorded speciments.
