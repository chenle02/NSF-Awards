This project is to develop accurate and efficient state-of-the art numerical
algorithms for electromagnetic scattering in dispersive and lossy inhomogeneous
media. Electromagnetic scattering, wave scattering in general, is ubiquitous in
scientific and engineering applications. Simulation of wave scattering in
dispersive and lossy inhomogeneous media poses two major challenges for fast and
accurate computations, namely, the resolution requirement by the large wave
number of the problems involved, and the accuracy degeneracy of numerical
discretizations due to interfaces of material discontinuities. To address these
challenges, the investigator proposed two new approaches: (1) In Time domain: A
high order Cartesian grid based Upwinding Embedded Boundary Method for time
dependent Maxwell equations in dispersive and lossy inhomogeneous media, and (2)
In Frequency Domain: A fast integral method for wave scattering in layered media
based on fast calculation algorithms of dyadic Green's functions.

The investigator will apply the numerical algorithms developed under this
project for the designing of microscale photonic devices with significant impact
on the development of next generation optical technologies for cost efficient
home internet broadband access, and also the design of ground penetrating
radars, which will contribute to the development of modern detection devices for
underground mines and industrial contaminants. Moreover, Research results from
this project, in the area of new physics and numerical methods, will be
incorporated into the applied mathematics and optics curriculum, potential
technology transfer of the results to the area optics industrial will be
explored through the existing partnership between the Center and area optics
companies. The investigator shall participate actively in the Center's
technology training programs with area high schools during the course of this
research.
