arXiv is an open-access repository that has played a leading role in disciplines
such as computer science, mathematics and physics for over 30 years. It hosts
more than 2 million scientific papers and has a large user community. Each month
there are approximately 5 million active users and 100 million web accesses.
Despite its size and usage, arXiv has very limited search and recommendation
functionality. In order to better serve the arXiv community, this project is
building a new generation of search and recommendation functionality and
simultaneously creating a research sandbox to reduce reliance on third-party,
commercial services. To make arXiv's trove of scientific content accessible to
the visually impaired, support is being added for well-structured HTML as well
as PDF. Improved discovery of research results provides broad multidisciplinary
benefits across areas of science. These include less researcher time wasted
browsing through large amounts of irrelevant papers, revelation of "unknown
unknowns," and accelerating research across different subject areas through
unexpected synergies. Improved recommendation tools, which can provide unbiased
and diverse sources of relevant research results and techniques, are urgently
needed to break silos. arXiv will provide improved mechanisms for scientists to
find out about important advances, both in their own field of expertise and in
adjacent fields.

This project includes 4 major focus areas: Open A/B Testing, Neural
Representations of Scientific Text, arXiv Dynamics, and Security & Privacy. (1)
Open A/B Testing enables arXiv to become a platform for A/B testing of search
and recommendation algorithms. In addition to online A/B testing, offline A/B
testing is provided using historical data along with counterfactual estimators
for policy rewards. (2) Neural Representation of Scientific Text provides a
vector-based representation of scientific texts (documents, paragraphs, and
sentences) appropriate for multiple tasks, including citation, author, title,
and keyword prediction. Differentiable search indices are investigated due to
their potential to provide additional search performance improvements without
requiring incremental re-training. Finally, this supports the construction of a
scientific question-answering system which can also be used as a context-
sensitive "chat-bot" enabling researchers to converse with and get a list of
recent publications relevant to their interests. (3) The arXiv Dynamics project
investigates how scientific fields grow, shrink, and transform over time.
Creating a "trending and emerging arXiv topics" pattern recognition system
predicts how interesting current and historical articles are to researchers.
Research is investigating methods to remove the "rich-get-richer" effect from
this model, to correct the model for the effects of the users' historical
interactions with the system, and to track performance and solicit user feedback
as these models change over time. (4) Under Security & Privacy arXiv's privacy
policy is updated so that users are aware of how their (meta-)data may be used
and the protections that will be deployed to protect their privacy. A "Layer 1"
API allows researchers to make coarse-grained queries on anonymized arXiv
weblogs and a "Layer 2" API which allows researchers to securely experiment on
arXiv metadata and weblogs. Privacy is preserved by a combination of query
restrictions and researcher usage agreements. A machine-learning API layer is
being developed which supports differential privacy, and allows researchers to
investigate the utility of these tools for novel ML-based applications, such as
free-form question answering about scientific texts, neural recommender systems,
etc.
