9406258 Carlson This grant provides partial support for the acquisition of a
high-resolution, X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scanner for innovative, sub-
millimeter scale studies of metamorphic textures, vertebrate paleontology and
physical anthropology at the University of Texas-Austin. Recent advances in high
resolution CT instruments, especially with regard to X-ray focusing and modular
detector design, together with sophisticated image processing software developed
for cross-platform usage, will allow unprecedented, high resolution, non-
destructive 3- D imaging of many geologic materials for which digital will be
available both rapidly and in formats that are readily exchangeable. These data
will be made available for interested researchers both interdepartmentally as
well regionally and further afield. This facility will allow analysis of a wide
range of geologic materials of greatly varying sample size and thus has great
potential for new advances in metamorphic petrology and invertebrate
paleontology that will available to academic researchers at costs which will be
substantially below commercially available, high resolution CT instrument time.
