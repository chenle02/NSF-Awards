The western margin of North America has experienced several episodes of
tectonic activity, culminating in large-scale accretion of allochthonous
terranes in the Mesozoic. The Kootenay Arc is an arcuate belt of Proterozoic to
Jurassic rocks extending from east-central Washington to SE British Columbia.
This study will examine and attempt to date the emplacement of early Paleozoic
eugeoclinal sedimentary and volcanic rocks over Cambrian and older miogeoclinal
rocks. Emplacement of the allochthonous rocks could have occurred either during
the mid-Paleozoic Antler orogeny, or during Jura-Cretaceous accretion of
outboard tectonic fragments. Results will have considerable impact on models of
the tectonic evolution of the western continental margin of North America
including indication of how close some of the allochthonous terranes were to the
margin during the Jurassic and perhaps Paleozoic time.
