This project will build and fly, over Antarctica, a balloon borne instrument to
measure the isotopic abundance of cosmic rays with masses from neon through
nickel. The origin and evolution of elements and isotopes remains one of the
central problems of astrophysics. The data which this instrument will be used to
investigate questions of cosmic ray origins and transport, and to look for
effects of ongoing nucleosynthesis on the chemical composition of the galaxy.
This project will be jointly supported by NSF's Division of Polar Programs and
Physics and NASA's Space Physics Division. NSF will provide logistical support
in Antarctica and NASA will provide balloon launch services.
