Proposal: CCR-0312760&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Algorithms for the Technology
of Trust&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Michael T. Goodrich&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project is directed at a subject area of critical importance to society--methods
for efficiently maintaining the security of computations and computational
resources, including the networks that communicate vital data. In addition, the
work involves an important educational mission to integrate cyber-security
algorithms into the undergraduate computer science
curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on developing efficient
algorithms for performing trusted computations in a networked environment.
Themes to be investigated include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Authenticated data
structures and algorithms: The project places special emphasis on methods for
authenticating the results of data structures and algorithms, even when those
computations are performed by an untrusted third party on behalf of a trusted
source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Audited algorithms: The project will explore a
new computational framework in which computations are performed by a community
of untrusted users, but this computation is checked by an external auditor with
limited computational resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Democratic Trust
Assurance: The project is also directed at infrastructures for a community of
peers who want to establish trust within their group. Specific interest is in
solutions that are practical and potentially applicable to grid computing, while
allowing for multiple clients and servers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
