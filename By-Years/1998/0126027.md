Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;Muhlenberg College's Biology Department is
committed to having students undertake long term, independent research projects,
complete comprehensive data analysis and data presentation, and engage in
intensive collaborative inquiry and investigative type exercises. Muhlenberg's
1998 ILI-NSF grant ensured that these objectives were accomplished in the upper-
level research-based courses through the use of computer-based technology. The
current project is addressing the introductory biology sequence, and is an
adaptation of the learnings provided by Project Kaleidoscope's "What Works," and
similar efforts at Kutztown University (DUE 9952337). Specifically, the project
is implementing models for teaching plant and animal structure/function and
cell/molecular biology laboratories while adapting computer technology to
facilitate scientific inquiry. Our central goal is to expand the use of computer
technology and the culture of science to students enrolled in the introductory
biology laboratories. These courses are introducing the students to all elements
of scientific inquiry through investigative exercises and doing independent
research. The students are using computers, software, and peripherals to 1)
record data from their short-term investigative and long-term independent
experiments, 2) doing statistics and graphing, 3) placing data on the web and
using web-based technology to access molecular databases, and 4) presenting
their long-term projects in the format of a poster and/or oral presentation.
Thus, the computer-based infrastructure is allowing the students to make even
more sophisticated connections within and outside the laboratory.
