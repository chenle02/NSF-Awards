9501793 Murphy This project is on research to enhance the design and fabrication
of microsystems for medical and biological applications. Two demonstration
projects are proposed for this purpose. The first project is the development of
a strain sensor to be mounted directly on bone fixation plates, which could be
monitored using an external ultrasound sampling system. This could significantly
improve the orthopedists' control of when bone plates are removed, greatly
reducing the risk of a second fracture adjacent to the original break. The
second project is to develop an arthroscopic instrument based on sensing
technology developed for in situ laboratory cartilage research to assist
diagnosis of a common orthopedic problem, chondromalacia. This project will push
the limits of current microfabrication technology and help to define the
requirements for interfacing between macroscale and microscale machine elements.
