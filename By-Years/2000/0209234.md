This research focuses on the development of a sound theoretical framework for
the design of efficient network discovery and reconfiguration techniques that
are deadlock-free and generically applicable to state-of-the-art interconnection
networks used in future multiprocessor servers, network-
based&lt;br/&gt;computing clusters and distributed storage systems. The theory
should have wide applicability and serve as an authoritative basis on which
deadlock freedom of reconfiguration processes for arbitrary networks can be
formally proved. As part of the theoretical framework, a general methodology
will be developed that will allow the power of the theory to be realized in the
straightforward design of new and more efficient techniques. The techniques
derived from the theory and methodology will provide alternative ways of
increasing network reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) in the
presence of unconstrained fault patterns as well as in the presence of voluntary
changes to a network configuration due to resource re-partitioning,
communication-aware algorithm/process re-mapping, data migration, etc.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The techniques will not impede the injection,
transmission, or delivery of user packets during discovery and reconfiguration
processes but, rather, will remain relatively transparent to the user and/or
system administrator. Proof of concepts will be pursued by simulating the
developed techniques and applying them to state-of-the-art switch-based system-
area and storage-area networks amenable to their implementation. This research
ultimately could result in new opportunities for dependable network
architectures to off-load some of the QoS handling to lower network layers
while, at the same time, providing enriched RAS features and higher
performance.&lt;br/&gt;
