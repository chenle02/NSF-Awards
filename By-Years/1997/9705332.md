ABSTRACT EEC-9705332 Mathur The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Software Engineering has developed the Virtual Software Engineering Research
Center (VSERC), a prototype of a virtual enterprise on the Internet and World
Wide Web (WWW). This project maintains and improves the accessibility and
reliability of VSERC, provides for and improves the ease of transfer of VSERC to
other Centers, and adds new educational capabilities to the software program.
The enhancement of VSERC will be achieved by the addition of an Educational Wing
that will allow Internet access to the following material: 1) Interactive
Components, 2) Multi-Media Server Access Facilities, and 3) Software Engineering
Courseware. The proposed enhancement of VSERC will allow educators and students
to access all SERC related educational and research material through a single
hierarchical interface. The research material is already available via VSERC and
is continually updated. Starting in Fall 1997, the educational material will
begin entering into the database currently under construction in SERC and the
Department of Computer Science at Purdue. This database will contain the
digitized versions of live lectures delivered in the classroom, course material,
interactive software engineering tools, and "concept applets" written in Java.
The proposed addition of the Educational Wing to VSERC will allow faculty and
students to update and access this database through a uniform interface that is
independent of the specific courses, concepts, and research areas supported.
