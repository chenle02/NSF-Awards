9401455 Curto The research of Curto will involve five projects from the subject
of multivariable operator theory. These projects are the following: 1.A
description of the spectral picture of multiplication on functional Hilbert
spaces over Reinhardt and matrix Reinhardt domains. 2.Further characterizations
of polynomial hyponormal operators. 3.Using hyponormal operator techniques to
characterize initial segments of moment sequences. 4.A search for an Sz. Nagy-
Foias dilation theory in several variables. 5.Understand the relationship
between Taylor spectrum and other spectral systems using topological and
K-theoretic invariants. Hilbert space operators are infinite generalizations of
matrices. The infinite generalization of a vector is frequently a function and
for this reason Hilbert space operators are frequently modeled as the operator
of multiplication on a space of functions. This project involves finding such
models for operators or tuples of operators. Once such models are obtained many
basic questions about the structure of these operators become more natural. ***
