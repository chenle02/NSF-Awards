9410158 Lever It is apparent that intelligent techniques necessary to control
machine / environment interactions for autonomous excavation operations at
complex rock excavation sites require further investigation. The first objective
of the proposed research is to mount sensors, actuators and a control CPU on a
real mini-excavator arm. collect bucket force/torque sensor data during actual
excavation tasks, and then develop sensor data reduction techniques needed for
its intelligent control. The second objective is to develop and implement a new
intelligent control approach that utilizes fuzzy behaviorq with fuzzy strategies
to control bucket motions for autonomous excavation tasks. This approach uses
feedback from bucket mounted force sensors to control excavation motions by
sensing and reacting to interactions with rock particles during excavation task.
