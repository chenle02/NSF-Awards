The National Information Service for Earthquake Engineering ((NISEE) was
established to facilitate the collection, organization, and dissemination of
information on earthquake engineering and related subjects. In addition to the
component of NISEE at the California Institute of Technology, there is also a
unit of NISEE at the University of California, Berkeley. NISEE/Caltech operates
a research library and serves as a source of information for researchers,
engineering organizations, and public officials. NISEE's Earthquake Engineering
Library contains numerous items for users, including books, monographs, reports
and a collection of earthquake slides, photographs, and seismograph records. The
objective of NISEE/Caltech during the next 2 years will be to maintain and
expand the existing collection of resource material through increased use of
electronic data storage and retrieval technology. In addition, NISEE will begin
the distribution of important strong motion accelerogram data on floppy
diskettes. These diskettes will be formulated for popular microcompuers and
plotting software will also be provided.
