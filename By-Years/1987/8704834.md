This research program investigates a number of mathematical problems concerning
the solution of nonlinear time dependent partial differential equations. These
equations are mathematical models of a wide range of phenomena in mechanics,
thermodynamics, chemistry and material science. The research results from this
program will have implications on heat transport by "second sound" in solids,
elastic-plastic oscillators with a discontinuous forcing, travelling waves in
the cold drawing of polymeric fibers, "soliton switch" behavior of chiral
smectic crystals in electric fields, etc.
