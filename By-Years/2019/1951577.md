How does information spread within a system over time? How is this related to
the intrinsic structure of &lt;br/&gt;the system? Mathematical models are
developed to understand and make predictions about the &lt;br/&gt;behavior of
highly complex processes and structures. Richer and more realistic models can be
obtained &lt;br/&gt;by increasing their 'roughness'; here we may think of the
intricate branching of large networks like the &lt;br/&gt;Internet. In addition,
incorporating randomness can help to better describe the interactions between
&lt;br/&gt;the elements that compose the model, for instance between different
web servers. The area of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics concerned with the analysis of
random processes and structures is called probability &lt;br/&gt;theory. This
project aims to apply probability theory to better understand the
interconnections between &lt;br/&gt;the random processes, the geometry, and the
analysis of rough spaces and random geometric models. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The
research supported by this award aims to investigate stochastic processes in
rough spaces and &lt;br/&gt;functionals of random sets. The PI will analyze the
behavior of diffusion processes intrinsic to fractal-like &lt;br/&gt;spaces,
where classical concepts such as derivatives or canonical measures are less
straightforward or &lt;br/&gt;not even available. Special attention will be paid
to the study of functional inequalities and gradient &lt;br/&gt;estimates to
gain further insight into the connections between the process and the geometry
of the &lt;br/&gt;underlying space. Besides, the PI will analyze properties of
large spatial data sets modeled by point &lt;br/&gt;processes with long range
dependencies. Here, the focus lies on geometric and potential-theoretic
&lt;br/&gt;aspects of random covering sets and the asymptotic behavior of
statistics employed in the detection of &lt;br/&gt;rare events. The PI expects
that the methods and techniques developed will lead to progress on current
&lt;br/&gt;questions in mathematical physics, material and data
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
