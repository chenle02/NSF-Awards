Auston The renovation project to be undertaken by this award will modernize the
obsolete heating, ventilation, air conditioning and plumbing systems in the
research wing of the Seeley Mudd Engineering Center at Columbia University.
Malfunctioning mechanical systems have become a serious impediment to the
school's many advanced research activities. Those research activities include
aspects of civil engineering, chemical engineering, engineering mechanics,
materials research, electrical engineering, biological sciences and mineral
engineering. More than 21 faculty conduct research in the space to be modernized
along with 19 postdocs, 105 graduate students and 32 undergraduate students.
This modernization project will have a tremendous impact on one of the leading
engineering training facilities in the nation.
