Molecular techniques are essential to some of today's most advanced and
progressive research in physical anthropology. The broad applicability of
molecular methodologies, combined with improved accessibility, means that
invaluable training and research opportunities now exist for students and
researchers. This award provides funds for an Automated DNA Analysis System in
order to develop a molecular anthropology training and research program at the
University of Florida (UF). The Department of Anthropology at UF is expanding
its Bioanthropology program with an emphasis on developing a core series of
graduate-level laboratory courses. Furthermore, the expansion of the
Bioanthropology program has stimulated the development of several collaborative
research and training projects within the Department of Anthropology and
throughout the university. Dr. Mulligan has an active research program in which
molecular techniques, specifically DNA sequence and fragment analysis, play a
central role. A total of eight projects are currently funded (partially or
fully). The requested instrumentation will provide improved accessibility of the
technology to researchers and students with minimal experience in molecular
methodology. The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at UF recognizes the merit
of this opportunity and has agreed to match external funding obtained for the
acquisition of an Automated DNA Analysis System.
