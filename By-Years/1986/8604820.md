This proposal is for the acquisition of a low cost digital image analysis system
for use in particle sizing, colloidal phenomena, and biotechnology. The
following projects will be using the image analysis system extensively in the
immediate future: detection of nucleation and crystallization; kinetics of
silica gel formation; diffusion of molecules and particles in two dimensions;
on-line monitoring of cell growth; diffusion and reaction in immobilized
mamalian cells; chemically induced protein release from E. coli cells; and
kinetics of droplet aggregation, coagulation, and breakup.
