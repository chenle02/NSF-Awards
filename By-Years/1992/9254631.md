This project will train a substantial number of teachers of science,
mathematics and social studies in systems thinking. In 36 months, approximately
100 teachers will learn to use modeling systems, including STELLA which is
available for even low-end Macintosh computers, to represent and solve complex
problems. Twenty-two teachers will be the core team which accumulates develops
and disseminates models related to mathematics, science, technology and society.
Partnerships with local industry and agencies help by providing the ongoing
support teachers need to develop relevant models. Even though the project
directly serves only teachers in Oregon, it includes other supports for teachers
such as the information of a national user's group for educators, networking in
a way which permits sharing models, and significant commercial involvement in
providing useful real world models. Through this project, teachers will begin
building interdisciplinary applications for their courses. These models help
students to understand and represent complex processes. The grantee provides
matching costs of 22%.
