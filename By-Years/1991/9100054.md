Habitat use during migration has profound consequences for a bird's ability to
satisfy energy requirements, vulnerability to predators, and exposure to
environmental stress. The proposed research quantifies habitat use during spring
and fall en route periods. Presumably migrants select particular habitats
because they thereby enhance their fitness. Although it would be difficult to
measure directly the effect of en route use of habitat on survival and
reproductive success, it is possible to evaluate the immediate consequences in
relation to how effectively migrants satisfy energy demand during migration,
i.e. deposit fat reserves and gain body mass. Over half of all North American
landbirds are long-distance migrants that journey between temperature breeding
ranges and more tropical wintering areas. Decline in populations of Neotropical
landbird migrants is linked to habitat loss on the wintering grounds and
fragmentation of forested breeding habitats. Because the persistence of migrant
populations depends on the bird's ability to find favorable conditions
throughout the annual cycle, factors associated with the en route ecology of
migrants must figure in the formulation of sound conservation policy.
