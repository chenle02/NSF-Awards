This project's workshops are engaging key stakeholders from academia and
industry in the development and finalization of the Computer Engineering (CE)
and Software Engineering (SE) curricula guidelines. The resulting guidelines,
referred to as CE2013 and SE2013, are expected to be used by academic
institutions to evaluate and evolve their computing curricula. There are two
workshops: A SE-focused, and a CE-focused workshop. In each workshop attendees
are reviewing the current curricula guidelines and discussing how the guidelines
should be evolved to meet current and future computing workforce needs. Both
workshops engage the respective communities in discussions on how best to
integrate recent developments and advances into curricula that best prepare
students for modern computing careers. The workshops involve, along with other
stakeholders, key members of related computing accreditation bodies and members
of the group developing the software engineering body of knowledge. The SE
workshop is co-located with the Conference on Software Engineering Education &
Training (CSEE&T), expected in the Fall 2013, in San Francisco. The CE meeting
is anticipated to take place in conjunction with the Frontiers in Education
(FIE) conference, which will be held in October 2013, Oklahoma City.
