Understanding the catalytic activity of ATP-utilizing enzymes on a molecular
basis requires knowledge of the structures of the reactants and products bound
at he active sites of these enzymes. Dr. Rao's goal is to establish the active-
site structures of three classes of enzymes, phosphory1 transfer, nucleotidy1
transfer and pyrophosphory1 transfer by using NMR spectroscopy which is one of
the few techniques available for structural investigations in liquids. This is
an excellent, well-crafted proposal by a very creative scientist. Dr. Rao has
made impressive contributions to cleaning up the interpretation of metal-ion
induced relaxation of substrate molecules in the active site of ATP-utilizing
enzymes. This project represents significant and important extensions of the
ongoing research.
