It is proposed here that support be provided for four projects as part of the
investigator's continuing work in the representation theory of p-adic groups
with applications to local number theory. The first of these projects would
extend to classical groups much of the investigator's work with Bushnell on the
groups GL(N). The ultimate goal is to construct inducing representations for the
supercuspidal representations of these groups and then to produce covers for the
resulting supercuspidal types. This would allow the use of earlier methods in
studying the harmonic analysis of these groups and would hopefully have
arithmetic applications, especially to Langlands functoriality. The second
project involves working out what might be called a Plancherel theory for affine
Hecke algebras with possibly unequal parameters. These algebras play a critical
role in applying the techniques alluded to above; it is to be hoped that results
already obtained in low rank may be extended to this general situation. The
third project involves the K-theory and homology of p-adic groups and builds
upon some recent results on the module theory of Hecke algebras. The fourth
project is to apply methods involving compact, open subgroups to study the
oscillator representation, especially in case p=2.

A basic problem in the mathematics of almost every ancient culture was to
determine solutions to equations where the solutions were constrained to be
whole numbers. Such equations, called Diophantine equations after the late Greek
mathematician Diophantos, have motivated much of the development of that part of
mathematics referred to as the theory of numbers. As an example, one has the so-
called Fermat equation, an equation that has been much in the news of late due
to the recent determination of its lack of solutions except in case n=2. One way
of attempting to solve a Diophantine equation is to replace the equation by a
congruence: that is, one picks an integer N and one replaces the condition that
the two sides of the equation be equal by the less stringent condition that the
difference of the two sides of the equation be divisible by N. Solving these
congruences for enough integers N often gives good information about the
existence or non-existence of solutions to the original equation. Often it is
useful to fix a prime number p and then to study the congruences that result
when N runs through all powers of p. In this case, one says that one has
localized the problem to the prime p. This process of localization has, over the
last two hundred years, led to the development of a part of number theory called
local number theory. This is the general area in which this project is to be
carried out. One of the most powerful conceptualizations in local number theory
is to be found in the conjectures of R.P. Langlands which, if verified, would go
a long way to clarifying the nature of local Diophantine problems. The project
proposed here would build on the investigator's earlier work in an attempt to
provide some of the tools necessary to verify these conjectures.
