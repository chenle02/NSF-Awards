This award is to support travel by up to 25 student participants to attend the
2020 International Symposium on Medical Robotics. All of the supported students
are attending US institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is a conference
support grant for the expenses of up to 25 selected U.S. trainees (PhD students
and post-doctoral fellows of various disciplinary backgrounds pertaining to
medical/surgical robotics, image-guided interventions, surgical simulation and
training, biomechatronics, rehabilitation robotics, and medical devices)
attending the 5th North American School on Medical Robotics - "2020
International Symposium on Medical Robotics". The Conference will be held at the
Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, from April 22-24, 2020 to
introduce and educate trainees on the ground- breaking research and
opportunities in surgical robotics, image-guided medical interventions, surgical
simulation and training, rehabilitation robotics, etc. Organized in part by the
Georgia Institute of Technology, the symposium focuses on providing a forum to
exchange scientific findings, discuss recent research progress, identify areas
requiring greater emphasis, set research goals for collaborations, recognize
outstanding achievement in the field, and promote the study of medical robotics
to young scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
