Consistent with the proposed Presidential Executive Order to provide
surplus/excess equipment to qualified institutions, it is considered appropriate
that Mary Holmes College receive this award. The College, in a cooperative
effort with the West Point Mississippi public school system, is intensely
involved in a program to motivate at-risk students to continue in a program of
formal education. This initiative is consistent with the Division of Human
Resource Development's programs.
