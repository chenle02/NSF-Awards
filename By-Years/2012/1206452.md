0721902&lt;br/&gt;PI name Martin Swany&lt;br/&gt;Institution University of
Delaware&lt;br/&gt;Title ?Improvement: Production Services for the perfSONAR
Framework?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
project addresses development and deployment of a cyberinfrastructure system for
network monitoring, measurement, reporting, and debugging that is interoperable
and sharable across multiple network domains. The software system, called
perfSONAR, is already an international software effort whose architecture has
been adopted by the major research and education networks in the United States
(Internet2 and ESNet) and abroad. This proposal addresses needs in the further
development of perfSONAR to make it more viable as a deployed network monitoring
and reporting system through code hardening and the addition of new features for
authentication, discovery, and data exchange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
