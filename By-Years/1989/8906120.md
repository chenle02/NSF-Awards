This proposal requests funds to purchase state-of-the-art instrumentation to
permit advanced research to be carried out on high- frequency, coherent free-
space and fiber sensors for a range of ultra- sensitive applications. In
particular, instrumentation is being requested to provide accurate DC to
microwave frequency generation and analysis capability. This instrumentation
will replace antiquated instrumentation currently in use in experiments using
homodyne and heterodyne sensors in the following applications: 1) photothermal
spectroscopy and related photothermal studies; 2) studies of lateral turbulence
correlations in the atmosphere; 3) studies of local, short-path turbulence; 4)
detection of trace organic molecules in the atmosphere; 5) studies of the
ultrasonic properties of liquids up to 2GHz; 6) studies of the non-linear
magnetooptical properties of materials; 7) development of new heterodyne fiber
sensors with novel polarization and demodulation techniques using balance
mixers. These sensors are being developed for local probing of electrooptic and
magnetooptic activity. The specific equipment being requested comprises: HP:
Model 8662A Signal Gen.: Model 8644 Signal Gen.: Model 8562 Spectrum Analyzer:
Model 3162 Dynamic Signal Analyzer.
