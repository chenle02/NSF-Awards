The second ACM/IEEE Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications
Systems (ANCS), which will be held in San Jose, CA on Novenber 5-6, 2008. ANCS
has been created to provide a top-tier venue to bring together researchers from
the areas of computer systems architecture and networking systems, in order to
foster greater collaboration between these increasingly related research areas.
This proposal aims to secure travel support to ANCS for students.
