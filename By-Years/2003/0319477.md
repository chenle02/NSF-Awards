This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will explore liquid-
phase analysis systems utilizing novel sample introduction methods coupled with
an innovative portable mass spectrometer. Much valuable time and chemical
information can be conserved through in-situ analysis at the actual point of
sample collection. In light of developing needs in industry as well as current
environmental and terrorism threats, the need for rapid, definitive, on-site
liquid-phase analysis has become an important analytical challenge.
Breakthroughs in instrument design and capabilities are key to providing
analytical information in a more timely and efficient manner. Current state of
the art techniques for analyzing liquids are slow, expensive, laboratory-based,
and require extensive operator expertise to collect and interpret the data. The
goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of the company's
proprietary technology to develop a portable, easy to use, miniature mass
spectrometer that will provide a real-time, automated, sensitive, affordable,
and reliable method for detecting a wide range of species in liquid-phase
samples. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument will be deployed in chemical
process applications, teaching and academic research laboratories, contaminated
environmental sites, and military installations and battlefields, and has the
potential to impact society broadly by providing improved monitoring of
developing environmental and homeland security threats.&lt;br/&gt;
