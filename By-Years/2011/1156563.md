This funding renews a highly-successful CISE Research Experiences
for&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa.
This&lt;br/&gt;site focuses on empirical software engineering and its projects
span&lt;br/&gt;several exciting areas of inquiry, including text retrieval
based&lt;br/&gt;feature location, code clone evolution, software engineering
techniques&lt;br/&gt;and tools for computational science &amp; engineering, and
open-source&lt;br/&gt;developer communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site
will allow 30 students (over three years) to experience&lt;br/&gt;Software
Engineering research. Participating students will attend&lt;br/&gt;research
training and professional development seminars. Students will&lt;br/&gt;have the
opportunity to submit their research to quality conferences and&lt;br/&gt;to
present their work, if accepted. The project team is committed
to&lt;br/&gt;including under-represented minority students in their research.
Thus&lt;br/&gt;this project has the potential to produce new computer science
graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and faculty members and to advance discovery and
understanding&lt;br/&gt;while promoting learning.
