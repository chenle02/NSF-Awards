9411528 Cheng As one element of the US/China (PRC) Protocol Annex III Program, a
US-PRC Symposium on Post-Earthquake Reconstruction will be held in April 1995 in
Kunming, PRC.Objectives of the symposium/workshop are: 1) to discuss the lessons
learned from recent seismic disasters in both countries; 2) to assess the
current state of knowledge and practice in urban rebuilding after earthquake s
and to identify frontal joint research opportunities necessary to advance the
current state of knowledge; 3) to stimulate future cooperative results of PRC's
post-earthquake reconstruction program and their practical implications in the
US; and 5) to continue to build the long-term bilateral scientific relationship
existing between academic and practicing communities. Engineers, Social
Scientists, Planners, Construction Professionals and Policy Makers will all be
involved. In March of 1993, a delegation from the Earthquake Resistance Office.
Ministry of Construction (MOC), PRC, visited NSF in Washington, DC. This
proposed symposium/workshop is approved as a high- priority activity endorsed by
both agencies. This is a US-China cooperative earthquake engineering research
project. ***
