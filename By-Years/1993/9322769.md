Abstract ATM-9322769 Bradley, Raymond S. University of Massachusetts Title:
Laminated Lake Sediments from the Canadian High Arctic: Understanding the
Climatic Signal for Paleoclimatic Reconstruction Synopsis. Ice core and other
paleoclimatic records from the High Arctic suggest that summer temperatures
reached minimum levels for the entire Holocene during the last 500 years, but
underwent a dramatic reversal in the last 100 years. This award, under the
Paleoclimate from Arctic Lakes and Estuaries (PALE) program is designed to study
lake sediments from a number of sites to determine if this hypothesis is
supported by the sedimentary record. To better understand the paleoclimatic
signal in the sediments, a three year process-based study is planned to
determine the primary controls on sediments flux and varved sediment formation
in Sophia Lake, a High Arctic hypersaline, meromictic lake. Sophia Lake provides
a simple topographic environment, which will facilitate efforts to isolate the
primary climatic forcing. Sediments from lakes on the margin of Agassiz Ice Cap
will also be recovered in order to link the paleoclimatic record of ice cores
from the ice cap to sedimentary records from the glacier margin,
