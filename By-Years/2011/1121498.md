Most animals locate resources critical to their survival and reproduction (i.e.,
food, mates) by tracking evaporated odors that have moved downwind away from
these resources in odor plumes. A major unanswered question about this
remarkable behavior is how animals maintain contact with odor plumes. Do they:
1) make simultaneous side-to-side comparisons of odor levels between odor
sensors, or 2) compare a series of odor concentrations detected at different
points along their paths? This answer is not known because the multiple
variables that affect an animal?s behavioral response to odor have rarely been
studied in a systematic way. These variables include a dynamically changing
environment, how fast they are walking, flying or swimming, and odor sensors on
different parts of their bodies.&lt;br/&gt;Our project will use a novel
integrative approach to address this long standing question and transform and
expand our understanding of odor-guided behavior. The behavioral responses of
flying and walking animals will be compared as the three variables listed above
are manipulated. The variables most important to successful source location will
be identified along with how they interact with each other. The knowledge gained
about biological control rules and their interaction with the behavior and
sensory structures of a specific organism will reveal how animals prioritize
information to adapt their behavior to unpredictable conditions. &lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts of this study will include: 1) research training for students
from our university and from a local all-girls high school, 2) training for a
Cleveland Metropolitan High School teacher who will work in our lab during
summers with the goal of using insect behavior as a tool to bring experience-
based learning to the classroom, and 3) knowledge of biological control rules
for odor tracking to apply to such projects as odor-tracking behaviors in mobile
robots.
