Under this award, the Principal Investigator will continue research on the
influence of the urban environment on clouds and precipitation. Under prior NSF
support, which was focused on dynamical influences, results of sensitivity
experiments have shown that the urban heat island is a factor in inducing deep,
moist convection downwind of a major urban area. Surface convergence driven by
the urban heat island is enhanced on the leeward side of the city. The nonlinear
interaction between urban momentum drag and the urban heat island causes
convection downwind of the urban area with a concomitant increase in
precipitation. Topography is also shown to impact storm development.

Under the current award, the Principal Investigator will undertake the following
activities:

-Modeling the effects of enhanced cloud condensation nuclei and giant cloud
condensation nuclei concentrations on convection. -Idealized modeling and a case
study of impacts of an urban area on mesoscale convective systems.
-Participation in the Houston Environmental Aerosol Thunderstorm Project (HEAT).
HEAT is in the planning stages and is a multi-investigator program designed to
investigate the influence of the urban environment on weather. The Principal
Investigator's modeling work will be helpful in the planning of this project.
-Modeling urban impacts on convection and cloud structures favorable for
lightning.

This research will contribute to fundamental understanding of the influence of
major urban centers on convective storms, lightning, and precipitation. The
broader impacts of this research will be on urban land-use planning. The
educational benefit is that results of this work will be immediately
incorporated in the course content of first year and advanced courses in cloud
physics and cloud dynamics, as well as in the textbook "Human Impacts on Weather
and Climate" co-authored by the Principal Investigator.
