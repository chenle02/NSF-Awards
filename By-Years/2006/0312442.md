DMS-0312442&lt;br/&gt;Rachel Roberts &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Professor Roberts
will investigate several problems concerning the &lt;br/&gt;topology of
3-manifolds. In particular, she proposes investigating &lt;br/&gt;a series of
questions suggested by her earlier work (joint with &lt;br/&gt;John Shareshian
and Melanie Stein) demonstrating the existence of &lt;br/&gt;infinitely many
hyperbolic manifolds containing no Reebless &lt;br/&gt;foliation. She also
proposes a study of particular Reebless &lt;br/&gt;foliations and essential
laminations as part of her proposed &lt;br/&gt;approach to proving the truth of
the property P conjecture for &lt;br/&gt;knots, which says that no
counterexample to the Poincar\'e &lt;br/&gt;Conjecture can be generated by Dehn
surgery on knots. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Three-manifolds are spaces formed by
gluing together blocks of &lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional space according to
certain prescribed rules. &lt;br/&gt;Globally, the spaces obtained are usually
quite complex. These &lt;br/&gt;spaces arise naturally in many contexts in the
physical and &lt;br/&gt;natural sciences and model many interesting phenomena.
As an &lt;br/&gt;example of this, we note the recent joint research of
topologists &lt;br/&gt;and cosmologists suggesting a perhaps surprising model
for our &lt;br/&gt;spatial universe. As another example, the study of
3-manifolds is &lt;br/&gt;important in the study of the knotting and linking of
strings in &lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional space, which in turn is important in the
study &lt;br/&gt;of the structure of DNA. A primary goal of the study of
&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds is to discover a useful description of all such spaces
&lt;br/&gt;and to develop useful tools for working with them. In this
&lt;br/&gt;research, Professor Roberts investigates questions related to this
&lt;br/&gt;goal. &lt;br/&gt;
