This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses research
required to develop intelligent software systems for distributed real-time data
fusion that will be capable of dealing with the explosive growth in the amounts
and types of information available to intelligent information processing systems
in dynamic environments. Today, automated techniques deal primarily with mere
correlation of information, with more sophisticated analyses available only
through largely manual processing. While this approach may work for certain
situations, there is little hope that it can keep pace with highly mobile,
dynamic systems, in which the numbers and positions of distributed information
sources evolve in real time. Scientific Computing Associates, Inc., proposes to
investigate development of systems based on a software architecture (the Process
Trellis) that is effective for data fusion and that can be dynamically grouped
into ensembles and ungrouped as needed. Such an architecture seems essential for
applications like vehicular traffic management, air traffic control and others
in which individual components may enter or leave the `world view` with great
rapidity and at unexpected times. In terms of implementation, they propose to
use distributed processors functioning as a single dynamic parallel computer. In
Phase I, the researchers plan to build a prototype ensemble Trellis system and
study its performance in order to assess the feasibility of a full-scale
implementation. If the Phase I research is successful, it will lay the
groundwork for building data fusion systems that will be able to maintain real-
time behavior in dynamic environments by automatically scaling the use of
processing power as required.
