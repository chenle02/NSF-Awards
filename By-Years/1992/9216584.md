This research will focus on developing a methodology and a software tool for
the design and verification of heterogeneous controllers composed of multiple
simple controllers. The component controllers may operate either on different
operations regions or on different time scales. The design tool will use
qualitative and semiquantitative simulations of the plants and controllers as
produced by the QSIM and NSIM simulators to map out possible behaviors, thus
producing automatic stability proofs. (Qualitative models specify monotonic
relationships between variables, while semiquantitative models specify envelopes
which bound the function relating the variables.) Models of faults and
disturbances will be used to test the robustness of proposed controllers, and
either prove their stability or suggest modifications to the control law. This
is a collaborative project with Prof. Lyle Ungar, Department of Chemical
Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. //
