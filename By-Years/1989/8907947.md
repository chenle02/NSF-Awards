This award provides funds for the purchase of a central computer, or network
server, and seven powerful computer workstations that will be linked to the
server through an existing campus-wide fiber optics cable. The computers will be
used by eight research groups for storage and analysis of DNA sequence data, and
will be available to additional groups of investigators whose computational
needs are of smaller scale. The researchers who will benefit from the award
study basic aspects of the genetics and development of a variety of organisms,
both plant and animal. Since the development of accurate and efficient DNA
sequencing methods about 12 years ago, the sequence of roughly 25 million
basepairs of DNA from a large variety of organisms has been determined. Much of
the known sequence data has been deposited in GENBANK, a DNA sequence database
sponsored by the Federal government. Comparison of newly obtained sequence data
with that already in the database has become a routine tool in the analysis of
gene structure and function. The increasing sophistication of the software
needed for such analysis, as well as the rapid increase in the size and
complexity of the database, virtually requires that powerful computer
workstations of the type been purchased be used if database searches and other
computationally intensive analyses are to be performed within a reasonable time
period.
