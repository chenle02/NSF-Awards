In the past decade, many tools and opportunities have been developed for
children and young adults to learn through designing and programming computer
games. While each project has contributed its analysis of what can be learned
from computer game programming, there has, as yet, been no synthesis across
those projects laying out what children learn from computer game programming,
the best pedagogical strategies for promoting such learning, and which tools and
learning environments promote different kinds of outcomes and for whom. This
project?s investigators are using a systematic meta-synthesis methodology to
pull together existing research on computer game programming to create such a
synthesis. Their meta-synthesis method is a seven-step process that integrates
quantitative and qualitative research findings. A panel of content and
methodology experts is evaluating the rigor and transparency of the findings at
each step of the analysis process. In addition to the results that will be
reported, this project also is contributing to the growing body of research on
rigorous methodologies for conducting qualitative research syntheses.

Authoring of computer games is increasingly being used as a strategy to attract
youngsters to computing and to enhance STEM learning. A systematic synthesis of
what has been learned from scientific studies about effective design and use of
computer game programming is needed to make what has been learned accessible and
available to those who are designing tools for authoring computer games and
experiences for learners and who are investigating the roles computer game
authoring can play in promoting learning. This is a broad range of audiences and
includes researchers, educators, and program developers.
