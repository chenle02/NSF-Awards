9529445 Takahashi The series of Coastal Ocean Space Utilization (COSU) symposia
sponsored by the National Science Foundation and a significant number of
partners has stimulated considerable interest, cooperation, and agreement on
balanced utilization and management of our coastal region in harmony with the
environment. The success of these gatherings can be attributed to the quality of
the conferees and the philosophical format. The COSU series has provided an
excellent international forum to review and discuss the latest technological
advances, concepts, and research needs on a variety of interdisciplinary topics.
Inasmuch as more than 50 percent of the world's population and industrial and
research activity is located within 100 kilometers of the coast, this is a very
important region on which to focus in applying advances in marine science and
technology to achieve sustainable development of the coastal infrastructure.
These symposia has been held in specific coastal regions of the world to obtain
different perspectives and thus stimulate the cross-pollination of ideas for
solving the many environmental and developmental problems facing these areas.
These gatherings have provided new insights and innovative concepts to deal with
the interdisciplinary problems of the expanding coastal infrastructure, which
are driven by the steadily increasing coastal population with its attendant
environmental, social, and economic impacts. Concepts frequently introduced
pertain to such topics as artificial islands, floating cities, environmentally
friendly coastal reclamation, new ocean energy extraction techniques, off- shore
ranching, artificial upwelling, autonomous vehicles, and remote sensing systems,
to mention a few. Various international cooperative projects have already
resulted. There is great emphasis on sustainable coastal development, i.e.,
development in harmony with the marine environment. This has introduced new
technologies, methods, and techni ques that have greatly influenced the design
of those systems and projects comprising the coastal infrastructure. ***
