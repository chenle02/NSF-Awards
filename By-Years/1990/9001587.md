Field experiments will be employed to investigate differences in the
reproductive biology and population traits of a species of salamander. Different
populations of this amphibian exhibit very different growth rates, reproductive
rates, and body sizes which appear to be related to differences in environmental
quality. This possibility and the alternative that the populations are
genetically differentiated will be explored, using a series of experiments in
which animals are raised in different environments in the field. Other
experiments involve supplementally feeding animals in natural populations to
ascertain the specific role of food abundance in determining these traits.
Patterns of response to the different conditions will reveal how important the
environment is in determining these traits.
