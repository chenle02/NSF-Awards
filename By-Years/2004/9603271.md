This two-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in adapative control
theory involves Anuradha Annaswamy of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) and Rogelio Lozano-Leal at the Universite de Technologie de Compiegne,
Compiegne, France. The objective of the research is to develop an adaptive
control theory for nonlinear systems and for systems with nonlinear
parametrization using neural networks. The project takes advantage of
complementary skills. The U.S. investigator is an expert on adaptive control of
continuous time systems and nonlinear parametrization. This is complemented by
the French researchers expertise in adaptive control theory in discrete- time
systems. The project will advance fundamental understanding into control design
and stability.
