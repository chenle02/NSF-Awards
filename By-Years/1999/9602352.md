Title: Business Alliance for Advanced Technological Education This two year
project will establish the Business Alliance for Advanced Technological
Education. It will develop school-to-work projects focused on technician
education at four partnership sites: Siemens and East Wake High School in
Raleigh, NC; Novell and Ford and the Virginia Beach Public Schools inn Virginia
Beach, VA; Pratt and Whitney/UTC and the Manchester Public Schools, and the
Hartford Community and Technical College in Hartford, CT; and Procter & Gamble
and the Northern Tier Industry Education Consortium in Mehoopany, PA. The
project is guided by a National Advisory Committee of educators, business people
and policy-makers. The Alliance will be supported by an On-Site Assistance Group
which will conduct site visits, provide technical assistance, facilitate cross-
learning among sites, and ensure that worksites are connected with local
postsecondary institutions. A Project Team will coordinate the development of
curriculum and instructional materials, teacher and faculty enhancement and
creation of technical experiences for students. Each year's activities are
centered on a theme.
