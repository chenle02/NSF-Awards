Computer Science (31)

This collaborative project creates a multithreaded programming (MTP) course
targeting general-purpose multi-core processors for the senior-level and
graduate-level students in computer science and computer engineering. In order
to overcome the difficulty of teaching and learning multi-core programming,
problem-based learning (PBL) is used in this course to ease students' transition
from the single-threaded programming model to MTP. PBL-oriented course materials
are developed, including real-life multi-core programming problems, mini-
lectures, lesson plans, lab manuals, reference materials, etc. The course is
taught at the collaborating institutions in two consecutive semesters without
and with PBL, and the effectiveness of PBL is evaluated through analyzing data
collected from a variety of sources, including pre-tests and post-tests, in
depth interviews, and general evaluation forms. The project outcomes are
disseminated through websites, email lists, CDs, publication, and presentations
at professional conferences.
