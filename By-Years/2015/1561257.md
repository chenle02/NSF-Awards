The rules governing the public funding of science tend to downplay an extensive
literature in economics and finance regarding the balance of risk and return in
designing portfolios. This project develops measures that quantify the
importance of project riskiness in selecting research portfolios that
appropriately balance incremental and breakthrough scientific innovation in
order to improve social welfare. Findings speak directly to ongoing debates
about the innovativeness of the current funding system of public science funding
institutions and provide valuable insights for private research-intensive firms
in a wide range of sectors within the U.S., many of whom are currently worried
about how to maintain their scientific edge in the face of enormous investments
elsewhere in the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To estimate research portfolio
choices and the implicit weights that respondents place on various features of
those portfolios this project uses stated preference surveys and econometric
techniques designed for use with discrete choice experiments. A diverse
respondent pool - elite life scientists, mid-career life scientists, life
science postdocs, and MBA students - elucidates the role of incentives and
experience in shaping preferred allocation rules. Experimental variation in the
scarcity of research funds also provides valuable information about how
tradeoffs between risk and return are impacted by the potential scale and scope
of research projects under evaluation.
