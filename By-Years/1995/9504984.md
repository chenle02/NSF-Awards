9504984 Williams This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the Promotion
of Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Eric Williams of the Mathematics
Department, University of Minnesota Minneapolis, Minnesota. This fellowship
opportunity will enable Dr. Williams to begin a collaborative research effort
with Professor Minoru Takahashi of the Institute of Solid State Physics (ISSP)
at the University of Tokyo. The researchers propose to study integrable many
body quantum mechanical systems, in particular those for which the individual
particle numbers are not conserved. The 12-month visit by Dr. Williams will help
him to establish a personal and professional link with a leading researcher in
Japan. As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Williams will have the opportunity to
interact with researchers at the University of Tokyo, as well as contributing to
the understanding of integrable systems and physics. Therefore, this proposal
fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of
scientific knowledge through an international collaboration. ***
