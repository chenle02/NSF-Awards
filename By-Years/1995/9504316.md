Level Reasoning for Constraint Satisfaction Constraint satisfaction is an
important reasoning paradigm in artificial intelligence, with many applications,
extending to more general computing domains outside of AI. As constraint
satisfaction addresses larger and more practical problems, it will become
increasingly necessary to bring to bear advanced artificial intelligence
techniques for higher level reasoning. Higher level reasoning steps back from
the immediate need to find a solution to a problem and reasons about such
interests as: Interactive constraint satisfaction (How to acquire, update, and
explain constraint knowledge), Abstraction and reformulation (How to simplify
problems by removing constraints without trivializing them), Metaknowledge (How
to use knowledge about constraint management, substitutability of constraints,
and relation of constraints to problem structure effectively), Knowledge
compilation (Achieving efficiency by preprocessing bodies of constraints), and
Subproblem decomposition (Extraction of useful subproblems and their constraint
representations).
