9412392 Slodkowski The problems in this proposal are concerned with polynomial
convex hulls and their applications. The proposer intends to pursue his long
term interest in polynomial hulls fibered over the unit circle. he will
concentrate especially on analyzing the structure of polynomial hulls with non-
connected fibers and finding their new applications. He also plans to study weak
solutions of Levi equations in two or more dimensions and their applications to
description of polynomial hulls and envelopes of holomorphy of submanifolds of
n-dimensional complex Euclidean space. The role of mathematical analysis is to
provide qualitative, quantitative and geometric information concerning the
solutions of equations. When the equations are defined over domains in several
complex variables the approximation of functions and solutions is complicated by
the geometry of the domain. This project studies this interplay between the
complex geometry and approximation. In particular, the project will have
application to the location of extreme values of solutions to complex equations.
