Lightly reinforced concrete members are widely used in practice. In spite of
their widespread use, there has been very little research regarding the shear
capacity of these members, especially continuous members and members with
tapered webs such as joists. Limited research indicates that the shear capacity
of lightly reinforced members is below that predicted by current design
procedures. Thus, these structural components appear to have a lower margin of
safety than other components of reinforced concrete structures. The current
research will determine the shear strength of continuous, lightly reinforced
T.beams and joists. Both single web and triple web members will be tested. The
effects of flexural reinforcement ratio, degree of shear reinforcement, and load
sharing between joists will be considered. The cracking shears will be compared
with existing empirical and analytical expressions. The contribution of
concrete, shear reinforcement, dowel action and aggregate interlock to shear
strength will be estimated. Modifications to current design expressions will be
developed. The research will fill a major gap in current understanding and allow
the formulation of rational design provisions. The research will result in
improved safety for an important class for reinforced concrete structural
components.
