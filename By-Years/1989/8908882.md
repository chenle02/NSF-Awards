This ROW planning grant provides funds to allow investigation of the
feasibility of detailed U-Pb isotopic studies to determine the age and origin of
complex zircon populations in peraluminous trondhjemites in the eastern Blue
Ridge of the southern Appalachians. Results will be the basis for a proposed
study of such rocks in a belt from Virginia to Alabama.
