The principal investigators undertake studies of a variety of problems in
mechanics and biology, using techniques of nonlinear dynamical systems. The
topics include the dynamics of dissipative partial differential equations and
pattern formation in fluid systems, global dynamics of symmetric systems, knots
and orbit genealogy in three-dimensional flows, dynamics of oscillators with
slowly varying potentials, modelling of neurobiological oscillators, iterations
of one-dimensional mappings, nonlinear stability and bifurcation in Hamiltonian
and weakly damped systems. Arnold diffusion in four-dimensional symplectic maps,
and dynamics of the growth of certain plants. These topics have applications in
the design and development of "smart" materials, in aerospace (particularly
satellites and spacecraft), in the control of turbulent boundary layers,and in
biology.
