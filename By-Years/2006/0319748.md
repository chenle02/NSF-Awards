This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility of fabricating SiC based pressure sensors that function
accurately and reliably in harsh environments and at high temperatures (20-800
C). There are a number of uses for such devices, particularly in energy
conversion and Conservation applications. These innovations will enable
formation of diaphragms with precisely controlled thickness, integrated with
strain gauge sensing elements and temperature compensation sensing elements.
Phase I will also include demonstration of an innovative SiC packaging concept
for high temperature and harsh environment use, which will include materials
validation, computational analysis and testing. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;It is
anticipated that the successful demonstration of the pressure sensor chip
fabrication &lt;br/&gt;Processes, the chip module packaging concepts, and the
housing assembly design will enable &lt;br/&gt;Subsequent prototype development
and then commercialization of pressure sensors for high &lt;br/&gt;Temperature
and harsh environment applications. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
