SBR-9422485 FELDMAN In recent years there has been much popular and academic
reporting of new forms of organization of manufacturing activity. Empirical and
theoretical interest has focused on spatially concentrated clusters of companies
which operate in highly competitive, technology-intensive industries. The role
of inter-firm linkages, local labor markets, local socialization, and forms of
public and quasi-public governance have received attention, in North American,
European, and East Asian contexts. This collaborative research project (with
SBR-9504088; Schreuder, PI) uses historical, economic, and geographic approaches
to a technology-intensive industry and region that has received relatively
little attention: the pharmaceutical industry in the Philadelphia-to-New York
City corridor from the early-19th through mid-20th centuries. The main goal of
the research is to understand the circumstances, resources, and linkages that
enabled pharmaceutical firms in the Mid-Atlantic region to find competitive
advantage and to adapt, survive, and grow. The research is novel in its broad
historical perspective and methods, explicitly complementing the many recent
studies of current industrial clusters. The historical perspective allows study
of the development of social and institutional relationships, and of the ways in
which these evolving relationships influenced the market structure, technology,
and geography of the industry. Company histories, labor-market studies, and
patterns of supplier and market linkages provide the source material for
constructing the overall explanation of the development of this industry in this
region. The results of the study should add to the academic debate over the
formation and operation of industrial clusters, and should inform the national
and local policy debates over influences on industrial competitiveness.
