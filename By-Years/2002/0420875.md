0420875&lt;br/&gt;Pekar&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award to
City University of New York's Queens College provides funds for acquisition of
an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) for
research and teaching at the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences. In
addition to marine and earth science applications, it is expected that the
instrumentation will be used for research and teaching by faculty in the
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Department of Anthropology, as
well as other Queens College departments. The broader impacts of the acquisition
include the enhancement of interdisciplinary education and research, bringing
state-of-the-art research facilities and hands-on education to undergraduate and
graduate students typically underrepresented in the sciences. This proposal is
supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF.&lt;br/&gt;
