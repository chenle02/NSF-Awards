This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a
high-performance uncooled sensor to accommodate multiple spectral-band infrared
detection at high operating temperatures. The photon detector will operate in
the 3 to 5 and 8 to 10 micron spectral bands. In addition, the infrared sensor
will be fabricated out of III-V nano-semiconductor materials. The nano-material
will be composed of features, such as quantum dots and wells, and superlattices,
for intra-band photon detection and dark current suppression. That is, detector
materials and large format detector arrays will be design, constructed and
characterized.

If successful the proposed uncooled high-performance sensor will be important
for many commercial, scientific, and defense applications. In particular, the
research and development activities will directly lead to a sensor product for
high temperature operation (uncooled) and multi-color imaging. For example, the
advanced sensors will benefit many industrial applications that include:
environmental monitoring, biological and chemical detection, and medical
imaging. Based on the advanced properties of the nano-material constituents, a
number of unique detection and imaging capabilities will be realized.
