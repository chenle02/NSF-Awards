The program is an integrated research and teaching effort in the field of
Organic Photonic Materials and Plastic Optoelectronic Technologies. The proposed
research will focus on the study of charge-transfer in photorefractive polymers
and light-emission in conjugated molecules and polymers. The research will
consist of three major tasks that are highly connected. One area is the study of
electronically engineered photorefractive polymers in which the relative energy
of the frontier orbitals of the sensitizer, transport molecule, and the
chromophore are controlled and systematically varied with the goal of developing
new materials with sub-ms response times. The second area includes the
development of photorefractive polymers based on two-photon absorption
sensitizers. The third area includes fabrication, testing, and modeling of
organic electroluminescent devices based on a new generation of photo-
addressable molecules and polymers with controlled frontier orbital energies and
good photochemical stability with emphasis of developing full color displays on
plastic substrates.

A broader goal of the program is to use the proposed multidisciplinary teaching
approach as a vehicle to create equivalent curriculums in other universities and
educate students for cross-disciplinary and knowledge-based career environment
for the optoelectronics and information technology industry (specifically, low
cost, light weight, flexible optoelectronic devices).This program will sustain
and strengthen an existing partnership between scientists from several
departments including Optical Sciences, the Departments of, Chemistry, Physics,
and Materials Science and Engineering at The University of Arizona.
