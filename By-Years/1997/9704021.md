9704021 Jarell This is a renewal grant to support work on a theoretical study
and numerical simulation of strongly correlated electron materials. The specific
subjects include the high temperature superconductors, heavy fermion materials,
non- Fermi liquid metals and exotic magnetic materials. Quantum Monte Carlo
methods are combined with statistical inference to calculate the dynamical
response of the models of these systems. The study has two main objectives: The
first is to calculate, numerically and analytically, relevant properties of the
model systems as accurately as possible. The second is to explore the non-
perturbative features of these models, with the hope of finding new physical
phenomena. %%% This grant continues the support of an active and enthusiastic
young PI who is rapidly emerging as a leader in the general area of strongly
correlated electrons. This is a class of materials which have wide ranging
applications but whose properties are not as well understood, at least so far.
The class of materials include the high temperature superconductors, heavy
fermion materials, non-Fermi liquid metals and exotic magnetic materials. The
proposed research program utilizes a variety of theoretical and numerical
techniques and hopes to gain insight in to the observed properties as well as
discover new physical phenomena. ***
