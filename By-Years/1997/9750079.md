Abstract DBI 9750079 John Huelsenbeck This action funds an NSF/Alfred P. Sloan
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997. These
fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, comparative,
computational, and/or experimental analyses of biological patterns and processes
at the molecular level within the framework of organismic evolutionary change
and adaptation. These studies also include the use of molecular data to address
broader evolutionary questions. Each fellowship supports a research and training
plan to be carried out in a sponsoring laboratory. The research and training
plan for this fellowship is entitled "Testing Models of Cladogenesis in a
Phylogenetic Context." Phylogenetic trees (diagrams depicting the genealogical
relationships of species) can be used to examine the process of speciation and
extinction. This research focuses on how speciation and extinction rates can be
estimated from phylogenetic trees of living and fossil bivalves.
