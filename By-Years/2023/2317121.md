Understanding how humans learn, produce and understand speech is one of the
fundamental endeavors of cognitive science. This project investigates an often-
overlooked aspect of speech processing, namely, how we can catch and repair the
errors we make when we speak. Even though native adult speakers do not make many
speech errors, children, second-language speakers, and individuals with brain
injury do, and many of them show a remarkable ability to detect and repair their
own errors. Repairing errors is important, because without repairs,
communication can easily break down. Also, developing the ability to repair
oneâ€™s errors in a new learner, like a child or a second-language learner, is a
good signal that the learner is making progress. Yet, we know very little about
how the brain can catch and repair speech errors. We also do not know if this
ability differs between speakers of different languages. This project sheds
light on these issues.

Taking advantage of existing models of language production, we construct a
computational model which mimics how the brain may detect and repair speech
errors. We then test the predictions of this model using a large database that
we build over the lifetime of the project from over 700 native speakers of four
languages, English, French, Dutch, and Farsi. Using these data, we further
refine and fine-tune the computational model to arrive at a model that best
captures how speakers repair their speech errors. The project has two major
outcomes: (1) The largest publicly available multi-lingual database of speech
errors and repairs. (2) The first open-source computational model of speech
error repairs. Both of these will be made freely accessible to anyone in the
world who is interested in understanding or researching how humans produce
language.
