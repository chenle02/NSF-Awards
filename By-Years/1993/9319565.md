During development of the nervous system, or neurogenesis, it is possible to
trace the lineage of cells leading to adult cell types. For all cells that will
become nerve cells, or neurons, a group of genes has been identified that are
characteristically activated to express protein products . Several of these
"neuronal precursor" genes are likely to have regulatory functions during
neurogenesis. This project uses the insect Drosophila as a model system with
well-known genetics to investigate one such gene. The gene called "prospero" or
"pros" is believed to act as a regulatory gene by expressing a protein that
binds to specific regions of molecular sequences in the nuclear DNA. Molecular
techniques are used to assay the binding sites, the identification of potential
target genes, and the sequence elements required for gene regulation. Clarifying
how this key gene works to regulate neuronal lineage in early development of
Drosophila will be an important step toward understanding the molecular
processes underlying initiation and execution of neurogenesis. The results will
be fundamental to further work on regulation of neuronal differentiation and
process outgrowth, in the vertebrates as well as the invertebrates, and the
results will have an impact beyond neuroscience to developmental biology and
genetics.
