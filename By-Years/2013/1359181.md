This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience
for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities.
Professors Philippe Buhlmann and Steven R. Kass will train undergraduates from
institutions with limited research opportunities, sophomores, under-represented
minority groups, and the economically disadvantaged. These students are targeted
to lead students to consider careers in chemistry-related fields who might
otherwise have chosen different career paths. To increase the program impact and
sense of community among the participants, students are encouraged to volunteer
on weekends for an outreach program that gives children the opportunity to
perform hands-on chemistry experiments at local community libraries, many of
which are in neighborhoods with large minority
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site whose theme is "Challenges of the
21st Century" will fund ten undergraduate students per year over a period of
three years to carry out individual research projects in interdisciplinary
areas. Participants will gain research experience in a nurturing environment at
a major research university, with particular emphasis on addressing critical
challenges in environmental, materials, and biological chemistry. This broad
research exposure is supplemented with extensive mentoring and hands-on
training. Students have the opportunity to work on environmental, sustainable
and health-related chemistry problems of critical societal importance.
