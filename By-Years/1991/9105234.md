The Department of Mathematics at the Johns Hopkins University will purchase
computer equipment which will be dedicated to support research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several research projects,
including in particular: (a) A time intensive computer search for new immersions
of real projective spaces coming from bilinear maps plus a package of programs
to check conjectures in the area. (b) A continued attempt to transform unstable
Brown-Peterson operations into a working tool for algebraic topologists. (c) The
ability to compute with representations of simple algebraic groups. (d) The
computation of syzygies. (e) The day to day problems that arise in algebraic
topology, especially those related to the Steenrod algebra and Brown- Peterson
cohomology, where computations by hand take far too long and/or are too error
prone.
