In Phase I, the reliability of expert systems for structural design with
microcomputers will be evaluated, and recommendations will be made for
improvements. Among the areas to be studies for this purpose are: the
reliability of other expert design systems, self-explanatory and readily-
modifiable software, and expert system generator. In Phase I the approach will
be as follows: (1) List criteria for the reliability of structural design; (2)
investigate in detail whether (and how) existing expert systems for structural
design wiith micro-computers satisfy the criteria; (3) check other expert
systems with the reliability criteria. If they satisfy the criteria, determine
if their procedurers are applicable to structural design and microcomputers; (4)
research the related fields of self-explanatory and readily-modifiable software;
(5) review expert system generators and determine the feasibility and
reliability of expert structural software so created; (6) develop preliminary
recommendations for standards of reliability for expert systems for structural
design with microcomputers; and (7) Identify areas requiring research in Phase
II.
