Statistical agencies are pivotal in collecting and disseminating the data that
guide the health and wealth of our nation. In their mediation between
respondents and users, statistical agencies hold two mandates in tension:
provide research and policy access to data and assure confidentiality. If an
agency fails to properly disseminate data, its data collection is fruitless and
wastes taxpayers' money. If the agency fails to protect privacy of respondents,
it cannot collect quality data - because of increased nonresponse and evasive
response -- and it violates ethical norms. The objective of this research is to
develop and evaluate statistical and institutional procedures that better
provide confidentiality and data access. The work will build on accomplishments,
evidenced by published work, conference presentations, and interactions with
statistical agencies, under a current NSF grant. The expansion entails
constructing a conceptual model for research and policy access to data,
developing and evaluating options for informed consent in data sharing and
record linkage, deriving and assessing statistical disclosure limitation
procedures based on the concept of matrix masks for public use files, evaluating
other restricted access procedures such as licensing agreements, and improving
privacy control methods for sequential access to computer databases.
Establishment data will receive special attention. The proposed research will
effect a significant extension of ethical guidelines, administrative rules, and
legal specifications with respect to confidentiality and data access. The issues
addressed are becoming increasingly important not only for the individual but
for society as a whole.
