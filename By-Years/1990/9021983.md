This grant will partially support a conference on computational number theory
and combinatorics at Northern Illinois University in May, 1991. Held in honor of
John Selfridge and the contributions he has made to both these fields, the
conference topics will concern practical computing and its relationship to
mathematical research. The invited speakers will lecture on the current state of
research in these areas, and will help delineate future research directions and
stimulate the research of investigators, especially young mathematicians,
working in these areas.
