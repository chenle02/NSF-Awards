The long range goal of the proposed work is to understand the nature and
mechanism of regulatory genes that inversely affect the expression of the white
eye color gene. It is believed that this type of regulatory effect is involved
in the expression of most types of structural genes. The four currently known
inverse regulators of white will be precisely localized, genetically and
cytologically, via x-ray and P element mutagenesis as a prelude to molecular
cloning. Cloning of two of these genes will reveal their nature and provide the
means to address the molecular mechanism of action on white by sequence
analysis, in vitro binding tests and genetic dosage studies with transformed
copies. Each of the four inverse regulators, individually as well as in
combinations, will be tested for an effect upon white mRNA levels in
developmental profiles, as well as for a coordinate response from scarlet and
brown, which cooperate with white in pigment deposition. Each will be tested for
an effect on a white promoter-reporter construct to examine the requirement of
the w promoter. A refined functional analysis of the white promoter will be
conducted to better localize the sites required for interaction with the four
regulators. This analysis will be conducted by deletion and site directed
mutagenesis of the promoter, which will then be placed driving the alcohol
dehydrogenase structural gene. These constructs will be tested to determine the
four inverse regulators and examine the context within which these regions work.
The proposed experiments will contribute to an understanding of the inverse
regulation phenomenon and address whether there is a connection between such
regulatory genes and the biological phenomena associated with chromosomal dosage
such as compensation, the inverse effect, aneuploid syndromes, and position
effect variegation.*** //
