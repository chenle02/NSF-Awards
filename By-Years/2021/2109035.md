This project funds the ongoing operation of the Parallel Imager for Southern
Cosmology Observations (PISCO), a fast, general-purpose imaging photometer in
Chile. The South Pole Telescope (SPT) consortium is conducting the SPT-3G deep
millimeter-wave continuum survey, which is detecting thousands of previously
unknown galaxy clusters and groups. PISCO observations play a key role in the
production of an extensive catalog of galaxy clusters over about 9% of the sky.
The resulting searchable public database will include imaging as well as
spectroscopy in the optical, infrared, and X-ray, contributing to a wide variety
of scientific studies. This project also funds the operation and maintenance of
a MicroObservatory telescope for remote STEM education and outreach, operated as
part of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatoryâ€™s Science Education Department
Robotic Telescope Network for the online STEM learning
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will produce photometric and
spectroscopic catalogs of volume-complete samples of galaxy clusters over a 4000
square degree area of sky. After analyzing candidate cluster positions in
existing survey data such as DES and VISTA, the SPT team will: (1) make the
additional photometric imaging observations needed for completeness in redshift
and mass limit, (2) obtain weak lensing measurements during periods of excellent
seeing for a representative sub-sample of these clusters, (3) make these
evolving data sets available to the astronomical and STEM learning communities
in both raw and reduced form, through publications and a web-accessible,
searchable archive, and (4) analyze the data for cosmology and the determination
of neutrino properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
