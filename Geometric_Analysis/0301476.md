String theory is one of the most challenging and interesting fields in both
mathematics and physics. Widely considered the most promising approach to
formulating a complete unified model of physics at the most fundamental level,
it has also spawned many ideas in pure mathematics. The original idea of string
theory was that all fundamental constituents of the universe were open or closed
loops of string. It has become increasingly clear that this formulation of the
theory is incomplete in essential ways. One of the missing pieces is the
phenomenon known as "D-branes", which naively appear to be geometric objects of
various dimensions: points, strings, membranes, and so on, which coexist with
the fundamental strings of the theory.

A satisfactory mathematical framework for studying these D-branes, and an
understanding of their physical nature, are lacking. In this project,
mathematical techniques from algebra and geometry will be used to uncover the
concepts required for a precise definition of these D-branes. The researchers
will develop new mathematical tools, as needed, as well as apply existing
mathematical tools to attack this problem. The physical nature of D-branes in
non-trivial backgrounds will also be investigated in detail, using methods from
quantum field theory and insights from supergravity. The insights gained from
the study of D-branes will be applied back to the physics of gauge theory and
string theory, as well.
