Investigations will continue into mental tools for developing concurrent and
distributed programs. Some of that work is concerned with the semantics and
verification of concurrent and distributed programs; other work, with
identifying abstractions for fault-tolerant, real-time, distributed systems. A
new approach that has been developed for verifying temporal properties of
programs will be extended. Previously, this approach could not adequately handle
properties specified by non-deterministic Buchi automata. This restriction will
be relaxed. Extension from a posteriori verification to a program development
methodology will also be investigated. An attempt will be made to narrow the gap
between the theory and practice of fault-tolerant distributed system design by
using and identifying helpful abstractions. Using the state machine approach, a
prototype control program for a real-time process control and application will
be constructed. Optimization of fundamental protocols for agreement and clock
synchronization will be attempted based on exploiting properties of the
environment and application being controlled. New, asynchronous, clock
synchronization protocols will be investigated. Finally, techniques for
programming using values obtained from approximately synchronized clocks will be
studied.
