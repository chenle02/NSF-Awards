Support is requested for a symposium on the development of the vascular system,
to be held in Madison, Wisconsin on April 23-26, 1989. The object of this
symposium is to define the contemporary questions and chart the principal
directions of future research in the field. This symposium will bring together,
for the first time, a group of junior and senior investigators from the basic
and clinical sciences to examine the field of vascular development. The events
underlying the development of the vascular system are central to our
understanding of pathologic and reparative angiogenesis, of would healing, of
regulatory mechanisms during morphogenesis, of the mechanisms by which many
teratogenic changes are induced during development. %%% The field of
angiogenesis is undergoing rapid development and change. This is the first
meeting devoted exclusively to this topic and will bring together investigators
with differing backgrounds who are studying similar problems.
