This proposal will provide equipment to augment and upgrade an existing cluster
of Lisp workstations used for Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. Research
includes work on (1) common-sense problem solving using case-based reasoning, an
attempt to fit outcomes of prior planning-execution episodes to the present
situtation, (2) robust natural language interfaces to expert reasoning systems
that can cope with realistic user inputs and express the reasoning system's
questions and conclusions fluently, and (3) intelligent advisory systems that
interact with users to provide advice for decision support in areas such as
trouble shooting and design. The award will enhance the capability of Georgia
Tech to perform mainstream research in important areas of computer science.
