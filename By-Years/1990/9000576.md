This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of Dr.
Larry K. Blair at Berea College, who is investigating the chemistry of new
positive halogen reagents. These studies should lead to new reagents with
desirable handling properties for organic synthesis. The experiments to be
carried out by Dr. Blair will be aimed at developing new bromine and iodine
reagents that have useful properties as oxidizing agents and halogenation
reagents. Complexes to be investigated include bis(amine) complexes of bromine
and iodine monocations, amine complexes of molecular bromine and iodine, and
amine complexes of N-bromo and N-iodoimides. The complexes will be characterized
by X-ray crystallography and by NMR and UV-Vis spectroscopy. These spectroscopic
techniques will also be used to study the dynamics of ligand exchange in the
complexes.
