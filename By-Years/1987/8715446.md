Dr. Eric Herbst at Duke University is considered one of the founders and leading
experts in the field of astrochemistry. In his current research effort, Dr.
Herbst will continue a program of theoretical modelling of dense interstellar
clouds in which he will incorporate new constituent molecules and the effects of
dust grains. Dr. Herbst will also try to understand in detail the individual gas
phase processes that occur inside dense interstellar clouds. Primarily through
observations at radio wavelengths, observers have detected the presence of more
than seventy different molecules in the vast regions of space that lie between
the stars. The existence of these molecules has stimulated a large research
effort directed towards understanding why the molecules are present and how they
are produced. The objective of Dr. Herbst's theoretical research is to better
understand the chemistry of this aspect of the interstellar medium.
