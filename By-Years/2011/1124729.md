This award provides funds to the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR)
for a long-standing program of travel assistance to qualified and active
oceanographic researchers from developing countries and nations with economies
in transition. SCOR travel grants are awarded to enable such individuals to
attend international meetings relevant to their scientific interests and to
those of SCOR and the Division of Ocean Sciences of NSF. This ongoing project
has become the cornerstone of SCOR's efforts to provide assistance to marine
scientists in the third world and, more recently in Russia and Eastern Europe.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impacts of this
activity extend beyond the ocean sciences into other scientific topics by
stimulating scientific progress in developing countries. In many cases, personal
connections and collaborations that can result from contacts made through these
travel grants can have long-lasting effects both in international activities as
well as in the developing country?s science communities as the individuals
involved rise through the ranks of science and science policy.
