Award number: 0228784&lt;br/&gt;PI: Devendra P. Garg &lt;br/&gt;Institution:
Duke University&lt;br/&gt;Title: A Multi-Sensor Fused Intelligent Biomemetic
Microrobot&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes an in-depth analytical investigation,
design, and development of an innovative and unconventional multi-sensor-fused
architecture for a biomimetic microrobot. This device would derive its
inspiration from nature and integrate the physical and biological
characteristics of several insects. The microrobot would prove to be a great
asset for applications in a variety of scientific and engineering systems that
acquire, process, and integrate information gathered from multiple knowledge
sources. Specific examples of capabilities to be included are the visual,
auditory, proximity, olfactory, and communication faculties. The proposed
architecture and the microrobot could be gainfully employed for reconnaissance
and information retrieval in unstructured and uncertain environments. An example
of such a situation is that presented by the terrorist attacks on September 11,
2001. Other crucial tasks that the proposed microrobot could perform include
that of surveillance and target acquisition. The operation of the microrobot
would be remote; hence the communication protocol would be wire-free. In
addition to developing a sound mathematical basis, the proposed microrobot
architectures functioning and performance will be verified via exhaustive
computer simulations, building a prototype microrobot, and validating the
results by exposing the microrobot to a variety of unstructured environments
during laboratory experiments.&lt;br/&gt;
