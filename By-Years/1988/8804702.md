The purpose of this work is to present a new model for electrolyte solutions by
adding contributions for long-range charge-charge interactions (Henderson, 1983)
to Perturbed-Anisotropic-Chain theory (PACT) (Vimalchand, 1985, 1986) which
takes short-range molecule- molecule interactions into account. Since dielectric
constants used in the primitive model are only for solvation effects caused by
charge-molecule interactions near ions, additional terms for the interactions of
ions with molecules in the bulk of the solution (i.e. those not solvated) are
derived and included in the theory as well. Electrolyte Solutions, especially
aqueous electrolyte solutions, are common in the environment, living organisms,
and industrial processes. Their thermodynamic properties play an important role
in separation, fermentation and purification processes in numerous industries.
Therefore, interest in the prediction of thermodynamic properties of electrolyte
solutions has grown over the past decade.
