9314853 Housner This award supports a two-year cooperative research project
between Professor George Housner, California Universities for Research in
Earthquake Engineering (CUREe), and Professor Yutaka Inoue, Department of
Architectural Engineering, Osaka University. The award supports the travel of
U.S. scientists on the U.S. Panel on Structural Control Research to Japan to
meet with the counterpart Japanese panel to plan, coordinate, promote, and
conduct research in the field of monitoring and control of civil infrastructure
systems. The joint efforts will also provide a detailed research agenda that
will be the foundation for future U.S.-Japan cooperative research projects. The
active control of seismic response of structures can be described as a system to
modify from one instant to the next the dynamic responses in buildings or civil
structures induced by an unknown external seismic disturbance. This is
accomplished by providing control forces to counteract the seismic motions, or
by changing the dynamic properties of the structure so as to reduce the effect
of the ground shaking. To achieve the foregoing, the theory and analytical
methods that will form the basis of seismic control must be established, and a
comprehensive step-by-step research program is necessary to examine various
methods and systems regarding performance and practical application to
structures. Direction and coordination of research in this field in a key
requirement for an effective R&amp;D program. U.S.-Japan cooperation in a
continuing exchange of information will lead to new developments and directions
for research. ***
