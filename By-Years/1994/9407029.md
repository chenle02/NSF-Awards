9407029 TRANGENSTEIN Advances in computer hardware have greatly extended the
predictive capability of reservoir simulators. Even with current gigaflop
performance, however, the capabilities of the machines executing state-of-the-
art algorithms are still far below the needs; in order to reduce the risk in
planning projects, the petroleum industry needs much greater computational power
in order to make improved predictions of reservoir performance. Further advances
can come by introducing sophisticated algorithmic techniques, such as adaptive
local grid refinement and parallel processing. In this postdoctoral research
program, we propose to extend adaptive local grid refinement techniques,
currently being developed at Duke University for micellar- polymer flooding, to
compositional reservoir simulation. We also propose to investigate the
parallelization of this algorithm on a network of IBM RS6000 workstations at
Mobil Exploration and Production Technical Center.
