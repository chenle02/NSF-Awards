The eventual goal of this project is to describe the flow of gases through the
lung. The specific objective of the proposed research is to characterize
experimentally the axial and secondary flows in a model of bifurcating tubes
that is dynamically similar to the human airways. The flows will be determined
using laser-Doppler velocimetry at frequencies of normal breathing and also at
frequencies used for high-frequency ventilation. This basic engineering research
is an important first step toward a comprehensive description of flows in the
entire lung. Such a description will lead to improved basic understanding, and
eventually should also result in improved diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
