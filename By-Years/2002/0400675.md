This grant provides partial support for the acquisition of a confocal laser
scanning microscope (CLSM) with spectral imaging capabilities. The award is made
to Illinois State University (ISU) under the direction of Dr. Kevin Edwards. The
microscope will be employed by a number of investigators for diverse research
projects in cell and developmental biology, including: (1) the roles of
conserved tyrosine phosphatases in cell signaling and development, (2) the
effects of an ankyrin mutation on C. elegans neural development, (3) genetic
dissection of the molecular processes that control directional growth of plant
cells, (4) the development of novel microprobe-based cell imaging techniques,
(5) the distribution of dopamine neurons in brain tissue in a rat Parkinson
Disease model, (6) the investigation of the evolution of cell division in
plants, (7) the role of ion transport proteins in the adaptation of fish to
osmotic changes, and (8) the investigation of the endocrine regulation of
follicle cell shape changes during insect reproduction.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The confocal microscope will be part of a multi-user
facility, and will strengthen the infrastructure required to promote several of
ISU's key missions: increased retention of undergraduates in research,
enhancement of diversity in science, and strengthening K-12 science teaching.
ISU serves a large pool of students who may have had little previous exposure to
current scientific tools. Also, this instrument will be the nearest confocal
microscope for Illinois Wesleyan Univ., Millikin Univ, Knox College, University
of Illinois College of Medicine-Peoria, and the Peoria USDA-ARS facility, and
thus will provide new research and training opportunities for those
institutions.&lt;br/&gt;
