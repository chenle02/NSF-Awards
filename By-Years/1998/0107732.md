Professor Jonathan L. Sessler in the Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry
at the University of Texas at Austin is supported by the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies on novel polypyrrolic
macrocycles that differ from naturally occurring tetrapyrrolic systems by virtue
of being "pyrrole-inverted" or topographically non-planar. The preparation of
these new materials and the study of their basic chemical properties, including
those associated with anion complexation, cation coordination, and ability to
stabilize unusual oxidation states, will be
undertaken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Jonathan Sessler is studying the
interactions between ions and polycyclic organic compounds which function as
receptors for them. Potential analytical and medical applications for these
polypyrrolic materials are anion sensing and purification, radioactive waste
remediation, or as fluorescent markers for the diagnosis of neoplastic or
cardiovascular disease.
