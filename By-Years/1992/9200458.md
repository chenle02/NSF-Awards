Microbial populations at deep-sea hydrothermal vents link the transfer of
geothermal energy to the production of organic carbon, known as chemosynthesis.
As the particulate organic food source for the filter-feeding and grazing vents
animals, free-living bacteria function as the chemosynthetic base of the food
chain for this part of the vent communities. During the continuation of the
RIDGE Initiative, this project will focus on those bacteria from hydrothermal
vents. Dr. Jannasch will address the question - which chemosynthetic bacteria
are quantitatively the most important in terms of productivity at hydrothermal
vents? To answer this question, newly-developed techniques will be used to
assess aerobic and anaerobic chemosynthetic bacteria at a large variety of vent
environments. Rates of growth and chemosynthesis will be measured by a variety
of in situ and laboratory experiments. It's assumed that these natural microbial
populations are highly responsive to environmental conditions and, therefore,
representative of temporal geophysical-geochemical changes of vent systems. Work
at the Mid- Atlantic Ridge vent sites will deal with new approaches for in situ
rate measurements of chemosynthetic activity by microbial populations covering
the polymetal sulfide deposits. In addition, work is also planned for the
Guaymas Basin Beggiatoa mats. These studies will involve the use of two
submersibles, the ALVIN and JASON/MEDEA.//
