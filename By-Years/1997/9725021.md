Biomolecular Computation (BMC) is an area of great potential due to the massive
parallelism available at the molecular scale. However, a realistic assessment
must also take into account that research in this area possesses considerable
risk, due to its lack of maturity. This is a multi-group effort encompassing
several groups within the United States working on BMC. The goal of this project
is to organize the energies of these groups so as to harness a collective
accomplishments that may exceed the individual efforts. This project will
emphasize collaborative development of the infrastructure in support of BMC, to
further develop and test its basic capabilities. The groups will investigate key
aspects of BMC. These will include: Demonstrations of BMC. The key subtakes are:
word design; register design for storage and retrieval of logical and numeric
information; execution of basic operations such as logical and arithmetric
operations, and the sequential chaining of these operations; input of data and
readout of results and interfacing with silicon-based computers; and methods to
improve error resiliency. Nano-construction of New 3D Structures. Applications
of BMC. This will include: biological applications exploration and
demonstrations of intractable NP search problems solution of analog problems
Software Tools. For simulation, design and associated mathematical models.
