9612339 De Alba This action is to support a small workshop to examine how the
value of the full-scale earthquake engineering experiment at Treasure Island,
California, might further be enhanced. Treasure Island, an artificial island in
San Francisco Bay, California, approaches ideal conditions for a full-scale
field experiment to study the response of soft ground during strong earthquake
shaking. It is located between the San Andreas and Hayward faults, on which a
magnitude 7 or greater earthquake is expected to occur within the next thirty
years, with a probability greater than 67%. The major instrumented site on the
island, which is one of the National Geotechnical Experimentation Sites, is
located on 300 feet of soil, including 40 feet of hydraulic fill sand, underlain
by soft to hard clays. It is adjacent to Yerba Buena island, a rock outcrop,
thus permitting motions of the rock outcrop, deep bedrock, and soil to be
measured and compared. Currently, instrumentation at the "fire station" site on
Treasure Island includes six accelerometers in a vertical array between bedrock
and the ground surface, as well as six piezometers in the upper potentially-
liquefiable hydraulic fill. The installation of these instruments (completed in
1993) was accompanied by an extensive site characterization program. Support for
the Treasure Island National Geotechnical Experimentation Site has been a
collaboration between the U.S. Navy, National Science Foundation, Federal
Highway Administration, U.S. Geological Survey, California Division of Mines and
Geology, Electric Power Research Institute and the University of California at
Davis. The major questions to be addressed by this workshop are: What is the
best use of strong motion information so as to improve or create models to
predict the behavior of soft soils under strong ground motion? What additional
site information is required? The goal of this workshop is to assure that all
the major pieces of information are in pla ce at the time of the next major
earthquake, so that the data obtained can quickly and efficiently be used by
researchers, and thus lead to rapid development of improved techniques for
predicting the behavior of soft soils under strong ground shaking. ***
