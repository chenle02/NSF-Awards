PROPOSAL NO.: 0230625&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Ellis,
Glenn&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: Smith College&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Building an
Engineering Education Partnership&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br
/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building an Engineering and Education
Partnership&lt;br/&gt;Smith College Proposal to Bridges for Engineering
Education, &lt;br/&gt;NSF-02-092&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Smith College Picker
Engineering Program, Department of Education and Child Study, and Office of
Educational Outreach propose to build upon an innovative partnership they have
already established to enhance the quality and expand the reach of engineering
education preK-16. The first goal is to integrate engineering into the Smith
Department of Education and Child Study program by a) developing a certification
program in technology/engineering, and b) designing a certificate program for
elementary school engineering education. The second goal is to develop best
educational practices in the Picker Engineering Program by expanding the role of
an expert educator in the curriculum development process. The third goal is to
enhance engineering educational outreach at Smith College by developing
engineering education teacher resources and by expanding the engineering
education course for teachers. These goals respond to national calls for science
education reform (preK-12) and for the integrating engineering education into
the preK-12 curriculum; to the call for engineering education reform at the
college and university level; and, to the grave need to recruit and retain women
and underrepresented minorities in science, engineering, and technology fields
in our nation's workforce. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
