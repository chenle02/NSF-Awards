This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research on human control of
body posture involves the research groups of Thomas A. Stoffregen at the
University of Cincinnati and Reinoud Bootsma at the Universite de la Mediteranee
in Marseille, France. The award provides travel support to Professor Stoffregen
and his graduate students. The objective of the research is to study the
relationship between vision and posture and between posture and simultaneous,
`supra-postural' behaviors, such as looking or reaching. The proposed
experiments are developed from a theory that argues that postural control will
be strongly influenced by the goals of simultaneous, supra-postural behavior.
These experiments take advantage of unique approaches using a videographic
projection system developed by the Marseille group and a moving room developed
by the Cincinnati group. The research will advance fundamental understanding of
neurological equilibrium or posture deficits.
