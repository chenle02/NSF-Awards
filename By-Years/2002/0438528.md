This award is to the Michigan Technological University to support the activity
described below for 36 months. The proposal was submitted in response to the
Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-04556).

Partners The partners include Michigan Technological University (Lead
Institution), Michigan Tech Enterprise Corporation; Knowledge Sharing Systems,
Inc. the Cities of Houghton and Hancock, Michigan, Finlandia University, and the
Michigan Economic Development Corporation.

The primary objective is to create a rural entrepreneurial culture that captures
the economic and social benefits of innovation. A three-pronged initiative will
build on the existing infrastructure and on current endeavors to foster economic
development by state and local governments and by Michigan Technological
University. First, this project will offer an education component that adapts
Michigan Technological Universitys highly regarded engineering Enterprise
program to a new entrepreneurial Enterprise. This program will involve science,
engineering, and business undergraduate students working as teams with real-
world entrepreneurs to conduct and integrate technology and market assessments
with business plan development for proposed or emerging potentially high-growth
entrepreneurial industries. Second, this project will strengthen the
interconnectedness and support among the local entrepreneurial community through
networking and mentorship programs that develop linkages with the MTU community
of faculty, staff, and students. Third, this project will support technology
commercialization activities by increasing and improving access to university
expertise, facilities, and equipment.

Potential Economic Impact

The intellectual merit of the project will result from creation of a thriving
and vibrant entrepreneurial culture that creates and increases new wealth within
the local and regional economies of Michigan's western Upper Peninsula, in
Houghton County, Michigan.

The broader impacts of the activity concentrate on providing the infrastructure
for rural regions to participate in technology-based innovation, especially in
regions that are underrepresented and underserved in the economy. This project
will be replicable in similar rural settings across the United States.
