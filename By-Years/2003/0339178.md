Under prospect theory, a person's satisfaction derived from a gain or loss is
calculated as a deviation from that person's status quo wealth reference point.
However over time each gain or loss has the potential to alter the reference
point as the individual adapts to the change in wealth. Our pilot data suggest
that people adapt their reference points more readily to gains than to losses.
The quicker adaptation to gains leads to immediate gratification from mentally
assimilating those gains, but dissatisfaction with subsequent gains, which feel
less impressive relative to the new, elevated reference point. The slower
adaptation to losses reduces immediate misery by deferring the assimilation of
the new, lower wealth level, but also decreases the satisfaction associated with
future gains or losses. Our proposal is designed to investigate individuals'
readiness to adapt to gains versus losses, the factors that influence
adaptation, and the means by which adaptation occurs. &lt;br/&gt;Questionnaires
and a new experimental auction design with real monetary payoffs will be used to
identify the location of reference points and their movements after gains or
losses. We will also continue research we have already begun in which we have
tested our predictions about reference point adaptation using actual trading
data from United States brokerage houses.&lt;br/&gt;Researchers have recently
discovered that some anomalous price patterns are present in American financial
markets are absent in Asian markets, and conversely. Also, risk preferences and
styles of information processing have been shown to differ in Asian and Western
cultures. In addition to collecting data in the United States, we will perform
experiments in Korea and China to explore whether cultural differences influence
reference point adaptation, which in turn may contribute to differences across
countries in the behavior of stock returns.&lt;br/&gt;
