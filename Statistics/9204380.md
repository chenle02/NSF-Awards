This project will examine robust regression procedures for multiple linear
regression and for nonlinear regression. In the first case, methods will be
developed for the exact computations of least median of squares estimators. The
theory and computation will be extended to the case when responses are
arbitrarily censored; and bootstrap methods will be used to generate confidence
intervals. In the case of nonlinear regression, the project will focus on
determining the robustness of MM-estimation, which has been shown to be robust
in the linear case. Predictions are often calculated from data using regression
functions, which relate the value of the observation of interest to values of
other features or attributes. Traditional computations used to derive the
regression function itself are vulnerable to fairly rare but quite aberrant
single data points (outliers). More robust alternative methods reduce the impact
of individual unusual or bizarre data points; hence these methods should give
more stable predictions.
