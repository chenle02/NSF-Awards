SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanic hot spots leave trails of volcanoes that
can be interpreted in terms of tectonic plate motion. The motion of the Pacific
Plate is most prominently reflected in the Hawaiian/Emperor seamount chain with
a characteristic bend at about 42 Ma. The timing of this change based on dating
of rocks is almost 10 million years younger than the age calculated from marine
magnetic anomalies, and it has been suggested that the Hawaiian hot spot may
have moved with respect to other hot spots. The Gilbert Ridge and the Tokelau
seamount chain display a similar bend at their southern terminations, and offer
an opportunity to improve our accuracy of absolute Pacific Plate motion and to
test for the validity of the fixed hot spot concept. This project will dredge
rocks from these seamount chains and date samples by 40 Ar/39 Ar isotopic
methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
