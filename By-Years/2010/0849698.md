The NSF S-STEM program at the University of Texas-El Paso provides scholarship
support and student development activities for 104 outstanding students majoring
in engineering. This effort involves multi-prong recruiting strategies involving
high school counselors, alumni, industry personnel, students, and faculty. Also,
this program pairs students with faculty mentors and makes research
opportunities available to scholars. Additionally, project efforts are designed
to decrease the traditional amount of time that it takes to produce high quality
Hispanic engineers.
