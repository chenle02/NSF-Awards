Nonparametric function estimation is the representation of "noisy" data by a
satisfactory smooth function without having to make restrictive assumptions
about the function beforehand. The solution lies between artistically connecting
all the data points and inadvertently smoothing out salient features of the
data. This research will investigate possible definitions of the appropriate
balance point between these extremes. Since many functions which differ only
slightly may all appear to be satisfactory, definitions of boundaries for
"satisfactory function" will also be sought. In addition, corrective techniques
will be devised for technical problems with estimation using data near the
boundaries of the observable (observed) values.
