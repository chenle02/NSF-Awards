This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
yeast strains to efficiently catalyze the conversion of cellulose to ethanol.
Current technology requires the addition of purified cellulase enzymes to
convert cellulose to glucose, which is then fermented to alcohol by the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The proposed research intends to make three
significant improvements over the existing technology : (1) Use of a high
temperature tolerant yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus to effect a very efficient
fermentation, (2) Expression of genes encoding cellulase in the fermenting
yeast, and 3) Isolation and selection of the yeast and the cellulase genes from
the cellulosic waste specifically for optimal performance.

The commercial applications of this project are in the reduction of cellulose
waste material produced by agriculture and industry, and in the production of a
cost effective fuel grade ethanol.
