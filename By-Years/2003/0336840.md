Friction experiments, where the applied shear force required to produce slip
between normally planar rock surfaces, are designed to simulate displacement
observed on natural faults. One difficulty that arises in the interpretation of
experimental results is the problem of scale: the size of the samples is
measured in centimeters, whereas natural faults are many kilometers in length
and depth; and the disparity in the scales of time that are characteristic of
natural and laboratory processes is as great.

Walsh is studying ways to bridge the gap caused by the disparity in time and
length scales by developing theoretical models which simulate behavior observed
experimentally. He is now studying slip between rough elastic surfaces where
slip, opposed by Coulomb friction, occurs on the microscale at the contacts
between asperities. This analysis, which has immediate application to sliding
experiments in the laboratory, is the basis for the analysis of earthquake
faulting, where 'roughness' of lab samples is equivalent to heterogeneity in the
normal stress and shear stress fields at the fault interface. The study can be
modified by introducing more complicated frictional behavior, such as the rate-
state model, now being studied in several laboratories.
