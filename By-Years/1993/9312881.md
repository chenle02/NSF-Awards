9312881 Montonye This proposal, from SPIE -- The International Society for
Optical-- Engineering, will provide support for SPIE's efforts in the Former
Soviet Union (FSU). SPIE's activities will enhance FSU communications potential
with the establishment of a printing and distribution capability for scientific
journals and newsletters, and the installation of electronic mail and a bulletin
board capability in the chapter's Moscow headquarters. The goal of this SPIE
program is to promote scientific interchange between U.S. scientists and their
counterparts in the FSU, and to establish and foster a capability for optics-
related scientists and scientific groups within the FSU to network and
communicate, and to form and expand alliances within a professional society
framework for their common benefit. ***
