The PI will continue his observational search for evidence of asteroids
accreting onto white dwarfs, which is motivated by previously observed abundance
anomalies in white dwarf spectra. He will use the Keck Observatory to obtain
spectra of disks around white dwarfs that he and a graduate student will
analyze. The results will be used to constrain models of planetary formation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is likely to have broader impacts to fields of
cosmochemistry, planetary science and stellar evolution. This project will also
help train a graduate student in research who is participating in an outreach
program with China.
