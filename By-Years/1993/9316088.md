9316088 Plummer This award will partially support travel costs associated with
the visits by Professor Michael Plummer of the Department of Mathematics at
Vanderbilt University to conduct collaborative work with Prof. Derek Allan
Holton and Dr. Robert Aldred of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at
the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand and with Prof. Louis Caccetta
from the Curtin University of Technology in Perth, Australia. The proposed work
is in the areas of matching extension and cyclability in graphs. Both concepts
admit immediate translation to problems involving communications networks. Dr.
Plummer will spend one month with Dr. Caccetta on joint research on matching
extension. Matching in a graph is a set of independent edges with no two of
these edges sharing a common vertex. The concept is finding increased
utilization in mathematical applications. The proposer will then spend two
months working with the investigators in New Zealand. This group has developed
valuable expertise on cyclic connectivity and symmetry of graphs. This
collaborative activity draws together the work in both Australia and New Zealand
with that of the American investigator.
