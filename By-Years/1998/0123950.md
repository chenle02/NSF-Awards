The rapid development of wireless communications technologies and their impact
on everyday life has greatly increased over the last couple of years. But, the
traditional client/server architecture, where the client relies completely on
the server for information, is not useful in the wireless environment, as the
server is often not reachable because it is not connected.

The proposal focuses on the development of wireless communications technologies
and plans to design, develop and implement a "client/proxy/server system" in
which a client-side proxy assumes the role of a local server during the
disconnections.

Preliminary work shows that the approach has great potential to improve data
access, computation and service. The targeted application areas include distance
learning, fast mobile Internet as well as 3rd and 4th generation wireless
cellular networks.
