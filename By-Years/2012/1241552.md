The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) is organizing and
coordinating the logistics for the 2013 and 2014 Grantees Meetings of the STEM
Talent Expansion Program (STEP). These annual meetings bring together Principal
Investigator (PI) teams for all STEP projects to exchange ideas, to share
progress reports and information about proven practices, and to examine,
collectively, issues of STEM retention and degree attainment. The intellectual
merit of this project lies in its "meta-level" examination of the general
benefits of such community building activities in furthering the aims of the
STEP program. For example, the project team is assessing the impact of the
content and logistics of the STEP Grantees meeting on program objectives such
as: i) increasing awareness of promising practices and promoting their
adaptation and use; ii) building and sustaining communities of interest (among
faculty, administrators, and community leaders) able to implement, refine, and
innovate promising practices; and iii) catalyzing wide-scale action toward
undergraduate STEM education innovation by communities of interest that
transform into communities of practice beyond individual departments or
campuses. Simultaneously, the project is exercising broad impact by identifying
strategies that enhance the widespread use of the most effective education
practices, which in turn inform efforts to strengthen the robustness of the
Nation's STEM workforce and lay the foundation for its global competitiveness.
