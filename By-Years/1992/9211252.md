Chemical studies of secondary metabollities from fungal sclerotia will be
studied. Sclerotia are key physiological structures vital to the survival and
propagation of many fungal species. Ecological considerations and circumstantial
evidence suggest that sclerotia may contain new antiinsectan metabolites not
found in other fungal tissues. The occurrence of sclerotial metabolites that
deter feeding by fungivorous insects would be very significant to fungal
chemical ecology. Sclerotial extracts will be tested for effects against both
ecologically relevant and agriculturally important insects. A pool of
antiinsectan extracts is already available. Active metabolites will be isolated
by chromatographic methods, and identified using modern spectroscopic
techniques. Experiments will be performed to determine whether these compounds
are concentrated in the sclerotia. Investigations will also be extended to
include related fungal bodies (i.e., ascostromata). These studies will provide
insight into fundamentally significant, rarely-studied aspects of fungal
secondary metabolism, and will permit further exploration of this unique source
of new antiinsectan natural products. %% With this award, the Organic Synthesis
Program will support the research of Dr. James B. Gloer at the University of
Iowa. Dr. Gloer will focus his research on a specialized tissue structure of
fungi, the sclerotia, as a source of new natural products that may have
antiinsectan activity. This has the potential to benefit research in
biochemistry and agriculture as well as in the chemical industry.
