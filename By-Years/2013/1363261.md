The objective of this award is to develop novel dynamic pricing models that take
into account pertinent, empirically validated consumer behaviors. Building upon
empirical data from industrial partners and open databases, we plan to construct
accurate and tractable demand models that are amenable to pricing optimization.
Specifically, we will explore demand models that incorporate consumers' memory-
based reference prices under dynamic pricing. We will then use these demand
models to build pricing optimization models that take into account a variety of
complex practical operation constraints. The project's demand models and
decision models range from single products to multiple products, from durable
products to perishable products, and from deterministic settings to stochastic
settings. Developing advanced analytical techniques and efficient algorithms by
exploiting the special structures of these models will be essential to this
project. If successful, this research will lead both to novel and comprehensive
analytical models and to advanced methodologies and efficient algorithms that
may be used to attack the resulting challenging non-smooth, non-convex
optimization problems. These models, methodologies, and algorithms will be
critical for the development of the much needed decision support systems to
improve companies' competitive advantages. Preliminary research demonstrates
that memory-based reference price models result in complex price dynamics and
raise a host of challenging yet practical research questions that the existing
literature does not yet address. The novel theory and techniques we expect to
develop will not only successfully address these questions, but will also be
useful in other research areas such as dynamic systems.
