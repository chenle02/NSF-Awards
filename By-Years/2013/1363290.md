The award supports the attendance of students to the 20th Annual IEEE
International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2014),
to be hosted on February 15-19th, 2014 in Orlando, Florida. The HPCA Symposium,
a top-tier conference on computer architecture related research, has enjoyed a
rich history of success. The research results presented at HPCA conferences have
shown strong impacts in this research field and are highly regarded among the
computer architecture community. Students have much to gain from attending HPCA
such as learning state-of-the-art methodologies, being exposed to novel
techniques, and interacting with senior researchers in their chosen area of
expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of formal verification is
becoming widely accepted. Increasing the attendance of students in HPCA will
expose more students to the exciting developments in the field and in the long
run will help to build a broad base of expertise in the field, which will impact
both industry and academia.
