This project provides continuing support for a series of Interdisciplinary
Conferences in Applied Mathematics conducted by the Society for Industrial and
Applied Mathematics (SIAM). The conferences are designed to bring together
mathematical scientists, engineers, and other scientists who are developing and
applying new mathematical concepts, methods, and algorithms. The primary
objective of the conferences is to encourage fruitful interaction among the
creators and users of the mathematical sciences and thereby contribute to
understanding of the mathematical sciences and their applications to the
solution of significant problems in industry and society. A second objective is
to encourage the participation of students, women, and minority groups in this
interaction. The conferences under the previous award were particularly
successful in this respect - nearly 18% of the attendees were students and 10%
of the attendees were women - although SIAM recognizes that much more can be
done in these areas. The award supports four conferences per year for three
years.
