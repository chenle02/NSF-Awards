9730411 Robinson This project is to develop, test and distribute nine
interactive biology learning programs that are designed to use Web-based CD-ROMs
("Web-on-a-Disc"), and have accompanying activity sets and teacher guides.
Inquiry-based activities are based on light microscope images that lead to a
wealth of images from electron microscopy (Scanning Electron Microscopy SEM and
Transmission Electron Microscopy TEM ), laser confocal microscopy, fluorescence
microscopy and laser flow cytometry. The goal is to use these microscope and
research technologies, that are so often used in experimental biological
research, to provide teachers and ultimately students with up-to-date biology
images that better reflect current cell biology. Subject matter developed with
these images includes cellular structures, cell membrane physiology, cell
cycle/genetics, plant tissues, animal tissues, protists, fungi and monerans.
Materials are developed under HTML using JAVA, the latest WEB technologies and
are designed on the CD-ROM Web-on-a-Disc concept. The CD-ROMs are interfaced
with the WEB, allowing a multi-platform interactive environment for the user.
