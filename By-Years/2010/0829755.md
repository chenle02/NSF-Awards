IPDPS is an international forum for engineers and scientists from around the
world to present their latest research findings in all aspects of parallel
computation. In addition to technical sessions of submitted paper presentations,
the meeting offers workshops, tutorials, and commercial presentations &amp;
exhibits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is to seek l funding for TCPP to
allow 20 awards (at $500 per student), to be split evenly between IPDPS student
author and inaugural TCPP PhD forum travel support.&lt;br/&gt;This would
particularly allow several underrepresented women and minorities to be awarded
travel support, increasing the likelihood of their participation. Each award
will provide up to $500 for reimbursement of actual travel, accommodations, and
registration expenses.&lt;br/&gt;In making these awards, the TCPP gives priority
to individuals who would otherwise be unable to attend and to students
presenting their own published work.&lt;br/&gt;
