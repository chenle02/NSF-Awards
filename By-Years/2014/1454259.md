1454259&lt;br/&gt;Hong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to
explore the structure of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) directly at field
scales by tracking the trajectories of snowflakes and using them as flow
tracers. This approach will remove scaling and modeling adjustments currently
made in scaled down wind tunnel experiments. Findings from this research will
impact directly the wind energy industry. The proposed research activities are
integrated into the educational plan of the proposal, which is centered on the
use of the field laboratory and the wind turbine as a hands-on learning
facility. Teachers, graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this
project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to develop a super-large-scale
particle image velocimetry (SLPIV) technique that will be complemented by
laboratory scale experiments to understand full-scale wake dynamics around wind
turbines. The innovation of this proposal is that SLPIV will be implemented by
using snowflakes as natural tracers to quantify incoming turbulence and wake
flow fields around a fully-instrumented wind turbine at the University of
Minnesota. The field data will then inform the design of laboratory scale
experiments that will aim to reproduce the key full-scale wake phenomena by
tuning controllable experimental parameters. This proposal's goal to decipher
the dynamics of the atmospheric layer behind a full scale wind turbine has both
fundamental and practical importance. Better understanding of the turbine wake
behavior and the fluid-solid interaction can lead to 10-20% improvements in the
efficiency of wind turbines, while the establishment of the SLPIV as a
ubiquitous experimental method can allow its use to study large scale ABL
turbulence. Our climate, agriculture, and commerce are affected by the
turbulence within the ABL.
