Remarkably, it was not until 2008 that Bacteria and Archaea (prokaryotes) were
shown to possess adaptive immune systems that protect them against prokaryotic
viruses. This system, called CRISPR/Cas, uses protein and RNA based recognition
to identify and destroy an invading virus. However, we still lack important
details on how this is accomplished. The project will utilize biochemical
methods to further our understanding of the CRISPR/Cas system and the detailed
biochemical steps it takes to recognize and destroy the invading viral DNA. It
will also investigate the ways in which the activity of this immune system is
controlled. Although the goal is a basic biological understanding of the biology
and chemistry of CRISPR/Cas, the ability this system to recognize, repair,
alter, or destroy a specific DNA sequence in a living cell has a host of
potentially powerful applications in biotechnology. Finally, there is a strong
integration of the project with the educational goals of Montana State
University and the National Science Foundation. Students (and teachers) at the
high school, undergraduate and doctoral levels will receive significant training
in biochemistry, structural biology and thermal
biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will utilize a number of
biophysical and biochemical methods, including X-ray crystallography, single
particle cryo-electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and surface plasmon
resonance to accomplish the specific goals of this project. These methods will
first be used to understand how the CRISPR/Cas recognizes and templates CRISPR
RNA for the recognition and destruction of invading viral DNA. These same
methods will be used to investigate how the activity of Cascade is regulated.
Combined, these studies will elucidate the structure of the 400 kDa Cascade
complex at the atomic level, identify post-translational modifications that
control its activity and identify molecules thought to regulate the expression
of the CRISPR/Cas system.
