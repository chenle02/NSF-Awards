9450532 York This project investigates the use of virtual reality technology as
an aid in the development of abstract concepts from mathematics and physical
science in African-American students at the secondary school level. These
students will explore in a multi-modal fashion abstract concepts which derive
from the very basic notions of polygons and polyhedra(geometry), permutation
groups(algebra), path in a graph (topology), counting and estimation
(combinatorics), and motion and forces(Mechanics). In this pilot project virtual
reality technology is investigated as a tool in developing multi- modal (visual,
tactile, and auditory) learning experiences for primarily low-verbal learners.
Two starter VR environments will be developed and tested over the next year. The
goal of the project is to begin to understand the non-verbal acquisition and use
of abstract mathematical, physical, and algorithmic concepts as demonstrated
through motoric responses.
