This research project is a foundational theoretical study of mathematical models
of interactions within large networks. There has been extensive study of many
different models of, for instance, human interaction via social networks, which
involves modeling both the network structure and the interaction rules. Studying
the mathematical underpinnings of such probability models is intended to
facilitate the dissemination of techniques among different research communities
and provide additional tools for the design, analysis, and empirical
investigation of large networks. Separately, by emphasizing novel mathematical
research problems arising from readily available real-world data, it is hoped to
stimulate interest amongst undergraduate and graduate students in pursuing novel
research paths.

One technical aspect concerns the compactification methodology for studying
limits of finite discrete random structures. This is well studied in the case of
graphons as limits of dense graphs; this project continues the study of limits
of finite reversible Markov chains and initiates study of limits of first
passage percolation on arbitrary finite weighted graphs. Another theoretical
aspect concerns further study of scale-invariant random spatial networks and
their construction via dynamic proximity graphs. Novel research problems arising
from readily available real-world data concern spatial queues (exemplified by
airport security lines), the topology of road networks on sampled points, and
Nash equilibria for an online game one can observe in real time.
