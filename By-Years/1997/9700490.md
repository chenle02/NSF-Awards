9700490 Pedersen Osteoporosis is the most common systemic bone disease which
causes an increased fracture risk in especially older women. It is a
debilitating and costly disease which a decade ago was estimated to cost to the
US society $6 - $7 billion. Osteoporosis affects primarily the trabecular bone
which is the mesh-like structure in the center of a bone. A clinically accepted
measure of the degree of osteoporosis is the bone mass density (BMD), and so all
instruments in clinical use attempt to estimate BMD. The dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry (DEXA) technique is considered the most accurate technique today,
but an ultrasound transmission technique, referred to as broadband ultrasound
attenuation (BUA), is also widely used. Among the limitations of the current
techniques are: i) difficulty in diagnosing osteoporosis in its early stages,
ii) inability to carry out localized measurements, and iii) only modest
correlation with fracture risk. The goal of the proposed research is to generate
preliminary data based on a new ultrasound system which will utilize both
transmission and reflection measurements. The motivation for the research is to
develop a technique which can provide information about both the architecture of
the trabecular bone and BMD and thus be more sensitive to changes in the
trabecular bone structure and to changes in bone mass density, i.e., to the
degree of osteoporosis, than existing techniques. The attractiveness of
ultrasound for assessing osteoporosis lies in the relatively low cost, its
portability and the absence of ionizing radiation. The measurements will utilize
cow bone samples chosen to cover a range of bone mass densities corresponding to
the densities from normal to osteoporotic bone in humans. Several ultrasound
parameters will be measured, such as sound speed, absorption, and scattering in
different directions. The ultrasound results will be compared to results
obtained with DEXA measurements which will be carrie d out at Univ. of
Massachusetts Medical Center. ***
