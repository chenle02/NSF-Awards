The purpose of this project is to develop highly sensitive torsion-balance
instruments to search for the ultra-weak forces predicted by several modern
theoretical attempts to unify gravity with the other forces of physics. This
unification is faced with two deep problems: the extreme weakness of gravity
compared to the other known forces, and the enormous observed disparity between
the cosmological constant and the quantum-mechanical predictions of the vacuum-
energy density. Theoretical ideas for overcoming these problems often predict
new gravitational phenomena that can be tested with improved instruments.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, Newton's inverse-square law of gravitation
will be tested down to length scales substantially smaller than the diameter of
a human hair to probe for large extra dimensions and to test a possible
explanation for the observed smallness of the cosmological constant. The
sensitivity of tests of Einstein's Equivalence Principle for a variety of
materials will be increased by a factor of 30 to test speculations about the
source of the mysterious dark energy that appears to comprise two thirds of the
total mass-energy of the Universe. A special torsion pendulum that contains
almost a mole of polarized electrons will be used to search, with great
sensitivity, for vector fields frozen into the universe that could cause
macroscopic violation of charge-parity-time reversal (CPT) symmetry. Finally, a
novel torsion-balance instrument will be developed to search for the force
produced by the as yet unobserved axion.&lt;br/&gt;
