Abstract.

The proposers intend to continue their study of meromorphic functions using the
methods of geometric theory of functions and topology, the approach which
already brought significant results in their previous research. All problems in
this proposal arise naturally from the results of the previous research of the
proposers funded by NSF. The proposers intend to concentrate on the following
specific problems: geometry and topology of real and complex spectral loci of
the one-dimensional Schrödinger operators with polynomial and rational
potentials; singularities of implicit analytic functions defined by entire
relations; general properties of certain classes of meromorphic functions
occurring in holomorphic dynamics and in spectral theory of the Schrödinger
operators; polynomial approximation of discontinuous functions on systems of
intervals. Proposed research will expand our understanding of solutions of
transcendental equations emerging in analysis and mathematical physics.

Meromorphic functions constitute the most basic class of functions used in
mathematics and most of its applications. In addition to elementary functions
like the exponent, cosine and tangent, this class includes higher transcendental
functions, indispensable in physics and engineering. Previous work of the
authors on this subject already found important applications in control theory,
material science, computer science, signal processing, mathematical physics and
astrophysics. This proposal contains several problems of the function theory
motivated by quantum mechanics, and the proposers expect their results to yield
deeper understanding of this fundamental physical theory. The PI and coPI will
also work with graduate students on research related to the project.
