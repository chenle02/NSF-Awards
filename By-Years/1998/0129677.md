To continue to address the goal of characterizing the behavior of
HPC&lt;br/&gt;networks, the NLANR/MNA group plans to extend and expand the
Network&lt;br/&gt;Analysis Infrastructure (NAI) by deploying more sophisticated
measurement&lt;br/&gt;architectures, meeting the needs of new measurement
domains, and&lt;br/&gt;developing network analysis partnerships with established
and developing&lt;br/&gt;researchers. Planned projects include the extension of
the Active&lt;br/&gt;Measurement Project (AMP) into the campus domain, the
repackaging of AMP&lt;br/&gt;for distribution, a wider range of measurements,
and the development of&lt;br/&gt;new data analysis tools, including
visualizations and automated event&lt;br/&gt;detection. The Passive Measurement
and Analysis (PMA) project will be&lt;br/&gt;extended to allow detailed study of
packet flows through a router&lt;br/&gt;and across an end-to-end path. Other
developments will include PMA&lt;br/&gt;measurements focused on coordinated
measurement, allowing the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;parts of the network to be
understood as they relate to one another, as&lt;br/&gt;well as measurements of
higher speed network paths. With these&lt;br/&gt;developments, the NAI will
continue to be an excellent platform and source&lt;br/&gt;of research data and
methods from which other researchers (including&lt;br/&gt;students) can build
their own projects and with which systems engineers&lt;br/&gt;and administrators
can improve their networks.&lt;br/&gt;
