The goal of this doctoral dissertation project is to examine the spatial
distribution and architecture of villages and towns in a traditional society to
better understand long-term changes in economics, identity, and human social
organization. Traditional explanations for the rise of social complexity often
emphasize the role of inequality, hierarchy, and appearance of cities. In many
instances past people were involved in mining and specialized production of
trade goods using such materials as local copper and soft-stone resources.
However, in some cases there is limited evidence these activities were
controlled by elites, and instead may have been led by local entrepreneurs
rather than wealthy and powerful foreigners. Research will focus on villages in
mountainous areas, including two important sites where copper and soft-stone
were extracted, that so far indicate less centralized production than predicted
by traditional models of state formation. The research offers important insights
about how societies developed, changed, and thrived in mountainous arid
environments, including in relation to valuable raw materials like copper that
are only available in particular geological settlings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
investigators will use archaeological survey, architectural and geospatial
analyses to study the distribution of Iron Age settlements. These methods
investigate the spatial organization of life at the regional, local, and
settlement scale by focusing on movement. This brings the methods beyond static
distribution maps and expands the area of inquiry to include past human behavior
â€“ how would people move across broad regions, on trade routes, and through their
villages? The range and variability of movement will be used in conjunction with
artifacts and other data sources to investigate the nature of social networks
among people. Working in international collaboration education and outreach will
promote tourism and support the preservation of cultural
heritage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
