The goal of the "Tough as Nails, Nimble Fingers Research Practitioner
Partnership (RPP)" is to develop a pipeline for computer science (CS) and
computational thinking (CT) education within Pikeville Independent Schools and
Floyd County K-8 schools. Kentucky Appalachia K-8 instructors will learn the
basics of CS and CT and how to integrate these skills and concepts into existing
coursework. Through the professional development and curricular model of South
Fayette School District (a national leader in CS/CT education) and wider support
from local company Bit Source, Pikeville Independent School district and Floyd
County schools will develop their own CS/CT pathways, grounding coursework and
learning competencies in the educational and economic needs of their respective
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
