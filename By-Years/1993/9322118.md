9322118 Crawford The proposed research will simulate the predicted hypervelocity
interactions of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 1993e fragments with the Jovian atmosphere
using a computational approach. The goal of the simulations is to provide
immediate information for other predictive investigations and guidance for
observations of the event. Two and three-dimensional simulations of the
individual bolide events will be made. These simulations will provide estimates
of the penetration depth, the mode of fragmentation and bolide dispersion, the
mechanism of energy deposition and energy deposition rates within different
regions of the atmosphere, and quantify the effect of impact obliquity and
bolide irregularities. These results will be made avialable to atmospheric
modelers as quickly as possible to aid in estimates of potential long-lived
observable features such as gravity waves and material upwelling in the Jovian
atmosphere. ***
