This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of California at Los Angeles acquire a
360 MHz NMR spectrometer which will be used in research investigations in the
following areas of chemistry: 1) Synthesis of Bioactive Natural Products, 2)
Structural Recognition in the Complexation of Organic Compounds, 3) Exploratory
Studies in Supramolecular Chemistry, 4) Unstable Reactive Intermediates from
Singlet Oxygen, 5) Study of the Synthesis and Reactivity of Novel Boranes,
Carboranes, and Metallacarboranes, and 6) Synthetic Organic Chemistry. Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrometry is the most powerful tool available to the
chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are
useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
