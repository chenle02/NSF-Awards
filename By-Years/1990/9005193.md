Inorganic phosphate is an important part of cells as well as body components
such as bone. The amount of phosphate within an organism can alter bodily
calcium balance, acidity of body fluids, and growth. Phosphate regulation is
therefore important in all vertebrates. Dietary intake, intestinal absorption
and renal excretion determine the body phosphate balance. The processes in the
kidneys which control the excretion of phosphate are not understood in animals
such as birds and fishes. Unlike mammals, the latter have a mechanism to
transfer phosphate directly from blood to the urine through kidney cells. The
objectives of this work include the study of the mechanism of phosphate transfer
at both the cellular and cell membrane levels. Regulation of phosphate excretion
by the kidneys involves the interaction of hormones, acid-base balance, and
dietary phosphate availability. Dr. Renfro will examine the basic cellular
processes by which these factors alter body phosphate.
