This project will support improved housing and curation of the botanical
collections at the University of Massachusetts herbarium, which includes two
herbaria: Amherst College Herbarium, one of the oldest in the country and
Massachusetts State, both of which have collections of historical importance
that are strong in New England plants, especially from western Massachusetts.
New cabinets will replace older wooden ones which are no longer adequate to
prevent infestation and serious damage to this important regional collection.
Also a backlog of important specimens will be mounted and added to the main
collection. Both improvements will increase access to the collection by students
and researchers involved in biodiversity and conservation studies.
