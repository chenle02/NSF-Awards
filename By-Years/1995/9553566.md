9553566 Epel This project is to provide high school biology laboratory exercises
to teachers over the Internet. New mult-disciplinary protocols in biology and
cell biology are to be developed, disseminated as supplementary materials and
maintained on the World Wide Web and in other forms. The project is a model of
how research laboratories can efficiently share expertise with the nation's
educators. Concepts of scientific method and experimentation is to be taught
through modules featuring sea urchin gametes, illustrating fertilization, cell
physiology, cell division, embryonic development, biochemistry, speciation, and
the interaction between organisms and their environment. Teacher support is to
be by way of interactive tutorials and Web pages over the Internet.
