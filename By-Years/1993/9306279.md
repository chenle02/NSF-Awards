This award is for support of a National Academy of Sciences (Committee on
Geodesy) workshop on airborne geophysics. The emergence of high precision, high
speed, Geodetic Positioning System (GPS) technology has created opportunities
for new research in aerogeophysics. Primarily, this technology allows for much
higher resolution work in research projects using airborne study methods ranging
from photogrammetry to geopotential field measurements. The workshop will focus
on the potential role of high-precision, kinematic, GPS in aerogeophysical
research of the future.
