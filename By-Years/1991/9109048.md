There have been many recent results in the p-adic theory of modular forms, with
emphasis on p-adic periods and p-adic analogues of the conjecture of Birch and
Swinnerton-Dyer. The workshop supported by this grant will high-light the
L-invariant, which appears as a factor of the leading Taylor coefficient of the
p-adic L-function of a 'split multiplicative' newform. At least five independent
interpretations of this invariant have been proposed in recent years. By
bringing researchers together to discuss the underlying ideas, the workshop will
contribute to a deeper understanding of the interdependence between p-adic Hodge
theory, analogues of the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer, p-adic
uniformization theory, p-adic differential equations, and deformations of Galois
representations. The workshop will be held at Boston University in August, 1991,
and will bring together the leading researchers in this area from the United
States and abroad. It will have a profound effect on the graduate students and
recent Ph.D.s who attend. The results of the workshop will be published in a
conference proceedings.
