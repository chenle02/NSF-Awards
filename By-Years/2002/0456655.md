The singularity theorems tell us that singularities form in a large class of
spacetimes, including the physically relevant cases of the big bang and of the
gravitational collapse of a star to form a black hole. However, these theorems
tell us very little about the nature of the singularities. For example, we would
like to know for the entire class of incomplete observers, how the curvature
behaves along their world lines and whether they can see the singularity before
they hit it. Since we do not have the general solution of Einstein's equation in
closed form, the PI intends to perform numerical studies of spacetimes with
singularities to address these issues. The PI has already developed and
successfully applied a fully 3-space dimensional vacuum code to study
cosmological singularities and has found support for the BKL picture of
oscillatory singularities. He plans to complement this with further work
involving matter sources to test the idea that "matter doesn't matter" near the
big bang. The PI also will study how coordinate conditions effect the numerical
evolution of colliding black holes.
