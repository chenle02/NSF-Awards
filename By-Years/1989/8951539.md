This project brings the institute's introductory course in computing up to date
and into alignment with the technical degree programs it serves. This course,
offered by the Department of Applied Computer Studies within the School of
Computer Science to approximately 1000 non-computer science majors per year, is
the first step in enabling students to become skilled users of computers as
scholars in their careers. The course emphasizes hands-on self-paced learning in
a dedicated laboratory staffed by trained proctors. Problem-solving with
increasingly powerful and broadly useful general purpose software such as word
processing, communication software, hypertext and electronic spreadsheets
replace Pascal programming as the primary focus of the course. The project
includes the purchase of Macintosh II computers, networking equipment, and
general purpose software tools to replace existing Apple IIe microcomputers in
the courses's dedicated laboratories. This award is being matched by an equal
amount from the principal investigator's institution.
