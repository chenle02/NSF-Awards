This award partially supports the attendance of young scientists at a six-day
workshop on "The Physics of Supernovae", a part of the Aspen Winter Conferences.
The appearance of supernova 1987A gave a major boost to the subject of
supernovae, but the subject was already developing increasingly rapidly before
1987. This award supports expenses of younger scientists to attend a six-day
workshop on "The Physics of Supernovae". This workshop will allow a careful
integration of the various branches of physics and astrophysics that contribute
to and benefit from the subject of supernovae.
