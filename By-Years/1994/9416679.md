9416679 Milliman A workshop is planned to bring together leading workers in the
neritic and deep-sea carbonate systems to define future directions that will
allow the community to understand the marine carbonate system in its entirety,
particularly in the light of changing sea level and climate. A report to NSF is
planned as the understanding of the global carbonate budget and its relationship
to CO2 cycle are important stated objectives of marine earth system history
initiative. Funds will pay partial attendance cost of twenty five US and local
expenses of five foreign scientists. ***
