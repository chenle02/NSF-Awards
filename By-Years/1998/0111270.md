Professor William Fenical in the Marine Research Division at the University of
California, San Diego Scripps Institute is supported by the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies on the defense chemicals
utilized by marine plants and animals against a diversity of pathogenic
microbes. Bioassays for six known algal and invertebrate pathogens will be used
to assess 1) the inhibition of microbial growth (antibiosis) and 2) the
inhibition of microbial attachment (anti-settlement). New assays for additional
pathogens will continue to be developed. Structure determination studies of
several antifungal metabolites are ongoing and characterization of new bioactive
metabolites discovered during the course of this project will be carried
out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program, Professor Fenical is isolating organic compounds which marine
plants and animals use as a chemical defense against various pathogenic
microbes. There is a possibility that some of these novel bioactive compounds
which exhibit antifungal or antibiotic activity may prove useful in controlling
human infectious diseases.
