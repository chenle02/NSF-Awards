9626320 Ward Advances in materials science require detailed characterization of
the structure and composition of materials. Consequently, x-ray diffraction
continues to play a vital role in the synthesis, fabrication and
characterization of advanced materials and in materials processing. This award
provides support for an x-ray diffraction system to be housed in the University
of Minnesota X-ray Diffraction Facility. X-ray diffraction is an integral part
of numerous University research programs related to materials research, and the
Facility has actually served eighteen different universities, at least fourteen
industrial research laboratories and programs affiliated with the National
Science Foundation's Center for Interfacial Engineering. The requested equipment
will replace an aging Siemens diffractometer which poses safety hazards and has
performance limitations. The system represents a significant improvement in the
Facility's capabilities, providing a rotating anode source for faster sample
throughput (imperative for a multi-user facility), and control of sample
environment. This acquisition will substantially benefit several key principal
investigators whose research programs involve materials research, as well as a
substantial user community composed of academic and industrial scientists. ***
