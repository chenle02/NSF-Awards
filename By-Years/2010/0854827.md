This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutrinos offer a new way to look at
the sky. As a new generation of experiments is being developed, the detection of
neutrinos from core collapse supernovae and stellar jets finally is within
reach, with unprecendented potential to learn about these sources and about the
properties of the neutrinos as a particle. This proposal has the main goal to
contribute to the theory of neutrinos from astrophysical sources, in guidance
and support of this new phase of neutrino astrophysics research. Being based at
a large public university, it has the potential to actively involve postdocs and
students. This mentoring activity will contribute to educating a new generation
of neutrino theorists that is urgently needed in this exciting time.&lt;br/&gt;
