INT-9600343 Monteiro This U.S.-Brazil collaborative research project between
Renato Monteiro at Georgia Institute of Technology and the Brazilian researcher
Alfredo Iusem of IMPA in Rio de Janeiro will utilize proximal interior point
methods (PIP) for solving constrained optimization problems. Issues to be
addressed include superlinear convergence, convergence of the generated dual
sequence in linear and convex quadratic programming, characterization of the
limit of the primal sequence, and study of continuous trajectories and
approximate versions of PIP algorithms. The development will parallel recent
developments in classical interior point methods. The proposed research will
create a new collaborative link between mathematicians in Georgia Tech and Rio
de Janeiro. The proposed effort, by bridging two areas so far treated
independently, should provide better understanding and new and more effective
methods for an important class of problems. ***
