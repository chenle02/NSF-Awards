Principal Investigators proposed to study Hagia Sophia, a historical structure
built in the 14th Century. Numerical and experimental analyses are used to model
the dynamic responses. Stiffness degradation is to be quantified.
Computationally intensive inverse analysis is to be used to delineate material
properties.
