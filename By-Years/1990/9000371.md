This award supports an integrated field and laboratory paleoenvironmental study
of the eastern Canadian Arctic (60 to 90 degrees West, 50 to 85 degrees North),
a region known to have experienced significant climatic change during the
Holocene. The field team will obtain complete undisturbed sediment records from
six strategically located arctic lakes. Fossil pollen and diatom analyses will
provide two independent well-dated paleoclimated records for each lake. The new
paleoclimatic time series will be combined with published and unpublished data
to generate a 100 + site network of plaeoclimate records for the region. This
network will be used to map 1) past vegetation change and 2) past climate change
over a significant portion of the North American arctic. This investigation will
also provide an opportunity to test the utility of annually laminated sediments
for arctic paleoclimatology. This effort will provide important new data for
inclusion in the eventual mapping and analysis of past environmental change
across the entire North Arctic.
