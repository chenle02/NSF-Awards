Dr. Frost's work centers on the vertical migration of marine zooplankton. The
vertical movements of the small crustaceans that comprise much of the
zooplankton in the ocean have been documented for many years, but the reason for
this phenomena is poorly understood. Dr. Frost has collected extensive data on
the distribution and vertical movement of copepods in Dabob Bay, Washington. The
current work is a seasonal study that applies sophisticated acoustic sampling
techniques that will enable the zooplankton to be located in the water column.
This study seeks to clarify the proximate and ultimate causes for vertical
migration of marine zooplankton.
