The project focuses on three areas of rigidity in the theory of "large" groups
and in Ergodic theory: (1) extending Margulis' superrigidity and Zimmer's
cocycle superrigidity from Lie groups setting to other situations, including A_2
groups and lattices in products; (2) exploring the connections between recent
advances due to Popa in von Neumann Algebras in the context of Ergodic theory;
(3) studying measure rigidity questions in the spirit of Ratner's theorem for
algebraic actions of non-amenable groups (which have no unipotents).

The common phenomenon, termed "rigidity", in the above problems is that certain
algebraic structures describing intrinsic symmetries of the studied objects
impose very strong constrains on the otherwise flexible characteristics of these
objects. One of the most intriguing aspects of what became known as "rigidity
theory" is its characteristic synergy of methods and tools from rather different
areas: Algebra, Number theory, Geometry and Analysis. This project concerns some
problems in Dynamics most related to Lie groups and Analysis.
