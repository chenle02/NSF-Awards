With support from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods (CTMC)
program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor David Reichman of Columbia
University is developing theoretical methods to simulate the properties of novel
materials that hold promise for important technological applications, including
next-generation electronic devices and solar cells. Reichman and his research
group will develop novel machine learning techniques as well as efficient
algorithms which operate on quantum computers to enable these simulations.
Reichman will continue his association with the Bronx High School of Science as
well as local public schools to teach rising scholars how solar cells
operate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first phase of the proposed work, Reichman
and his group will study how the coupling to an optical cavity can influence
chemical reactions and transport in materials. In the second phase, the
development of methods to extend the auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo method
to enable the treatment of important strongly correlated electronic systems will
be put forward. Finally, Reichman and his group will develop approaches to treat
strongly coupled electron-phonon systems. Particular focus will be directed to
create methods for the accurate description of polarons and the renormalization
of exciton binding from phonons in polar semiconductors at the ab initio
level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
