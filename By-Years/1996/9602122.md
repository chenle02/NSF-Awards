The aim of this project is to show that quantum systems can be chaotic, which is
thought not to be possible because a system undergoing unitary time evolution is
not sensitive to its initial conditions, and sensitivity to initial conditions
is an indicator of chaos. If quantum systems are not chaotic, then the
correspondence principle is challenged. (The correspondence principle is a main
interpretive principle of qunatum mechanics, which asserts that as the scale of
a system increases, quantum physics converges on conventional physics). The key
to accomplishing this aim is to examine a pair of interacting systems, because a
component of a pair of such systems does not, in general, undergo unitary time
evolution, leaving open the possibility of finding chaos in the time evolution
of a component of such a pair. If it can be shown that quantum systems do indeed
exhibit chaos, then the correspondence principle would be vindicated.
