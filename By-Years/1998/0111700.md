Since the passage of the 1988 Constitution, the prosecutors of the Brazilian
Public Ministry have become the "watchdogs" of environmental agencies, bringing
investigations and lawsuits on behalf of the public interest against agencies
that neglect their enforcement duties. This research seeks to determine whether
a new model of environmental regulation has emerged in Brazil capable of
stemming the under-enforcement of environmental laws. Two questions are asked:
(1) How do Brazilian environmental agencies and the Public Ministry differ in
their approaches to the enforcement of environmental law? and (2) How have the
enforcement practices of Brazilian environmental agencies been reshaped by the
Public Ministry's environmental "watchdog" activities? The researcher will
conduct nine months of field research in two Brazilian states, Sao Paulo and
Para, using ethnographic and quantitative data collection methods. The research
contributes to three academic literatures: the sociolegal and political science
literature on comparative regulatory institutions; the sociological literature
on state capacity in developing countries; and scholarship on the
democratization of Brazilian legal institutions.
