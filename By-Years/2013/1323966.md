Recent scholarship on the international community's role in prosecution of
genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity has focused on the
international criminal courts created since the close of the Cold War. But there
is an alternative international mechanism of accountability that also dates from
the Cold War's end, also takes shape through the intervention of an
international court, and also deserves study: the jurisdiction exercised by the
regional human rights systems for ordering and monitoring national prosecutions
of international crimes. The regional rights courts have embarked on a quasi-
criminal practice that seeks to achieve the same outcomes as the international
criminal tribunals: punishment and deterrence, restorative justice, processes of
societal reconciliation, and justice system reform. Further, this form of
jurisdiction has unique features: it promotes prosecutions that are local and
paid for by the state (rather than the international community); it takes place
at the local level, in the midst of the communities most harmed by the crimes;
and its process is responsive to victims' needs. The Inter-American Court of
Human Rights in particular has made national prosecution of gross state-
sponsored crimes a center-piece of its regional agenda.

The proposed project examines whether and under what circumstances the Inter-
American Court's quasi-criminal jurisdiction results in punishment, processes of
societal reconciliation, and national justice system reform. Employing a mix of
quantitative and qualitative methods, including fieldwork in Peru, Colombia and
Costa Rica, the project will assess the efficacy of the Inter-American Court's
interventions. The project will contribute to knowledge about the conditions
under which international courts orders have a local impact, and the conditions
under which states choose to prosecute international crimes.
