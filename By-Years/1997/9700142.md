In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division with funds for instrumentation provided by the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities, Continetti will continue studying the dissociation
dynamics of transient molecules and molecular clusters in the gas phase using a
technique developed in his laboratory, neutral dissociation dynamics, which is a
combination of negative-ion photodetachment and neutral-fragment translational
energy spectroscopy. Issues to be examined include isotope effects in the
dissociation of O3, transient molecules of interest in combustion and
atmospheric processes, and the photochemistry of dimer anions. This research
project will examine the molecular structure and electronic composition of a
number of unstable and transient molecules which are difficult to study by other
techniques. Possible applications of information obtained from this research
include combustion chemistry, atmospheric reactions, chemical vapor deposition,
and supercritical water reactors.
