Stony Brook This research has two foci. First, the development of new
carbocyclization reactions will be carried out by probing cascade
tricyclizations, by trapping of the intermediates in silylcarbocyclization
(SiCaC) reactions and by testing the scope of hetero-SiCaC reactions. Second, a
synthetic and mechanistic study of homogeneous catalysis in supercritical carbon
dioxide will be carried out. Both higher reaction rates and greater reaction
selectivity are to be expected from this approach. With this renewal award, the
Synthetic Organic Program and the Office of Multidiciplinary Activities are
supporting the research of Dr. Iwao Ojima of the Department of Chemistry at the
State University of New York, Stony Brook. Professor Ojima will focus his work
on developing new and efficient homogeneous catalytic reactions incorporating
carbocyclizations and carbonylations in conjunction with heterobimetallic
catalyst systems. The methodology affords synthetic chemists powerful tools for
the preparation of a large number of cyclic molecules.
