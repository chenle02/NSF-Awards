This study will attempt to identify the current level of U.S. civil engineering
related R&D funding, the funding organizations, the research performers, and the
areas of research emphasis for the following sectors: - Federal Government -
State Government - Private Industry (design firms, contractors, manufacturers,
etc.) - Non-Profits - Colleges & Universities The survey results should be of
direct interest to all Federal agencies, and the private sector by helping to
define levels of R&D in the design and construction industry, as well as the
overall R&D focus. The results should provide a useful baseline frame of
reference for future R&D investments, strategies, and in the identification of
gaps in research funding. For this survey to be of maximum use in establishing a
design and construction industry R&D baseline, it should also facilitate
comparison with civil engineering R&D figures published in other countries.
