Abstract

Award: DMS-1103368 Principal Investigator: Yongbin Ruan

During the past twenty years, there has been a great deal of interaction between
mathematic and physics. Various correspondences or dualities arising from
physics have had a great impact on mathematics. One of these correspondences is
the Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence. This proposal offers a
comprehensive program to establish this correspondence in mathematics with
mathematical rigor. There is a wide range of applications such as global mirror
symmetry, the computation of Gromov-Witten invariants of compact Calabi-Yau
manifolds, and to modular forms.

Since the era of Newton, mathematics has been a key tool in helping us to
comprehend the universe. An example is differential geometry via Einstein's
theory of general relativity. During the last twenty years there has been a
great deal of activity in building so-called string-theoretic models of the
universe. The string-theoretic model of the universe is ten-dimensional, our
usual 4-dimensional space-time togeher with a very small 6-dimensional space
called a Calabi-Yau manifold. Such a small internal space will affect our space-
time through certain mathematical quantities such as Gromov-Witten invariants.
The computation of these invariants has been a central problem in geometry and
physics. This is the area in which mathematical tools can be very useful. The
current proposal envisages a theoretical framework as well as developing
technical tools to compute Gromov-Witten invariants
