Pausch 9157583 This is the fourth year of a five year continuing grant. This
research aims at integrating multimodal input streams from a human to a computer
into higher level semantic actions. This project is important because of the
current imbalance of information flow between a human and the computer with
computer output being several orders of magnitude greater than user input by
gestures, voice and other input modalities by examining new software
architectures to deal with probabilistic input and combinations of simultanewous
probabilitistic input streams. Higher level semantics of multi-modal inputs will
be addressed by research on input specification languages which properly
incorporate time, the sharing of semantic information at various levels of
synthesis and the development of a general framework to support the combination
of probabilistic input streams.
