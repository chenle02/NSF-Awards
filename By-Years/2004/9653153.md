Using modeling and real world data as motivation, a two-course sequence which
integrates calculus and statistics is being developed, tested, and evaluated.
These courses are designed to improve the mathematical knowledge and skills of
entering college students outside of science, mathematics, and engineering. The
first course uses elementary concepts from statistics and calculus to construct
and analyze algebraic functions which model real data; the second introduces
more sophisticated functions and uses more advanced methods from calculus and
statistics. The first course stands alone as a core course; the second can be a
meaningful replacement for introductory statistics or "business" calculus. The
sequence, which is being piloted at both Kennesaw State College and Portland
State University, exposes students to mathematical and statistical concepts and
tools used in the workplace. Both courses make extensive use of computers to
gather data and analyze real world problems. In the spirit of the Earth Algebra
and Earth Math projects, previously funded by both the Fund for the Improvement
of Post-Secondary Education (FIPSE) and the NSF, the sequence incorporates the
principles of the NCTM and AMATYC Standards. Dissemination efforts include a
textbook, workshops, MAA minicourses and posting of some materials on the
Internet. The assessment activities are investigating the feasibility of a
technology-intensive integrated calculus/statistics sequence which uses modeling
and data analysis to motivate the mathematics. This grant supports specific
materials development and dissemination activities, and complements core funding
for the overall project by FIPSE.
