1247729 (Crittenden). This award provides partial financial support for the
participation of U.S. scientists and engineers in the Symposium on Resilience
and Sustainability that is being organized by faculty at Ohio State University,
Portland State University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Oberlin
College in collaboration with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The symposium will be held on Monday, January 14, 2013 in conjunction with the
National Council for Science and Environment (NCSE) annual conference on January
15-17, 2013, which has an overall theme of ?Environmental Disasters, Science
Preparedness and Resilience.? Highlights of the symposium results will be
presented in a plenary session at the NCSE conference. The purpose of this
symposium is to convene researchers and practitioners from a variety of fields
that are investigating the modeling, assessment, and improvement of resilience
in economic, social, and ecological systems. By stimulating trans-disciplinary
thinking and collaboration, the symposium aims to (a) develop a more integrated
understanding of common principles of resilient and sustainable systems, and (b)
identify useful approaches or tools for enhancing the resilience,
sustainability, and productive harmony of human and natural systems. This
symposium will contribute to the understanding that ecological insights and
systems thinking can help human enterprises and communities to develop greater
resilience in order to anticipate surprises, recover from disruptions, and
evolve in response to external pressures. Special efforts will be made to
recruit speakers from groups that are underrepresented in science and
engineering (e.g., minorities and women). The topics of environmental justice
and equitable policies for disaster response will be addressed.
