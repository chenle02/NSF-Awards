Continuous phase modulation, CPM, is a constant envelope digital signaling
scheme which promises reduced spectral occupancy and/or improved performance
when compared to standard modulation formats. Little information is available on
how to perform carrier phase tracking of a received CPM signal in order to
provide a coherent reference. The first goal of the proposed research program is
to derive and analyze an architecture for a carrier tracking system which is
applicable to the general M'ary partial response CPM modulation. The second task
will identify a set of CPM modulation parameters which simultaneously optimizes
performance and minimizes implementation complexity, and which will be used in
the computer simulations required in the first task.
