Previous theoretical and simulation studies predict that a tradable groundwater
pumping rights system can generate positive societal impacts including both
economic and environmental benefits. Completion of the proposed activities under
the I-Corps program may help to develop an understanding of how to translate
theoretical results and analyses into a viable market system. In particular,
improved understanding of customer and stakeholder concerns and needs should
ultimately lead to improved risk management systems that increase profits for
all market participants.

Conflict over water resource management is increasing, with large amounts of
money being spent on litigation, as well as reduced agricultural productivity
for farmers that are constrained as a result of regulations. Successful
translation of project activities into public use may provide new risk
management tools for farmers, reduce the costs of water reallocation, and lead
to an increase in agricultural productivity and profits while maintaining or
improving environmental conditions and resource sustainability. Successful
completion of activities has the potential to increase understanding of how
commercially viable market-based resource allocation systems should be designed
and implemented.
