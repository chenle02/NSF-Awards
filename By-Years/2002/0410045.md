This Collaborative Research Activities in Environmental Molecular Science
(CRAEMS) Award to Worcester Polytechnic Institute is supported by the Special
Projects Office in the Chemistry Division. Barbara Wyslouzil is supported by
this award for the fundamental study of nanoparticle formation in air pollution.
Support is also provided to Doug Doren, Murray Johnston, Hai Wang, and Anthony
Wexler at the University of Delaware through subawards. An integrated
experimental and theoretical program will be carried out to understand, at a
molecular level, the processes of nanoparticle formation that are relevant to
air pollution. The topics that will be addressed are (1) nucleation in aqueous
systems, (2) soot inception, and (3) the interaction between soot and metals
during combustion. Water, water/alcohol and water/nitric acid aerosols will be
generated in a supersonic nozzle and characterized by small angle neutron
scattering and FTIR. Molecular simulation techniques will be applied to
calculate nucleation rates and to address important non-equilibrium effects.
Soot particles will be generated in a flat flame burner and characterized by
sampling with a scanning mobility particle sizer. Size distributions will be
compared to those derived from small angle neutron and x-ray scattering
experiments. Molecular composition of the particles will be determined by mass
spectrometry. The reaction between metals and soot will be studied by generating
particles from ethylene-oxygen flames, seeded with ferrocene. Mathematical
models will be developed that incorporate molecular mechanisms of metal oxide
particle formation and carbon deposition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particle
nucleation is a key step in many environmental and industrial processes.
Refractory particles are formed in combustion and metallurgical processes, while
acid-water droplets are produced in stack gases, volcanic plumes and in
photochemical reactions in the atmosphere. This research will help define the
mechanisms by which they are formed and the role they play in air pollution.
