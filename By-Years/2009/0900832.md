The research objective of this award is to understand the mechanical behavior of
graphene nanostrucutures as influenced by van der Waals forces. As a single
suspended layer of atoms, graphene sheets are among the thinnest objects
imaginable. A suspended single layer of graphene is one of the stiffest and
strongest known materials. While these attributes are attractive for many
reasons, the mechanical behavior of graphene is dominated by the influence of
van der Waals forces. This situates graphene, and many nanomechanical structures
in general, in a regime that is not yet well understood or even studied. The
research approach consists of a tightly-coupled experimental-theoretical
research program. It involves a novel experimental platform that will facilitate
the characterization of numerous aspects of the nanomechanical behavior of
single and multilayer graphene, including elastic properties, adhesion, and the
influence of van der Waals forces in the range of a few to 100s of nm on
dynamical behavior. Deliverables include a new experimental platform, analytical
and numerical modeling and simulation approaches, documentation of research
results, engineering student education, and impact on K-12 students. The results
of this research program will uncover aspects of the behavior of nanomechanical
structures that live in a world where van der Waals forces are ever-present, and
as structures become smaller the influence of van der Waals forces become
stronger. It will broadly impact a wide range of applications where graphene is
intensely being pursued for technological insertion, including nanomechanics,
microelectronics, energy, and biomedical applications. The coupling of research
discoveries with ongoing and new educational activities will expose students at
all levels (K-12, undergraduate, and graduate, including students from typically
underrepresented groups) to the excitement of nanotechnology in general and the
fascinating world of the mechanics of nanostructures in particular.
