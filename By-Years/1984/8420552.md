The research involves fundamental studies of the kinetics of enzymes which break
down cell walls (cell-lytic enzymes). For many microorganisms desirable
materials are produced within the cell, and before the material can be separated
and purified the cell wall must be ruptured to release the desired contents of
the cell. The development of superior techniques for breaking the cell wall may
be particularly important for the production of food grade protein and
intracellular enzymes; degradation of cell wall polysaccharides; production of
cell hydrolysates; use as anticaries agents; treatment of fungal diseases; and,
lately, in the release and isolation of intracellular products obtained by
recombinant DNA techniques. The research studies the kinetic behavior of the
enzyme reactions which leads toward the engineering principles necessary for the
design of an enzymatic cell-disruption reactor.
