9353271 Hernandez Funds are requested to establish a Laboratory for Logic and
Databases that supports an environment where research activities in the areas of
logic programming and deductive databases can be performed. Under the umbrella
of this laboratory, research on the following topics will be pursued: The
Laboratory will investigate: 1) semantic query optimization; 2) parallel
Execution of Logic Programs; 3) implementation of Sequential and Parallel
Deductive Databases. The research will include a theoretical study of the
properties of deductive database languages and logic programming languages, as
well as new languages and new evaluation mechanisms. On the other hand,
efficient techniques will be designed for the execution of logic (database)
programs, both on conventional machines, as well as on parallel architectures.
