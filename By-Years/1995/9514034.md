9514034 Mullet The goals of this work are: 1) To delineate the specific cis-
elements that mediate jasmonate-induced transcription of VspB, a 50 bp DNA
domain that activates reporter gene transcription in response to jasmonic acid
in soy beans. 2) To identify and clone genes that encode trans-factors that
interact with the jasmonate response cis-elements. 3) To complete
characterization of two jasmonate insensitive mutants of Arabidopsis thanlania
and clone the genes identified by these mutants. %%% Jasmonates regulate the
expression of numerous genes involved in plant responses to wounding, pathogens
and pests as well as during specific stages of development. Jasmonic acid is
derived from linolenic acid by a biosynthetic pathway and the results from this
work will help to elucidate the biochemical pathways that mediate jasmonic acid
modulation of plant genes. ***
