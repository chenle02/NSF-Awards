People coordinate their actions with one another in many different contexts and
in many different ways: Drivers in traffic manage to merge without accident;
people walking on crowded streets usually avoid mishap; musicians coordinate a
variety of nested rhythms produced by band members. These examples highlight the
human capacity to coordinate behavior and exchange information at different
rates to accomplish an overall goal, a phenomenon called interperson,
multifrequency coordination. The researchers will study interperson,
multifrequency coordination by applying the physics of coupled, oscillator
systems to the perceptual, cognitive, and social information inherent in this
type of coordination. Pairs of participants (dyads) will coordinate their
movements while listening to different metronome frequencies through headphones.
Both performance pattern and pattern stability will be measured under different
experimental conditions in order to test fundamental predictions of the
mathematical model. Experimental manipulations specifically designed to increase
or decrease coupling between dyads' movements will be tested in the context of
perceptual (e.g., visual), cognitive (e.g., counting), and social (e.g., partner
familiarity) coupling mechanisms. Field studies are also planned to discover how
people coordinate in naturalistic situations. This sequence of studies is
designed to advance basic research on multifrequency coordination in dyads and
to extend that research to spontaneous coordination in larger teams.

One important aspect of this project is the extension of experimentally induced
multifrequency coordination in the laboratory to real-world settings in which
spontaneous multifrequency coordination occurs across teams of individuals. The
project also has a significant outreach component, including a visit to a
nationally organized competitive youth summer camp, where investigators will
collect data on spontaneous interperson, multifreqency coordination and teach
campers about coordination science and STEM fields.
