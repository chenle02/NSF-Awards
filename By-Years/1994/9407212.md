This project will collect baseline information about the physical features,
fauna and flora of a representative number of locations. These locations have
never been inventoried, even though they are heavily visited by both tourists
and scientists. The project will generate substantial information that is
presently unavailable. These data are extremely relevant to the preparation and
the evaluation of environmental assessments as required by the 1991 Protocol on
Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.
