ABSTRACT EEC-9713935 DAYTE This award is to provide funding for the
Industry/University Research Center on Microengineered Ceramics at the
University of New Mexico for its phase down period, as well as for a supplement
for Research Experience for Undergraduates. The Center has been funded by the
National Science Foundation since 1998. The research has been highly productive
with more than $2 million in annual support from its industrial and governmental
partners. Some of the research topics at the Center are fundamentals of sol-gel
film formation, ceramics with controlled pore size, liquid routes to supported
dense mixed metal oxide membranes, synthesis of dielectric ceramics with
controlled microstructure, aerosol synthesis of ceramics, etc. The objectives of
the Center are to develop new technology for microengineered ceramics, to
transfer technology to industry for commercial development, to educate students
for the materials science industry, to assist the development of high-tech
companies through the small business innovative research programs (SBIR),
especially in the state of New Mexico. The undergraduate students are involved
in the research activities of the Center with faculty mentors in teams of
graduate and undergraduate students.
