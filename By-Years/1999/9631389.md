This project develops and experimentally and econometrically tests a theory of
human behavior and learning in games. Under their previous NSF grant the
investigators found evidence that human players can be characterized as having
one of five models of other players. The proposed research will explore the
robustness of these findings, and compare the current theory with alternatives.
The investigators also found evidence for `rule learning` in a guessing game,
and propose exploring the applicability of such a model to typical normal-form
games. Consequently, this project contributes to a descriptive and prescriptive
theory of games.
