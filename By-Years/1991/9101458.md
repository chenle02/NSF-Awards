Professor Ruh will investigate some problems in Riemannian geometry by using
techniques of deformation theory. In particular, he will study deformation of
metrics, connections, and curvature. The general goal is to obtain optimal
structures on manifolds in order to draw conclusions about the geometry of the
manifold. Professor Ruh will consider the deformation of almost Lie groups into
Lie groups and the deformation of general Riemannian metrics into metrics with
prescribed curvature conditions. The foundation of deformation theory lies in
partial differential equations and the heat equation in particular. One
underlying theme which has turned out to be extremely useful in mathematics is
that of deformation to a desired structure. In order to obtain an optimal
structure it is often useful to construct a structure which has some of the
desired properties but not all of them. One then seeks to "deform" the initial
structure to one with the desired properties. The mechanism used to make the
deformation should preserve at least those aspects of the desired structure
which one was able to attain as a first step.
