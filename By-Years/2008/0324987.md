Funds are provided for detailed carbonate chemistry and isotopic tracer
measurements (oxygen isotopes, carbon isotopes and radiocarbon measurements) of
about 140 previously collected water samples from the Bering Sea. The work will
include analyses of salinity, dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations, and
alkalinity. The work will fill a gap in the post-GEOSECS 14C data set that will
help evaluate the possible role of winter-time bottom water formation in the
Bering Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
