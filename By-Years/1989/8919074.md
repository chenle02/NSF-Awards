The study of fluid dynamics and fluid flows has been and continues to be
considerable interest to a wide range of researchers in disciplines encompassing
engineering, the physical science, and the mathematical science. This research
effort has, as its goal, the exploration of fundamental mechanisms in fluid
dynamics using optimal computational techniques. The topics to be studied are:
Mixing in Complex Flows; Numerical Methods for Combustion; Numerical Methods for
3-D Fluid Flows; Programming Languages and Environments;
