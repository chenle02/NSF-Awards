The sense of touch allows discrimination of texture and spatial properties of
objects, in addition to conveying timing information on properties such as
vibration to the brain. One class of mechanoreceptor in mammals shows a slowly
adapting response to deformation; are called T1 or SA 1 receptors and are found
in small domed structures under the skin. These domes are contacted by terminals
of single nerve cells that carry the signal to the brain. There may be more than
one site where responses are generated in such neurons, so that each neuron may
have several nearby zones of maximal touch sensitivity, to allow sophisticated
spatial and temporal processing. This project combines engineering and
biological techniques and modelling to examine the physiological responses from
these receptor organs, using a novel stimulus technology. The emphasis will be
on understanding the temporal, spatial, and mechanical aspects of interactions
between response generator sites. Results will be incorporated and compared to
numerical models, to clarify possible mechanisms for encoding the signals, for
the brain to use in tactile discrimination. This novel approach will provide
needed data on the role of micromechanics and spatial integration on touch, and
will have impact on neuroscience studies of sensory coding, and on engineering
aspects of artificial tactile sensors for robotics.
