ABSTRACT EEC-9726306 BEHRENS It is not unusual for Industry/University
Cooperative Research Centers to form partnerships between two or more
universities. These partnerships provide access to more research expertise than
is resident at a single university and hence create stronger centers. Although
the research strengths of each university and the degree to which the research
integrates is typically well understood before two or more universities join
together to form a center, the managerial and administrative issues may not be.
Differences in organizational culture, management philosophy and bureaucratic
procedures, if not addressed, can break up an otherwise fruitful partnership.
The objective of this project is to develop a tool, for use by two or more
universities planning to enter into a partnership, to focus discussions on these
non-research related issues. This tool would use the business alliance lifecycle
model based on a marriage metaphor developed by Kantor et.al. as a conceptual
framework. The tool would be an annotated checklist containing items that
potential partners must discuss before entering into a partnership, such as what
the "target market" for the envisioned center is. Included under each item would
be a short discussion about why consideration of that item is important.
