With support from the National Science Foundation and the Government of Spain,
Symbols, Embodiment, and Meaning: A workshop and debate brings together some of
the world's leading psychologists, philosophers, neuroscientists, and
roboticists to address whether, or the extent to which, the meanings of words
derived from the bodily experiences of human kind. For instance, the word
"stand" is used metaphorical in ways that take into account the bodily
experience of upright posture in a gravitational field (e.g., standoffish, stand
your ground, take a stand, which emphasize force and balance). This issue has
deep theoretical implications for the cognitive sciences and practical
implications for the construction of interactive robots as well as the teaching
of reading and mathematics.

The 22 invited speakers (from the US and Europe) represent both sides of the
debate about embodied meaning. Invited speakers prepare position papers that are
distributed in advance to all attendees. Each morning and afternoon is devoted
to a debate-like presentation of the positions followed by a discussion open to
all attendees. In addition, approximately 40 doctoral and post-doctoral students
will attend the debate and a poster session each day allows for the presentation
of new empirical work by speakers and students.

Intellectual merits of the workshop arise from the debate format designed to be
a source of new theoretical ideas, collaborations, empirical tests, and
interdisciplinary and international research. Broader impacts arise from the
integration of research and education: Graduate students participate in the open
discussions and present their research during the poster sessions. The results
of the debate will be disseminated widely through the publication of a book and
accompanying DVD documenting the debates and discussions.
