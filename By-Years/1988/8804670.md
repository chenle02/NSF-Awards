Folding in rocks is very common, yet is still imperfectly understood. Very slow
natural strain rates and development of large strains over extremely long times
make direct laboratory modeling impossible. Theoretical treatment only
adequately account for initial stages of folding. This research will attempt to
circumvent these problems by using a two-dimensional finite- element model with
appropriate choice of constitutive relation- ships to study development of folds
with time. Predictions of shape and strain distribution resulting from the model
will then be compared with data on natural folds. The aim is to provide criteria
for gaining information from natural folds about deformational history and about
rheology of rocks deformed under slow natural conditions.
