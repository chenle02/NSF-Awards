The primary objective of this US-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. Vera Adam-Vizi of Semmelweiss University of Medicine, Budapest and Dr. Abel
Lajtha of the N.S. Kline Institute, Orangeburg, NY is to examine the mechanism
of which calcium is released when nerves release neurotransmitters, causing a
concentration in extracellular fluids. The researchers intend to 1)
differentiate between a non-specific increase in external calcium and one which
is due to calcium released from nerve terminans; and 2) identify which fraction
of the neurotransmitter stored in nerve terminals is susceptible to changes in
external calcium concentration. Results may reveal molecular mechanisms which
are associated with transmitter secretion. Funds for the project are awarded
through the U.S.-Hungary Joint Fund, Budapest in accordance with established
guidelines.
