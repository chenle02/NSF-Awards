L. Keith Woo, Iowa State University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic
and Organometallic Chemistry Program for studies of chemical oxidations mediated
by transition metal porphyrin complexes. Oxometalloporphyrins are important
active intermediates in several enzymatic processes, particularly the
cyctochrome P450 family. Oxometalloporphyrins of the early transition metals,
particularly titanium (IV), chromium (IV) and vanadium (IV) can utilize
molecular oxygen in oxidations of organic substrates, particularly diols. Woo is
focusing on three processes: 1)oxidative cleavage reactions catalyzed by metal
oxo complexes, 2) oxygen atom transfer from metal peroxo and alkyl peroxo
complexes, and 3) studies on the reactions between NO and peroxo
complexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oxidations are critically important both
industrially and biochemically, yet the details of many of these reactions are
not well-understood. A thorough comprehension of the chemical steps involved may
advance our abilities to optimize these important processes, conserve natural
resources and eliminate waste. Through this project, graduate students and
undergraduates will be trained in the laboratory and will develop communication
and intellectual skills needed to become independent scientists.
