This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project
competitively selected by a 55-country initiative on global change research
through the Belmont Forum. The Belmont Forum is a consortium of research funding
organizations focused on support for transdisciplinary approaches to global
environmental change challenges and opportunities. It aims to accelerate
delivery of the international research most urgently needed to remove critical
barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources.
Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium
to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders. This approach
facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent
research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational
approach, recognizing that global challenges need global
solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will quantitatively evaluate the
impact of culturing corals and seaweed together in an effort to reduce ocean
acidification and mitigate coral bleaching. This project will assess whether
this practice is a feasible intervention with quantifiable benefits, and whether
this approach has potential to be implemented in other coral reef locations. The
study sites include Onna-son, Okinawa, Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, and Mayotte, France.
The results will help in measuring the impacts of ocean acidification on marine
ecosystems and will provide a summary of mitigation measures to reduce the ocean
acidification impacts. The work is critical in providing information to assist
scientists around the globe to understand different elements of ocean
acidification which is considered to be an emerging threat in many
regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
