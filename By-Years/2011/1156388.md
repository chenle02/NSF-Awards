This award supports the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and
Research Experience for Teachers (RET) site in Physics at the University of
Minnesota - Twin Cities. In order to encourage students to pursue careers in
scientific research, the REU/RET provides an opportunity for students and high
school teachers to participate first hand in cutting-edge scientific research in
astrophysics, biophysics, condensed matter physics, cosmology, high energy
particle physics, nuclear physics, physics education, and space and planetary
physics. The students receive guidance in applying to graduate school, and
preparing for the Graduate Record Examination in Physics. Students get
experience and coaching on effective scientific communication including the
writing of a research report, a poster presentation, and an oral presentation of
their research results. Both students and teachers participate in safety and
ethics sessions to prepare them for physics research. To emphasize the bigger
intellectual picture, both populations are introduced to frontier physics
research outside the subject in which they are doing research. The high school
teachers are also introduced to the latest research on pedagogy and encouraged
to integrate their research experiences into their teaching by the Physics
Education Research Group. The teachers benefit from their interaction with the
students in the REU program as do the students in their interaction with the
teachers.
