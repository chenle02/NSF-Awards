The University of New Mexico-Los Alamos (UNMLA), in partnership with Los Alamos
National Laboratory (LANL) and Santa Fe Community College, is redesigning the
Applied Technologies (AT) associate's program to include degree concentrations
in electromechanical, solar, and nano-technology as an effort to prepare more
highly skilled technicians to support the region's emerging need for high-tech
employees in these areas. This critical need is given special urgency based on
the State of New Mexico's vision and plan for the development of a new "green"
economy.

The project involves an equipment overhaul, in addition to rigorous curriculum
and instructional improvements in the three content areas noted above. Targeting
high school students and teachers, the project articulates a career pathway for
underrepresented students that leads to participation in advanced technical
education, as well as opportunities at four year institutions . Problem-based
learning incorporating engineering design principles and an interdisciplinary
thematic approach guide the strategy for teaching and learning. The project also
supplements instruction with authentic internship experiences at supporting
companies and national laboratories. A total of 65 students will have moved
through the program at its completion. The project takes advantage of UNMLA's
pilot faculty share program supported by LANL and Santa Fe Community College as
a means to build institutional capacity and sustain the efforts of the work.
Thus, this important initiative serves as a model for revising and enhancing a
pre-existing degree program, specifically targeting underrepresented student
populations. The support and commitments at the state and local level ensure the
efforts to build capacity to meet the demands of the participating institutions
and the growing needs of the new economy.
