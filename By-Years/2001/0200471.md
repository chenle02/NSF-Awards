This planing grant plans to expand the research on Fuel Cells by creating an NSF
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Fuel Cell Research.
This center builds on the strength of electrochemical engineering in the
Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of South Carolina. The
center provides an opportunity to focus research, nationally and perhaps
internationally, to benefit commercialization of an environmentally friendly
technology with a $10 billion US economic potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
vision for the Center is to be recognized internationally for developing
mathematical models useful for PEMFC design; producing experimental data and
techniques that provide an understanding of PEMFC stack performance; studying
hydrogen storage materials, devices, and their interface with PEMFCs; and
developing new catalysts development for reforming hydrogen from hydrocarbon
fuels and the oxygen electrode.&lt;br/&gt;
