9602886 Kron The abundance of morphological and molecular evidence to date
consistently indicates that a new classification of the Ericaceae - an
ecologically and horticulturally important group which includes, for example,
azaleas, blueberries, and cranberries - is needed. This workshop, organized by
Professor Kathleen A. Kron of the Department of Biology, Wake Forest University,
and Dr. Paul A. Gadek of the Department of Botany and Tropical Agriculture,
James Cook University of North Queensland, Australia, will provide a forum for
the development of a new and modern(cladistic) classification based on all of
the newly available evidence developed in the United States and in Australia.
Classification of this nearly cosmopolitan group of plants is important because
it provides a reference point for many areas of research such as the study of
molecular evolution and the investigation of mycorrhizal associations in
Epacridaceae and Ericaceae. The workshop will provide opportunities for
Australian, US, and Swedish researchers to exchange information and develop new
collaborative projects. In particular, collaborations on evolutionary and
biogeographical questions within the southern hemisphere and Asian taxa will be
pursued.
