This award provides support for students to attend the 2011 Nonlinear Optics
(NLO) Topical Meeting, to be held July 17-22, 2011 in Kauai, Hawaii. The purpose
of this meeting is to provide an international forum for discussion of all
aspects of nonlinear optics, including new phenomena, novel devices, advanced
materials and applications. Nonlinear optical phenomena are being studied and
applied over a wide range of energies and powers, from single-photons to
petawatts, and over broad spectral regimes, from THz to X-ray frequencies. NLO
2011 will also celebrate 50 years of nonlinear optics through several devoted
presentations. This grant will make the conference more affordable for the
students' research groups, making it more likely that they can attend the
meeting.
