Algorithms for solving problems in optimization, enumeration, reliability
design, statistical mechanics and electronics will be studied on classes of
planar and near-planar graphs. The three main tools used to solve these problems
are (1) the delta-wye reduction (DWR) algorithm -- which reduces a planar graph
to a single edge by means of six elementary local tranformations, (2) the
Erickson-Monma-Veinott (EMV) algorithm -- a dynamic programming algorithm that
builds plane solution subgraphs up by patching together smaller subgraphs, and
(3) the shortest enclosing walk (SEW) algorithm -- which encloses specified
regions of the plane by a minimum length walk. The main concentration will be in
the following area: reliability and associated enumeration problems,
approximations schemes will be developed using the DWR algorithm to compute
various measures of connectivity, Steiner trees and related network design
problem, Ising models in statistical physics, and extensions and
generalizations.
