This research project will apply new methods emerging from molecular biology to
the area of plant systematic biology. The investigator will develop single copy
nuclear gene sequences for comparative study using the family Solanaceae as a
model system. Further applications of the methods will be made to higher level
phylogenies in the angiosperms. %%% Research of this type is fundamental to
understanding the basic lineage relationships among higher plants, many of which
may be of agronomic importance. Futhermore, methods developed under this project
will likely be valuable to a broad suite of other investigators.
