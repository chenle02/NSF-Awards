A central problem in Andean geophysics remains the accurate characterization of
the overriding plate, specifically its composition, style of deformation, and
thermal state. This collaborative proposal is for seismic analysis of digital
array data and broadband data to image that crust/mantle wedge in two diverse
Andean provinces: the region of flat subduction beneath central Peru, and the
region of the westward-stepping subduction complex that comprises the
northernmost Andes. Our objective is to map seismic structures in sufficient
detail and accuracy that the results may be applied to understanding the
dynamical and magmatic processes that shape the Andes. By combining these two
markedly different provinces in a single study we endeavor also to resolve
fundamental differences in deep structure between segments of the Andean arc.
