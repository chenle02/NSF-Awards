This research program will determine the role of internal ionic regulation in
maintaining the positive buoyancy of large oceanic diatoms, Rhizosolenia, using
a combined laboratory and field program. Previous work has shown that diatoms of
the genus Rhizosolenia are positively buoyant, and that this buoyancy can be
described by a size- dependant function of cell sap density and silicification.
This program will follow the buoyancy response of positively buoyant diatoms to
light and nutrient (N, P, Si) manipulations. The resulting changes in direction
and rate of movement will be related to variations in the cell sap ionic
composition and concentration of internal nutrient pools. Diel studies will
measure the temporal variation in buoyancy to determine its potential effect on
the vertical positioning of cells in relation to life-cycle phenomenon. The
potential for vertical migration in these diatoms for utilization of deep
nitrate pools will be specifically addressed in laboratory and field
experiments. This work represents the first focused analysis of positive
buoyancy in diatoms, a class of plankton previously assumed to be incapable of
directed upward movement in the euphotic zone.
