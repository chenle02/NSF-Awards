It is proposed that a Rigaku R-Axis IV imaging plate system for collection of
protein crystallographic and fiber diffraction data, a Silicon Graphics Indy XGE
computer to drive the imaging plate system, and a Silicon Graphics
Indigo2/R10000 workstation with Solid IMPACT graphics for computations using the
collected data be purchased for use in structural studies of viruses, proteins,
and nucleic acids by Drs. Stubbs, Newcomer, Kim, and others. The new equipment
will replace an antiquated data collection system mounted on an x-ray generator
that is almost 30 years old, and will upgrade an existing area detector that is
not capable of handling many of the crystallographic problems or anv of the
fiber diffraction problems under study
