Dr. Morton A. Heller, with the support of the National Science Foundation, will
study the perception of raised-line pictures that can be touched by people who
are visually impaired. This research aims to determine how to produce pictures
that best convey spatial information through the sense of touch. It will also
lead to knowledge about whether some viewpoints in tangible pictures are not
useful for people who were born without sight. In addition, the research will
tell us whether there are important differences in touch perception in sighted
and blind persons, and provide information about how to educate people to use
touch to cope with those differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on pictures
for blind people will have a broad impact on their education in the sciences.
Lack of information about how to produce good illustrations hampers the
education of persons who are blind. Many content areas in science are dependent
upon graphics and pictures, including biology, physics, mathematics, geography,
geology, and chemistry. The study of pictures that can be understood through the
sense of touch will advance access to science and mathematics for individuals
who are visually impaired.&lt;br/&gt;
