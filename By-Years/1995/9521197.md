9521197 Hennage The sixth OSA Topical Meeting on Optical Computing explores the
applications of optics in computing, interconnections, and information
processing with invited and contributed oral presentations and posters. Papers
are solicited in all facets of optics in computing from materials, devices and
components, to architectures, algorithms and applications. Germane topics
include system demonstrations in digital optical computing, optical neural
networks, and novel optical processing architectures, development of active and
passive components, devices and materials, and progress in techniques and
subsystems such as optical interconnections, optical memory, and optical logic.
