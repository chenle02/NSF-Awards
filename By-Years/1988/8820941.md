A fire in a small but important telephone switching station caused loss
situations that affected, in one way or another, much of the United States.
Everything from a large number of automatic teller machines, bank and brokerages
to aircraft trying to land at O'Hare International Airport were affected. The
objective of this research is to track all of the losses and attendant costs
that resulted from this single structure loss situation. Losses in terms of
revenue, jobs, increased costs of fire and police et cetera, will be tracked
through the system in order to develop an understanding of the importance of
these types of situations to the nation and to the individual suppliers of goods
and services. The model created can then be considered for introduction to
earthquake, wind and flood economic loss models.
