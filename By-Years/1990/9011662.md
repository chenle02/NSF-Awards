A multidisciplinary study of fire, grazing and fire-grazing interactions on
population, community and ecosystem properties will be continued on Konza
Prairie, a native tallgrass prairie site in northeastern Kansas. The proposed
research builds and expands upon a ten-year study of fire frequency effects on
tallgrass prairie. Previous and proposed LTER efforts will continue to provide
long-term data and baseline studies such as those that spawned a series of
intensive short-term experiments and manipulations supported by NSF, NASA, USGS
and state funds. Results from these previous studies have been incorporated into
current LTER measurements and questions. The goal of the proposed research is to
understand how grazing influences biotic and ecosystem processes and patterns
imposed by fire frequency over the landscape mosaic, all of which are subjected
to a variable (and possibly directional) climate regime. A new, landscape-level
study linking surface and ground water chemistry will interface with ongoing
measurements to provide a landscape emphasis to ecological research. The new
focus involves topotedaphic effects and landscape interactions influencing
ecological phenomena; specifically, the relationship between geomorphic patterns
and ecological constraints (fire and/or grazing) from the perspective of the
individual organism to the watershed level. These efforts are necessary if
ecologists are to integrate their research to scales where biotic processes may
adequately be incorporated with climate models. The Konza Prairie LTER research
team has made important contributions on the area of atmosphere-biosphere
interactions, Institutional support for this research is outstanding.
