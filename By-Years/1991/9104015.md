This research continues earlier work, investigating bilattices in the context of
logic programming. There are two general areas of exploration involved. First,
develop tableau-based algorithms for linear bilattices, and for more general
classes of bilattices, and implement them experimentally. Along with this goes
the investigation of logic programming languages based on these bilattices.
Second, continue the theoretical investigation of bilattices, in particular the
development of bilattice-valued modal logics. Such logices will be much more
expressive than conventional modal logics, and more natural for applications.
Experimentation will begin with classical logic then, if successful, will
continue to modal logics, and finally to bilattice-valued modal logics.
