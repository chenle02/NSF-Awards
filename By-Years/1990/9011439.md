This research is to study the Loma Prieta earthquake using strong ground motion
stations and aftershock recordings to (a) map the variability of the fault zone
structure along the rupture zone of the Loma Prieta earthquake to locate fault
irregularities controlling rupture initiation, termination, and complexities;
(b) incorporate known broad regional three dimensional structure in the modeling
of the complete set of strong ground motion data within 50 km of the epicenter
to determine whether effects of known three dimensional structure can explain
any of the observed variations in intensity of ground motion; and (c) derive
corrections to rupture models based on the assumption of plane layered
structure.
