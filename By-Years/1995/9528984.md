The objective of this project is to create a database of children's read speech
with the digital quality needed for speech research. Such data is unavailable
today, but essential to achieving effective speech communication between
children and machines. The methods to be employed include selecting appropriate
texts to be read, recording good and poor readers, labelling the speech,
verifying the quality of the labels, and organizing the data into an easily
accessible form. A database of children's speech is a key enabling condition for
applications in education, entertainment, and other socially and economically
important fields. Expected direct impact of the work includes making the
database available to the Linguistic Data Consortium for distribution to speech
researchers. Applications include an automated reading coach that listens to
children read aloud, and helps when needed. A prototype of such a coach was
developed with previous NSF support, but its usability and robustness were
limited because its speech recognizer was trained on adult speech. A children's
speech database is necessary to achieve the required accuracy in listening.
