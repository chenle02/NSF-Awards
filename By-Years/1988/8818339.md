The major thrust of this research project is a detailed investigation of a low
voltage direct current meshed transmission system. The system in this study
shall consist of a meshed superconducting system with isolated generation and
many small inverter taps to move power from generators to ac loads. Several key
issues are central to this investigation: understanding the behavior of a meshed
superconducting network in conjunction with a directly-connected form of
generation, the voltage levels, the classes of inverters and the methods of
control of the resulting ac/dc system. This research is being jointly funded by
the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).
