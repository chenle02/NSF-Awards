A systematic revision of a species-group within a large genus of lichen moths
will be completed using morphological traits of adult and immature specimens.
The project will include cladistic analysis of adult museum specimens, leading
to clearer understanding of ancestor-descendant relationships. Field work and
rearing experiments in Peru will add to our ecological understanding of the
genus Agylla. A phylogenetic framework for the moths will set the stage for
later research into the coevolution of moths and their host- lichens, and the
evolution of the moths' mating system. Graduate student Nancy Jacobson will
pursue this research, and her project will help in scientific exchange with the
research community in Peru.
