This project aims at advancing the understanding of nondipole dipole
(E1)-quadrupole (E2) interference effects in atomic photoionization, at
advancing the understanding of quantum confined structures, and at fostering
integration of research and education at the University of North Alabama.
Specifically: To learn about the strength of E1-E2 effects in regions of
gigantic quadrupole autoionizing resonances in atoms developing nd and/or nf
orbital collapse (essentially all transition and rare-earth atoms). To establish
trends in the behavior of quadrupole Rydberg structures interacting with
gigantic quadrupole autoionizing resonances of which little or nothing is known
to date. To learn about E1-E2 effects within dipole autoionizing minima in atoms
with large Fano profile parameter q. nance maxima, as in Tl, thus possibly
resulting in strong E1-E2 effects far off the resonance maxima. To develop a
quantum defect theory of confined atomic systems under conditions of incomplete
short-range confining screening. New unique classes of interchannel phenomena
arising due to crossings between Rydberg states and cavity related resonances
are expected to be revealed. To work out the foundations of spectroscopy of
atoms A trapped under conditions of incomplete charged quantum confinement.
Hartree-Fock approximations and the many-body random phase approximation with
exchange (RPAE) will be employed in the study. UNA undergraduate students will
actively be engage in research.
