The International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases for Plant Sciences (also
known as TDWG) has been a unique force in developing data standards for
botanical information. Their efforts have produced the ability to move data
among many participating computer installations. At an upcoming TDWG meeting in
Delphi, Greece, an international assemblage of botanists, information
specialists, and computer scientists will collaborate on a design for a global
information system for the plant sciences. They will draft an action plan and
specifications for efforts that will extend over the next decade and potentially
span all countries of the world. Access to information on plants, their
geographic distribution, and their ecology and taxonomy is critical to many
fields. Biologists, land use planners, political economists, and even the
military have long-term needs for accurate data concerning plants. Except for
the efforts of TDWG, most of the energy expended on botanical data have been at
the level of single institutions, such as an herbarium, botanical garden, or
agriculture department within a university. The Delphi symposium will capitalize
on these efforts, and set a productive new course for global collaboration.
