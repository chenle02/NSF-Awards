Lower Rampart Cave 1 is significant as one of only three known arctic caves
containing deposits in eastern Beringia which span the late-Quaternary. Among
the three arctic caves, it is unique in containing the oldest, least disturbed
and most complete stratigraphic record. Paleoenvironmental analysis of this
important cave deposit will provide objective new data necessary to resolve some
of the vigorously debated hypotheses regarding the nature of the late
Pleistocene/early Holocene environment of eastern Beringia, a hypothesis known
as the Productivity Paradox. As part of a larger on-going study, this research
consists of five components: 1) sediment analysis, 2) large mammal taphonomy, 3)
fossil pollen analysis, 4) charcoal species identification, and 5) accelerator
dating. These analyses will contribute significant new data essential to
understanding the full-glacial environment of eastern Beringia, the timing and
nature of the faunal and floral transition between the late Pleistocene and the
Holocene, and the abiotic response to the climatic amelioration following late-
Wisconsin glaciation.
