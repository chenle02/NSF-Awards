Peter Rossky is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his work in the area of quantum simulation of
chemical dynamics in solution. This research focuses on both the development and
application of mixed quantum and classical mechanical simulation methods for the
description of chemical processes in solution. Emphasis is placed on the
simulation of nonadiabatic quantum dynamics. The work will address in detail: 1)
The fundamental molecular level description of the solvent modes associated with
the non-radiative relaxation of solute excited electronic states in liquid
solution; 2) New applications of algorithms for quantum nonadiabatic simulation
to the dynamics of molecular photoionization and to intramolecular charge
transfer dynamics in both aqueous and non-aqueous solution; 3) The development
and implementation of new algorithms for nonadiabatic quantum dynamics; and 4)
Generalization and testing of current nonadiabatic algorithms with emphasis on
an analysis of the role of quantum coherence in the results obtained in the
condensed phase. The majority of chemical reactions occur in solution. This fact
has stimulated a tremendous research effort to elucidate a set of unifying
principles describing chemical dynamics in liquids. To fully address this issue
requires a detailed understanding of both the molecular motions that occur
during the course of a chemical event and the energy flow within the solute and
between the solute and the solvent. Exceptional recent progress in clarifying
these aspects has been made. Advances in laser technology enable direct
experimental measurement of dynamical behavior of chemical systems on the time
scale of the fundamental events. At the same time, significant advances have
been made in theoretical methods and models used in describing solution
chemistry. Rossky's research in the development of new computational algorithms
will allow for both cl assical and quantum mechanical dynamical simulations of
phenomena on time scales accessible by these new experimental techniques.
