Regulation of Gibberellin Biosynthesis: The present proposal identified three
primary objectives to elucidate the sites of biosynthesis of the plant hormone,
gibberellic acid and how the biosynthesis is regulated: 1) to determine the
capacity of cell free enzyme systems derived from various tissues and organs of
pea seedlings to synthesize the hormone; 2) to characterize the mixed function
oxidases affecting the intermediates, kaurene, kaurenol and kaurenoic acid; and
3) to investigate the stimulation of gibberellin synthesis by light in the
fungus Gibberella fujikuroi. The regulation of levels of the phytohormone by
localization of synthesis, by inhibition or enhancement of enzyme activities and
by modulation of enzyme biosynthesis controls plant growth and development. The
knowledge will be useful for manipulating plants to make them higher yielding,
easier to germinate, more attractive and more predictable in terms of flowering
and fruit setting.
