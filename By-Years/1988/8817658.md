Hydrothermal circulation at spreading centers is governed by the thermal regime
and permeability structure of young ocean crust; thus, it is inextricably
coupled to the volcano-tectonic processes along spreading centers. For virtually
all spreading centers the interrelationships between hydrothermal, magmatic, and
tectonic processes are poorly known because fine-scale mapping of the sea-floor
has been restricted to very small segments of ridge crest. The present
recommended award will rectify this situation for a major segment of the East
Pacific Rise. Using the ARGO deep ocean search vehicle, the project will acquire
both side-scan sonar and bottom photography from a one hundred mile long segment
of this spreading center. This region has already been intensively studied using
surface geological and geophysical techniques and the overall crustal structure
is therefore well known. Objectives of the present project are: 1) to map the
location of hydrothermal vents, 2) relate vent distribution to faulting and
recent volcanic activity, and 3) determine the effect of ridge discontinuities
on volcanic and hydrothermal activity. Data acquired during the survey will also
be critical in locating sites for deep sea drilling to sample ocean crust.
