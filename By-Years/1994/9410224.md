9410224 Lumpp Economical manufacturing of high density microelectronic circuits
depends on two critical factors: fabrication of fine pitch electrical
interconnections and cost reduction by integration of processing steps. Both of
these issues are addressed by using ultraviolet light to define circuit
patterns. The new procedures utilize ultraviolet excimer lasers to locally
decompose AIN and A12O3 surfaces to pattern high resolution metal lines for
additive deposition of films without photolithography processing. Laser assisted
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) from dimethylaluminum hydride produces a
patterned seed layer by direct writing with the laser beam. Thin films are grown
by selective area thermal CVD on the decomposed and seeded regions. In practice,
adhesion of thick films on AIN has been poor due to nitrogen bubbles formed when
the glass phase in the ink oxidizes the substrate. Thick film density is
improved by screen printing onto decomposed regions so that the metallized
surface is oxidized without blistering the film. Metallized vias are fabricated
by laser ablation of the substrate and a detachable metal backing. Electrical
properties of films, vias and laser modified surfaces are correlated with
chemical analysis results and evaluation of microstructural development. ***
