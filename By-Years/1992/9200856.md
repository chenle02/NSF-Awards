Unique and threatened habitats in the midsouth Coastal Plain will be surveyed
for mites, Microlepidoptera (moths), and caddisflies, which are major components
of the biodiversity present in soil and aquatic microhabitats and on plant
hosts. Unique habitats to be surveyed in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi
include inland and coastal prairies, coastal savannahs and dunes, bottomland
hardwood forest, mesophytic forests on loessal hills, and selected streams and
other aquatic habitats. These habitats are threatened by urbanization, clear-
cutting of forests, agricultural practices, proposed placement of regional
hazardous waste dumps, and stream channelization and pollution. Four senior
researchers from Mississippi State University will be assisted by collaborators
to document the fauna with use of a wide array of collecting methods. Larvae of
leafminers and stem-root borers will be reared to obtain data on host plants and
life histories. The survey will result in publications that document morphology,
ecology, biogeography, and systematics of mites, microlepidoptera, and
Trichoptera in the midsouth. The survey also will provide biodiversity data for
documenting the need for habitat conservation.
