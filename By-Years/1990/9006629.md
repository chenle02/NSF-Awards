This is a proposal on the acquisition of a material testing system for the
Advanced Civil Engineering Materials Research Laboratory at the University of
Michigan. The Testing System for Advanced Materials consists of a MTS 55 KIP
load frame, a 22 KIP actuator,load cells service manifold, servovalve, Micro
Console, strain and load Controller, stroke controller, Micro Profiler with
RS232 interface, 1.5 GPM hydraulic power supply, alignment fixture, automated
control and data acquisition system hardware and software hydraulically operated
side entry grips, collet grips, axial extensometer and clip gage. The system is
configured for testing of brittle, high modulus samples, etc, in quasi-static
monotonic to cyclic fatigue loads.
