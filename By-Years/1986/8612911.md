Network location problems involve locating one or more new facilities on a
network, such as a transport network, when costs of some sort are incurred which
are proportional to network travel distances between new facilities and existing
facilites on the network, as well as possibly to distances between new
facilities. The new facilities are to be located on the network so as to
minimize an objective function. The principal approach to solving such problems
in the past, when the problems have been continuous (considering all possible
locations on every link) has been to exploit network structure. Recently it has
been shown that many such continuous problems may be formulated as mathematical
programming problems (well-defined mathematical optimization problems). This
research will focus on solving continuous network location problems by
exploiting connections with mathematical programming. Since the latter field is
quite highly developed, the opportunities for improving our ability to solve
network location problems appear very promising.
