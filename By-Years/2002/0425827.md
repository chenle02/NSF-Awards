While existing observations suggest that arctic plant communities undergo
dramatic changes in species composition, net primary productivity (NPP), and
biomass in response to climate warming and subsequent increased soil nutrient
mineralization, current models used to predict carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)
cycling in arctic tundra are lacking inclusion of higher trophic levels and,
thus, are missing mechanisms that may be having considerable effects. Funds are
proided to concurrently measure plants, soil invertebrates and microbes (biomass
and diversity) as they respond to increased soil nutrients to test ecological
theory regarding such changes and understand feedbacks among trophic levels. The
proposed work addresses whether we are witnessing simple&lt;br/&gt;increases and
subtle shifts in the ecosystem components or fundamental changes in the
ecosystem that have the potential to alter the current balance of biota, carbon
and nitrogen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theory suggests that when NPP increases,
additional trophic levels should enter the system because there is now enough
energy to sustain them. These changes will be more dramatic in lower NPP
systems, such as arctic tundra, because the dynamics are not linear. The study
will examine how soil communities and nutrient cycling respond to changes in
plant growth and how these responses compare between two common arctic
ecosystems that differ in NPP, dry heath and moist acidic tussock tundra. It
will use existing experimental plots of the Arctic LTER at Toolik Lake, Alaska
to test these hypotheses at the plot scale under long-term nutrient enrichment
and will establish new smaller-scale nutrient amendment experiments on which
more localized and frequent plant and soil sampling will occur to capture a
temporal and spatial scale more appropriate for soil organisms. Theoretical and
empirically-based models will be used to aid in the analysis and
interpretation.&lt;br/&gt;
