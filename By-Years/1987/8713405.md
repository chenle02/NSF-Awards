Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)/Electron-Nuclear Double Resonance (ENDOR)
spectroscopy allows chemists to conduct extremely precise high resolution
studies on materials containing unpaired electrons (paramagnetic compounds).
Such studies reveal information on molecular structure that is unavailable by
any other technique. The Department of Chemistry at Princeton will purchase an
EPR/ENDOR spectrometer with the help of this award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program. The areas of chemistry that will be enhanced by this
acquisition include the following: 1) Metallo-enzymes and synthetic analogs in
photosynthesis 2) Surface chemistry at semi-conductor and electrolyte interfaces
3) Metal-oxo and metal-peroxo intermediates in oxidative catalysis 4) The
migration and trapping of exciton states in crystals by impurity ions 5)
Determination of the nuclear moments of unstable isotopes of elements 6)
Mechanistic studies of alpha-ketoacid dioxygenases 7) Determination of odd-
electron intermediates in organometallic reagent development 8) Mechanisms in
organic synthesis using transition metal ions 9) Magnetic resonance in dense
low-dimensional solids 10) Metal centers in biology: hemes, iron-sulfur and
copper proteins
