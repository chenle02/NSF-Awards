"Objectivity" has surely always been the goal of scientific research. Yet recent
history, philosophy, and sociology of science studies challenge the very
foundations of the assertions of objectivity in science. Professor Daston, under
this grant, is examining not the contemporary debate about objectivity in
science, but the historical development of our modern view of objectivity. She
is preparing an examination of the history of the ideals and practices of
objectivity in the natural sciences from the rise of modern science in the 17th
century to about 1925 with the development of quantum theory with its
"uncertainty principle." Her study will trace the historical transformation of
scientific objectivity, revealing the range of alternative meanings it has taken
on since 1600. Each of these alternatives is rooted in the daily workings of
science--experimental techniques, metaphysical assumptions about determinism and
variability in nature, patterns of professional sociability, theoretically
grounded rules of evidence, division of scientific labor, a carefully cultivated
sensibility that spans impartiality to self-effacement. Not only the attitudes
but also the objects of objectivity evolve, creating sharply contrasting
prototypes of what counts as a fact in science. The concept and conduct of
objectivity are specific to discipline as well as to historical period:
astronomy, natural history, the physics of electricity, and experimental
physiology all evolved distinctive brands of objectivity in the 18th and 19th
centuries. By showing that objectivity itself has a history, Professor Daston
hopes to illuminate our own confused usage of the term which refers to
metaphysics, methods, and morals.
