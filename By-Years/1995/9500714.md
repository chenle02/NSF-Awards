This award supports the research of Professor Richard Stanley in the field of
algebraic combinatorics. Stanley will continue his research in two main areas:
(a) convex polytopes and related geometric objects, and their connections with
algebra, geometry and topology, and (b) symmetric functions, representation
theory, and their applications to combinatorics. This research is in the general
area of Combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study
how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete
systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design
of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design
of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this
makes use of combinatorial research.
