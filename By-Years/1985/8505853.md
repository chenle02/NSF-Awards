In this study, research on the dynamic behavior of inflatable dams will be
undertaken. Such dams are used in the United States, Australia, and other
countries for water impoundment, flood control, diversion of flow, raising
spillway elevations, and other purposes. They also have potential application as
a transportable flood control device. Even though a few of these dams have
failed dynamically, published analyses have only considered static forces and
deflections. The vibrations and dynamic response of inflatable dams will be
studied systematically. The dams may be inflated by air, water, or a combination
of air and water. The dam material acts like a membrane and cannot sustain
bending or compression. The effects of various assumptions related to the fluid
and membrane properties, such as incompressibility and inextensibility, will be
investigated. Particular attention will be focused on conditions for local or
global instability of the dam.
