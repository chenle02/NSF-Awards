This proposal seeks funding to support a faculty member to be resident at NSF
for the purposes of studying LIS proposals, funded projects, and related high
technology sites with educational mandates for their potential benefit for
education, generally, and educational research in particular. The study would
proceed in the manner of case study formative evaluation plan that would include
site visits, and holding workshops on themes similar to the ones addressed
above. The outcome of this SGER would be a set of papers for presentation to NSF
and other interested audiences leading, perhaps to a publication that would
allow NSF to inform the field of educational researchers about NSF's research
and development agenda in light of the innovations of LIS and, ultimately,
Knowledge and Distributed Intelligence. Other outcomes could include the
dissemination of these recommendations in other formats including conference
presentations.
