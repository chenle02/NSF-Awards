Intellectual Merit: The purpose of this project is to provide financial
assistance to&lt;br/&gt;engineering students to attend the 2003 American Control
Conference (ACC 2003),&lt;br/&gt;sponsored by the American Automatic Control
Council. The focus of the conference will&lt;br/&gt;center on theoretical
issues, engineering methodologies, and industrial applications in
all&lt;br/&gt;areas of control research and development.&lt;br/&gt;The primary
goal of this project is to expose students to current advances in
control&lt;br/&gt;theory and applications. As part of a new initiative, the PI
will organize student-oriented&lt;br/&gt;sessions for ACC 2002 to help these
future professional engineers prepare for their&lt;br/&gt;careers. Travel
support for student attendees, in the form of ACC 2003 Student
Travel&lt;br/&gt;Grants, will be advertised nationally. Women, minorities, and
disabled students will be&lt;br/&gt;especially encouraged to
apply.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts resulting from the Proposed Activity: Graduate
students who&lt;br/&gt;attend the conference and participate in the student-
oriented activities are likely to&lt;br/&gt;pursue careers in the field of
control theory and its applications.
