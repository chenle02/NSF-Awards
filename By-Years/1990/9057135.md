Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will focus on the strong
nuclear interactions. An attempt will be made to show how quantum
chromodynamics, the theory of these interactions, makes bound states of light
quarks look from the outside like the single, heavier quarks suggested by
experiment as the constituents of matter. This work, to be carried out by one of
the new Presidential Young Investigators for 1990, is important to our
understanding of the structure of matter.
