The primary aim of the proposed research is the development of static scheduling
techniques for multiple, multifunctional and reconfigurable pipelined
operational units. Such units are the key elements of high performance computing
engines. A voracious pipeline scheduling algorithm driven by the earliest
completion time of tasks is proposed. The method provides good schedules at the
basic block level. The intention is to extend it by researching and implementing
the following concepts: static scheduling technique(s) for pipelined functional
units with ability to handle branching, exceptions and global code motion, and a
timing-resource model for the pipelined resources that will facilitate
retargetable code generation for the pipelined resources. The plan is to test
the concepts using the research version of the retargetable microcode compiler
developed in the Firmware Engineering Laboratory. Since the control of most high
performance computing engines is done at the firmware level, the scheduling
techniques are geared towards microcode implementations. In order to accomplish
the task of imbedding the pipeline schedules in the microcode one needs to
develop a model for pipelined resources that facilitate the (retargetable)
microcode generation for the pipelined resources. The significance of the
proposed research lies in the pursuit of the quality (micro)coded control of the
high performance, specialized computing engines. Major application areas are:
realtime digital signal processing, computer vision and graphics, and related to
these areas, specialized scientific computation.
