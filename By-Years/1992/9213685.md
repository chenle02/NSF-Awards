This award is to research and develop an ultrasonic based sensor for the in-
situ monitoring of the precipitation hardening process in materials, in close
cooperation with an industrial co- sponsor. This will enable the on-line
monitoring and control of heat treatment facilities in aircraft manufacturing
plants with improvements in manufacturing efficiency and quality. The basis of
sensor design approach is the relationship between sound wave velocity and the
elastic moduli and elastic behavior of the material in the proximity of
metallurgical reactions, such as precipitation hardening. The development of
this sensing capability, in close coordination with a major aerospace
manufacturer, will foster a relationship between academic and industry
participants, while improving the efficiency of an operation in the
manufacturing sector.
