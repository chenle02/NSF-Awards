Difficulties in passing required mathematics courses often discourage young STEM
majors, leading them to leave STEM for other fields. Based on the success of
STEPMT: STEPping up Undergraduate Research at Middle Tennessee State University,
the Type 1-B Mathematics as a FirstSTEP to Success in STEM project focuses on
interventions addressing math deficiencies which place freshman STEM majors who
are at risk of not graduating as STEM majors into an intensive academic and
student support environment. FirstSTEP Is a broad-based project that targets
students from all STEM disciplines who are underprepared in mathematics.

First-time, full-time freshman students, who are at-risk based on mathematics
ACT test scores, participate in an intensive two-year program that includes a
mathematics bridge program before their freshman year followed by an
individualized study plan using technology and human interventions. The cohorts
of students complete pre-calculus in the fall semester and Calculus I in the
spring semester along with a one-credit semester during the academic year. The
one-credit course adopts and implements an effective professional seminar model
in which students learn the knowledge and skills associated with successful STEM
professionals. During the summer between their freshman and sophomore years,
cohorts participate in a one-month, intensive, inquiry-based exploration
utilizing mathematics that is connected to their major field of study. During
the sophomore year, the cohorts of students enroll in a one-credit semester
designed to develop skills to prepare them for undergraduate research and to
mentor the next freshman cohorts.

In addition, First STEP builds on current projects aimed at increasing
graduation rates of all STEM majors by addressing the high DFW rates in pre-
calculus and calculus. Pedagogies, such as Peer Led Team Learning, stretch
courses, and individualized study plans, are used and tested during the summer
bridge program and then are integrated into pre-calculus and Calculus I courses
for all students, STEM majors and students in other majors. With changes in the
courses, more aspiring STEM majors, who are underprepared in mathematics,
experience success in their mathematics courses and consequently continue in
their STEM studies.
