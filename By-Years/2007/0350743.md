ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0350743&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research team successfully completed a two-year tracer and turbulence field
study in the Tropical North Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, in an area prone
to salt-finger instability. Preliminary results from the experiment are that the
vertical diffusivity of the passive tracer in the area showing signs of salt-
fingering was 4-5 times greater than elsewhere. Diffusivity for heat was about
half that of the tracer, and that the energy dissipation was much smaller than
would be expected for shear-driven mixing, both of which are expected for mixing
due to salt fingers. This project is for the extended analysis of the data from
the field study with the following objectives: to accurately determine the
vertical mixing of tracer and heat within the staircase region and outside of
it; to evaluate the roles of shear and salt finger instability in the formation
and maintenance of staircases and the enhancement of mixing; to develop a
parameterization of diffusivities of heat and salt in regions of the ocean
susceptible to salt fingering for use in numerical models; to evaluate the role
of enhanced mixing in the staircase region in regional transport of heat and
salt and in water mass modification; to analyze the efficient zonal dispersion
of the tracer patch, and lateral mixing and stirring of the tracer patch with
the help of numerical models; and to publish the results of the research. The
project will have broader impacts through the training of a graduate student,
international collaborations and contribution to parameterizations for modeling.
