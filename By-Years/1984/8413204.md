Highway bridges in the U.S. are fast approaching their design life of 50 years.
As a result, they are in need of repair, strengthening, or replacement within a
short period of time. This project will investigate the static strength of
upgraded composite steel girders that are prestressed with a construction
sequence identical to that used in field applications. Currently there is no
experimental data available in the literature. The research will study load-
deflection characteristics, ductility, redundancy, and reliability of
prestressed steel girders under static loads using bonded and unbonded tendons
applied in a straight and draped profile. The results will be of great benefit
to bridge engineers.
