The biology faculty are committed to improving the curriculum for biology majors
in cell and subcellular biology. This project funds an ultracentrifuge and
microcentrifuges to help the faculty achieve the next step to an improved
curriculum. Integration of the new equipment into the program is outlined as two
phases: (1) the implementation of new, investigative laboratory exercises that
are not possible without the equipment and (2) involvement of more students in
molecular research. Seven courses are significantly enhanced, including General
Biology, Bacteriology, General Ecology, Genetics, Cell and Molecular Biology,
Animal Physiology, and Plant Physiology.
