For a variety of reasons, fiscal consolidation is the order of the day in many
industrialized and developing countries. The purpose of this research is to
investigate the determinants, macroeconomic effects, political effects, and
durability of fiscal consolidations. The project is organized around three main
sets of issues. First, the macroeconomic effects of fiscal adjustments. Recent
work in this area has shown that these are likely to depend on the composition
of the adjustment. This issue is analyzed via a systematic investigation based
on relatively unstructured vector auto regressions using both quarterly and
annual data on 20 OECD countries. In addition, the role of policies such as
monetary and exchange rate policies that have accompanied fiscal consolidations
is investigated . Furthermore, this research will go deeper into the composition
of consolidations by using a more refined breakdown than has been done so far.
Second, the political consequences of consolidations. This is obviously an issue
of primary importance. Hence, what happened to governments that consolidate is
analyzed, with particular regard to the effects of spending cuts vs. tax
increases. Third, the political determinants of consolidations, with particular
regard to the notion of fragmentation of the executive and the role of budget
institutions, both of which have played and important role in the theoretical
literature are investigated in a systematic way. All these issues are
investigated for OECD countries and US states and localities.
