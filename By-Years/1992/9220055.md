The superoxide dismutases (SODs) are a family of metalloenzymes that defend
against toxic oxygen species. While bacteria ordinarily contain MnSOD, FeSOD, or
both in the cytoplasm, a small number contain a periplasmic CuZnSOD, called
bacteriocuprein. The periplasmic location of bacteriocupreins suggests that they
defend against oxyradical stress originating outside the cell. The goal of this
project is to investigate the physiological function and structure of this SOD
type in bacterial species exposed to external oxyradical stress. Two bacterial
cell models will be studied. Caulobacter crescentus, a pond bacterium that
tolerates high concentrations of oxygen, and Legionella pneumophila, a pulmonary
pathogen that escapes oxygen-dependent killing by macrophages. In C. crescentus,
SOD function will be studied by measuring transcriptional activation in gene
fusions of periplasmic CuZnSOD and cytoplasmic FeSOD. In L. pneumophila the
CuZnSOD gene will be cloned and a mutant lacking CuZnSOD will be constructed and
characterized. In these studies, the mutants and gene fusion strains will be
exposed to internal and external oxyradical stresses. In addition, the ability
to invade, multiply and to grow in a HL-60 macrophage system will be studied for
the L. pneumophila mutants. %%% Many microorganisms can be killed by toxic forms
of oxygen, a gas we breath, but a few types of bacteria are resistant. It has
been proposed that the resistant bacteria survive because they can make special
enzymes that fight against the energized, toxic forms of oxygen. One unusual
enzyme that can fight against "toxic" oxygen was discovered in my laboratory.
This basic research project will study the structure of the unusual enzyme and
determine how it works to destroy "toxic" oxygen, thereby allowing the cells to
survive and grow in its presence.
