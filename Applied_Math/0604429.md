A system of differential equations is called a cell. A coupled cell network is a
collection of cells that are coupled together and the architecture of that
network is a graph that indicates which cells are identical and which cells are
coupled to which. The primary question addressed by this proposal is: What part
of the dynamics of coupled systems is due to network architecture? The theory of
these systems was developed with recent NSF support: we will continue its
development by focusing on bifurcations and forcing of feedforward networks,
stability of solutions obtained by bifurcation, and bursting in coupled systems.
We will also focus more directly on applications including the vestibular system
(in particular, the network of connections between neurons of the six
semicircular canals in the ears and eight neck muscle groups), the development
of a frequency filter/amplifier associated to synchrony breaking Hopf
bifurcation in a simple feedforward network, and `cortical songs' obtained from
different dynamical patterns in coupled phase oscillators.

The biologist J.B.S. Haldane, when asked what we can learn about the Creator by
examining the world, replied that God seemed to have an inordinate fondness for
beetles. Today's biologists could be forgiven for pointing to the deity's
inordinate fondness for networks. Networks are ubiquitous in biology: examples
include gene expression, neural circuitry, ecological food webs, and disease
transmission. Networks are also common in many other branches of science, and
there has been a recent explosion of interest in the topic. The research
literature, including applications, now extends to many thousands of papers. We
have been developing a theory of network dynamics, where the nodes in the
network are systems of differential equations. In this proposal we focus on some
generalizations of the theory and on specific applications including the
dynamics associated to a network in the vestibular system called the canal-neck
projection.
