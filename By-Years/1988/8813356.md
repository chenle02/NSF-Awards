An image analysis system for fluorescence microscopy will be developed which
incorporates state-of-the-art image acquisition technology. The project will
result in the development of instruments and techniques for detailed biomass
measurements of the pico- and nanoplankton components of the microbial food web.
While video technology is the most common method of image acquisition, it is not
particularly well suited for accurate, quantitative imaging in the low light
environment of fluorescence microscopy. Video systems are limited by low
sensitivity, non- linear response, and a narrow dynamic range. Digital cameras
incorporating cooled, solid-state charged-coupled devices (CCDs), however, are
now available with excellent characteristics of photon sensitivity, spatial and
gray scale reolution, response linearity and quantum efficiency. These imaging
devices overcome the major problems of video systems which limit their
usefulness for quantitative image analyzed fluorescence microscopy. Development
will be directed toward a system capable of ship- board use to allow rapid size
spectra and biomass measurements of the bacteria and protists at sea as part of
the Global Ocean Flux Study.
