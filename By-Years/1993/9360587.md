9360587 Daughton Spin valve materials have great application potential in
Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM), tape or disk read heads and
magnetic field sensors. However, positive coupling between the two magnetic
layers is always present in so-called "uncoupled" spin valve materials today and
presents a roadblock for the widespread use of those materials. this coupling
reduces the effective anisotropy field for MRAM memory cells, reduces field
sensitivity for sensors and may prevent "single domain" behavior in spin valve
devices. Positive coupling is believed to be caused by correlated roughness of
the interfaces of the magnetic layers through a dipole-to-dipole coupling
effect. To obtain truly uncoupled spin valve materials, MER proposes a number of
approaches o the spin valve materials using industry-standard equipment. Some of
the proposed approaches may also induce a beneficial antiferromagnetic exchange
coupling.
