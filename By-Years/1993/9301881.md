Electroplating of fasteners generates large amounts of solid and liquid waste.
A unique dry plating method has been developed to address this concern. This
method eliminates liquid chemicals and minimizes solid waste. A process model
has been successfully developed that predicts the cumulative effect of
independent process variables on the deposition rate and the grain size. The
data generated has indicated that the dry plating is a promising and safe
alternative to electrochemical plating. A cadmium dry plating apparatus suitable
for plating fasteners will be developed and the environmental and occupational
safety standards of this process will be investigated. The dry plating process
will be developed and modeled to study the quality of the coatings which are
needed in the fastener industry. If this quality can be obtained in an
environmentally safe manner, the dry plating has a substantial potential for
plating large quantities of fasteners.
