1602192&lt;br/&gt;Shepherd&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Division of Earth Science
Instrumentation and Facilities Program grant supports acquisition of a Ground
Penetrating Radar (GPR) system with multiple antennas in a range of frequencies
to support non-invasive imaging investigations of the structure and properties
of the near subsurface. The instrument will support research and research
training in the Department of Geosciences at Auburn. The lead PI is an early
career, female geoscientist with plans to engage underrepresented middle school
students in rural Alabama in locally relevant environmental research using the
requested GPR. This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the
progress of science and advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare
given the importance of training the next generation scientific workforce in
modern techniques of geophysical remote sensing and the societal importance of
understanding the impacts of river restoration programs and extent of historical
seismic hazards in the central U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GPR permits non-
invasive investigation of the dielectric properties of near surface sediments
and can yield insights into near surface stratigraphic relationships and
materials properties. The GPR will support studies of Quaternary fluvial
processes and landscape evolution, investigation of flood plain restoration
strategies in watersheds that impact Mobile Bay Estuary, and paleoseismic
investigations of earthquake induced liquefaction from historic earthquakes in
the New Madrid mid-continent seismic zone.
