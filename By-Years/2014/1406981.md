This project concerns research in the Theory of Numbers, in particular questions
related to the distribution of prime numbers. This topic has advanced
considerably during the past year due to the breakthrough work of Zhang and
Maynard on small gaps between consecutive prime numbers, where previous work of
Fouvry, Iwaniec, and Friedlander played a crucial role. One of the most
fundamental open questions in modern mathematics is the Riemann hypothesis,
which connects the distribution of prime numbers with the distribution of
complex zeros of the generating zeta function. The hypothesis asserts that all
these zeros lie on a single "critical" line. The main goal of this project is to
show that a large proportion of these zeros are indeed resting there. This
result will enhance our understanding of subtle behavior of the basic elements
of arithmetic, the prime numbers. The PI has written expository books on several
topics related to the Theory of Numbers, most recently a book on Sieve Methods,
joint with John Friedlander. The PI is active in training graduate students and
plans to continue to train graduate students under this
award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project starts with the method of Levinson-
Conrey designed for estimating the percentage of zeros of the Riemann zeta
function that are on the critical line. The original construction by Conrey of a
linear combination of the zeta function and its odd order derivatives is quite
robust. Naturally, this needs to be mollified by a suitable Dirichlet
polynomial. The longer mollifier one can handle, the more critical zeros reveal.
The key innovation of the proposed approach is a special arrangement of the
convolution coefficients into "local mollifiers" which allows applying very long
global mollification, thus raising hope for substantial improvements of the
existing results.
