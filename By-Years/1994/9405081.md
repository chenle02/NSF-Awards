Current theories of visual processing are theories of local responses. Even
models of space-variant acuity concentrate on properties of the local receptive
fields, with the rationalization that the visual system is approximately
homogeneous within any small neighborhood. The response of the entire visual
field is pieced together from models of local responses. The theory of integral
operators allows the experimentla study of human acuity to be united with
computational model is visual processing. Their use in this context leads to
simpler and more intuitive proofs of key theorems which relate threshold
assessment to eigenvalue problems. At the same time, everyday experimental
concepts, such as threshold sensitivity, take on new elegance when placed within
the theory of integral operators.
