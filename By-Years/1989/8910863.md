Steroid hormones have a major impact on the behavior of mammals. Most of the
behavioral effects of steroid hormones are thought to be mediated by the central
nervous system; however, very little is known about the underlying mechanisms.
Dr. Albers, who has previously received support from the National Science
Foundation, will continue to work on steroid-peptide-transmitter interactions, a
general problem of substantial interest in neurobiology. Sophisticated
anatomical and biochemical techniques are used to examine scent marking, a
functionally significant communicative behavior that is also sexually dimorphic.
As a model system, scent marking is interesting because of the involvement of a
neuropeptide, arginine- vasopressin in its control. Dr. Albers will determine
whether steroid hormones influence scent marking by diminishing the sensitivity
of a specific area in the brain to vasopressin. He will also investigate the
role of vasopressin in regulating the sex differences in scent marking. A
carefully designed set of pharmacological studies will examine how the
noradrenergic transmitter system is involved in coordinating the expression of
this communication behavior as well as with other behaviors. These studies will
make important contributions to our understanding of how endocrine signals act
on neural systems to control behavior.
