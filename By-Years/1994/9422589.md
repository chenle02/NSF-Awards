9422589 Gordon The purpose of this research is to analyze the role the corporate
income tax plays in the overall tax system. The first part of the project
explores the possibility that the primary role of the corporate tax is to
provide a backstop to personal taxes on labor income. The basic idea is that
individuals can arrange to receive their labor income not only in the form of
cash wages, but also as capital gains on shares they own in the firm. Qualified
stock options provide this opportunity, for example, in publicly traded
corporations. Similarly, employees of closely held firms can be issued shares at
a book value below market value instead of being paid cash wages. This project
will examine carefully the various incentives involved, and then make use of
recent variation in corporate vs. personal tax rates in the U.S. to measure the
responsiveness of behavior to incentives using both aggregate income data and
panel data on individual taxpayers. The second project will reexamine the
appropriate tax treatment of foreign subsidiaries in a setting where information
flows between countries occur primarily because of the activity of such
subsidiaries. Not only may foreign firms acquire knowledge of domestic
technology by acquiring a domestic firm that uses this technology, but domestic
firms may acquire information through observation of the production process of
foreign subsidiaries located nearby. While the original domestic owner of the
technology would likely use the technology primarily in the domestic economy, a
foreign acquirer of the information in contrast would likely make use of it
primarily within its own country. As a result, a foreign acquisition may have
long term implications for future economic activity. The project will attempt to
model carefully the equilibrium role of foreign subsidiaries, given the
possibility of such information flows. The project will then examine the
implications of the model for the corporate tax treatment of bo th capital
exports and capital imports. ***
