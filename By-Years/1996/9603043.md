9603043 Yuh This award supports a three year collaborative research project
between Professor Junku Yuh of the University of Hawaii in Manoa and Professor
Tamaki Ura of the University of Tokyo in Japan. This project undertakes a study
of a virtual collaborative world simulator for underwater robots using a multi-
dimensional, synthetic environment. The major objective is to develop a virtual
3-dimensional, hybrid environment platform with a high-level control and
information architecture. The major goals of the project are to l) enable remote
sharing of underwater robotic resources; 2) enhance the remote monitoring and
control of the robots from globally remote locations; and 3) enhance and
stimulate the development of other areas such as underwater communication, sonar
and acoustic sensors and underwater visualization. Successful planning of the
robot operation requires integrated simulation of the actual robot with
environmental data and operating conditions. The project brings together the
efforts of two laboratories working on different aspects of autonomous under
water vechicles: the American's have experience in developing a virtual reality
platform and an underwater vehicle and the Japanese have developed the graphic
platform, underwater vehicles and shallow water testing. Research and
development of underwater robotic systems will be a low-cost key to better
understanding marine and other environmental issues; to protect the earth's
resources from pollution; and to efficiently utilize the vehicles for human
welfare. The data gathered from the research project will provide information on
the performance, effectiveness, interactiveness, and safety of an underwater
vehicle and its environment. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this
project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international
understanding and cooperation. ***
