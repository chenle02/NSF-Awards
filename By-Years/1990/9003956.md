This research is to investigate the possible changes in compressional and
shear-wave velocities associated with increasing metamorphic grade by
determination of seismic velocities of samples from the Pikwitonei-Sachigo
subprovinces, northwestern Superior Province, in Manitoba, Canada. Measurements
will be made at laboratory confining pressures up to 600 MPa. Particular
emphasis will be placed on data across the amphibolite-granulite facies
boundary. In addition to addressing this important question, the study will also
provide key rock properties data for interpretation of geophysical data to be
collected by the planned Canadian LITHOPROBE project in the northwestern
Superior Province.
