Research Infrastructure: Acquisition of a Grand Challenge Data Laboratory This
Academic Research Infrastructure award supports the acquisition of Grand
Challenge Data Laboratory consisting of a high speed computational cluster,
visualization equipment, fast disk storage, mass storage capability, and a high
speed network interconnect. The research project supported by the equipment
include: 1. Aerospace engineering research involving clustered fields projects.
These projects have applications in the design of aircraft, the solution of
three-dimensional superconductivity problems, and the solution of distributed
control at Colorado. 2. Geophysical and astrophysical turbulence problems
exemplified by the research of the Grand Challenge Application Group team funded
at Colorado. 3. The development of multi-cluster computing algorithms using new
mass stores and high speed networks. 4. Parallel tools and performance
evaluation in a distributed computing environment. 5. Visualization of very
large datasets.
