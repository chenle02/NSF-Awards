This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the
development of a high-yield fermentation route for the production of levulinic
acid (LA). LA is one of the best-suited C5 building blocks for bio-refinery
production due to higher value, broad applications, and likely quick adoption by
the chemical industry. To date, no bioprocess for LA exists, and known chemical
processes have not reached commercial stage due to high cost and lower yield.
Arzeda, the world leader in computational enzyme engineering, has invented a new
biochemical method to convert sugars to LA. The objective of this Phase I
project is to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept by validating the
proposed biochemical conversion in vitro. Arzeda will use its enzyme engineering
platform to design the biocatalyst(s) needed, including computational modeling
and design, gene assembly, and enzyme production. &lt;br/&gt;The
broader/commercial impacts of this research are the advancement of a U.S.
?green? chemistry industry, and strengthening, economically and environmentally,
of a sustainable United States bio-refinery industry. The lack of a high-yield
alternative to costly thermochemical processes has been preventing a widespread
adoption of levulinic acid. Because LA can be converted, chemically or
biochemically, to synthetic rubber (through isoprene and butenes), bio-fuels
(such as kerosene and HMF), polymers (for instance, nylons) and polymer
additives (for changing polymer characteristics), the addressable market is in
excess of $20B annually. When considered as the end product, LA trades at a
considerable higher price than ethanol, the current product of most commercial
bio-refineries, and thus can help diversify their product offering and
considerably increase their margins. Application of Arzeda?s proven technology
of computational enzyme design to bring to the world a high-yield fermentation
route for LA will considerably advance
