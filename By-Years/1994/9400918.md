Kleiman This supports the research of Professors S. Kleiman and M. Artin with
Dr. J. Pommersheim as a post-doctoral associate. Kleiman will continue to work
on Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicity and equi-singularity. Artin will continue to work
on the foundations of non-commutative algebraic geometry. Pommersheim will work
on the connection between toric varieties and number theory. This is research in
the field of algebraic geometry broadly conceived. Algebraic geometry itself is
one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a
revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated
figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but
from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those
fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics. ***
