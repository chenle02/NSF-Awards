9314076 Jung This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
organic synthesis chemistry between Michael E. Jung, University of California,
Los Angeles, and Alex Alexakis, Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris,
France. The objective of their research is to study asymmetric induction of
homochiral ketals and aminals in various cyclization reactions. They will
determine the utility of these chemical processes in organic synthesis, namely
whether these cyclizations proceed well enough to be generally useful in the
synthesis of complex natural products in optically pure form. This project takes
advantage of French expertise in chiral ketals and aminals in synthesis. This is
complemented by the U.S. group's expertise in intramolecular cyclization
reactions. This proposal will advances understanding of new techniques for
organic synthesis and characterization. It may also form the basis for designed
synthesis of natural products.
