Norwich University, a National Security Agency Center of Academic Excellence, is
awarded a National Science Foundation Federal Cyber Service: Scholarship for
Service grant to establish scholarship monies that will encourage students to
obtain a degree in Information Assurance studies. The scholarship will allow
rising juniors to obtain their degree in Information Assurance competencies to
help defend our federal cyber systems and protect the private sector
infrastructure. Because of the breadth and scope of this program, it is strongly
believed that students will graduate from Norwich University's Information
Assurance program with the skills, background, and motivation to meet the
growing national need for specialists in this critical area. At the end of their
junior year, the students will be available for summer internships in IA with
deployment to appropriate federal agencies. The students will return for their
senior year and complete their major and minor areas of study. At the end of
their senior year, students will participate in a one-week information security
update program that will be run by the programs industry partners, who are
national leaders in information security. They will then be available to enter
the workforce for the selected federal agencies.
