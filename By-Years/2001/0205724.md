Methods and technologies for effectively supporting application development have
not kept pace with the changing character of applications and development
groups. Applications increasingly span multiple organizations, involving
thousands of interacting and heterogeneous computers. The creation and evolution
of these inter-organizational systems typically involves many separate
development organizations, who contribute to multiple software systems that must
interact to support inter-organizational activities. This research project is
focused on developing the knowledge for effectively building and evolving
software for &lt;br/&gt;distributed inter-organizational systems and by
distributed multi-organization teams. As the problem is intrinsically
interdisciplinary, so is the approach. This project will create novel
development methods and &lt;br/&gt;technologies based upon an integrated social
and technological perspective. Insights come from many quarters. From a
technical standpoint, the emergence of adaptive software architectures and
event-based technologies suggest novel approaches to inter-organizational
applications. On the social side, previous successes in coordination and
awareness technologies must be brought to inter-organizational settings. An
overarching concern is that inter-organizational settings provide no central
authority - rather, social arrangements and interactions play dominant roles in
shaping technology development and deployment. The project will be empirically
grounded through research partnerships with four external organizations.
