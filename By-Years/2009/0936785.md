This award provides support for students to attend the Second Summer School in
Fundamental Neutron Physics to be held at the NIST Center for Neutron Research
June 22 - 26, 2009. The use of slow neutron beams and ultracold neutrons for
investigating fundamental processes in nature has grown steadily during the past
two decades. Major neutron research facilities: the NIST Center for Neutron
Research in Maryland and the Spallation Neutron Source in Tennessee have
significant research programs and important recent results in this field, often
called "fundamental neutron physics". This work has important implications for
nuclear physics, astrophysics and cosmology, and for testing the Standard Model
of particle physics. This subject is not often covered in graduate school
curricula, so there is a need for a national summer school to educate graduate
students and other young scientists who are already in or interested in joining
this growing field.

Fundamental neutron physics is interdisciplinary -- it lies at the intersection
of nuclear, particle, and condensed matter physics. The proposed summer school
will help educate the next generation of neutron scientists in the United
States.
