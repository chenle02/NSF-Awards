&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control theory witnessed explosive growth in the latter
half of the 20th century. The field matured into an elegant and rigorous
scientific discipline as a result of developments in linear quadratic optimal
control, geometric structure theory, robustness analysis and synthesis,
H-infinity and L1 optimal control. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The invited speakers
include many pioneering researchers who created or contributed to, some of the
above fields. The workshop will provide the opportunity for this outstanding
group of system and control scientists to assemble and discuss the status of the
field. Its impact on the course of this discipline cannot be overstated. For
this reason we plan to assemble the papers presented at the Workshop in book
form. &lt;br/&gt;
