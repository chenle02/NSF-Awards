9729444 Alexander This award provides partial funding for U.S. ocean scientists,
particularly those in the academic research community, to participate in the
activities of the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES). This
organization was established in 1992 to promote and coordinate marine scientific
research in order to advance knowledge of living marine resources, land-ocean
and atmosphere-ocean interactions, ecosystem components and processes, resource
usage, ocean response to global weather and climate change, and human impacts in
the North Pacific. Members presently include Canada, China, Japan, Korea,
Russia, and the United States. Participation by U.S. scientists in Annual
Meetings, scientific committee working groups and workshops, will also be funded
through this award.
