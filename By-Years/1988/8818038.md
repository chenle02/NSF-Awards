Understanding the evolution of social behavior, especially apparent
cooperation, requires knowledge of genetic relatedness among individuals.
Evolutionary theory demonstrating the potential effects of kin-structure in
populations on the spread od social traits like cooperation and reciprocity has
been well developed. It is proposed that even apparently altruistic acts (like
helping others to rear young rather than reproducing oneself) can be beneficial
to the donor. This explanation holds when the potential benefits of such
behavior (the enhancement of reproduction of the actual breeders weighted by the
relatedness of the cooperator to recipients) more than balance the costs (young
that could have produced in an independent breeding attempt). This analysis
depends on accurate assessment of genetic relatedness between cooperator and
young produced, which in turn depends on precise knowledge of exactly who begat
whom. For ten years the principal investigator have studied several populations
of wrens (Campylorhynchus nuchalis, C.griseus, and C. fasciatus) the practice
such cooperative breeding in South America. These birds live in extended family
groups on permanaent communal territories, a habit that is widespread among
tropical birds. These species are an especially revealing test case of the above
evolutionary ideas cooperation so effectively increases the number of young that
can be produced. Pedigrees are available for as many as 11 breeding seasons in
groups of wrens involving a total of more than 1600 individually recognizable
individuals. Cooperation in breeding enhances reproductive success five-fold, as
unaided breeding pairs almost always fail. Young birds usually remain as helpers
on their natal territories, meaning they are usually helping their presumed
parents produce siblings. Based on this assumption, cooperation benefits these
helpers. Our extension of this work has two aims. Using newly- developed DNA
fingerprinting techniques, the PIs will establish whether the presumed breeders
are the only birds reproducing in these family groups, and whether putative
nonbreeding helpers are aiding in rearing siblings. This test will now be based
on conclusive evidence from the genetic material itself rather than on fallible
inferences based on behavioral observation. The extent to which parentage is
shared within and between groups will be documented, and analytical models and
computer simulations will quantify the potential importance of parentage shared
beyond a principal pair in social groups. The project will continue field
experiments examining the processes of competition for productive breeding
positions and group defense against predators, the suspected mechanism of the
advantage of breeding in a group.
