The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a type of concrete that reduces waste. More than one billion
cubic yards of ready-mix concrete produced in the United States is returned to
concrete plants every year. Much of this concrete is discarded as waste or
washed out to reclaim the aggregates used in the system. This waste results in
hardened concrete in landfills, contaminated washout water, and increased
greenhouse gases. Reducing this may significantly improve sustainability by
preventing unnecessary material in the landfill and reducing use of scarce water
resources for washing, as well as improving operating costs. Furthermore, the
main reason for truck rejections of concrete every year is due to the strict
adherence to the 90-minute time limit. The technology is a concrete additive
that allows mixed concrete to “sleep” to preserve the quality.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of an
improved concrete formula to allow extended mixing times without negatively
impacting long-term durability. As traffic and road congestion has gotten
progressively worse, this rule has unnecessarily increased construction cost and
waste concrete. The proposed technology may extend mixing times by up to 150
minutes without negatively impacting the long-term durability of concrete
mixtures. Recent studies examined hardened concrete properties such as
compressive strength, freeze-thaw, and surface resistivity and indicate that the
discharge time had no significant impact on the fresh properties, surface
resistivity, and freeze-thaw durability up to 150 minutes. This technology may
improve discharge time limits and extend
specifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
