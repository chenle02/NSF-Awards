This is a project to evaluate the current status of alternative systems for
delivery of municipal water to consumers, commercial concerns and industry. It
will involve a retrospective assessment of the degree to which research on dual
water systems that was conducted with support from the National Science
Foundation under Grant No. 76-18499 (Multiple Water Supply for Urban Water
Management) and 80-15075 (Alternative Technologies for Small Water System
Management) has been influential in guiding adoption and engineering design of
water distribution systems. The research is being conducted by three
undergraduate students under the Interdisciplinary Studies Division of Worcester
Polytechnic Institute. Results of this project are expected to be applied toward
determining any further research needs associated with the process by which
engineers select concepts for and design of water delivery systems. The project
is also expected to provide knowledge regarding improvement in the process by
which results of research are made available to practicing environmental
engineers.
