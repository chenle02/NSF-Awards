Increased demand and overfished resources have prompted the development of an
abalone farming industry in the US and abroad. Expansion of this food industry
has been hampered by the slow growth of these mollusks. It is proposed that a
faster growing red abalone (Haliotis rufescans) be produced by the induction of
triploidy. Results from published reports on other molluscan species infer that
chromosomal manipulation in abalone should create sexually sterile animals which
channel energy away from gonad production into enhanced meat and shell growth.
Triploidy may also produce secondary benefits such as improved meat quality and
adaptability to a greater range of environmental conditions. Chemical and
thermal shock will be tested for their ability to induce triploidy in abalone
eggs, and for their effects on post- treatment survival. Increased growth rates
should increase profitability and stimulate further industry expansion. The
techniques developed in this work could be used on technically unsophisticated
farms using simple equipment.
