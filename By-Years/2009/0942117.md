Engineering-Mechanical (56) In order to provide Minnesota P-12 teachers training
in engineering content, this project will develop a concentration in engineering
for undergraduate education majors. The concentration provides students
interested in education with exposure to rigorous engineering content while
meeting state standards for licensure. Specifically, the project will develop
two new undergraduate courses, "engineering in the P-12 classroom" and
"fundamentals of engineering." The goal of engineering in the P-12 classroom is
to familiarize students with the practical aspects of presenting engineering
material in a P-12 classroom. The course focuses on current P-12 engineering
education programs, explores relationships between pedagogy and content, links
content to national and State Academic Standards, and surveys assessment
mechanisms that evaluate impact of classroom initiatives. The fundamentals of
engineering course is a survey of six main engineering topics: machine design,
manufacturing, thermodynamics, electronics, computer programming, and chemical
engineering. The project will implement and evaluate this concentration in
engineering at the University of St. Thomas. The goal is to increase achievement
in P-12 students as it relates to relevant standards in STEM areas with
particular emphasis on engineering.
