This research is concerned with the measurement of surface defects on either
hard disk media or hard disk substrates. These defects can effect the
performance of a computer disk as the head tracks over the surface. The research
concentrates on the measurement of surface defects on computer hard disks using
non-contact optical scanning interferometry. The primary objective of the Phase
II research is to measure the defects under typical rotating conditions of the
disk. The effects of the signal to noise ratio, signal bandwidth, laser spot
size, and focusing errors will be studied for different disk rotation speeds.
The anticipated result of the Phase II research will be the development of a
device for the characterization of one entire side of a computer hard disk
surface. There is the potential for a rapid non-contacting measurement technique
of surface features of a finished hard disk or uncoated hard disk is the
development of new measurement techniques and test equipment that will have the
potential to improve the quality of computer hard disks.
