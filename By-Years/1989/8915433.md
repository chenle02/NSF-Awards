This award will support a six-month research effort at Kyoto University in Japan
by Dr. Charles C. Han, Polymer Division, National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST). Dr. Han's host at Kyoto University will be Professor Takeji
Hashimoto, of the Department of Polymer Chemistry. The scientists are
collaborating on a study of rubber/rubber blends. Well characterized deuterated
polybutadiene/protonated polybutadiene and deuterated polybutadiene/protonated
polyisoprene blends will be studied, using the technique of small angle neutron
scattering (SANS) to obtain detailed structural and conformational information
on these polymers. The blends serve as ideal systems to investigate the
fundamentals of phase behavior of binary systems. The effects of chemical
crosslinking on phase behavior of these polymer blends will also be studied. At
Kyoto University Dr. Han will participate in the synthesis, microstructure
characterization, and specimen preparation of the various blends. The SANS
measurements will be carried out later at NIST by Dr. Han and visiting members
of the Kyoto group. While in Japan Dr. Han will also make brief visits to other
academic and industrial research groups working in this field. Polybutadiene
blends, polyisoprene blends, and polybutadiene/ polyisoprene blends of various
microstructures are widely used in the rubber and tire industries. The blends
are tailored to achieve various desired properties in the final products. The
studies to be carried out in this collaboration may be expected to lead to a
greater predictivity of the phase diagrams of rubber/rubber blends, and to other
contributions to the technology base for the rubber industry.
