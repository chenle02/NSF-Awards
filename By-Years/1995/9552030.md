This project is purchasing six automatic titrators to acquaint students with the
capabilities and limitations of these devices which are routinely employed in
many working laboratories. The units are being used for three experiments
(oxidation-reduction titration, neutralization titration, and direct
potentiometry with an ion selective electrode) in the Introductory Analytical
Chemistry Laboratory, and one experiment (Karl Fischer titration) in the
Instrumental Analysis Laboratory. Both laboratories are required of chemistry
majors. The introductory course is also heavily populated by students from other
departments, including microbiology, zoology, and allied health fields. The
automated systems include modules for both potentiometric and spectrophotometric
endpoint detection, so that students are able to compare the capabilities of the
two methods. Two video tapes are being produced to reinforce these concepts and
to teach the theory of operation of ion selective electrodes.
