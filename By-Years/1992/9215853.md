This is a microseismic study of the East Pacific Rise at 9 degrees 50 minutes
north to provide constraints on shallow magmatic and hydrothermal processes. The
study will locate areas of seismic activity and compare them to seafloor
geological features, determine the depth extent of microseismicity to delimit
the region of brittle fracture, and test whether the seismicity is migrating
along the ridge. Two deployments of ocean-bottom seismometers will be conducted;
the first to delineate regions of high microseismicity, and the second to
provide for accurate hypocenter locations.
