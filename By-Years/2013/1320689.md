Live migration of virtual machines (VMs) is a key feature of server
virtualization that underlies numerous operations in cloud computing platforms
such as routine maintenance, load balancing, scaling to handle peak demands, and
saving energy. Even though work in both industry and academia has made
impressive advances in live migration technology, several important challenges
remain to be addressed. This research investigates new VM migration mechanisms
having better performance, robustness, and security. In particular, this work
explores (1) simultaneous live migration of multiple VMs using distributed de-
duplication and scatter-gather transfer of memory contents, (2) fault-tolerant
VM migration to recover VMs after a failure during live migration, and (3)
secure live VM migration techniques that reduce the performance impact of
encryption and increase robustness against attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research benefits modern data centers by advancing the state-of-the-art in live
VM migration technology. Broader impacts include technology transfer, outreach
to local high schools, and involving undergraduates, women and minority students
in research. Integration of research with education includes development of
course modules, course projects, and an advanced topics graduate course.
