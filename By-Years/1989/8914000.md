This award supports a conference which assesses the status of and identifies
research needs and opportunities in the field of aerospace computational
control. Many of the topics addressed at the meeting have a direct bearing on
research supported by the Dynamic Systems and Control Program. Specifically,
multibody simulation formulation, articulated multibody component
representation, parallel computation for multibody dynamics, model reduction,
symbolic manipulation, and control design and analysis are included in the
conference topics. Support of this proposal satisfies, in part, several key NSF
goals including strengthening cooperation between industry and university
researchers, and aiding in the transfer of technology from the research level to
the users. It also represents cooperation between government agencies on
research of mutual interest to the three agencies involved.
