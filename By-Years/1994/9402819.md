Ideas from algebraic and arithmetic geometry have to recent advances in
symbolic algebraic computation, computational number theory, and in the
effective geometry of real semi-algebraic sets. In motion-planning and modeling,
the reintroduction of classical methods of elimination theory including
multivariate resultants, u- resultants and Chow forms have aided in the design
of efficient parallelizable algorithms. In number theory, rational points on
abelian varieties defined over finite fields have provided a rich new source of
groups with arithmetic properties that can be exploited in the design of new
algorithms. This study computational problems for which algebraic and algebro-
geometric methods have had significant impact. The research further explores the
applications of multivariate resultants to problems involving algebraic curves
over finite fields and their Jacobians. These methods have been successfully
applied in designing factorization-free algorithms which have achieved order-of-
magnitude improvements performance in computing arithmetic properties of curves.
Methods of elimination theory that have been used to explore the structure of
semi-algebraic sets and to construct solutions to systems of polynomial
inequalities are also studied. Such methods have been successfully applied to
the design of theoretically efficient solutions to very general problems in
solid modeling and algorithmic motion-planning. This research focuses these
methods on somewhat more constrained problems manufacturing and from molecular
modeling involving topological polyhedra with low degree surfaces in low
dimensional spaces where algebraic tools, together with the basic paradigms of
computational geometry, provide a framework for the design of both theoretically
efficient and potentially practical algorithms.
