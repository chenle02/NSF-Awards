Abstract - Rollins, 9310095 Gross error detection (GED) is directed at
identifying and correcting inaccurately measured process variables when nuisance
quantities (gross errors by some researchers' terminology) contribute to
physical process constraints not being satisfied. These nuisance quantities
include biased measurements, process leaks, and other physical parameters that
can cause inaccurate estimation of process variables. Two reasons GED has not
seen widespread use in the chemical process industries are its poor performance
and limited applications. The major objective of this research is to increase
the use of GED in plant operations when the steady-state assumption is invalid
(i.e. dynamic conditions). The PI plans to develop a statistical approach that
will provide accurate detection, identification, and estimation of process
variables with gross errors and measures of performance, such as confidence
intervals for true values and power functions for controlling error rates. The
research addresses dynamic processes operating at a set point (pseudo steady
state) and dynamic processes with changing steady states. The anticipated
results include a-level global tests, a-level tests for specific identification,
power functions for all tests, unbiased (or nearly unbiased) estimators,
consistent estimators, and 100(1-a)% simultaneous confidence intervals when
variances and covar iances of measurement errors are known and unknown. The
scope of the work includes missing data, unmeasured variables, and serially
correlated data. In addition, the PI plans to incorporate the work into an
overall strategy to detect, identify, and correct process measurements with
gross errors when conditions are dynamic.
