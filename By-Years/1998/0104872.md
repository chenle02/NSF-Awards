Title: Visual factors affecting mate choice in Lake Malawi cichlids

PI: Francis Juanes

Doctoral student: Rebecca Jordan

The cichlid fishes of Lake Malawi are an excellent example of rapid species
diversification over a relatively short period of evolutionary time. There are
numerous theories to explain this diversity that are often linked to sexual
selection through female choice. Given that males are brightly colored, females,
presumably by using visual cues, choose among the males. In being selective of
certain males, females drive the reproductive isolation that lead to species
differences. Little, however, has been done to investigate the visual factors
used by female Lake Malawi cichlids. In fact very little has been done to
discern what type of visual system these fish have, which is particularly
surprising given their reliance on visually guided behaviors. The primary
objective of this work is to ask four main visual questions with a group of rock
dwelling Lake Malawi cichlids (mbuna): (I.) what spectral abilities exist across
several groups? (II.) what is the role of visual cues in among species mate
choice? (III.) what is the role of ultraviolet radiation in mate choice and
feeding, and (IV.) what variation in physical characteristics occur with
attenuating light? A critical understanding of the visual factors affecting the
Lake Malawi mbuna is a necessary step in understanding of the reproductive
isolation see in these fish. This understanding can aid in explaining the
extreme diversity seen in these mbuna, and comes at pivotal time because of the
anthropogenic stressors that currently threaten the integrity of the East
African cichlid fish.
