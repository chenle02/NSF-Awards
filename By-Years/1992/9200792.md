This award supports the research of Professor P. Terwilliger to work in
combinatorics. He intends to investigate subconstituent algebras for commutative
association schemes. In particular, he intends to work on the classification of
thin P- and Q-polynomial schemes. He also intends to study possible connections
between subconstituent algebras and quantum Lie algebras. The research is in the
general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods
to study how discrete collections of objects can be organized. And, so it is
extremely important to modern communications, for example the design of large
networks as in telephone systems and the design of algorithms in computer
science.
