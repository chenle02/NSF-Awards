This proposal is to conduct Phase II research on machining with abrasive-
waterjets under the SBIR Program. The feasibility of machining with abrasive-
waterjets has been demonstrated in the SBIR Phase I research study in which both
milling and turning experiments were conducted. In the Phase II research milling
will be investigated in greater detail. Linear cutting tests will be conducted
on selected materials that are conventionally hard to machine. Examples include
ceramics, composites, and exotic alloys. Basic and special cutting tests will be
conducted to develop a fundamental understanding of the effects of milling-
related parameters on machining results. Models will be developed for the
prediction of quantitative and qualitative milling results as well as cost of
machining. The response of machining parameters to control signals and its
effect on machining results will be experimentally investigated. Depth sensing
techniques will be investigated for possible future implementation. The
investigator is well qualified to conduct this research. A Phase III effort is
planned to further develop and commercialize this approach.
