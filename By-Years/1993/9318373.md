The Analytical Ultracentrifugation facility will be heavily involved in the
development and the application of methodology, hardware and software for
advanced analytical ultracentrifugation. Optical and data acquisition system
improvements will be applied to both absorption and interference optics of the
new XL-A centrifuge. These innovations will have direct application to
increasing the scope and power of this new second-generation centrifuge.
Applications will deal largely with equilibrium sedimentation studies of
macromolecular interactions with particular emphasis on hetero-association. This
will also involve the development of software for data analysis as well as
research strategies to optimize such studies. New technical developments will be
engineered and applied to increase the accuracy and efficiency of velocity
sedimentation measurements, a technique which did not receive high priority
under the previous grant. These resources have been made available to the
scientific community over the past three and a half years. The Facility has
participated in or is still involved with 31 research projects (17 completed)
involving over 100 combinations of macromolecular samples and experimental
conditions. During the next five years this collaboration with academic and
industrial researchers and the publication of the results of such research will
continue to be the central focus of the Facility. The Facility also assists
researchers to make use of the newly developed technology in their own
laboratories by upgrading their instrumentation and computational methods. This
transfer is promoted by presentations at national meetings and conferences, and
by workshops held at the Facility for investigators, students, and technicians.
This training, along with the distribution of software and of the schematics and
construction diagrams for hardware, will constitute the heart of the technology-
transfer mission of the Facility.
