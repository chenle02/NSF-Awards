HCCS Planning for Engineering Transfer&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Houston Community College
System&lt;br/&gt;Planning for Engineering Transfer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Houston Community College System (HCCS), a Hispanic Serving Institution with
five colleges, has partnered with local and regional universities (the
University of Houston, Lamar University) and community engineering agencies and
corporations (NASA, Schlumberger) to develop an engineering transfer program.
The primary goal of the project is to increase the number of underrepresented
students enrolled in engineering degree programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
planning group will develop the new curriculum by investigating best practices
in engineering education through consultations and visits with exceptional
programs throughout the country. Because Texas has no approved engineering
community and junior college curriculum (approval is dependent upon credits
accepted by the transfer institution), collaboration with university partners is
critical to the success of the program. Ultimately, the program will serve as a
model that can be replicated by colleges and universities throughout Texas and
will set the standard for engineering transfer programs. The program will offer
its greatest benefits to the underrepresented students who will find new career
opportunities, and to the engineering industry, which will have an expanding
pool of well-educated, successful employees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
