Many features of an animal, such as its skull shape, change throughout its
life. Yet, comparative studies of skull shape, including those that seek to
infer evolutionary relationships among groups, and those that examine
evolutionary changes in skull form, commonly survey only adults. The proposed
research will analyze developmental changes in skull form to determine whether
these transformations provide information about evolutionary relationships among
selected rodents, and to dissect evolutionary changes in skull development.
Recent advances in methods for quantifying shape change have yielded promising
techniques that will be applied in this analysis. The method of thin-plate
splines, the method that I propose to use, has a unique advantage in that it
gives a way to identify a series of independent shape characters that have
specific location and spatial extent on the skull. In the first stage of this
project, I will compare three genera of murid rodent Mus, Sigmodon and
Peromyscus. Relationships among these genera are not controversial. I will
compare: 1) transformations in skull shape from age to age in each species; 2)
average skull shape at each age across species; and 3) intraspecific variability
of skull shapes and their transformations. This phase of the research will
explore several methodological issues, such as methods for coding developmental
transformations of shape characters. The second stage of the research will use
these methods to analyze relationships among Sigmodon species, and to describe
evolutionary modifications of skull growth.
