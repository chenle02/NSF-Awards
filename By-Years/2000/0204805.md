ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wallerstein, George&lt;br/&gt;"Travel Funds for
Stellar Abundances Conference"&lt;br/&gt; AST- 0204805&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
conference, to be held March 27-29 in Seattle, WA, is on chemical abundances in
stars and on nuclear astrophysics. The invited speakers are leading experts in
the field. They will discuss the observations relevant to the determining the
content of elements such as Helium, Lithium, Iron, and others in stars of
various ages throughout the universe. There also will be presentations on the
current state of our theoretical knowledge and of modeling the production of
various elements in the deep interiors of stars and how they are mixed into the
outer layers of a star, as well as the creation of the elements at the time of
the Big Bang. The conference is international in scope with attendees from
several European countries as well as the U.S. The proceeding are to be
published by World Scientific under the auspices of the Institute for Nuclear
