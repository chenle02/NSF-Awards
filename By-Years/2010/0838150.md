This action funds a continuation of core support for the Institute for
Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR) at the National Academies of Science. ILAR is
the recognized leader in developing and disseminating guidelines for laboratory
animal care, breeding, and use, including the internationally accepted standard
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals); resources for identifying
animal models for biological research; and reports on the humane and scientific
use of laboratory animals. The mission includes education and training of
scientists and technicians in the care and use of laboratory animals; reduction
of pain and distress in research animals; occupational safety and health of
employees; and nomenclature of inbred, transgenic, and other genetically defined
animals. The program goal is to improve the humane and scientifically valid use
of laboratory animals as well as the availability, quality and care of
laboratory animals for research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ILAR accomplishes its goal
through a core program, carried out by staff, and a special-project program,
carried out by National Academies-appointed experts. Both programs are guided by
a 16-member advisory council comprised of experts in laboratory animal medicine,
physiology, genetics, medicine, bioethics, and related biological and biomedical
sciences. Numerous sponsors fund ILAR?s operations. The funds supplied by NSF
partially support maintenance of the web site, publication of ILAR Journal,
exhibits at scientific meetings, work of the Council, and general office
operations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The many and significant broader impacts of
ILAR-sponsored activities extend beyond the U.S. scientific community via
outreach to the worldwide scientific community.
