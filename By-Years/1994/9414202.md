9414202 Curry Funds are provided for the continued operation of the deepsea core
and dredge samples' repository at Woods Hole Oceanographic. These samples are
vital to our understanding of the past and present oceans, climates and events
on the continent. Newly acquired cores will be integrated into the curatorial
system and the old cores and dredges will be continued to be curated and
distributed to scientists requesting samples. The core lab at WHOI also serves
as a center for design and development of tools for marine geological sample
acquisition. ***
