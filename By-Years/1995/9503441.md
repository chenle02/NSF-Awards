This project focuses on a number of topics related to on-line problems. On-line
algorithms work with only partial information about the input data. At each time
step, such an algorithm receives one unit of data, and has to produce partial
results before seeing the remaining data. On-line competitive algorithms are
algorithms which return a solution that is not worse than a constant times the
optimal one. One of the goals is to solve the k-server problem. An optimal
algorithm for k servers has already been developed: the algorithm is
2-competitive for two servers. A closed form function, which is a good candidate
for the potential function for k = 3, is examined. A second goal is to attack a
number of other on-line problems for which optimal competitiveness is unknown,
including: randomized list update, multi-processor scheduling, and page
migration; and to develop a general theory of on-line problem solutions. A third
goal is to show how the techniques, developed for the solution of the k-server
problem, can be applied to other on-line problems. In particular, applications
of work functions, forgiveness and stable distributions to general on-line
problems are developed. Note: This is a companion award to CCR-9503498 (PI:
