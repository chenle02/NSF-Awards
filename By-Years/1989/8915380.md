Adsorption/solubility isotherms of hydrogen in palladium and titanium are
determined using clean surfaces and accurate pressure measurements. The effects,
if any, of applied electric fields on these isotherms are measured. If an effect
is observed, the measurements will be extended to deuterium and the effects of
pressure on the onset of "cold fusion" will be observed. This study examines
whether there may be more efficient ways to charge the matrix for "cold fusion"
than the lengthy electrochemical method used up to now. The work is also
relevant to storage of hydrogen in metal matrices and to embrittlement of
metals, one of the major causes of structural failure of metals.
