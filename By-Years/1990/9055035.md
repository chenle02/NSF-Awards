California State University -- Long Beach will initiate a two- part, four-week,
residential Young Scholars project in Ocean Science for 30 students entering
grades 9,10. This is a program in which ocean science serves as a vehicle for
addressing all the sciences and aspects of engineering. Students will experience
a 3-1/2 week residence on the CSU-LB campus followed by a three-day field trip
to include Catalina Island and two days "shadowing the scientist." Four Saturday
follow-up sessions continue exploration of science and engineering.
