This awards supports the research of Professor A. Bertram to work in algebraic
geometry. He will study the moduli spaces of vector bundles on an algebraic
curve. In particular he hopes to derive a rigorous proof of the empirically
observed formula of Verlinde and Witten for studying the cohomology groups
associated to these moduli spaces. The research is in the field of algebraic
geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed
to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have stood
for centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the plane by the
simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not
only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is
extensively used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields
as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory
and robotics.
