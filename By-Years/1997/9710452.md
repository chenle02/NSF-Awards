The purpose of this research project is to identify how findings in Science and
Technology Studies might be brought to bear on the processes of design. This
necessitates developing a better conceptual and empirical understanding of the
relationship between design and social life from the perspective of designers.
Recent work on cognitive-cultural models will be used as a theoretical framework
for bridging the gap between sociotechnical processes and `design thinking.`
Developing a methodology will be the focus of this year's project.
