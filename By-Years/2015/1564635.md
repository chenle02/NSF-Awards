Webster University in St. Louis, Missouri specializes in 4-year Bachelor of
Science degrees in Biological Sciences with an emphasis in Chemistry, Research
and Technology, or Computational Biology, or a Bachelor of Arts in Biology with
an emphasis in biodiversity. The "Winning Approaches for Talented Transfer
Scholars" (WATTS) project will support 51 academically talented students from
feeder Community Colleges (CC) to pursue degrees as full-time
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will include a research study on the
implementation and effectiveness of new strategies to recruit and support
transfer students through successful STEM degree completion. The study and the
project evaluation will examine the role of alumni and peers as mentors; the
role of corporations as partners in education and the development of workforce-
ready graduates. The effectiveness of practices for comprehensive institutional
alignment and communication on behalf of the specific needs of STEM students,
transfer students, and the larger undergraduate student population will be
studied to promote the preparation of students for careers in science through
rigorous course work and independent/collaborative research projects. The WATTS
program will provide crucial transitional counseling, mentoring, and peer/buddy
support before, during, and after transfer. Graduating biology majors will meet
the growing demand by area employers for STEM expertise in the St. Louis region
workforce, where biotechnology is among the area's most prominent industries.
Conclusions drawn from the results of the research study and the evaluation will
be used to inform decisions on the institutionalization of effective components.
