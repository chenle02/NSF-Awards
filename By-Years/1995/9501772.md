9501772 Gribb Soil mechanics and groundwater flow courses at the undergraduate
level, and often at the graduate level, rarely include in-depth discussion of
the properties of unsaturated soils. Without an understanding of fluid transport
and strength and volume change behavior of unsaturated soils, engineers are not
well equipped to effectively design foundations for expansive soils, predict
slope stability of residual soils, or characterize the flow of contaminants in
the vadose zone. Historically, complexities associated with unsaturated flow
equations have made analytical solutions difficult and limited to relatively
simple problems. New computational methods, powerful personal computers, and
improved soil instrumentation have made it possible to investigate a larger
scope of problems, both numerically and experimentally. The two overall goals of
this project are: 1) to increase the knowledge base of unsaturated flow behavior
and 2) to incorporate the topics of unsaturated soil mechanics and unsaturated
flow into the civil engineering curriculum at the University of South Carolina
to better meet changing needs of the profession and society. ***
