&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
address the high cost and size and shape capability of ceramic matrix
composites. Silicon carbide (SiC) fiber reinforced silicon carbide composites
require furnaces, reactors, or ovens to produce the SiC/SiC composite matrix.
These reactors, furnaces, and ovens are large capital expenditures limiting
product size and shape and significantly increasing the cost of composites.
Phase I will use an oven-less process to make SiC/SiC composites with a
reaction-bonded silicon carbide matrix to remove cost, size, and shape
constraints on SiC/SiC composites. Phase I will determine the thermal processing
parameters required to produce SiC/SiC composites comparable to furnace-produced
composites. Density, microscopy, and strength will be used to evaluate the
process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a technology for producing SiC/SiC
composites that are not dependent on furnace proportions that control the size,
shape and cost of the composite parts. Large and complex shapes are expected to
be produced rapidly in an oven-less process for advanced turbine engines,
radiant tube heaters, heat exchangers and the numerous erosion, corrosion and
thermal applications of the chemical, petroleum, and paper and pulp
industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
