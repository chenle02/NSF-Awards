This project is the developing and implementing (at Michigan Technological
University and Arizona State University) course materials for an improved
undergraduate number theory course. This new course incorporates many of the
ideas and innovations that have been successfully employed in earlier
mathematics education reform projects. New features to be integrated into the
course are: the use of guided discovery as the primary mode of student learning;
the use of Mathematica to facilitate numerical experimentation; collaboration
between students to work on forming and investigating conjectures; a diminished
emphasis on lectures; and, student lab reports detailing results that have been
obtained. The target audience for the proposed course is preservice secondary
mathematics teachers, who comprise the majority of students in the course.
During the first year of the project, all materials for the proposed course will
be prepared: pre-lab worksheets and homework assignments; Mathematica notebooks;
documents to be distributed to students that describe the nature of the course
and expectations for lab reports; and, an instructor's guide to assist in
implementation at other sites. All materials will be free and available to
interested parties via anonymous ftp.
