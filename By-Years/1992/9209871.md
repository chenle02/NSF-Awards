This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist
studying the changing definition of womens' social and psychological problems in
Japan. The changes are from a traditional physical-medical model to one
including mental health therapy, specifically dealing with feminist issues.
Ethnographic methods of participant observation and in-depth interviews will be
used in three locations, a government-funded comprehensive mental health care
center, a social casework department of a hospital, and the Tokyo feminist
therapy center. The student will examine how these therapeutic practices provoke
women to redefine stresses from marital, child-rearing, and work-related issues
as social and political problems, rather then as medical pathologies. This
research is important because the insight it will provide about the changing
social and psychological issues confronting Japanese women will help us
understand why this important society reacts as it does to modern events.
