The goal of this project is to design and implement an inquiry based
undergraduate physics course for preservice K-8 teachers which integrates
scientific content knowledge with research based knowledge about teaching and
learning science. Research evidence has been building to support inquiry-based
lessons, student centered pedagogy such as cooperative learning and peer
teaching, and computer based laboratory instruction as effective strategies to
improve student learning. This project will implement and evaluate these
strategies in Physics 100, "Concepts in Physics", an introductory course for
future K-8 teachers. Of special concern are strategies to address ethnically
diverse student populations. Teaching strategies such as "Science Content And
Language Expansion" and programs such as "Cooperative Education" and
"Multicultural Infusion" that have been effective in other disciplines will be
tested in Physics 100. A collaboration between a professor of physics, professor
of education, and teacher from the local school district will design Physics 100
and integrate it with the science methods course in the School of Education.
This design and integration process will become a new paradigm for
collaborations between science and education departments and lay the foundation
for establishing a coordinated science curriculum for pre-service teachers which
reflects National and State wide reform efforts in K-12 Science Education.
