This research concerns phase-equilibrium properites of natural-product mixtures
(such as vegetable oils and other agricultural products) as required for process
design to manufacture-refined foods (e.g., cocoa butter), speciality chemicals,
and pharmaceuticals. To study these properties, it is necessary to separate the
agricultural product into fractions according to molecular type and size. A
preparative liquid chromatograph is required to obtain such fractions in
sufficient quantities for subsequent experimental studies using liquid
chromatography and other analytical instruments for measuring thermodynamnic
phase equilibrium properties. These properties are needed for process
development in a variety of natural-products industries, including biotechnology
process innovation.
