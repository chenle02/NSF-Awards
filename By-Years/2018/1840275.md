Innovative low-cost and low-input DNA library preparation techniques, using
microfluidic molecular barcoding, have been developed. These technologies, also
known as Linked-Read sequencing, offer additional long-range information over
standard short-reads that are present on the same DNA molecule. The limited
number of available tools do not meet the fast-growing needs of the community,
because they focus on simple applications, lack the desired sensitivity, and are
computationally expensive. This project will develop sensitive algorithms for
mapping Linked-Reads to the reference genome. The method has also potential in
solving other challenging problems such as the accurate discovery and assembly
of structural variants and resolving repeat regions in the
genome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there are an enormous amount of computational
methods using standard short-read sequencing technologies, there is yet no
comprehensive set of scalable algorithms that can be applied effectively to
Linked-Read sequencing technologies. This project will develop novel
probabilistic models and algorithms to address several computationally
challenging problems, leveraging Linked-Read sequencing technologies. In
particular, the project will develop a novel probabilistic framework and a
sensitive algorithm for mapping Linked-Reads to the reference genome with
applications to sensitive structural variation detection. Successful completion
of this project will provide fast and scalable computational methods that can be
applied to large-scale whole-genome data. The planned methods, tools and related
test data sets will be made freely available online with extensive documentation
on GitHub for the community to use and benefit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
