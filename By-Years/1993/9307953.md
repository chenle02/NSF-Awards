The Office of Naval Research (ONR) will receive cost sharing to co- sponsor an
instrument development project at Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Geological
Observatory, under the direction of Dr. John Marra. The project will develop and
field test a new type of spectro- radiometer for irradiance measurements in the
ocean. It will be optimized for use on moorings, but profiling the sensor
through the water column will also be possible. The new radiometer will have
several advantages over presently available instruments. It will cost less than
instruments now required to make spectral irradiance measurements as a function
of depth. More wavelengths will be covered (32 from 400-700 nm), thus providing
a more accurate spectrum of underwater irradiance measurements than is now
pract- icable The new instrument will also be smaller and easier to use. High
quality spectral irradiance measurements are important in a number of ocean
science investigations within several disciplines, that deal with the energy
budget and other parameters.in the upper ocean.
