9354758 Lewis The problems with general science education, the science literacy
of college graduates, and attitudes toward science have been well documented.
This proposal addresses these problems through the development of a new two-
course sequence for the general college student. This sequence will use an
active learning approach and a unique interdisciplinary structure to engage
students in examining the connections among the sciences and between science and
their lives. Rather than presenting the standard science disciplines as separate
entities, the courses will use broad ideas such as conservation principles, the
organization of systems, and the flow of information to look at science as a
comprehensive human endeavor. The sequence will be designed to achieve both
science literacy and science skills objectives. The design builds upon
experimental modules tested in existing courses during 1992 and 1993 at Kennesaw
State College. When developed, this sequence is expected to become the required
core science sequence taken by most students at Kennesaw State College. ***y
