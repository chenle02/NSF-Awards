9420693 Thompson Underground pipelines and storage tank systems can develop
leaks over time and cause significant environmental damage. A number of
Government Agencies have jointly recognized this concern and are joining
together to facilitate a research and development program to be undertaken
jointly by the New Jersey Institute of Technology's Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Emission Reduction and Iowa State University's
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Nondestructive Evaluation.
This proposal address the initiation phase of an envisaged broad scope, multi-
year project. The Emission Reduction Research Center (ERRC) will be responsible
for the interface with he sponsoring Agencies, EPA, DOE, DOD, and NSF. ERRC is
conducting a needs assessment, with particular emphasis on environmental and
regulatory compliance issues. These initial activities are to identify existing
leak detection/leak location equipment; assess modifications to regulatory and
operating needs; develop experimental plan leading to modifications; and develop
bench scale studies leading to new technologies and protocols. All field testing
will utilize the pipeline systems at the EPA UST/Pipeline Test Apparatus in
Edison, New Jersey. The Center for Nondestructive Evaluation is responsible for
assessment of technology, based initially on the existing EPA technology and
literature information. This Center will survey industry consensus on the
effectiveness of available technologies and conduct experimental studies of
current acoustic emission techniques. The researchers are fully qualified to
perform these studies. Funding for this project is being provided by EPA, DOE,
DOD and NSF. The Program Manager recommends Iowa State University be awarded
$196,872 for one year for its portion of this project with funds provided by the
U.S. Department of Navy's Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center.
