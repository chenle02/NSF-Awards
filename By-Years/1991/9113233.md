This award from the Office of Special Projects, Chemistry will provide partial
travel support for approximately seventeen U.S. chemists attending the 33rd
Congress of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). This
Congress is the next in a series of biennial general congresses sponsored by the
Union. In order to assure that the United States will be represented with
quality and distinction, and that younger chemists will have an opportunity to
participate, the U.S. National Committee for IUPAC will organize a travel
program to provide partial travel support to selected U.S. chemists. Other
support will come from the U.S. National Committee and from private sources. %%%
The National Academy of Sciences is the National Adhering Organization for the
United States in the IUPAC and maintains an active role in the affairs of the
Union through the U.S. National Committee. Travel awards will be highly
leveraged with funds from non-governmental sources. Awardees will submit a brief
report on the quality of the scientific program and the benefits derived from
attending the Congress.
