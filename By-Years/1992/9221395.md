This award will continue the analysis of Very Low Frequency (VLF) radio wave
data acquired from Siple Station, Antarctica and the magnetically conjugate
station in Quebec between 1973 and 1989. Over this period the U.S. Antarctic
Program operated a VLF transmitter at Siple which has produced a very large and
unique data set which has already provided new insight into the structure of the
Earth's magnetosphere. The investigators at Stanford University will continue to
analyze and theoretically interpret the experimental results. In addition, they
will digitize selected analogue tapes and archive them for future research.
