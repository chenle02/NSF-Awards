This award provides funding for a three year standard award to support a
Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at the
Colorado State University, "RET-Site Program in Light &amp; Optics for the NSF
EUV ERC," under the direction of Dr. Jorge Rocca.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RET
Site at the EUV ERC will provide 27 (9 per year) middle school teachers each
summer for six weeks an opportunity to participate in pioneering research on
state-of-the-art equipment with faculty and students. The research topics in
light technology, are an important area of optics that is enabling to
nanoscience and nanotechnology, and that will play a critical role in the
fabrication of the future generation of computer chips. In addition the teachers
will develop new learning tools, participate in a professional development
workshop, and experience follow-up visits from EUV Center graduate students and
faculty which will increase the longevity of the program's educational impact.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optics is now part of the middle/high school curriculum in
Colorado, and therefore this effort will have direct impact on effective student
learning. The program will involve teachers and students from districts and
after-school programs with large minority and low-income
populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
