The aim of this application is to construct and test the performance of a new
generation of light-controlling materials called photonic hypercrystals (PHC).
This project builds upon the initial success of the investigators toward
developing a new generation of fluorescence sensors with a detection limit and
high dynamic range that have not been demonstrated in the past. They
demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed application as evidenced by the
outstanding performance of the proposed optical hybrid materials for the
detection of a fluorescence signal with a very high degree of sensitivity. This
project will potentially lead to a new class of highly novel sensors that can
significantly improve the limit of detection of biomarkers of diseases. This can
lead to the availability of highly sensitive, compact and low-cost fluorescence
sensors for low-cost integrated diagnostic tools for biomedical and clinical
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful development of the proposed
detection technique could have a significant impact on the development of highly
sensitive detectors and instrumentation that could be used to develop novel
biosensors and improve the performance an reduce the cost of existing bio-
imaging and sensing platforms that detect and quantify fluorescence signals from
biomolecules. The investigating team has outstanding records for teaching and
training of students and research fellows in the fields of engineering,
chemistry, biophotonics, biosensors, and
nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
