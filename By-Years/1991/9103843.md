Nitrogen fixation is an important component of the nitrogen cycle in the sea.
Presently, it appears that the colonial cyanobacterium Trichodesmium is the
major diazotroph in the euphotic zone of the open ocean. A number of other
species could potentially contribute significantly to the fixation of N2, but
may have escaped attention due to the difficulties of culture and the
measurement of N2-fixation in situ. In this project, Dr. Capone and
collaborators will present a new approach to the detection and characterization
of N2-fixing microorganisms in the marine environment. They will use a very
sensitive molecular technique, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to identify
and characterize nitrogen-fixing genes in a variety of marine environments. The
use of this technique will settle a number of long-standing issues of the
presence of N2-fixation potential i planktonic and benthic environments.
Furthermore, the product of this research will be a DNA sequence database and
cloned nif genes which can be used for detailed investigations of the ecological
diversity of N2-fixing microorganisms in the sea.
