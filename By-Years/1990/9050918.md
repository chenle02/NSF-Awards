The department of Chemistry is purchasing instruments and equipment (including
centrifuges, incubator, shaking water bath, and gel electrophoresis equipment)
to support a new course in the Chemistry of DNA. This course, intended for both
science and non-science majors, allows students to gain hands-on experience with
the isolation and analysis of DNA, DNA fingerprinting and genetic manipulation.
The equipment allows significant improvement in the college's program by
supporting the new course as well as an advanced biochemistry laboratory in
which state-of-the-art equipment is needed to provide a suitable experience for
chemistry and biology majors. The college will contribute an amount equal to the
award.
