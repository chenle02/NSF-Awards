INT 9505197 Lahiri Technical Description: This project provides partial support
for Partha-sarathi Lahiri, University of Nebraska, to conduct statistical
research in small-area estimation at the Indian Institute of Management,
Calcutta with collaborator Rahul Mukherjee. Dr. Lahiri will also work with T.J.
Rao of the Indian Institute of Statistics, Calcutta to explore new areas in
survey sampling. Estimators used in large scale national sample surveys perform
poorly at the sub-national level. The P.I. proposes to explore the use of
empirical Bayes and hierarchical Bayes methods in developing estimators to
generate reliable small area statistics. The collaborators will investigate
whether this method which Lahiri has shown to be superior to the best linear
estimators for small area means, holds for the general mixed model with random
error variance components. They will extend the empirical Bayes and hierarchical
Bayes methods to find estimators of small area characteristics for discrete
data. Scope: Research in small area estimation is important for generating
statistics at the state and county levels and for subgroups of the population.
In India and the U.S., such statistics are needed by various federal and local
governments for policy making and allocation of funds. The foreign collaborator
has done outstanding work in the areas of Bayesian statistics, higher order
asymptotics and survey sampling. Professor Mukherjee's recent advances in the
area of asymptotics will be very helpful in proving difficult asymptotic results
mentioned in the proposal. Many mutual benefits may be expected to result from
this new collaborative activity. ***
