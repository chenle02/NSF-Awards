This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
commercially feasible technology for the fabrication of membrane microarrays.
Recent studies have extended the microarray concept to include patterns of
substrate-supported lipid bilayers and cell membranes (MembraneChipsTM) which
retain biological functionality, and enable researchers to perform novel studies
of receptor-ligand and cell-cell interactions. These experiments are performed
using manual and often laborious chip fabrication and assay techniques. This
project will assess the technical feasibility of automating MembraneChipTM
production, and manufacturing membrane microarrays in a format compatible with
existing liquid-handling robotics and microplate readers. The specific
objectives of the project will be (i) demonstration of a scaleable membrane
arraying process using nanoscale fluid-dispensing technology, (ii) optimization
of the process with respect to substrate design and dispense parameters using a
statistical design of experiments approach, (iii) evaluation of process
consistency and yields, and (iv) evaluation of membrane array mechanical
stability, shelf-life, and sensitivity to assay reagents. This information will
be used to fabricate a prototype device in the 96-well microplate format.
Incorporation into the 96- well format will enable automation of novel
biological assays for basic research and drug discovery, while taking advantage
of the instrumentation infrastructure already installed in academic and
industrial research labs.

The commercial application of this project is in the areas of biological
research and pharmaceutical drug development.
