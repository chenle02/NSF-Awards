This project is creating a laboratory environment where non- science students
can actively and independently collect, graph and analyze data over a wide range
of physical systems. The goal is to instill the excitement and intrinsic
interest that should be present in the laboratory study of physics even at the
most basic level, while at the same time to make the introductory laboratory
experience more accurately reflect the nature of science in the modern world.
The laboratory design must be flexible enough to accomodate students with
limited mathematical skills and no laboratory experience while allowing for
completion of the experiments with the allotted lab period. These aims are being
achieved by equipping the introductory laboratory with computers in sufficient
numbers that there is one for each group of two students. The computers are
being used, with appropriate interfaces and sensors, to simplify data taking and
analysis as well as greatly expanding the number and type of physical phenomena
that may be studied by non-science majors. The data logging and rapid data
analysis of the computers allow the students to use most of the lab period to
think about what they are measuring and to try variations of the experiment. The
rapid and varied graphical presentation of data allows for a high level of
analysis and the introductory laboratory becomes the positive and enlightening
experience that it should be. The college is matching the award with an equal
amount of funds.
