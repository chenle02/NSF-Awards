1446280 &lt;br/&gt;Voigt, Christopher A. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal
seeks support for the inaugural 'Synthetic Biology: Engineering, Evolution and
Design (SEED) Conference 2014' to be held in Los Angeles, Manhatten Beach
Marriott Conference Center, CA, July 14-17, 2014. SEED 2014 will be the first in
an annual series of meetings held to bring researchers from industry and
academia in the area of Synthetic Biology. The SEED series will provide
leadership in the development of the field of synthetic biology and will serve
to broaden the participants in the field by appealing to broad sectors in
industry and providing a means for young investigators and those outside of the
field to participate. Proceedings will be published each year in the journal ACS
Synthetic Biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the
Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of CBET and by the Synthetic
and Systems Biology Program of MCB.
