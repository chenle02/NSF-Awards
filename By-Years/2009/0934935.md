This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Phase II Noyce Scholarship project
is providing twelve $10,000 scholarships annually to junior and senior STEM
majors seeking a career in secondary science or mathematics teaching, leading to
40 new teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High needs partner school districts are
Sunnyside Unified School District (in Tucson) and the Tucson Unified School
District. Teachers from these school districts serve on the project's Faculty
Advisory Group. Among the duties of the advisory group are holding small group
interviews with scholarship applicants and selection of scholarship
awardees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summer internships are available to freshmen and
sophomore STEM majors expressing an interest in a teaching career. Examples of
the camps are "The Science Detectives" and "Tucson Sweetness: Honey from the
Tucson Desert." The former is a forensics science experience involving the
Arizona Research Labs, the Tucson Police Department Crime Lab, Pima County
Superior Court and the Human Origins Genotyping Laboratory. The latter is
working with the Native American Summer Institute, a joint endeavor by two
tribal units, the Bee Center and the university. Participants learn principles
of economics, biology of bees, dynamics of the hive and mechanisms of colony
migration. They work at an apiary at the San Xavier Farm Coop and bottle honey
for sale under the name, "Tucson Sweetness: Honey from the Tucson Desert." The
project supports the Noyce Scholars' professional development with regard to
their awareness and acknowledgement of the factors that challenge high need
students' opportunities to receive a quality education. Research associated with
the project is contributing to the knowledge base on STEM teachers' perspectives
on teaching and learning in high need schools.
