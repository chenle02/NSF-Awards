9632357 BEARDSLEY This project represents a continuation of the analysis of the
physical oceanographic information collected during Phase I of the U.S. GLOBEC
Northwest Atlantic Field Studies on Georges Bank. Specifically, this project
will: (a) complete the processing of physical data collected in the Georges Bank
Stratification Study (GBSS) moored array, drifter; and hydrographic components;
(b) use these results combined with other moored and hydrographic data to
describe the development of stratification on Georges Bank; (c) describe and
model the water column response to surface forcing along the southern flank,
with emphasis on the surface and bottom boundary layers; (d) describe and model
a massive intrusion of Slope water, apparently driven by a warm-core ring; and
(e) compare the 1995 field data with prognostic model simulations driven with
the measured surface forcing. ***
