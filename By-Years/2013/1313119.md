This project will complete a radial velocity and abundance survey of Solar Twin
stars to test models of the importance of stellar metallicity to planet
formation processes. The team will use the HARPS instrument and plans to
estimate abundances more reliably than before using new observing and data
reduction techniques. They have already been awarded four years of time for this
project. One focus will be to concentrate on observing lithium and other
refractory abundances in stars that greatly resemble the
Sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stars and their planets are thought to arise from the
same fragment of a collapsed molecular cloud. Consequently, a star's properties
likely reflect the physical conditions of the disk its planets formed in, and
the study of relationships between planets' and their host stars'
characteristics can give insight to the processes that govern planet formation
and evolution. The observed strong positive correlation between stellar
metallicity and giant planet frequency is an example of such a relationship. In
astronomy, metallicity is generally defined as the abundance of all elements
other than hydrogen and helium. Broader impacts of the work include training a
graduate student in research, incorporating some of the data in undergraduate
courses, an international collaboration with scientists in Brazil and Australia,
and communicating with the public through articles on exoplanets in popular
science magazines.
