This proposal requests support to continue the principal investigator's study
of Earth's interior structure using body and surface waves. In order to analyze
seismic waveforms between the period range of 10 and 50 sec., we propose to
develop a perturbative propagator approach. This method is potentially more
efficient, at least within this period range, than the normal mode approach that
has been successful and widely used for longer period (&gt; 50 sec.) waves. We
will apply the method to study the Earth structure on the global, regional and
local scale problems in order to sharpen the image and increase our
understanding of seismic velocity structure.
