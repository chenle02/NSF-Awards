In this Cyberlearning: Transforming Education EXP project, a collaborative team
of assessment specialists, learning scientists, K12 educators, educational
technologisst, and informal science educators are exploring the design and
feasibility of a tool called the Learning Lens, a mobile multi-media tool for
gathering data in the midst of learning activities that can shed light on
learners' capabilities and understanding and the interactions between learners
and educators. The system's design is informed by ideas of evidence-based
assessment; it is designed to allow a user to collect the kinds of data that can
be used to support arguments about what learners understand and are capable of,
including formal products of learners, their presentations or explanations,
discussions among peers, and interactions with people and objects in the
learning environment.

Such a tool could play important roles in the the education of education
practitioners. Pre-service and in-service teachers might gather data
sporadically in their classrooms to use in discussions with others about their
practice. Or, those observing educators in practice might gather data to be used
later in reflecting on educational practices.

As well, such a tool holds promise for enhancing assessment. While paper-and-
pencil testing can be used to assess understanding and some disciplinary skills,
it is quite a bit more challenging to objectively assess complex social,
communication, reasoning, and meta-cognitive skills. The Learning Lens is being
developed to promote evidence-based analysis of such skills. With the tool,
researchers or teacher observers or teachers themselves would collect data
showing what learners understand or can do. Such data capture holds promise for
allowing educators and researchers to iteratively and collaboratively document
learner development, develop assessment rubrics, track students' real-time
growth in situ, and identify outcomes of pedagogical moves and tactics.
