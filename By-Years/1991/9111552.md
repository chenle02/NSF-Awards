This project involves two anthropologists from the University of New Mexico in
a study of male fertility and parenting in the contemporary US. The theories
tested are drawn from evolutionary models of male parenting practices and
fertility, and are designed to explain the total number of children and the
economic and noneconomic resources invested in children by parents. The
researchers use data from structured interviews with a representative sample of
Anglo and Hispanic men over 21 years of age in Albuquerque, NM. A short
interview will be administered to about 10,000 men and a long interview
administered to about 2,000 men to obtain fertility, parenting, and income data
from individuals in diverse generations. This research is important because most
studies of fertility deal with women. This project will advance our theoretical
understanding of parenting by contributing data on males from different age and
socio-economic cohorts.
