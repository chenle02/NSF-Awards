&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a research effort aimed at measuring
the&lt;br/&gt;angular correlation between neutron spin and the emission
direction&lt;br/&gt;of the electron following beta decay of the neutron. The
experiment&lt;br/&gt;will utilize ultra-cold neutrons at the Los Alamos Neutron
Science&lt;br/&gt;Center. The goal is ultimately to provide an order-of-
magnitude in&lt;br/&gt;the precision to which this asymmetry is known. This
measurment,&lt;br/&gt;coupled with ongoing measurements of the neutron lifetime,
can&lt;br/&gt;provide sensitive tests of the electroweak standard model, as
well&lt;br/&gt;as improved values of the weak axial form factor of the nucleon.
&lt;br/&gt;The research effort contains an exceptionally diverse collection
of&lt;br/&gt;nuclear and atomic experimental techniques, at a scale where a
Ph.D. student can have a substantial impact upon the course of
the&lt;br/&gt;research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
