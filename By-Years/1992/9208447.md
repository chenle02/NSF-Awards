Scripps will serve as a facility for the archiving and analysis of GPS global
tracing data to support regional crustal deformation projects. To support
operations of the Permanent GPS Geodetic Array (PGGA) in southern California,
scripps generates precise orbital ephemerides and maintain a comprehensive
archive of global tracking data. At present, orbits are at the several parts in
108 level computed within several days of observation and based on nearly
automatic data processing. These orbits land global tracing data have proven to
be of great benefit to ongoing crustal deformation projects.
