This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The research objective of this Early Faculty Career (CAREER)
award is to develop methods for sketch-based construction and interaction with
geometric content in creative design environments. The research will develop
methods that can translate designers' conceptual sketches into 2D and 3D
geometric data that can be readily modified, simulated and optimized through a
pen-and-paper like interface. The research will result in methods that enhance
design innovation by providing human-centric computational technology for form
creation and exploration in the early design stages of engineered products.
Methods will be designed and implemented for creating 3D geometry from 2D
sketches, for automatically generating aesthetic product forms from pen strokes,
and for capturing design knowledge by monitoring users' interaction with the
developed computational tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results
of this research will enhance current design practices in industry by enabling
designers to rapidly generate and assess complex product forms via digital
sketching. This will lead to greater efficiency in design exploration and
iteration, which are central to technological innovation. By facilitating form
creation, the new methodologies will enable a more fluid integration of
stylistic and functional design requirements currently not supported by
conventional tools. The resulting technology will have an immediate impacts in a
number of fields including product design, automotive design, pre-surgical
planning, and engineering education. The education and outreach activities of
the award will provide interdisciplinary learning opportunities for
undergraduate and graduate engineering students in computational design, and
will help promote interest for science and engineering from underrepresented
groups and high school students.
