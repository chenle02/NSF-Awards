Topological spaces are some of the most fundamental objects in mathematics.
Algebraic topology associates algebraic objects to topological spaces in order
to tell them apart. Some of the most powerful algebraic tools for doing this are
"cohomology theories". A certain sequence of cohomology theories called the
Morava E-theories have a deep and somewhat understood connection to algebraic
geometry and an important conjectural relationship with geometry. The first two
Morava E-theories are classical; however, the rest are quite mysterious. The
goal of this project is to use the connection to algebraic geometry to play
different Morava E-theories off each other in order to expose properties of the
conjectural geometry.

The PI plans to study the relationship between the chromatic layers in order to
expose the geometry that lurks behind the scenes in chromatic homotopy theory.
He will do this by pursuing three interrelated programs. The PI will use the
algebraic geometry of p-divisible groups, generalized character theory, and
field theories (in the sense of Stolz-Teichner) to attack the problem. In joint
work with Schommer-Pries, the PI hopes to give a field theoretic construction of
higher chromatic cohomology theories such as Morava E-theory. Also of particular
interest are "transchromatic" proofs of classical theorems that lead to more
general results. For instance, in work with Tomer Schlank, the PI has given a
new proof of Strickland's theorem on the Morava E-theory of symmetric groups
that naturally leads to a generalization of the theorem to wreath products of
finite abelian groups with symmetric groups. One of the main tools in the proof
is a character map from E-theory to p-adic K-theory that allows one to reduce
certain problems in E-theory to representation theory. This map deserves further
study.
