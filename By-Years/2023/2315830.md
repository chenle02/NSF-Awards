Hardware security is a topic of increasing concern in the cybersecurity field
for scientific and national security reasons.

This workshop sponsors students to participate in the 2023 New England Hardware
Security Day (NEHWS2023) held in April 2023. The workshop is a venue for
researchers and practitioners in hardware security to present the latest
research, and to explore opportunities for future research. By including
representatives from academia and industry around New England, the event will
provide students insight into a range of perspectives, as well as potential
post-university employment.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
