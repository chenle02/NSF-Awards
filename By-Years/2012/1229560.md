The small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) facility at Duke University will be the
first X-ray scattering instrument in the Research Triangle area of North
Carolina. It will therefore serve a multidisciplinary community of researchers
and provide the opportunity, for the first time, to train students in advanced
scattering techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SAXS facility at Duke
University's Shared Materials Instrumentation Facility (SMIF) will serve three
major universities in the area: Duke University, North Carolina State
University, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It will also be
available to two historically black universities, North Carolina A&amp;T State
University, and North Carolina Central University, that currently utilize
instrumentation at SMIF. The instrument will serve researchers in materials
science, structural biology, polymer and colloidal chemistry, chemical and
biomedical engineering, and textiles engineering. The instrument capabilities
will be broad to address the different needs of the users, and include wide
angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering
(GISAXS).
