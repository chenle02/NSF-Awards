In this project the PI's will collect and interpret high-quality and high-
resolution conductivity, temperature, depth, oxygen and nutrient data in the
Northeast Pacific Ocean, along a line designated as P-17N by the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE), and running generally parallel to the coast from
San Francisco to the Shumagin Islands, with an intersecting leg into Sitka,
Alaska. Specific science issues to be addressed include heat and fresh water
divergences, exchange of properties between the Alaska Gyre and the Subtropical
Gyre, spreading and ventilation rates of North Pacific Intermediate Water, and
bottom boundary interactions as seen in silica distributions.
