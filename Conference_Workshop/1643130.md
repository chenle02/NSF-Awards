This award supports participation in the Fifth Annual Midwest Women in
Mathematics Symposium (WIMS) to be held on April 8, 2017 at Indiana University -
Purdue University Indianapolis. The aim of WIMS is: (i) to highlight the
scholarly contributions of female mathematicians in the Midwest region, and (ii)
to stimulate collaborations, networking, and mentoring relations among female
mathematicians in the Midwest region. WIMS has been established as an annual
event that rotates among colleges and universities in the Midwest. The Symposium
brings together female mathematicians from across the Midwest at all stages of
their careers. Based on attendance at previous WIMS, 150 participants are
anticipated in 2017.

The Symposium features two hour-long plenary lectures by distinguished senior
female faculty members and ten thirty-minute invited lectures by promising
female junior faculty and postdoctoral researchers. The topics of the academic
sessions at WIMS 2017 are Geometry and Topology, Dynamical Systems, and
Mathematical Biology. Graduate students and recent Ph.D.s have the opportunity
to present their work at the Symposium Poster Session. The lectures and poster
session are accompanied by open problem sessions, during which WIMS participants
work in small groups to discuss field-specific problems. Such work will
naturally lead to follow-up visits among the participants at other Midwest
institutions and new long-term collaborations. More details about the symposium
can be found at http://math.iupui.edu/~buse/WIMS-17/.
