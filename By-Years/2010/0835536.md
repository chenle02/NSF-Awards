CBET-0835536&lt;br/&gt;Cohen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel funds are requested to
partially support the participation of 24 US university students from across the
country at the International Congress on Membranes (ICOM) July 13-18, 2008 in
Honolulu, Hawaii. The funds will be used to assist those students who are
participating as authors or co-authors in oral and poster presentations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds will be used to cover registration, housing, and
airfare costs for students attending the meeting. Funds will be used to provide
24 stipends of $500 each. Additional travel support for students has been
solicited from various companies that are engaged in the manufacturing of
membranes, working in the general area of membrane technology or with a stake in
membrane science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students will be
given the opportunity to attend conference sessions, and interact with academics
and professionals from around the world. The student participants will interact
and discuss various aspects of membrane science and technology with leading
scientists from around the world, get feedback on their own research work, and
advance their own knowledge of the sate-of-the-art in membrane science and its
technological applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ICOM 2008, the largest
membrane technology meeting in the world (held every three years), will consist
of 54 cutting-edge technical sessions on fundamental and applied membrane
science and technology. Over 1,000 membrane researchers are expected from all
various parts of the world representing industry, government, and academic
institutions. ICOM 2008 is organized by the North American Membrane Society
(NAMS) and is co-sponsored by the three major membrane societies in the world,
NAMS, the European Membrane Society, and the Aseanian Membrane Society.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student support will also have broad impacts as it will
increase the international visibility of U.S. Universities, demonstrate the high
level of student research in the U.S., and help to attract an upcoming young
generation of professionals to the rapidly growing areas of membrane science and
technology.
