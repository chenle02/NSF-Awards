This project intiates the process of establishing a general theory of the
mechanics of walking systems with more than two legs. Arthropods are used as
test models. The project has three phases. The first comprises an investigation
of museum specimens representing the diversity of arthropods to determine basic
parameters of potential leg movement. Phase 2 use photography to determine
actual leg motion of living arthropods, and phase 3 is a computer simulation of
leg and body motion using the parameters determined in phases 1 and 2.
