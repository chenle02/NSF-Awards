Odors coming to the nose of vertebrates are trapped in a film of olfactory
mucus, which provides a microenvironment for the initial interactions between
odorant molecules and the olfactory receptor cell surfaces. This mucus is
important in determining the solubility and diffusibility of the stimuli, and
can change the response of olfactory receptor neurons to odorants. The mucus is
secreted by accessory glands rather than the receptors themselves and its
composition is variable; it is a perireceptor modulator of olfactory function.
Neural mechanisms that regulate the secretion and composition of the mucus may
in turn be influenced by odorant stimuli. To fully understand olfactory receptor
function, these properties and mechanisms must be known. This project will
experimentally manipulate the olfactory mucosa, and use immunohistochemistry and
pharmacology to explore the relations between odorants and secretions.
Identification of the innervating pathways to the mucosa will be combined with
characterization of the neurotransmitters involved in regulation of secretion.
Odorants and pharmacological agents will be tested for their ability to
stimulate neuromodulator release and activate secretion. Functional carbohydrate
compounds will be identified in the secretory products, and proteins within the
secretory cells will also be identified to compare with those found in other
mucus-secreting systems. This project involves a unique approach to the
important topic of modulation of sensory input, and results will be important to
how we think about olfactory systems, and modulation of other sensory receptors
in general.
