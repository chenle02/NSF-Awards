In this project, funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Cha of the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University
is investigating an efficient preparation of several molecular building blocks
that have utility in organic and medicinal chemistry. The research project
begins with readily available cyclopropanols: three-membered ring compounds that
are tensioned like a spring and said to have ring strain. Reactions that open
the three-membered rings are driven to completion by releasing this ring strain.
The Cha laboratory developed a significantly improved preparation of these
cyclopropanols. They are developing new reactions of cyclopropanols to build
more complex molecules that may have useful medicinal properties. This project
is an excellent training ground for young scientists, from undergraduate
researchers to post-doctoral fellows, to learn about chemistry.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals for the project include the design of
new chemical reactions that facilitate concise and environmentally benign
syntheses of important structural motifs or natural products. Emphasis is placed
on high efficiency and convergence by use of segment coupling strategies, in
which two large fragments are linked at a late stage in the synthesis. Concise
total syntheses of suberosenone and alkaloid 261C are underway. These syntheses
highlight the preparative power of the newly developed synthetic methods.
Suberosenone and alkaloid 261C are both scarce natural products, and chemical
syntheses are necessary to evaluate their biological activity. Through
participation in this project, students and postdocs are trained in organic
methods development, organometallic chemistry and natural product synthesis.
They are well prepared for careers in chemistry.
