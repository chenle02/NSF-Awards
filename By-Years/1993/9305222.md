This is a workshop conference that will bring together research scientists and
representatives from commercial firms that produce instruments in an attempts to
find mechanisms for producing improved sampling and analytical devices for
chemical oceanographic studies. The structure of the meeting will be designed to
maximize interaction between commercial instrument builders and research
scientists and will be very different from a typical scientific meeting. Instead
of set-piece descriptions of completed science projects, the oceanographers will
be ask to discuss the problems that they face in turning technological
developments in other fields into useful devices that can advance knowledge of
marine chemistry and chemical oceanography. Similarly, the business
representatives will be invited to talk about the problems that they face in
producing instruments for the rather small market that is represented by the
oceanographic community. After initial presentations that outline the problems
and prospects, a large portions of the time will be devoted to informal
discussions during which it is hoped that fruitful alliances between research
scientists and instrument building businesses will develop.
