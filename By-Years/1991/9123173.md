This award will provide partial support for a workshop regarding
transformations of organic molecules on molecular metal clusters and on metal
surfaces. The objective is to establish connections between cluster and surface
chemistry. The coordinators for the event, to be held in Italy, are Edward
Rosenberg, of the California State University Foundation, Northridge, and
Luciano Milone, of the University of Turin in Italy. The workshop will bring
together leading scientists involved in two related and important areas of
research that have many features of their chemistry in common, but which are
generally investigated by significantly different methodologies. By bringing
together scientists from the two disciplines to discuss their latest research
findings, the concepts, principles, and problems that these areas have in common
will be more fully revealed. This, in turn, should lead to a better
understanding of the chemistry involved and stimulate new ideas and directions
for future research. Because Italy has traditionally been a center of excellence
in cluster chemistry, and the US has particular strengths in surface science,
the joint workshop brings together complementary expertise from the two
countries.
