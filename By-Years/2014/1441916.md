Understanding tropical intraseasonal variability is an important problem in
climate dynamics. The goal of this project is to enhance understanding of the
basic dynamics of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO). The broader impacts of
this effort are very high. In collaboration with NCAR, the PI will incorporate
newly developed process-oriented diagnostics into a diagnostics package that
will be applied to different versions of NCAR's Community Earth System Model
(CESM) to evaluate--and eventually improve--the representation of the MJO. In
addition, there will graduate student and postdoc training as well as the
development of diagnostic capabilities that could be used by the climate science
community to potentially improve model simulations.

The leading hypothesis that will be examined in this project is that wind-
evaporation and radiative feedbacks are required to destabilize the MJO, in
conjunction with weakly positive vertical gross moist stability. It is also
hypothesized that horizontal advection is critical to eastward MJO propagation.
Specific questions that the proposed work will address include: 1) What
combination of processes is responsible for destabilization of the MJO,
including vertical advection, surface fluxes, and/or radiative feedbacks? 2)
What are the contributions of moisture advection by the mean flow, anomalous
flow, and higher frequency disturbances to eastward propagation of the MJO? 3)
How do selected process-based metrics inspired by the column-integrated MSE
budget relate to model MJO performance, and what do these relationships tell us
about MJO dynamics? 4) How does the partitioning of destabilization and
propagation factors in the column-integrated MSE budget compare between models
and observations, and how do differences in this partitioning relate to model
mean state bias?
