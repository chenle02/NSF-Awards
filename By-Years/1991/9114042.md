This project will continue research on the average and probabilistic settings of
information-based complexity. The goal is to investigate when intractability or
noncomputability in the deterministic worst case setting can be avoided by using
randomness or by using average and probabilistic settings. In addition, two new
research directions will be pursued. The first is probabilistic complexity for
piece-wise smooth functions. The second is the relation between complexity and
stability.
