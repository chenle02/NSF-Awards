This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will develop a method
for incorporating Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWNT) into nylon fibers to act
as reinforcement. This incorporation will be achieved by wrapping the SWNTs with
a functionalized polymer that both allows the tubes to be dissolved in the
solution containing the nylon precursors and acts as a load transferring conduit
between the fiber matrix and the nanotubes in the final composite. The primary
focus of this project is to optimize the SWNT/nylon matrix interaction in order
to obtain the best load transfer properties and to direct the orientation of the
SWNTs along the long axis of the nylon filaments in order to maximize the
fiber's strength.

The commercial application of this project will be in the aerospace industry.
The high strength nylon fibers are expected to be used to construct flywheel
rotors for airplanes and spacecraft that are capable of performing the dual
functions of high density energy storage and control of gimbal and altitude.
