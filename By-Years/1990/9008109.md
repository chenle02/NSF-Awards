This project is to develop an environment for interactive prototyping of two-
dimensional and three-dimensional user interfaces. The environment consists of
an integrated set of tools that support the design, prototyping,
reconfiguration, and testing of graphical user interfaces, without involving and
traditional notion of "programming." The tools will allow a naive or
sophisticated user to configure and generate a user interface by interactively
specifying the 2D and 3D graphics, graphical events and various manipulations of
pictures, and the user/system dialogue.
