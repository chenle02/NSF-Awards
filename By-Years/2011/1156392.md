Many longstanding hypotheses regarding human ecology and physiology speculate
about the energetic demands placed on people in pre-agricultural societies, but
energy use in hunter-gatherers has never been measured directly. In this
project, daily energy expenditure will be measured for adult men and women of
the Hadza, who live in savannah and open woodland habitat in northern Tanzania
subsisting on wild foods which they hunt and gather. Energy use data will be
compared to activity data and demographic information in order to understand the
energetic demands placed on humans in pre-agricultural societies. This study
will be the first to measure daily energy expenditure in human hunter-
gatherers.&lt;br/&gt;Using the doubly-labeled water method, daily energy
expenditure (i.e., calories used per day) will be measured over a two-week
period. Body mass, fat-free mass, age, and the number and ages of dependents
(e.g., children) will be recorded for each subject, as will resting metabolic
rate and the energy cost of walking. During the two-week energy measurement
period, heart rates and daily activity budgets, including the distance walked
each day, and the time spent foraging and resting, will also be recorded for
each subject,. Together, these data will be used to establish the daily energy
budget for human foragers, as well as the proportion of the daily energy budget
spent on various activities including resting metabolism and travel. Daily
energy budgets will then be compared among subjects to determine the effects of
gender, age, and number of dependents on daily energy expenditure. These data
will be used to test and inform hypotheses regarding the energetic and
physiological demands on humans in pre-agricultural societies. A graduate
student and two Tanzanian researcher assistants will earn important research
experience through their involvement with this project. Results will be
incorporated into the curriculum at Washington University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
