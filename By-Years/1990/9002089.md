Software will be developed that provides experimental control of stimulus
display and data acquisition in neurophysiological and psychophysical
investigations of visual processing. This software is being developed for three
main reasons: (1) to take advantage of advances in computer technology that
facilitate the development of such systems, (2) to incorporate an extensive
library of low- level visual display drivers that have been developed at NYU
over the past five years, and (3) to incorporate modern design concepts into the
software. The software is expected to provide the basic experimental control
program for the next 5-10 years for the research group involved in this
proposal. In addition, a key design feature of the software system is
portability, with the goal of freeing its general structure from dependance on a
specific processor architecture or on a particular set of input and output
devices. The common theme of the research that will initially use the newly
developed software is that it relies upon computer controlled generation and
display of visual patterns, either on monochrome or color monitors along with
the collection of stimulus-evoked behavioral and neural responses. Although the
initial effort will concentrate on the generation of software for visual
experimentation, the design of the system is by no means limited to this area,
and adaptation of the general control structures to a wide range of neural and
behavioral experiments should be straightforward.
