This Major Research Instrumentation RUI grant supports the acquisition of a
scanning probe microscope (SPM)) for use in materials research and education.
The selected SPM allows for temperature variation using hot and cold stages. For
research purposes, the instrument has the needed measurement modes, sensitivity,
resolution, and acquisition software to examine composition-structure-property
relationships of elastomers and polymers, investigate magnetic domains and twin
boundaries in magnetic shape memory alloys, assess surface roughness in thin
films, characterize the defect structure in anisotropic superconductors, and
provide quantitative feedback regarding dimension and quality of nanoimprinted
features. These are topics that impact telecommunications, micromachining,
industrial processing, polymer science, and nanotechnology industries. Several
courses will benefit from SPM's broad array of scanning measurement
capabilities, which include mapping of surface topography, hardness, elastic
moduli, contact friction, magnetic domains, and tunneling
current.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polymer science, nanotechnology, and magnetism
have been extensively used in the development of new technologies and there is
continued demand for fundamental research within these various fields of
materials science. Without a doubt, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has
spearheaded many recent advances in these fields. Acquisition of an SPM will
permit the faculty to expand current research efforts and continue to foster
interdisciplinary collaborations already underway. In addition, the acquisition
will allow researchers to initiate new projects with industry and will help
prepare students for creative contributions in these areas. &lt;br/&gt;
