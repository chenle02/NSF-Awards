9311716 Reznikoff The extensive genetic, physiological and biochemical analysis
of R. coli bacteria make this the best defined of all organisms. It is critical
to integrate these bodies of information. This meeting will be held at the
University of Wisconsin on Sept. 9-13, 1993 in Madison, WI. We will bring
together leading researchers in the analysis of genomes at the genetic and
sequence level, and will facilitate the coordination of the structural and
functional analysis of this organism's genome. %%% The E. coli genome analysis
efforts are likely to be the first which will achieve a complete sequence
determination of a free- living organism. ***
