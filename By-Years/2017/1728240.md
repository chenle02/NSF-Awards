This project attempts to situate the ways in which legal mobilization and social
movement activism are shaped by social and political contexts, especially in
regimes where the political space is constrained. It specifically examines the
impact on perceived political acceptance in illiberal regimes, which have a
noted hostility to human rights frames, of adopting a human rights frame as a
substitute when approaching identity issues.

The research plan involves participant observation over 12 months with 3 social
movement organizations and approximately 50 semi-structured interviews. The
project offers the potential for increasing understanding of the ability of
social movements to shift frames in ways that enhance their social desirability,
in both liberal and illiberal societies.
