Larsen 9701410 This award funds the research of Professor Michael Larsen, who
will investigate two problems in algebraic number theory. The first is a project
undertaken jointly with Richard Pink to analyze in a qualitative sense the full
image of a compatible system of Galois representations. The underlying classical
problem, finding the Galois group of the points of finite order on an abelian
variety, goes back at least to Kronecker in special cases but remains unsolved
in general. The second project is more narrowly focused and concerns the search
for a generalization to n-dimensional varieties of Hasse's reciprocity law for
central simple algebras over number fields. This research falls into the general
mathematical field of Number Theory. Number Theory has its historical roots in
the study of the whole numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with
the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches
of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons.
However, within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in
diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and
communication systems.
