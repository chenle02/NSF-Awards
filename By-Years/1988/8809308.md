Size-exclusion chromatography is used widely for preparative bioseparations.
This is a basic study to develop a molecular based model to describe the
penetration of a colloidal solute into a porous medium, and to perform batch
partitioning experiments to validate the microscopic modelling. The theory will
involve a density functional approach. The theory will be used to examine the
influence of enthalpic effects on the selectivity of the porous medium.
Multicomponent systems are easily handled, so that competitive aspects of the
separation mechanism can be analyzed. The batch experiments will concern a well-
defined colloidal suspension and a well-defined porous matrix to make
comparisons with theory as clear as possible. In addition to the batch
experiments, an attempt will be made to use a light scattering technique to
probe the concentration of a colloidal solute within a porous bed. If
successful, this technique could be very useful for studying equilibrium as well
as non-equilibrium phenomena, in these well-defined interfacial systems.
