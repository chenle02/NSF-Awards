Three broad research topics are outlined. The glue which binds them is the
investigation of zero finding algorithms of higher order (order greater than 2).
The goals of the proposed research includes contributions to the understanding
of the global behavior of zero finding algorithms, application of such higher
order algorithms to two point boundary value problems, and the development of
fast algorithms for finding "approximate zeros". This research is likely to be
of great interest in dynamical systems as a source of examples. Professor
Curry's approach is to begin extensive computer experimentation, making this
project a natural one for inclusion in the Computational Mathematics Program.
