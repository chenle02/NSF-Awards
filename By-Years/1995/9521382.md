9521382 Swift In this project, the PI will participate, with Scripps Ocean Data
Facility (ODF) personnel, in oceanographic sections crossing from the Siberian
continental shelves into the Nansen, Amundsen, and Makarov basins of the Arctic
Ocean, and a transect of the Siberian ends of the three basins in July-
September, 1996, as part of the ACSYS (ARCtic System Sciences) program on both
Swedish and German icebreakers. The PI proposes to augment the full depth CTD
measurements by providing 36-place rosettes, and carrying out top-quality
measurements of salinity, dissolved oxygen, and nutrients at about 120 locations
along the tracks. These data are crucial to understanding the interactionsof the
Arctic Ocean circulation on the global climate system. The ODF capability will
add a very important element of quality control to this set of measurements. ***
