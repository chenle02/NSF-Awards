This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will support mathematical research on
general mathematical structures for fast Fourier transforms algorithms. The
focus will be on computing the discrete Fourier transform for the general case.
Applications to data possessing crystallographic symmetries will be made.
Studies on related fast convolution algorithms will also be made. Data
transformation and permutation algorithms will be produced. These be necessary
for transforming data between stages of the Fourier transforms and for reducing
and expanding data for input and output. Algorithms will be adapted to machine
architectures including those of vector, parallel and hierarchical memory
machines. They will take account of data flow, data permutations and data access
in large scale computations. Group theoretical methods will play an important
part in this effort. Included in the work is the goal of a systematic
classification of the symmetries of all crystallographic groups. Algorithms and
programs for others parts of the crystallographic calculation, particularly the
refinement problem, will be produced. Implementation of this work in one large
general crystallographic program package and report on the efficiency is
planned.
