The main goal of the proposed project is to study the effect that the ambient
field has on the behavior of set expanders. This is explored by studying the
Euclidean analogs of two problems which were recently investigated in the
context of vector spaces over finite fields. The first problem is a natural
generalization of the Falconer distance problem to the study of point
configurations. The second problem is drawn from a large class of problems known
as the sum-product problems. The continuous nature of the first problem and the
discrete nature of the second allows the researcher to incorporate a variety of
methods from various fields in order to better illustrate the general principles
involved. These include methods drawn from arithmetic and geometric
combinatorics, number theory, and classical harmonic analysis. The juxtaposition
of the methods from the Euclidean cases with the methods in the context of the
finite field geometry could provide a more complete picture of the set expansion
phenomenon.

This project involves studying the interaction between several areas of
mathematics using a problem-solving approach, in which two problems are
considered whose analogs have known solutions in one subfield of mathematics
known as finite field geometry. The problems are examined in two additional
related subfields known as discrete and continuous Euclidean geometry. The goal
of the project is to not only find solutions to the two problems in these
alternate contexts, but to explore the interplay between a variety of known
methods and techniques in order to obtain a more complete understanding of the
scope of the general principles involved. The major areas of mathematics these
problems are taken from include additive and geometric combinatorics, number
theory, and classical harmonic analysis. These areas have a variety of
applications in encryption, data mining, signal processing, and bioinformatics.
