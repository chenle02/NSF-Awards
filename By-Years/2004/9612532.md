ABSTRACT OPP-9612532 GRAYSON/KING This dissertation project will use data from
the Upper Kolyma region, northeastern Siberia, to undertake a broad examination
of stone tool technology over a 4000 year period (11,000 - 7,000 B.P.). The
proposed research involves an analysis of material from three sites (Uptar,
Kheta, Buyunda), an analysis of assemblage variability using published reports,
and the investigation of the potentials of an environmental model for explaining
artifact variability in this region. This study will make a significant
contribution toward understanding the early prehistory of northeastern Siberia.
A regional analysis of tools and manufacturing debris, and the environment in
which people made and used tools, is prerequisite to an understanding of the
earliest settlers of Beringia and the New World.
