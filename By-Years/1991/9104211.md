In this project, the PI's will collect and analyze high-resolution hydrographic
and nutrient data at 235 stations along 32 degrees South as part of the South
Pacific component of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic
Program. Preliminary analysis of the data will begin by focusing on studies of
western boundary currents, meridional heat flux, thermocline circulation,, and
deep circulation. The section will overlie two current meter arrays off
Australia and New Zealand, allowing this to be one of the primary flux lines for
WOCE.
