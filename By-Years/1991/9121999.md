This award provides funds to build an FDDI LAN using existing fiber cable, with
network analyzer and logic analyzer interface. This local area network will
support research projects in queuing and control theoretic algorithms for rate
based flow control, high- performance network interoperability modelling, impact
of application-network interaction on high data rate network performance,
multimedia information on a distributed system, and high performance FDDI
networks for VSAT internetworking. Equipment will be purchased to assemble a
campus-wide Fiber Distributed-Data Interface (FDDI) network to support
experimental communications research as well as to provide a testbed for
distributed multimedia. Research projects supported include the development and
implementation of a new rate control algorithm for local area networks (LAN),
interoperability modeling, optimal organization and performance of distributed
systems based on high data rate LAN's, and network-aided construction and access
to digital multimedia information.
