This award supports the research on level structures for Abelian varieties of
Professor Peter Norman of the University of Massachusetts. Dr. Norman's work
will involve the problems of lifting Abelian varieties from positive
characteristic to zero characteristic, as well as researches on Hilbert-
Blumenthal varieties and Dieudonne theory. This is research in the field of
arithmetic algebraic geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of
algebraic geometry and number theory. In its original formulation, algebraic
geometry treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest
equations, namely polynomials. Number theory started with the whole numbers and
such questions as divisibility of one whole number by another. These two
subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from the
earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual influence has
increased greatly. The field of arithmetic algebraic geometry now uses
techniques from all of modern mathematics, and is having corresponding influence
beyond its own borders.
