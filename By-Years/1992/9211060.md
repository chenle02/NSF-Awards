New applications - such as automatic knowledge discovery - are making new
demands on database systems. The constraints on collaborations between query
optimizers and query-plan evaluators in conventional database systems severely
limit the use of database systems for these new applications. The award supports
research into unconventional kinds of collaborations between query optimizers
and query-plan evaluators, including the migration of selected optimization
decisions to run-time, the scheduling of multiple-implementation queries, and
the migration of the use of prefetch hints from the query-plan evaluator to the
query optimizer. The performance of the techniques is being extensively analyzed
using an integrated rule-based optimizer and database system simulator. This
research is expected to result in more efficient designs for a new generation of
more flexible, high-performance database systems.
