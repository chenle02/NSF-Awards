This project is a modeling study of the deep and bottom water formation process
along the continental margin of the Western Weddell Sea. It will be based on an
existing three-dimensional primitive equation model (the so-called Semi-spectral
Primitive Equation Model, or SPEM) proven successful in coastal circulation
studies. Direct observations made during the occupation of Ice Station Weddell
in 1992 will be used to initialize, force, and diagnose the model results.
Modifications to the model will allow the inclusion of changes in sea water
density due to freezing and melting of ice (surface buoyancy fluxes), sea ice
dynamics, and ocean /ice-shelf interactions. Expected results from the study are
the simulation of existing water mass characteristics, their spatial and
temporal evolution, and the regional circulation of the Weddell Sea. It will
also be possible to evaluate the model itself with respect to the sensitivity of
simulated results with respect to model parameters and parameterization schemes,
intensity of external forcing, and variations in initial conditions. The results
will test existing theories of deep and bottom water formation for the
southwestern Weddell Sea.
