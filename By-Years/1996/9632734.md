If politics makes a difference in parliamentary democracies, then the promises
political parties make during electoral campaigns should have a systematic
impact on their subsequent policy making in office. Existing studies of
parliamentary politics have failed to provide an adequate explanation of whether
and to what degree this connection exists. This research will extend the scope
of narrowly constructed models of coalition bargaining to all stages of policy
making activity in the legislature and shift the theoretical focus of
traditional analysis of comparative legislative behavior toward promising
questions such as why parties behave as they do. The project will advance the
empirical state of knowledge in comparative legislatures through the systematic
collection of data across the parliamentary democracies of France, Germany,
Ireland, and The Netherlands. Data collection will require year-long field
research examining legislative proceedings. Econometric methods will be used to
model the complex relationships that theory suggests should characterize
legislative bargaining.
