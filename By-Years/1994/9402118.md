9402118 Mislove This award supports a conference on semigroup theory and its
applications to be held at Tulane University this spring. The impetus for the
conference is to commemorate the contributions of Professor Alfred H. Clifford,
who played a fundamental role in the development of semigroup theory. The object
of the conference is to identify the state of the theory of semigroups at this
time, and to look forward by identifying those areas of research where semigroup
theory can play an important role. This award is in the area of semigroups. A
semigroup is one of the simplest of the abstract mathematical structures,
consisting of a set with one associative operation on it. The structure of these
very general objects will be investigated. Applications will be given to various
areas of mathematics and computer science.
