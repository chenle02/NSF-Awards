The chemistry of our Universe is dominated by carbon molecules called polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). As much as a quarter of all carbon - perhaps the
most important element for life - is contained in these chemicals. In this
project, a dedicated astrochemistry program will explore the chemical pathways
leading to complex PAHs. The investigators will focus on the observations of
cold, dark molecular clouds where PAHs are found in abundance. These clouds are
sites of the earliest stages of star formation, which hints that these molecules
may play a large role in the chemistry of young stars and planets. Radio
telescopes will be used to search for more PAHs in this region in space, and
computer machine learning approaches will be developed to help us understand the
chemistry. Data products and computer code the investigators create will be
released freely and publicly. The investigators will share their research to the
public through a series of online seminars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The presence of
PAHs in cold clouds is surprising, as it has long been thought that they are
predominantly formed in the high-temperature envelopes of evolved stars. The
extremely high-sensitivity, high-resolution spectroscopic line survey that has
enabled this first wave of discoveries is only the tip of the iceberg. The
investigators will continue analysis of these data, including searching for new
PAHs and other chemically related species and create a novel machine learning
approach to predicting and exploring interstellar chemical inventories. These
projects will interface closely with laboratory spectroscopy and astrochemical
modeling aspects with a large collaboration of
astronomers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
