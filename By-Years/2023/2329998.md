This award funds the scientific analysis of materials recovered from the site of
Broken Mammoth in central Alaska. This site has figured heavily in debates about
the peopling of the Americas and yielded a vast collection of artifacts and
butchered animal bones--far more diverse and numerous than from other early
Beringian sites. These materials hold clues to understanding human adaptations
during the transition from the last Ice Age to the modern environment. Through
analysis of the site collection, the research team will explore changes in
foraging ecology and seasonal land use strategies, reconstruct subsistence
economies, and investigate changes in site activities through time. Broader
impacts include making site materials and primary data available to the
scientific community, support for several students and a post-doctoral
researcher, educational opportunities for Indigenous youth, and a cultural
heritage summit with regional Tribal leadership.

Investigations at Broken Mammoth (1989â€“2010) in central Alaska revealed a deeply
buried site with multiple occupations dating from 13,310 to 2250 years ago,
including two rare residential camps. The site has been highly influential in
developing broad spectrum foraging models and has yielded the largest faunal
assemblage in Beringia by species richness and count of identified specimens.
However, no detailed artifact, faunal, or spatial analyses have been conducted.
The project team will curate and analyze this large collection in order to
reconstruct human resource and risk management strategies from initial human
settlement to the recent past. The team will employ zooarchaeological,
biomolecular (proteomic and genetic species identifications), and lithic
technological analyses. Objectives include reconstructing site subsistence
economies through time (including diet breadth and seasonal land use
strategies); investigating raw material use and procurement; and identifying
site structure and activity patterns through plant macrofossil, spatial and
hearth biochemical analyses. This integrated analytical strategy will enable the
research team to document changes in human behavior through time and link human
adaptations to regional environmental dynamics.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
