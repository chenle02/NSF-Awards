This award provides funding for participation in the conference "Current
Progress in Mathematical Physics" to be held at Harvard University in Boston, MA
over the course of four days during the week of December 10--17, 2018. The
conference will focus on recent developments in analysis, especially in the
field of mathematical physics and quantum information science. The goal of the
meeting is to bring together a broad spectrum of mathematicians, physicists, and
information scientists to cross-fertilize ongoing research, stimulate new
collaborations, and discuss long-range research goals. The interdisciplinary
structure aims to interest students and researchers in potential new methods and
to advance ideas that cross the boundaries of mathematics, physics, and quantum
information.

The conference will feature presentations by leading researchers in mathematical
physics and quantum information science. One topical focus is a recently-
discovered coincidence between representation theory and Riemannian geometry and
its potential use in development of a consistent mathematical theory that
embodies both quantum theory and relativity. Other topics emphasized in the
conference include geometrical concepts in quantum information theory and the
development of an analytic point of view in topological quantum field theory.
This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups,
and researchers without other sources of support an opportunity to attend and
participate in this conference. More information will be made available at the
conference webpage: http://www.arthurjaffe.com/Assets/pdf/HarvardWorkshop.pdf

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
