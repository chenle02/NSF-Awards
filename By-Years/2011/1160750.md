This RAPID project will examine the current drought in East Africa in a timely
manner. There are four scientific goals (i) to assess the severity of the
drought and the extent of regional area affected; (ii) to determine the seasonal
nature of the drought; (iii) to investigate the factors contributing to its
unusual severity; and (iv) to predict the likelihood that the drought will
persist into 2012. Reaching this understanding is more challenging for the Horn
of Africa than for most areas of Africa because of the complexity of the
seasonal cycle, the multiple factors that influence drought in this region, the
lack of access to meteorological data from some of the countries afflicted, and
the sparse history of meteorological research on this region. The prediction
will be carried out in collaboration with the research group of Prof. Peter
Webster of Georgia Institute of Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will increase understanding of meteorology in an area of the world that is
frequently plagued by weather disasters and where we currently have little
understanding of the factors governing such disasters. Finally the project will
demonstrate a forecast approach that, if successful, has the potential to be
applied to other locations and situations.
