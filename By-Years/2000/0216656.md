This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project creates new
technology and materials that emphasize data analysis in science education. Data
analysis makes scientific concepts and processes concrete and gives students
another way - besides memorization or analytical understanding - to learn
quantitative science, often bypassing the need for advanced symbolic
mathematics. This project will emphasize physics classes in high school and
beyond, where labs are often cookbook demonstrations of phenomena and the data
analysis mere verification. The first phase of this research, with the help of
new technology, provided evidence those students understanding and competence
could be improved beyond their previous capabilities. This project enhances that
technology-Fathom Dynamic Statistics Software (KCP Technologies 2000) - to make
it more useful in the science classroom, and it develops curriculum materials
that use this software. Specifically, the firm will produce complete manuscripts
for two supplemental books in physics appropriate for the high-school, AP, or
college introductory course: a lab manual and a book of problem sets. In
addition, Epistemological Engineering will begin to explore and prototype
additional materials in physics, materials for other sciences, and staff
development offerings.

The proposed research will lead to significant enhancements to Fathom software
and open the door to creating curriculum materials in science education using
tools previously available only to math educators. Epistemological Engineering
proffers technology that will contribute to strengthening science education in
this country by teaching students to thoughtfully approach the world with a zest
for measurement and prediction.
