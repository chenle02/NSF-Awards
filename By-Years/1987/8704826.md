The group at Purdue headed by Professor T. Casavant will purchase a 64- node
hypercube multiprocessor which it will use to explore algorithms and their
implementation for future advanced parallel systems. Some of the research
projects involved will be: o Languages for parallel computation o PDE, VLSI and
computer vision systems o Parallelism control
