9310099 McGrath This research extends and expands work on the impact of
experience and change on the use of electronic technology in work groups that is
currently funded by the Information Technology and Organizations Program. The
research will examine: The extent to which differences between communication
media endure when groups accrue considerable experience with relatively new
media; Both the disruptive and the empowering effects of sudden shifts in
technology on process and performance of work groups; The role of group
autonomy, of particular divisions of labor, and of prior stability/variation in
major facets of the group, on how well work groups adapt to technological (and
other) changes; and the conditions under which various forms of system change or
restructuring are likely to result from changes in group technology (or group
tasks and membership composition).
