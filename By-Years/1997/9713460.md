This program will determine how well geomagnetic storms can be predicted from
magnetic polarities and orientation of disappearing filaments (DF) and soft
x-ray arcades on the Sun. The PI will specifically address whether the topology
of these fields is usually preserved upon eruption. The approach will involve:
(1) a large data base of DFs, essentially independent of flares, for which the
bounding polarities and geometrical orientations of preexisting filaments have
been measured, (2) a determination of these properties for a data set of large-
scale coronal x-ray arcades observed by Yohkoh, (3) the solar locations of the
filaments and arcades into GSM coordinates so geometrical coupling effects
influencing the occurrence rate and severity of storms can be accounted for, and
(4) a superposed epoch analysis technique to compare different sets of the DF
and arcade data with storm indices and a storm data set to determine which solar
parameters are most geoeffective. The project results will improve understanding
of solar mass ejecta characteristics that are most geoeffective, thereby
enhancing the prediction of moderate to large storms, key to forecasting space
weather.
