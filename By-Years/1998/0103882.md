Abstract for DMS - 0103882

The proposed research program seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the
dynamical phenomena of non hyperbolic systems with singularities. The main goal
is to investigate the interplay between dynamics and the growth and structure of
generating groups, the number theoretic properties of the defining parameters,
and the topology and geometry of restricting domains and the induced symbolic
dynamical systems. The scope of the program includes generalizations of interval
exchanges, polygonal dual billiard maps, piecewise isometries.



This program is in dynamical systems, an active area of mathematics whose main
objective is to study long term behavior of objects under applications of the
same mathematical principle. Apart from applications in other areas of
mathematics, the proposed program will have implications in Electrical
Engineering, in particular in digital filters. Digital filters, are algorithms
used commonly in electrical components that built in many wireless and voice
recognition devices.
