Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sensor networks are today being deployed in
scientific applications in fields and buildings, but their use underwater has
been quite limited. Undersea sensor networks are either based on expensive wired
devices or a small number of relatively large nodes with long-range acoustic
communications. The Sensor Networks For Undersea Seismic Experimentation (SNUSE)
project is developing fundamental tools to support small, low-cost, wireless
undersea sensor nodes. With laboratory and testbed experimentation and
simulation, the project investigates:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Hardware for small,
low-power, moderate-range acoustic telemetry for underwater sensor
nodes;&lt;br/&gt;- Time synchronization, localization, and energy-efficient MAC
protocols for environments with high-delay, acoustic communication;&lt;br/&gt;-
Applications protocols for ultra-low duty cycle operation, including long-
duration sleep and wakeup and efficient application-level data caching and
forwarding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is directly applicable to
applications in undersea sensing, including contaminant and pollution monitoring
undersea micro- and macro-organism -life tracking, and seismic monitoring of
undersea oil fields. Although focused on undersea applications, a large portion
of the research is also applicable to traditional sensor networks.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work supports undergraduate and graduate research at
USC, both directly and through sensor networking laboratory classes and the
developing CiSoft Masters Degree in Smart Oil-field technology. The results of
this work will be disseminated via technical papers, freely available hardware
designs and software on the project web site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
