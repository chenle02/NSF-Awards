Summer science for girls in a two week residential summer science enrichment
program for girls entering the ninth grade. The program will be conducted by The
University of Michigan Women in Science Program of the Center for the Continuing
Education of Women in collaboration School of Natural Resources, the College of
Engineering, and the UM Information Technology Division. Students will select a
focus project in one of three areas: chemistry, engineering or natural
resources. In the second year, a forth focus project area in physics will be
added. Students will spend two hours each morning in a discussion group and two
hours each afternoon in corresponding hands-on laboratory project in their focus
areas. Students will be introduced to the concepts of the scientific research
methodology during orientation and these concepts will be reinforced and
expanded upon during the focus project sessions. They will participate in a
computer project daily involving a basic analog to digital converter used to
gather data from a simple sensor and convert it to numerical information more
suitable for analysis. After gathering data, students will use common graphics
programs to graph the data. Participants will be able to take the analog to
digital converter back to their school, install it in their science laboratories
and instruct others in its use. Students will also participate in a field
biology trip, a mathematics program, and a field trip to a science and
technology museum. Evening sessions will be devoted to career panels in
chemistry, geology, science teaching, engineering, biology, mathematics and
physics Students will have an opportunity to talk with women scientists in each
area.
