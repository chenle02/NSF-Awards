Photosynthetic efficiency is the fundamental molecular basis for biological
energy generation in the plant world. The PI's laboratory has developed an
experimental system which allows the manipulation of coordinate gene expression
of photosynthesis related genes in a similar genetic background. The
experimental system consists of salt tolerant alfalfa cell lines and salt
tolerant plants regenerated from these cell lines that show enhanced
photosynthesis gene expression under salt stress conditions. The PI proposes to
identify the basic molecular mechanisms which lead to the accumulation of these
gene products and their role in the salt tolerant behavior at the cellular
level. The results from these basic biological experiments will increase
understanding of important regulatory features in photosynthesis gene
expression. These experiments will also provide a model system for understanding
the more applied role of photosynthesis related functions in salt sensitivity
versus tolerance in plants.
