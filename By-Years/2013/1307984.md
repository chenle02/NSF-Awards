The objective of this collaborative research between FIU and Georgia Tech is to
achieve simultaneous powering and communication of implantable and wearable
sensors through novel Highly Efficient, Misalignment-Insensitive, and Broadband
(HEMIB) Strongly Coupled Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) systems that cause reduced
biological side-effects. Intellectual Merit: Our research will generate the
required fundamental and technological knowledge for deriving the first HEMIB
SCMR designs with unprecedented power transfer efficiency, bandwidth and
alignment-insensitive characteristics for homogeneous, lossy, dispersive and
non-homogeneous media.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Our research is expected to
yield significant societal benefits because of its impact to health and quality
of life, as it will be able to support the powering of safe and smart
implantable systems that will enable next generation applications; including,
implantable or wearable biomonitoring of senior people in assisted living,
pacemakers, drug delivery, artificial organs, bionics for people with
disabilities and injured military personnel, and novel treatments for cancer and
brain disorders. Our work is expected to advance discovery and understanding
while promoting teaching, training, and learning through integration of cross-
disciplinary themes from our research with education. &lt;br/&gt;
