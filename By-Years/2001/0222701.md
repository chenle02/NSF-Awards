In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning and
Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is designed
to meet GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren in a
global information network with the ultimate goal of better understanding
Earth's environment and changes that take place within it. This project will
support, develop, and promote the phenology protocol for use at GLOBE schools in
order to detect the annual waves of plant green-up and senescence that occur as
photosynthesis becomes active and then dormant with the cycling of the seasons.
While satellites can detect such waves, there is very little data on what
exactly the satellite derived greenness index is actually indicating, especially
in areas like the dry tropical and semi-arid regions. This project will conduct
phenology measurements near the existing network of carbon flux-measuring eddy
covariance towers and also in urban and other data-sparse areas. A variety of
remote sensing algorithms and processing techniques will be compared with the
GLOBE phenology data, to allow a more accurate interpretation of this remotely
sensed data. Scientists will benefit from improving knowledge of integrated
phenological processes, and students will benefit from conducting real research
with their own and others' data. This project is being jointly supported by
NASA's Terrestrial Ecosystems Program.&lt;br/&gt;%%%
