This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Local and
Nonlocal Trends in Analysis and Geometry" that will be held University of
Pittsburgh on October 10-12, 2019.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses
on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of nonlocal partial
differential equations and geometric analysis. A number of distinguished
mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. This award
gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups, and
researchers not funded by NSF, an opportunity to attend and participate in this
conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding
opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.
