This dissertation project focuses on an understanding of the historical
development of the infrastructure of modern aviation through detailed
investigation into one component of the infrastructure: blind landing systems.
In particular this project will analyze the process of negotiation that took
place between representatives of labor unions, Federal agencies, the
International Civil Aviation Organization, airlines, and radio and electronic
companies which resulted in the construction of a standardized system. This
involved the rejection of some possible systems, and hence this project will
investigate both successful and failed technologies. Because modern aviation is
a highly complex system that has evolved both in terms of its technologies and
the organizations that use and mange them, understanding its development as an
historical process will help scholars better understand the development of
large-scale, public-sector technologies. The finished project will take the form
of an historical narrative, based upon extensive examination of published
primary documents, and through the examination of unpublished material contained
in the archives of government agencies, relevant labor unions, and commercial
organizations, and the International Civil Aviation Organization.
