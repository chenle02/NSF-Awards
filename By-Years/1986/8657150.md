The normal transport of inorganic ions across the surface membrane of any cell
is essential for its physiological function. This research is directed toward
understanding how eukaryotic cell membranes tranport ions, and in particular,
how yeast cells tranport potassium. Two potassium transport systems have been
identified thus far, one having a high affinitiy and one a low affinity. The
gene for the high affinity transporter has been cloned, and a quantitative assay
for transport through this system has been developed. Deletion of the gene for
the high affinity transporter permits the study of the low affinity transporter
and of potassium extrusion pathways. The next goals of this research are to
study the surface membrane potassium transporter proteins in more detail and to
identify and characterize the systems mediating potassium transport in
intracellular organelles (mitochondria and vacuoles). This research will provide
important new information on the molecular mechanisms of ion transport in
eukaryotic cells, and is the basis of this Presidential Young Investigator Award
to Dr. Richard F. Gaber.
