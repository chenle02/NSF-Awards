The research project of this Presidential Faculty Fellow is in the general area
of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. During the two-year tenure of this award,
Professor Shaka and his students will utilize innovative magic angle spinning,
cross polarization, proton decoupling, and pulse sequence techniques to obtain
chemical information from NMR spectra that is characteristic of selected, local
regions of samples. This approach to materials characterization has broad
applications in such areas as organic solids and polymers, reactions at
interfaces, isotopically doped porus materials, layered solids, and materials
defects analysis. %%% This Presidential Faculty Fellowship, which subsumes the
final two years of Professor Shaka's Presidential Young Investigator Award
(CHE-8957560), should significantly assist him in the continuing development of
his vital, innovative, and productive program of research and research training.
