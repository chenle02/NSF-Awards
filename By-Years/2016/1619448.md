The advent of modern data generation, collection, communication, retention, and
application has brought about an important new discipline termed data science.
It draws upon diverse techniques from statistics, machine learning, computer
science, and information theory to analyze, understand, and most importantly,
utilize, data. It therefore significantly impacts diverse fields ranging from
medicine to marketing, manufacturing, finance, and security. Much of the initial
work in this area has centered on simple models to to facilitate analysis. This
project is focused on bringing these results closer to real-world applications
such as natural language processing. The results of this work are expected to
lead to a better ability to predict future events, detect anomalies, and
classify data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research in this project is focused on
three technical thrusts: (i) extending data science concepts to practical
regimes, (ii) utilizing structure, and (iii) understanding the effect of memory
in data sources. With regards to (i), the objective is to develop optimal
distribution estimators not just for the traditional Kullback-Leibler
divergence, but also for other metrics, and to do so for arbitrary parameter
values, not just restricted asymptotic regimes. With regards to (ii), the
objective is to utilize structure to improve distribution estimates and to
resolve a conundrum where theorists and practitioners employ opposing
distribution estimation techniques. With regards to (iii), the general objective
is to study the problem of estimating distributions with memory. Preliminary
results have uncovered an interesting dichotomy between compression and learning
when memory is present. Through these technical thrusts, this project will study
complex and realistic data models and derive results with important theoretical
implications as well as applications in a variety of fields.
