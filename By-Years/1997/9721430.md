The PI, whose main area of research has been analytical and computational fluid
dynamics, has recently started working with experimental neuroscientists. These
neuroscientists are studying the question of orientation tuning in the mammalian
visual cortex, a problem of long-standing neurobiological interest. In this
collaboration, the PI has proposed mathematical models for the problem and has
obtained both analytical and numerical results for the models. These results are
then compared to the experimental results. By making such a comparison, they
find what aspects of the model produce what types of behavior. This then
suggests what types of mechanisms might be present or absent at various levels
of the visual cortex. The funds from this interdisciplinary grant will help the
PI continue the present collaboration, start new collaborations, and broaden and
deepen her background in the neurosciences. The PI will spend the year at New
York University's Center for Neural Science.
