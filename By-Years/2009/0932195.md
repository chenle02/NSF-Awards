The objective of this proposal is to acquire a low cost bench-top flow
cytometer to augment the PI?s research activities in the area of microfluidic
cell separation. The desired instrument is the Cell Lab Quanta SC system
manufactured by Beckman Coulter Inc. This system has the ability to count cells
in a heterogeneous suspension based on fluorescent light emission and detection
at three distinct wavelengths as well as the ability to measure cell sizes in
the range of 3-40 Ã¬m.

The capability to perform accurate, automated measurements of cell size and
fluorescence with the Quanta SC system will greatly enhance the PI's
transformative research efforts in (i) fingerprinting cell-ligand pairs based on
receptor responses to fluid shear stress to identify as-yet undiscovered
identify stem or progenitor populations that are resident in certain tissue
niches; (ii) designing a microfluidic immunophenotyping system for the detection
of uveitis and intraocular lymphoma; (iii) enriching cardiomyocytes
systematically as a precursor to effectively designing cardiac tissue patches;
and (iv) designing microfluidic cell separation devices to isolate and
characterize cardiac progenitor cells.

High school students and teachers participating in summer research at the
experimental research via existing Young Scholar and RET programs at
Northeastern University will have the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of
flow cytometry with an instrument that is far more accessible and simpler to use
than conventional flow cytometery systems. The Quanta SC will also be integrated
into a laboratory module on microfluidics in a senior-level undergraduate
laboratory course.
