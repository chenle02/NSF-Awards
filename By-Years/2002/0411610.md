0411610&lt;br/&gt;Findley&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Miami in Florida
provides support for the acquisition of oceanographic instrumentation to be used
on three vessels operated by the university's Rosenstiel School of Marine and
Atmospheric Sciences (RSMAS) and the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution.
All three ships are operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic
Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. Specifically, support is recommended
for a position and orientation system for R/V Seward Johnson, providing high
resolution data on vessel location and orientation for use in processing
acoustic current meter data as well as input to the vessel's dynamic positioning
system, and for use in improving navigation for other scientific systems. The
award will also provide support to acquire a high resolution, hull-mounted
acoustic Doppler current profiler for R/V Walton Smith, and a separate, 300 kHz
lowered acoustic current profiler to study vertical current structure through
the full water column. These acquisitions should provide a substantial
improvement in the shared-use instrumentation available to marine scientists
using the HBOI and RSMAS vessels in their research during 2004 and future
years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
