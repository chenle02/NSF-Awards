Operation of mechanical systems at higher temperatures leads to greater
efficiency, but proper design requires the understanding of the behavior of the
individual components. This, in turn, requires a suitable model of the material
response and a means of computing the stresses and strains at critical points.
Detailed predictive capabilities are just becoming available and must be
evaluated. The objective of this research is to measure biaxial strains at
stress concentrations in metal specimens tested at high temperature (using laser
based techniques) (650oC) and compare the results with predictions.
