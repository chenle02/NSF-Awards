9504237 McLaughlin The proposed research lies in the interface of differential
topology and mathematical physics. More specifically, it deals with the so
called Wess-Zumino-Witten vector bundle on Teichmuller space and is an attempt
to give a rigorous formula for the projectively flat connection on this bundle.
In recent years several unexpected relations between topology and mathematical
physics have been discovered. If completely successful, the proposed research -
which is originally motivated by problems in quantum field theory - will likely
shed a new light on the study of 3-dimensional spaces and knot theory.
