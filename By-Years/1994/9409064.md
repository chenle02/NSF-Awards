9409064 Kalanovic In this research project, variable structure nonlinear rate
controllers are developed for dynamic systems commonly encountered in the
context of industrial environment. These controllers significantly improve
system performance by increasing the speed of response, lowering overshoot, and
enabling high disturbance rejection. The configuration of the controller
includes an error feedback structure identifier coupled with a variable
structure artificial neural network. The modified controller, so designed,
provides a capability of enforcing robust and high quality tracking.
Experimental results validate mathematical analysis, modeling and simulation of
the controlled nonlinear systems. ***
