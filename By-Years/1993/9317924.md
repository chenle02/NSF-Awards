Lively 9317924 The purpose of this study is to evaluate some of the critical
assumptions of the recently developed parasite hypothesis for the maintenance of
genetic diversity and cross fertilization in natural populations. The most
critical assumption of the parasite hypothesis is that there is selection
imposed by parasites against host genotypes that become locally common. If this
idea is correct, then there will be a disadvantage to clonal reproduction that
is proportional to the frequency of any clonally produced type. Such selection
requires that there is a genetic basis to infection by parasites, and that
parasites rapidly "track" locally common host genotypes. An ideal system for
testing these ideas is the snail-parasite interaction that Dr. Lively has been
working on since 1985. The snail and its parasite ( a trematode worm) can be
easily reared in the laboratory. The goal of the study is to determine whether
the parasite rapidly evolves to infect different clonal types, and whether it
can prevent clones from competitively displacing cross-fertilizing forms. The
results will be of interest to evolutionary and conservation biologists
interested in the maintenance of genetic diversity, as well as epidemiologists
working on similar parasites that cause human disease(e.g. Schistosomiasis).
