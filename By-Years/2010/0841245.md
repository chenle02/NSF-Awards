The proposed research is important for understanding how nerves grow and branch.
In particular, the project focuses on microtubules, which are elongated polymers
that provide architecture for the nerve and also act as railways to move
proteins and structures down the nerve. For the nerve to grow and branch, there
must be mobility within the microtubule array itself. Notably, it has been
discovered in recent years that only the shortest microtubules in the nerves are
mobile. To generate more mobility within the microtubule array, nerves use
special proteins that cut long microtubules into short ones. The purpose of this
project is to study how these microtubule "cutters" work, and how they are
controlled to get their job done properly. The cutting of microtubules is also
important for many other types of cells, so the studies will be of interest and
importance across various fields of biology. The general approach will be to
make cultures of rat neurons, and then use reliable methods to alter the
microtubule cutting proteins, and then see what the effects are on microtubules
and the shape of the nerves. The results are expected to show what other
molecules and mechanisms the neuron uses to control the cutting proteins so they
cut microtubules at the right time and place in the nerves. Broad impact will be
achieved through strong efforts to recruit minority students into the graduate
program at Drexel University. Even broader impact will be achieved by an
outreach to scientists and students in the developing nations of Africa. The
Principal Investigator will work with African partners to develop strategies for
bringing African students to the USA for part of their training so that the
students can prosper, upon their return to their home countries.
