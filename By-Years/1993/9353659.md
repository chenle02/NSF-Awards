93-53659 Geren Arkansas Undergraduate Research Program A pilot project is
proposed to develop a state-wide program to support undergraduate research.
Involvement in a hands-on research project is the capstone of a complete
undergraduate education. Funds are requested from NSF, the State of Arkansas,
and participating institutions to support individual research projects for 35
undergraduate students and their mentors. The program will be administered by
the Arkansas Science and Information Liaison Office. Criteria for selection of
participants and administration of the program are described. Students and
mentors will be able to request academic and summer support for students, summer
salary for mentors, and travel funds for the students to attend appropriate
scientific sessions. The program is primarily aimed at junior and senior
students, but all Arkansas institutions of higher education will be eligible to
compete. If the pilot project is successful, funds will be solicited within
Arkansas to continue and expand the program.
