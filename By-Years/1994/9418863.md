9418863 Murphy This project seeks to develop an integrated biostratigraphic
zonation of the Lochkovian and Pragian Stages of the Lower Devonian based on
stratigraphic sections and taxonomic studies of Nevadan, Spanish, Austrian, and
Bohemian material. It will integrate the biostratigraphies of the two most
useful groups, the conodonts and the graptolites, with the biostratigraphies of
the brachiopods, ostracodes microvertebrates, trilobites, dacryoconarids, and
corals stratigraphies as they are currently known. The project necessarily
depends on a close collaboration in their various institutions. The study will
integrate the various biostratigraphies through application of Shaw's method of
graphic correlation modified to weight evolutionary appearance of taxa more
strongly in developing a composite section for the Lower Devonian (lochkovian-
Pragian) that may be used for chronostratigraphic interpretation within the
interval. Most stratigraphic problems depend fundamentally on being able to
assign relative ages to the strata being studied. This project will seek to set
up a globally useful standard of comparison for biostratigraphic work and
relative age dating in the Lochkovian-Pragian interval. This is now possible
because of the present data base and circumstances of key personnel.
