Two themes are to be addressed in this investigation. The first is an extension
of earlier work on laminar massive separation in two-dimensions to include
unsteady phenomena and three-dimensional configurations. The second is to
further explore the earlier interaction model into the regime of transition to
turbulence and turbulent separation.
