This NSF award by the Biosensing /CBET program supports work by Professor Liju
Yang at North Carolina Central University (NCCU) to study the electrical
properties of cancer cells in comparison with normal epithelial cells. A
microfluidic chip with featured microelectrodes will be designed and developed
to carry out this study. The microchip will use dielectrophresis to capture
cells onto the microelectrodes. The captured cells will subsequently be studied
in a wide frequency range using electrical impedance spectroscopy, and their
electrical properties will be analyzed using proper equivalent circuit models.
This research will provide a direct (without biomarkers) approach to distinguish
cancer cells from normal cells. It has potential applications in early diagnosis
of cancer and monitoring of cancer metastasis and the progress of cancer
treatment. Education will include the incorporation of research into course
development and the training of minority undergraduate students at NCCU in
interdisciplinary research.
