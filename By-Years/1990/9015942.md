The process of producing boron nitride membranes with the required properties
will be established. A fundamental understanding of the inter-relationships
governing deposition conditions, composition, and film properties will be
achieved X-ray masks incorporation the optimal boron nitride membrane properties
will be produced and tested for radiation hardness. The effects of accelerated
exposure testing on the properties of membranes will be ascertained and issuing
technological challenges addressed.
