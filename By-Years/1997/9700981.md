9700981 Chen The PI proposes to uncouple heterologous protein production from
biomass production by improving the protein producing machinery, i.e., the
complex ribosomal messenger RNA processing. Three ribosomal regulatory factors,
Fis, ppGpp, and RMF, will be varied to find the improved processing conditions
under no-growth of slow growth E. coli conditions. The PI already has
indications that these factors have a significant effect on E. coli protein
processing under slow-growth, bioreactor conditions. The educational plan has
three components. The first is to coordinate development of a new Environmental
Biotechnology program between the Chemical and Environmental Engineering
Departments. Bioremediation will be the focus of the program. The second
involves facilitating undergraduate research, including minority participation,
an activity that Dr. Chen is already engaged in. Finally, he will be involved in
the development of 2 new courses in cell engineering and environmental
biotechnology. ***
