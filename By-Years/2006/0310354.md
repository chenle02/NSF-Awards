DMS-0310354&lt;br/&gt;Satyan Devadoss&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative
project funded under DMS-0310642 and &lt;br/&gt;DMS-0310354 is a CARGO full team
award made under solicitation &lt;br/&gt;http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2002/nsf02155/n
sf02155.htm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geodesists and computational geometry
specialists use different &lt;br/&gt;mathematical tools for building surfaces
from sampled points. One part of &lt;br/&gt;this project (DMS-0310642)
encompasses cross-fertilization of tool &lt;br/&gt;development along with
merging and extension of the underlying mathematical &lt;br/&gt;theories. The
mathematical development will address issues in statistical
&lt;br/&gt;adjustment theory, meshing and other computational geometry
applications, &lt;br/&gt;and modified polyhedral Morse theory. Another part of
the project &lt;br/&gt;(DMS-0310354) deals with exposing and equipping
undergraduates to work on such &lt;br/&gt;problems by offering courses and
summer REU workshops. The mission is to &lt;br/&gt;involve research at all
levels, based on the interplay of fundamental &lt;br/&gt;ideas, such as
curvature, polyhedral geometry, graphs on surfaces, and &lt;br/&gt;combinatorial
topology, eventually leading to advanced topics such as noise
&lt;br/&gt;handling in geodetic data, Morse theory, mesh generation of surfaces,
and &lt;br/&gt;smoothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using statistical adjustment
methods, traditional geodesists fit smooth &lt;br/&gt;surfaces to noisy surface
data. Using computational geometry, our computer &lt;br/&gt;scientists have
begun developing and will continue to develop efficient &lt;br/&gt;algorithms
for finding meshed surfaces that are close to and provably
&lt;br/&gt;homeomorphic to densely sampled smooth surfaces. The interplay
between &lt;br/&gt;differential and discrete geometry has sparked a renewed
interest among &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians and theoretical computer scientists to
find algorithms for &lt;br/&gt;computing topological invariants and for
examining properties of surface &lt;br/&gt;decompositions and of graphs on
surfaces. The research offers challenges &lt;br/&gt;to graduate students,
undergraduate students, and research faculty alike.&lt;br/&gt;
