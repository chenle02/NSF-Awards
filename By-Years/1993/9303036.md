The purpose of this conference is to provide an opportunity for researchers and
practitioners from academia, government and industry to convene and exchange
information and ideas. This meeting will provide an efficient means of transfer
of information between those already actively using image processing methods, as
well as to inform those considering use of the technology in the future of the
potential benefits.
