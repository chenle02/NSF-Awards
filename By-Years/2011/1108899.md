This project seeks to advance understandings of teacher professional knowledge
in science. It focuses on bringing greater clarity to the pedagogical content
knowledge (PCK) construct, the model of professional knowledge in which PCK is
embedded, and its implications for enhancing teacher practice and student
learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thirty participants from eight countries will
take on the task of contributing to and/or completing this synthesis through a
summit and follow-up activities. A set of recommendations will be made to guide
future research aimed at advancing this field of
study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very worthy project in science education
research. It is innovative and brings together world-wide experts in science
education to develop products that will communicate refined models for teacher
professional knowledge. The project draws on past NSF-supported research and
builds on a highly diverse body of literature. It yields a wealth of information
that could lead to a commonly accepted agreement among science education
researchers about PCK and articulates future directions for collaborative
research as well as instrument development and/or refinement.
