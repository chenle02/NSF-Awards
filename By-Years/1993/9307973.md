Funded under a Research Initiation Award, numerical simulations will be carried
out of the turbulent transport of both heat and chemical species. The issue is
differential diffusion, in which the molecular transport rates of heat, species,
and momentum are different. In the presence of turbulence, these differential
diffusion effects are important but poorly understood and little investigated.
The approach is via Direct Numerical Simulations based on spectral methods. The
research has application to turbulent combustion, and mixing of chemical species
in reactors.
