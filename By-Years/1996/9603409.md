The work proposed is a collaboration with the laboratory of Horst Hahn of the
Materials Science Department of the University of Darmstadt, Germany. The goal
of the research is tto develop novel methane oxidation catalysts for use in
catalytic converters in automobiles that run on natural gas. The catalysts will
consist of nobel metals such as silver, palladium, gold, and platinum. A novel
aspect of the work will be the use of nanocrystalline oxide supports. Natural
gas as a fuel is less costly per unit of energy than gasoline, and, if properly
burned, less damaging to the environment. The catalysts studied in this work are
designed for long life and high efficiency.
