This engineering education research project will support a workshop for emerging
leaders and mid-career faculty to build support networks and strategize about
leadership directions in the emerging research discipline of engineering
education. The workshop builds on a social identity theoretical framework to
facilitate membership in a social group, defining the group of emerging leaders
in engineering education research, and exploring how differences between groups
can be acknowledged and managed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance
and importance of this project arises from the potential impact on the
engineering education research community, and thus the long term impact the
research discipline can have on the STEM workforce. This project overlaps with
NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers by making investments that
lead to emerging new fields of engineering, or shifting existing fields.
Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results
and research that are useful for society by informing educational policy and
practices.
