The 11th William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is a five-day,
directed workshop on Interactions between three and four manifolds, to be held
at the Hamilton Mathematical Institute (HMI) in Dublin, Ireland, August 25-29,
2015. The workshop will consist of a two-day mini-course for graduate students
and junior researchers, followed by a three day lecture series. The goal of the
William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is to investigate common
themes and techniques in current research in geometry and topology and to
support junior researchers interested in these areas. This workshop will bring
together leading researchers in the fields of three and four dimensional spaces
with graduates students and junior researchers to investigate questions at the
forefront of research in these areas. The confluence of expertise from different
areas will result in new collaborative projects, and in broadening the research
horizons of the participants&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this year's
workshop is to investigate common themes and techniques in the research of three
and four-dimensional spaces. The two-day mini course will be on bridging
classical three- and four-manifold theory given by Martin Scharlemann (Santa
Barbara) and David Gay (Georgia). Major topics of this year's workshop include
recent work related to the Schoenflies conjecture, the 4-dimensional smooth
Poincare conjecture, and "trisections" of 4-manifolds. &lt;br/&gt;
