Dr. Lorraine W. Deck and other members of the Chemistry Department of the
University of New Mexico are being supported to continue a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-
analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry. A unique feature of
this program is the recruiting of most of the students from other institutions
where research programs are limited, particularly the many small ones in the
southwestern U.S. which lack comprehensive research programs and facilities.
