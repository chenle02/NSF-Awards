This project involves an integrated transect of boreholes on the U.S. mid-
Atlantic region to address the continental margin record of the Oligocene-Recent
global sea-level changes. These changes have been controlled by glacioeustatic
(ice-volume) variations. Transects of passive continental margins from outcrop
to the deep sea are needed to evaluate the timing and amplitude of sea-level
variations. The transect requires drilling both onshore and offshore (ODP Leg
150). The Principal Investigators will drill three continuously cored and logged
boreholes in the New Jersey coastal plain near Island Beach, Atlantic City, and
Cape May, NJ. The project will be a collaborative effort among Rutgers,
LDGO/Columbia, and the Eastern Regional Branch of the USGS. The
multidisciplinary use of magnetostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, Sr-isotope
stratigraphy and oxygen isotope glacioeustatic curves combined with seismic
stratigraphy to tie together onshore and offshore wells will provide a
comprehensive data set. The geologic record of sea level changes gives factual
constraints for developing models of global paleoclimatological change.
