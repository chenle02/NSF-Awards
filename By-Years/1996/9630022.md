The hybrid automaton is a promising model for studying the behavior of hybrid
systems. One drawback of this model is the difficulty in deriving decidable or
semidecidable procedures. The suspension automaton is a subclass of linear
hybrid automata for which decidable language containment procedures exist. The
objective of this project is to investigate the use of suspension automaton to
accurately model and verify real-time systems. Due to the complexity of these
problems, a methodical way to study them is called for, such as would be
provided by a software tool. This project is designed to explore the issues
involved in building an implementation of verification techniques based on the
suspension automaton. Two specific issues must be addressed. First, the relation
of this work to existing work, particularly in the area of real-time systems,
must be established. Second, a specific approach to building such a tool must be
formulated. Both of these goals may be aided by establishing contact with
researchers in the real-time area, particularly those who are have produced
software tools to study real-time systems. ***
