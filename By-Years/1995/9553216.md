ABSTRACT CTS-9553216 Fundamental studies of the rheology of complex fluids such
as suspensions and polymeric liquids will be undertaken. Special focus will be
on measurement of two-phase flow mechanisms, investigation of the non-Newtonian
fluid dynamics associated with the onset of flow stabilities in polymer
processing operations, and their impact on ultimate structure-property
relationships. Theoretical concepts drawn from two-phase flow theory, polymer
science and nonlinear dynamics coupled with experimental techniques such as
digital imaging and electro-optics, will be integrated into the undergraduate
applied sciences curriculum. ***
