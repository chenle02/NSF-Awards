The continuation of research on the information level of information based
complexity is proposed. The application of information.based complexity to
problems in many disciplines and areas is summarized. Six new research
directions are proposed: *Optimal Information for multivariate integration in
the random and average settings *Randomization and the power of integral
information *Applications of random information to eigenvalue problems *Optimal
information for solving nonlinear equations in the average case setting *Noisy
information *Optimal information in mixed settings. In the first three of these
we will explore whether we can break intractability or noncomputability by using
randomness or an average case setting. In the fourth we propose the study of
nonlinear average equations in the average case setting. The fifth is the study
of optimal information and computational complexity when the information is
noisy. Finally, we would like to initiate the study of optimal information in a
mixed setting.
