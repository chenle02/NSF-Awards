Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0138057&lt;br/&gt;S. Lin, Clarkson
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to carry out a combined
experimental and analytical investigation on the suppression or enhancement of
wave motion in film flows. There are five objectives of this research, three are
in the experimental part, and two in the analytical part. The experimental
objectives are (1) to see if suppression of onset of instability as predicted
theoretically by the PI can be achieved, (2) whether enhancement of wave motion
can be realized as predicted, and (3) to demonstrate experimentally that the
Squire's theorem can be violated. Objective (4) is to extend the stability
theory to a multilayer system, and (5) to investigate the weakly nonlinear
effects of the wave motion. Broader impacts of the proposed research was not
discussed explicitly by the PI, but three graduate students will be trained per
year.
