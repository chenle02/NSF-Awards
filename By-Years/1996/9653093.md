This project is supporting the design and construction of interdisciplinary
student projects for the three semester calculus sequence. This builds on
Rockhurst's four years of experience as a major implementation site for Project
CALC, the calculus reform program from Duke University. The focus of the
development efforts is on the creation of well-defined projects which are more
authentically connected (through introductory readings and carefully sequenced
analytical activities) to their scientific disciplines. Additionally, projects
emphasize the collection as well as the analysis of data using technologies such
as computer algebra systems, universal lab interfaces, and the Internet.
Dissemination of the projects and support of instructors using the materials are
being accomplished by (1) a three-day summer faculty workshop entitled
Interdisciplinary Projects for Calculus, (2) a dissemination network which
includes distribution of the projects via FTP and the creation of an
Interdisciplinary Student Projects for Calculus Website, (3) commercial
publications, and (4) presentations and workshops at regional and national
meetings. These activities add quality interdisciplinary student projects to the
collection of materials currently available for revitalized courses in calculus.
The projects are distinguished by their careful attention to placing
applications of calculus in their scientific context and by encouraging students
to become more involved in problem solving through the collection and analysis
of data.
