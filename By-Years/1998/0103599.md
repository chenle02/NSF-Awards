DEB-0103599 Slava Epstein

A grant has been awarded to Dr. Slava Epstein at Northeastern University to
conduct a high-resolution identification and inventory of the free-living
ciliates along Northeast Atlantic coast. The target organisms comprise the
Phylum Ciliophora and are among the most important microorganisms in the ocean.
Genetically, this phylum is likely to be more diverse than the whole animal
kingdom, yet the species diversity of ciliates cannot be presently assessed even
with an order of magnitude accuracy. This is a reflection of the fact that
traditional morphological methods of ciliate (and other protists) identification
and cataloguing are not sufficient to describe their biodiversity. This study
will integrate traditional morphology and comparative genomics into one
synergistic approach. This will enable creation of an innovative catalogue of
marine ciliates in the form of collection of specimens, their DNA, specific gene
sequences, as well as an Internet-based searchable database. This database will
include rich verbal and pictorial morphological information, including still-,
3-D-, and video images, data on genetic diversity, all cross-referenced to the
earlier data. No database of this kind is available today.

The marriage between traditional morphological and modern molecular tools in
studying biological diversity is an important development in the area of
protozoology. In the most immediate sense, it will greatly facilitate
identification and classification of the ciliates that are targeted by research
in systematics, population biology, ecology, physiology, biochemistry, and
evolution. More generally, this comprehensive catalogue of the ciliates will
become an integral part of the process of documenting the overall diversity of
life on our planet.
