Natural disasters often lead to catastrophic conditions making human response
efforts risky and potentially hazardous. Consequently, there is an increased
need to develop robotic systems capable of collaboratively navigating and
collecting information in unstable environments. Current collaborative robotic
systems capable of navigating these environments are limited in their ability to
process and combine their individually collected data. Post processing at an
off-site location is usually necessary and may not be achieved in time enough to
initiate a strategic response. This research will lead to the development of an
onsite robotic system capable of processing information from other robotic
systems in real-time. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr.
Makoto Kumon who has expertise in micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) and is developing
a collaborative MAV acoustic localization system at Kumamoto University. Dr.
Kumon's system provides an application and a platform for developing a robotic
system capable of real-time complex data processing. This research will provide
an important contribution toward the response of autonomous robotic systems in
dynamic and complex environments.

The system will be an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) which is capable of
traversing through indoor environments as well as outdoor environments. The UGV
will act as a compact mobile base station capable of receiving and processing
data from a team of MAVs. The MAVs will collect acoustic data of a sound source
at an unknown location. The goal of the research is for the UGV to be capable of
processing the acoustic data to obtain a belief of the source location in real-
time. The objective is for the UGV to recursively update the belief of the sound
source location as it searches for it and continually receives data from the
MAVs. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for
the Promotion of Science.
