ABSTRACT CTS-9312892 CAPPELLI This proposal represents one half of a
collaborative research program between Mark Cappelli at Stanford and Iain Boyd
at Cornell. The PIs plan to study flowing, low density, chemically reacting
plasmas generated by an arc expansion into vacuum for use in material synthesis.
The effort will include a combined experimental and numerical investigation. The
experimental investigation, which is the subject of this proposal, which will
take place at Stanford, will include optical techniques such as laser induced
fluorescence to measure number densities, temperatures and plasma velocities.
The goal is to develop a mechanistic understanding of boron nitride and silicon
carbide syntheses under plasma conditions. The approach to be taken in the
experimental study is the injection of carbon, silicon and boron containing
reactants into a low-density, supersonic, reactive plasma flow, and the
interaction of this flow with a temperature controlled surface to deposit hard
ceramic thin films. Laser induced fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy will
be used to study the gasdynamic flow and mixing behavior in the plasma. Species
fluxes will be monitored by molecular beam mass spectroscopy. Deposited films
will be characterized using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron
microscopy and infrared and Raman spectroscopy. The primary objective of the
experimental study is to identify plasma flow conditions that favor the
synthesis of c:BN or b-SiC over their hexagonal allotropes. Another objective is
to provide experimental measurements of: plasma flow properties (e.g..
temperature, velocity), atomic hydrogen concentrations, methyl radical
concentrations, and reactive species fluxes.
