The purpose of this project is to establish a real life fully automated robotic
cell around the currently available CNC machines and the other equipment
purchased under the previous ILI grant. The completed cell will consist of three
robots (largest one to be purchased), two CNC machines (mill and lathe, both
available), a conveyor, a storage facility, and a programmable logic controller.
Available simulation package will be incorporated into the cell as a production
control prediction device and also to animate the machining activity. A total of
four personal computers (two to be purchased) will be used in operation of
various items and input/output communications among the items and the logic
controller.
