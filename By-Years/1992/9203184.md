In this project, the Principal Investigators will collaborate with Russian and
Canadian scientists in a repeated survey of the upper 1500 meters of the
subtropical and subpolar North Pacific. The total program includes four surveys
of the Oyashio/Kamchatka Current region, one geochemistry cruise in the western
North Pacific, and spring and fall trans-Pacific cruises each year for four
years that cover all the major circulation features north of the Subtropical
Front. US participation in the two trans-Pacific cruises, will allow the PI's to
gain access to the entire data set, allowing them to study a number of major
questions related to North Pacific circulation.
