This EAGER project will develop a deeper physical understanding of how
predictability is fundamentally limited and why it may vary from forecast to
forecast. New insights into the connection between the nature of turbulence and
predictability will be an important component of this project. Unlike most
earlier work on atmospheric predictability that has predominantly relied on
linearization and instability techniques, this research will adopt a fully non-
linear and probabilistic approach. Consequently insights into the nature of
atmospheric predictability when non-linearity is important is be a particular
focus of this research.

A newly developed theoretical methodology from statistical physics will be
applied to the problem of atmospheric predictability in the mid latitudes. This
will enable exploration of the nature of statistical predictability limits and
variability. Connections between these aspects of statistical predictability and
features of the atmosphere such as the mean vertical shear; boundary layer
damping and geostrophic turbulence will be thoroughly analyzed. Additionally a
new non-diffusive method of parameterizing the fine unresolved scales of motion
will be developed.
