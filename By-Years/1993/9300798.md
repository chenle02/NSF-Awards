diversity, systematics and geographic distribution of the Agaricales (mushrooms
and related fungi) of Costa Rican oak forests. These fungi play a vital role in
nutrient cycling, nutrient uptake and decomposition of organic matter in the oak
forests of montane Mexico, Central America and Colombia. Costa Rica is an ideal
site to obtain some of the essential data on composition, species distribution
and host specificity of these fungi in the neotropics; the data can then be
applied to other Central and South American oak forests. The project will
produce an illustrated manual of these fungi and, importantly, a comprehensive
computerized database of morphological, ecological, and distributional data. In
country collaboration includes scientists at INBio, the University of Costa
Rica, the Organization of Tropical Studies at La Selva and a Costa Rican
graduate student. Mycological collections will be deposited in Costa Rica for
research and training of students. No similar comprehensive study of fungi has
been undertaken in tropical America. %%% The Agaricales mushrooms and related
