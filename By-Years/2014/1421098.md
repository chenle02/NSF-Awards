Representation in judicial proceedings is assumed to assist litigants, and shape
the outcomes of cases. It may or may not; that assumption ignores the
significance of the content of the law, of jurisdiction, and of what clients can
do to build their claims. It assumes the effectiveness of the professional
deployment of legal knowledge. We know very little about how those before the
courts understand the assistance they get, or what difference it makes in
outcomes. Since we do not understand when and where representation makes a
difference in outcomes, we do not know a mechanism by which representation would
shape legal proceedings and their outcomes. Observational studies that take the
courts as sites for analysis cannot reveal outcomes over time nor can they
assist in understanding what assistance or court proceedings mean to people, or
how it matters in outcomes over time. This project will follow people brought
before the courts in civil proceedings in two jurisdictions, each of which has
different practices concerning provision of assistance. It thereby will link
with broader analyses of how institutions ameliorate or contribute to
inequalities experienced via public policy.

Comparing those brought before the courts over time across different
jurisdictions is an innovation in researching people's engagement with the legal
system and outcomes. This project will build theory concerning the legal system
in family problems, a significant encounter with the law for many people within
the United States. it will contribute to understanding the mechanisms by which
representation does or does not make a difference to claimants.
