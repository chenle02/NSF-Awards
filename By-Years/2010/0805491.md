The fast development in statistical methodology is mostly driven by the
necessity to describe, model and analyze complex large-scale data sets generated
from various scientific and engineering disciplines. In order to make full use
of available and incoming large amount of data in gene regulation, this proposal
aims (1) to develop predictive modeling approaches to combine sequence analyses,
gene expression data, and protein binding data; and (2) to develop a full
Bayesian model for de novo identification of cis-regulatory modules
(combinatorial patterns of multiple sequence motifs that mediate the
interactions between regulatory proteins and DNA sequences) in multiple related
species. For the first project, the use of many contemporary statistical
learning methods is investigated, such as boosting, random forests, MARS and
BART, for detecting influential sequence signals and predicting protein-DNA
interactions. Multi-level models are proposed to incorporate the uncertainty in
covariates into a statistical learning framework and efficient computational
algorithms are developed for the inference. The statistical aspects of the
second project involve modeling multiple interacting stochastic processes by
coupling chains of random variables. Efficient algorithms that utilize two-
dimensional dynamic programming and advanced Monte Carlo techniques such as
tempering and equi-energy jumps are developed for the challenging Bayesian
inference on the proposed model.

The proposed research is expected to have direct and immediate impact on various
fields in molecular biology, genetics, and medical sciences, in which gene
regulation analyses play critical roles. In addition to methodological
development, algorithms and software will be delivered for biologists to use on
their own experimental data. Many statistical components in these projects, such
as the coupling of hidden Markov models and the design of advanced Monte Carlo
sampling with dynamic programming, are expected to contribute significantly to
statistics and other computational sciences as well.
