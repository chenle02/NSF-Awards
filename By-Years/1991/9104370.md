This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant biology for two
years. The project entitled "Characterization of potyviral RNA replication" is
to be carried out in the laboratories of John Shaw at University of Kentucky.
The Ph.D. training of this Fellow was in the area of light regulation of gene
expression in barley. The focus of the postdoctoral project is the effects of
viral (tobacco vein mottling virus) gene expression on chloroplast activities.
The postdoctoral fellowships in plant biology are designed to increase the
number of outstanding young investigators in plant biology.
