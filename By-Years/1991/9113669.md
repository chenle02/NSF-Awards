FUSE (Fordham University Science Experience) ia a program aimed at increasing
access to and retention of underrepresented minority students in science. In its
first year the program will recruit 12 promising students: six entering
freshmen, four entering sophomores, two entering juniors and zero entering
seniors. The key elements of the program include the following: early
socialization of students in a mentored research experience with teacher-
scholars who are experienced in mentoring undergraduate, especially minority,
students in research; networking and academic enrichment experiences including
informal discussions with minority scientists; academic support services
including advising. Each aspect of the program will emphasize the importance of
networking, but the core of the proposed program is early intervention with a
focus on the research experience. Each student will have the opportunity to
select a faculty mentor from the areas of cell and molecular biology, cell
physiology, cellular biochemistry or photochemistry. FUSE students will work
closely with faculty mentors on individual research projects and are encouraged
to prepare presentations of their research at local and national scientific
meetings.
