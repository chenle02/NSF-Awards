Hao 9625183 This is an award to provide support for research aimed at developing
an approach to modeling nutrient removal from wastewater by use of suspended
growth bioreactors based on coupling the use of artificial neural networks with
knowledge of the underlying biological processes that take place within the
reactors. The investigators plan on using a hybrid modeling approach that
combines a simplified process model and a neural network, the purpose of which
is to correct any errors encountered by use of the simplified model. Two hybrid
modeling methods involving a series structure and parallel structure will be
used to integrate a suspended growth reactor model and a neural network. The
approach will be explored for potential use in both sequential batch reactors
and in a system for alternating aerobic and anoxic conditions. Results of this
research are expected to enhance the procedures by which complicated biological
processes can be designed, controlled and optimized. The proposed concepts to be
investigated in this project are expected to enhance process control in general
and lead to engineering designs that save energy in meeting stringent
requirements for removal of nutrients from wastewater prior to their discharge
to the environment.
