9452362 Waechter-Brulla A new interdisciplinary course entitled "Science and
Technology in Society" integrates topics from all scientific disciplines. In the
lecture, we examine basic science concepts and processes, technological advances
and their impact on society. In the discussion, we demonstrate how information
is collected, assimilated and understood via direct participation. Students will
use computers for data analysis and presentation; additional computer-aided
instructional materials will be used in both discussion and lecture. This course
will be required of all undergraduate students, and it will enroll 800 to 1000
students per semester beginning in fall 1994. Undergraduate pre-service science
teachers will serve as course assistants and be present with the faculty during
the discussion sections. These undergraduate assistants will also be available
to assist the students with interactive media homework assignments. The course
will serve as a model for the UW-Whitewater campus and other comprehensive
universities through its unique interdisciplinary nature and its exploitation of
certain pedagogical elements: direct student involvement, computer-aided
instruction, computer-based data analysis, multimedia enhanced lecture delivery.
