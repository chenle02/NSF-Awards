The PI's work is motivated by problems in the theory of automorphic forms and
L-functions on higher rank groups. The main topics of research are on
restriction theorems, zero free region for Rankin-Selberg L-functions and
equidistributions of horospheres on higher rank groups.

The projects that the PI pursues not only have fundamental theoretical values,
but also have important applications. The research will provide new bridges
among analytic number theory, representation theory and ergodic theory. This
introduces interesting subjects for experts in different fields. One would hope
the interaction of these three different fields would produce fruitful results
in the future.
