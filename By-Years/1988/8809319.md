RESEARCH INITIATION AWARD: PROTEIN ELICITATION OF SECONDARY METABOLITES IN
CULTURED PLANT CELLS ABSTRACT This proposal attempts to: - determine the
mechanism of elicitor activity by placing a recognized elicitor protein inside a
cell and monitoring the cell's response, thereby bypassing the hypothesized
polysaccharide receptor sites on the outer wall, and - evaluate the observation
that tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC) levels correlate with synthesis of a secondary
metabolite, berberine. The resulting data are to be used to develop kinetic
models for growth rate, product synthesis and secretion rates which reflect the
dependence on elicitor concentration. Until more detail is known regarding the
metabolic control involved in secondary metabolite production, effective use of
plant cell culture will be extremely difficult to achieve.
