The research will address the need for effective methods for the study of the
asymptotic behavior and fundamental limits that occur in networking. The work
will be restricted to stability problems in a multidimensional environment. The
definition of stability as used here is broad enough to cover many aspects of
networking behavior such as boundness in probability (i.e. substability),
limiting distributions, geometric ergodicity, strong stability, rate of
convergence to table modes, finite moments and tails of the queue lengths and
waiting time distributions, partial stability, robustness, cut-off phenomena,
shape of distributions, bistability, structural properties (e.g. monotonicity of
some parameters of interest), asymptotic performance, no-starvation regime for
real time systems, practical stability, and sudden changes in network behavior.
A stochastic approach is assumed through the project. The research will use new
approaches to the stability analysis of networking that are based on a non-
Markovian philosophy. The research will demonstrate that such an approach can
rigorously provide stability criteria for such open problems as stability of
multiaccess systems, token passing rings, FDDI, ATM networks, general network of
queues, and so forth.
