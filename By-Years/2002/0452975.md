REU SITE: An REU Site at Indiana University in Stellar Astrophysics and
Beyond&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST 0452975
Deliyannis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI, Constantine Deliyannis and collaborators
will continue the operation of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
site at Indiana University. The program brings incoming juniors seniors to
Bloomington, IN for 10 weeks during the summer to undertake research with
faculty and graduate student mentors. Students also participate in a weeklong
observing run on the Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale-NOAO (WIYN) 0.9-meter telescope at
Kitt Peak, AZ. Research projects include studies of the properties of star
clusters, searches for, and studies of, variable stars, and determination of the
chemical composition of stars and star clusters. All students present their
results at meetings of the American Astronomical Society. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this program includes the opportunity for
promising young scientists to experience research in astronomy, and the
resulting encouragement to pursue careers in science. The program aims to
recruit underserved minorities and women, and provide them with research
experience that can help as they move on to graduate school.
