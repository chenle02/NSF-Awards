The Department of Chemistry is committed to improving the biochemical exercises
in its curriculum. New faculty and courses have been added that require new
equipment be obtained to upgrade the laboratories. The upgrades will directly
impact an introductory class for non-science majors, a required course for
prospective chemistry teachers, two biochemistry courses, undergraduate
research, and a summer research program for minorities. Acquisition of the
shaker, incubator and microcentrifuges will help enhance the educational
experience of the above named courses by adding investigations.
