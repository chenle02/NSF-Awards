This SBIR Phase I project will develop efficient, scalable and low-cost photo-
bioreactors with light guiding optical sheets and low-power spatial light
modulators to increase culture density and light penetration, and decrease
doubling time for the production of microalgae. This proposed research will
enhance the algal growth in a photo-bioreactor by using a low-power spatial
light modulator to effectively reduce the photon saturation effects and light
guiding optical sheets to guide photons to the interior of a photo-bioreactor.

The broader/commercial impact of the project will be the improved efficiency of
a photo-bioreactor for the production of microalgae by reducing the photon
saturation effects and guiding photons to the interior of a photo-bioreactor.
The technology to be developed by this project should be attractive to provide
efficient and low-cost photo-bioreactors to the algal industry.
