The morphologic features of many protozoans can vary significantly with
environmental conditions, and therefore are unreliable indicators of ancestor-
descendant relationships. A molecular approach to the parasitic trypanosomes
will be pursued, using slowly evolving ribosomal RNA to reveal distant
relationships, a particular DNA sequence with intermediate evolutionary rates
for less distant relationships, and rapidly evolving nuclear DNA restriction
patterns for more recent divergences. Protist phylogeny would be compared with
phylogeny of vertebrate hosts to test the degree to which host evolution
controls evolution among parasitises. The proposed research will illuminate the
evolutionary history of a pivotal group of protists, and will set the stage for
a better understanding of host-parasite coevolution. A better understanding of
the trypanosome's ancestry can lead to important medical advances.
