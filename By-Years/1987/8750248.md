A computer controlled capillary gas chromatograph is being used by the Chemistry
Department at Mississippi College for undergraduate instruction in organic,
analytical, instrumental, and physical chemistry. Use of this instrumentation is
correlated with that of other computer interfaced analytical instrumentation
available in the department. There is a central focus on instruction in the
theoretical and practical aspects of modern separation science.
