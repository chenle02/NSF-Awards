The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the
National Science Foundation supports the research of Professors Benjamin Bostick
from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, and Bill Casey
of the University of California-Davis, who will perform collaborative research
that will investigate the solution speciation and adsorption properties of
tungsten in aqueous solutions. The thermodynamic and kinetic stability of
polyoxometalate clusters, and their reactivity towards mineral substrates will
be examined using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and complementary solution
and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This research
will address fundamental, long-standing questions about the reactivity and
properties of complex ions in the environment, and the role that such complexes
play in enhancing their solubility and transport.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To
accurately assess the environmental fate of a contaminant (or anything else), it
is critical to understand the chemical processes that control their
concentrations in water. This research examines the solubility and reactivity of
tungsten, and emerging contaminant of concern that has seldom been studied in
complex environmental systems. More broadly, the principles of chemical
speciation in solution and its role in regulating adsorption and mineral
precipitation behavior are widely applicable to understanding the properties and
behavior of many chemical species, including a variety of nutrients and
contaminants. This research will train students in the fundamental chemical
principles that affect the environment, and provide the perspective needed to
use those principles to be better stewards of it.
