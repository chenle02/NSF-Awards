This award supports infrastructure for research in high performance
parallel/distributed computing. The award supports the purchase of a high
performance distributed memory computer. The award also supports a programmer to
develop, maintain, and distribute software developed on this computer. The
research supported by this infrastructure is of two forms: compute intensive
research and systems applications research. The compute intensive research
includes computer vision, computer graphics, simulations, 3-D animation, and
computational chemistry. The systems applications research includes developing
fast operating system kernal service routines, programming models of parallel
computation activities, software engineering environments, and fundamental
research on parallel algorithms for distributed memory computers.
