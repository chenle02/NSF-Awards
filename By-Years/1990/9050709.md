The purpose of this project is to enhance the current status of design courses
in biomedical and mechanical engineering by providing new equipment and
techniques in prototype design. The new equipment and concepts to be introduced
include: computer aided machining (CAM), computer controlled data acquisition,
and prototype development by device testing. This system will enhance the
current design course curriculum by providing the means of implementing design
changes. By using this system students may produce a prototype design, test the
design, and make design changes by simply updating a computer file. The
successful execution of this project will result in abstract articles concerning
the development of new techniques and laboratory manuals to be made available to
other institutions. Students will benefit by knowledge gained in using the new
systems recently made commercially available, as well as through the additional
amount of practical design experience afforded by streamlining and automating
the design process. Most importantly, students will learn to improve and
reinforce their designs, a process that is not currently practical without the
automated equipment.
