This research program will focus on the demonstration of coherent sources of
radiation in the Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV), a region where few tunable sources
presently exist. Based on anti-Stokes Raman scattering in selected small
molecules that are known to be efficient energy storage media, these coherent
sources would exploit the detailed spectroscopic information that has been
obtained over the last few years by laser spectroscopy. Initial experiments will
concentrate on the XeF molecule which theory has identified as a promising
candidate. Laser spectroscopy of the D B transition of the excimer will be
carried out in a supersonic expansion followed by oscillator experiments in
longer gain length discharges. Subsequent studies will explore the rare gas and
Column B dimers as potential hosts for tunable lasers in the spectral region
below 150nm.
