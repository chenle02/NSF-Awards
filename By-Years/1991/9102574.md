This project involves research on nonconvex variational problems, singular
perturbation, and nonlinear partial differential equations. The connections
between nonconvex problems and the "relaxed problems" obtained by introducing a
convex perturbation will be analyzed, as well as the connections between
variational problems and the gradient flows they generate. Particular cases to
be emphasized are variational problems depending on a gradient, locally area-
minimizing partitions, flows driven by mean curvature, and optimal design via
least gradient. The results of this project will lead to better understanding of
physical problems related to material instabilities, which in turn will help in
the development of new materials. ***
