This is a seismic study of the southern flank of Kilauea volcano, Hawaii, that
will constrain the kinematics and mechanics of landsliding along the slopes of
young submarine volcanoes. Multichannel seismic data will be collected using the
R/V Ewing's 20-air gun array and 3-km streamer. Lines will be run along, and
across, the south flank of Kilauea and the southeast edge of the Puna rift. It
is expected that the offshore seismic shots will also be recorded by land
seismometers maintained by the USGS Hawaii Volcano Observatory.
