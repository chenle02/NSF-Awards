Non-technical Description&lt;br/&gt;This project will support a planning process
to establish a Virtual Sponsored Research Office (VSRO). The concept of the VSRO
is for it to be a shared resource to assist faculty and administrators at
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in preparing and submitting
proposals to the NSF and other federal agencies and provide training in the
appropriate policies and procedures for managing federal awards. HBCUs have
struggled to improve their competitive research standing, in part due to the
challenges faced by their administrators who are facing increased demands from
both federal agencies and faculty investigators while lacking the critical
infrastructure needed to keep up with the rising demands. The vision of the VSRO
is to develop an innovative online platform to provide support services to HBCU
institutional ?clients?. This service would address the needs of small and mid-
size HBCUs that do not currently have adequate sponsored research
capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description &lt;br/&gt;The planning
activity wwill solicit input from the community of HBCU researchers and
administrators via a series of virtual meetings and in-person workshops. From
these activities the project team will complete a comprehensive needs assessment
for the participating institutions and then determine what combination of
products and services would best meet these community needs. All aspects of
proposal development and post-award management will be considered throughout the
planning process, including but not limited to issues related to intellectual
property and human subjects research. It is expected that this planning process
will ultimately lead to the development of a proposal to implement the VSRO
concept.
