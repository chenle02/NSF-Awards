This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the
separation of light hydrocarbon mixtures-specifically, propylene/propane
mixtures-by membrane pervaporation. A preliminary analysis indicated that the
recovery of propylene from reactor purge gas streams using separation systems
based on these materials is economically attractive. These purge streams are
numerous-more than 400 streams of this type exist worldwide - but too small to
be treated by distillation. Nonetheless, the amount of propylene involved is
substantial. An estimated 685 million pounds of propylene are recoverable from
reactor purge streams in the United States alone. In the Phase II project, the
current best membrane will be optimized, scaled up and formed into bench-scale
membrane modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the separation of
propylene/propane mixtures; application to the separation of many other mixtures
is possible. The proposed membrane pervaporation process addresses a market need
- the economical recovery of propylene, a valuable chemical feedstock, from
propane-containing waste gas streams that cannot be satisfied by alternative
technologies.
