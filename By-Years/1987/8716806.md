The group singing of the African pygmies is a highly intricate form of social
interaction. The Biaka pygmies of Central African Republic, Cameroon and the
Congo have developed this form of expression into a mode that reflects the
egalitarian structure of the society. The goals of this project are to determine
what an individual must know in order to participate in Biaka social interaction
as expressed in music and to describe the processes of musical creation within a
closed, egalitarian community. The student will attempt to convey Biaka
understandings of their musical performance and of their culture.
Anthropological analyses are increasingly concerned with performance as the
structuring of experience, but rarely do they describe the details of the
structures as they emerge within actual performances as this study will do.
Specifically, essemble music as performance concentrates cultural knowledge in
patterns of interaction, cueing, and non-verbal communicative modes. This study
in ethnomosicology will provide creative input into traditional questions of
social structure, gender roles, social process, symbolism, and culture change.
