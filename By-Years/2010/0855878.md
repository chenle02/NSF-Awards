Full Center Proposal (Phase I) for an I/UCRC for Electromagnetic Compatibility

0855878 Missouri University of Science and Technology; Richard DuBroff 0856085
University of Houston; Ji Chen The proposal concerns the formation of a new
I/UCRC "Electromagnetic Compatibility" consisting of the Missouri University of
Science and Technology (MST) and the University of Houston (UH). MST is the lead
institution of the proposed Center, and proposes to add two additional sites
(University of Oklahoma and Clemson University) in the next review cycle.
Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) is an essential feature of virtually all
high speed digital electronic assistants and home entertainment centers to
essential control and information processing systems. EMC is the ability of
these electronic systems to function reliably without causing interference to
other electronic systems, being overly sensitive to weak signals generated by
other electronic systems, and generating signals in one part of the system
interfering with the operation of another part of the same system. The Center
and its research activities will involve faculty, students and industrial
representatives; and the industrial-focused research program will enhance the
scientific understanding and help address a potentially significant health and
environmental problem.

The proposed Center will encourage collaboration amongst the four institutions,
and is committed to providing a skilled and diverse workforce in the area of EMC
as required by industry. The research will expose students and faculty to state-
of-the-art research projects of value to the industry. The close collaboration
with various industry partners will help establish a strong research base to
enable development of consumer electronics and control and information systems.
The proposing institutions have a track record of increasing the participation
of under-represented groups in research and education. In addition, the proposal
emphasizes increased recruitment of students from under-represented groups.
