This project will examine factors that influence teacher career choices
including whether to enter teaching, where to teach and how long to stay as well
as teachers' contribution to student learning in mathematics. It seeks to
provide answers to two major questions: 1) How can elementary and secondary
schools attract and retain highly effective mathematics and science teachers?
and 2) How can traditional and alternative teacher preparation programs best
prepare people to teach math and science?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
design will extend and connect existing research on teacher preparation and
teacher labor markets. The career choices of aspiring and practicing math and
science teachers will be analyzed using models drawn from the labor market
literature including multinomial logit models of teacher choices and two-sided
matching models that incorporate both school preferences and teacher
preferences, supplemented with statistical and descriptive analyses of interview
data. Teachers' contributions to student math learning will be analyzed using
value-added econometric models that incorporate attributes of teacher
preparation pathways as independent variables, with appropriate attention to
issues of selection bias and data issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
focus on NYC and use existing data plus new data. The existing databases
include: 1) data describing career paths, qualifications and characteristics of
aspiring and practicing math and science teachers from State and NYC Education
departments; 2) data on school environments; 3) surveys of participants in major
math and science teacher preparation programs; 4) surveys of newly entering
school teachers; 5) detailed data describing teacher preparation programs; 6)
student level data from grade 3 -5 citywide standardized math
scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Research on
Learning and Education Program and the Division of Undergraduate Education's
Teacher Professional Development Program&lt;br/&gt;
