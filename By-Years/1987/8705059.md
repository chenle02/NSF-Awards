An ultrahigh-vacuum system equipped with an electrochemical cell is being
constructed for studies of electrode/electrolyte interfacial phenomena. The
system will have facilities for low energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger
electron spectroscopy (AES), thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS), and cyclic
voltammetry. It will also be able to operate in tandem with an existing X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) facility. Application of powerful surface
science techniques to electrode surfaces has great potential for improving
understanding and performance of systems employing electrodes including
electrosynthesis, batteries, fuel cells, and sensors. It is also relevant to
electrically conducting junctions in microelectronic circuits.
