9402971 Bowen This project will quantify genetic variation and evolutionary
relationships within the Clupeoid genera Sardinops and Engraulis. These two
taxa, commonly known as sardines and anchovies, are pelagic filter feeders
typically found in warm-temperate coastal waters and have great commercial
importance. The taxonomic and systematic distinctions between regional forms of
these two genera remains unresolved despite the intense interest in means by
which these fish have been dispersed throughout the ocean. This study will use
mtDNA geneologies to elucidate the pattern of colonization among regional forms.
A second goal of this study will be to estimate mtDNA clonal diversity within
regional forms of Sardinops and Engraulis. Finally, mtDNA data will be used to
assess the level of gene flow among putative sardine stocks along the west coast
of North America. These results have strong implications for fishery assessment,
as reproductive populations are the fundamental units of species management.
