9403478 Leaman University of Miami will continue development of a new generation
of fast acoustic current profilers using a set of surface-mounted Global
Positioning System (GPS) transponders for navigation. GPS receivers are to be
mounted on a ocean profiler, PEGASUS, that makes a series of excursions from the
surface to a predetermined depth at back to the surface. Its lateral
displacement is a function of undersea currents. Using differential GPS
techniques to track the movement of PEGASUS provides greater accuracy and
reliability than traditional tracking methods. This new effort will carry the
prototype design from a crude testing phase to an operational status.
