The Department of Statistics at the Pennsylvania State University will purchase
a network of workstations that will be dedicated to research in the mathematical
sciences. The equipment will be used in several research projects, including in
particular: 1. Latent classes, empirical Bayes, and random effects models in
categorical data. 2. Development and applications of statistical theory to
problems in ecology. 3. Inference and curve-fitting in generalization of
isotonic regression.
