9553902 diSessa This project will investigate the strengths and limitations of
students' meta-representational competence-that is, thier knowledge about
representing scientific concepts and phenomena in a pictorial form. Foci will
include student capability to: (a) design new representations;(b) to critique,
compare and refine them;(c) to select appropriate ones and learn to use them
efficiently; and (d) to understand what represents are for and how they work.
The project will investigate the relation of meta-representational competence to
conceptual development and will also design and research classroom instructional
activities that effectively utilize and develop meta-representational
competence. Results will help teachers better understand students' strengths and
weakness in learning representations in mathematics and science, and will open
up an attractive new genre of authentic scientific learning activities that can
involve students have a wide range of intellectual styles and abilities. ***
