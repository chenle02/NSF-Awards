This award covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics Research on the
constituent structure of matter by a group at Johns Hopkins University in
collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported scientists. The group will
continue studying electron-positron annihilations as a member of the L3
collaboration, and neutrino oscillations in the NOMAD experiment, both at CERN,
Switzerland. They will also continue research and development of wedge silicon
detectors at Johns Hopkins University.
