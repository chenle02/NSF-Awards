The quality of scientific training offered to students is being improved with
the purchase of a high pressure liquid chromatography instrument for use in five
laboratory courses. This is allowing the department to include as a part of the
students' scientific training the principles and practice of HPLC - the most
versatile method for separating and quantitating the variety of complex mixtures
which chemists encounter. Introduction of the HPLC into the Chemistry
Department's laboratory curriculum is enabling students to work with a wider
range of mixtures - especially those containing non-volatile solids or thermally
sensitive compounds - than was previously possible with the departmental
instrumentation. For instance, the students are doing experiments involving the
separation and quantitation of proteins in a mixture or determining the lipid
composition of a cellular membrane. Including these new experiments in the
laboratory program of the department is significant because it is enhancing the
ability of the science students to investigate chemical systems and solve
chemical problems. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
