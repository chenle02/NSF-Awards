Superconductivity and metallic behavior in thin films of doped C60 will be
probed by studying their thermodynamic, magnetic, transport and superconductive
tunneling properties, measured in situ over a wide range of temperature
encompassing both the superconducting and orientational structural transitions.
Fundamental questions concerning the nature of the superconducting coupling,
inter- and intra-ball interactions, electron density of states at the Fermi
surface, characteristic phonon frequencies, electron-phonon interaction, and the
formation of the interball conduction will be addressed through a series of
measurements including specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, and
Hall effect. Superconductive tunneling spectroscopy will be used to characterize
the strength and frequency dependance of the superconducting interaction. Thin
film deposition techniques will permit the exploration of metastable phases.
