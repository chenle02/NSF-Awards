0448950&lt;br/&gt;Yeh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
CAREER-development plan aims to integrate multidimensional studies at nano-,
micro-, and macroscales for a systems based approach to complex biomedical
problems &lt;br/&gt;linking molecular cell biology and chemistry to
physiological (dys)function. Integration of multidimensional studies in tissue
optics, mechanobiology and optical clearing will be achieved by interfacing
nonlinear optical microscopy (NLOM) with electron microscopy, genomic profiling,
biomechanical stress-strain and clinical, in vivo measurements. NLOM is a non-
destructive, laser scanning microscopy technique, which can image (sub-)
cellular processes in a thick, living tissue specimen over the course of a
biological event without fixing, staining or sectioning. Specific imaging of
tissue constituents by NLOM will be accomplished via nonlinear optical
spectroscopy (e.g., second-harmonic generation and two-photon excited
fluorescence). NLOM will be used to monitor tissue structure, organization,
composition with (sub-) cellular resolution and changes due to altered
mechanical and chemical environments and growth and remodeling. &lt;br/&gt;
