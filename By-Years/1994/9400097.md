9400097 Grunbaum This project, which is jointly funded by the Applied
Mathematics Program, the Computational Biology Program, and the Computational
Mathematics Program, will consider a number of inverse problems motivated by
problems in biomedical imaging, including existing modalities such as X-ray and
magnetic resonance, as well as emerging ones such as diffuse tomography and the
use of higher order invariants in the direct method of X-ray crystallography.
Some specific areas of investigation include work on aspects of the limited
angle reconstruction problem in X-ray tomography, the design of optimnized
pulses for slice selection in magnetic resonance imaging, the development of
nonlinear inversion algorithms in diffuse tomography, and the development of new
ways of using higher order invariants within the direct method of X-ray
crystallography to solve the phase problem. This project, which is jointly
funded by the Applied Mathematics Program, the Computational Biology Program,
and the Computational Mathematics Program, centers around inverse problems
arising in biomedical imaging, including X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging.
In particular, it will explore ways in which developments in mathematical
physics can yield insights in diffuse tomography, that is, medical imaging using
very low energy probes such as infra-red lasers. While this research is likely
to be of considerable practical value in certain specific areas of medical
diagnostics such as mammographies and neonatal diagnostics, the principal ideas
and concepts have applicability beyond medical imaging, from areas such as
crystallography to radar target estimation and semi-conductors.
