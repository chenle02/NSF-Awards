Funding is provided to investigate changes in the intensity and degree of
regional influence, in response to theorized teleconnections, in the climatic
zones of subtropical Florida and tropical Belize from 5,000-7,000 years before
present. Specifically, the researchers will use stable isotopic records of
oxygen and carbon collected from speleothems in the region to assess changes in
climate discerned from changes in precipitation, air temperature, and
vegetation. The research will support graduate education, international
collaboration, and bring to the broader community additional data on climate
from the tropics.&lt;br/&gt;
