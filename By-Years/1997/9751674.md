As systems improvements move toward the exclusive use of microelectronics for
sensors and distributed processing, it is imperative that high-performance
technicians who install and maintain Direct Digital Control systems and the
engineers who design these systems achieve higher competency levels in the
application of this technology. The university improves the teaching of direct
digital controls and related process instrumentation, data communications,
electrical/electronic control applications, and air conditioning and
refrigeration courses with the transformation of the campus Student Union into a
live laboratory. Using real-time microelectronic systems controls, students
monitor and control mechanical systems operations that maximize environmental
comfort and energy efficiency in full compliance with ASHRAE Standards. In a
live laboratory, students interface and monitor microelectronic control systems
in full compliance with building engineer design specifications; calibrate,
tune, and maintain heating ventilation and air conditioning direct digital
control systems to ensure operation at building engineer design specifications;
operate microelectronic control systems and mechanical devices from remote
locations; and link ethernet local area networks into a fiber-optic and copper
communications infrastructure. The development of the direct digital controls
live laboratory can result in curriculum improvements, higher levels of student
learning, and better prepared high-performance technicians for the emerging
workforce. This project serves many nontraditional students: the campus' average
student age is 26.6 years, and the racial distribution is more diverse than the
state population. Student pre- and post-tests can document the project's success
in producing more broadly trained and competent technicians. Project reports can
be offered to electrical/electronic and HVAC technical societies and
publications, to educational associations, and on the Internet home page. *
