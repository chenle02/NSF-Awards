The volitional movement of ones limbs is commanded by electrical activity in
the neurons of the motor cortex, the output part of the brain. In quadriplegia,
the spinal cord is damaged, but the motor cortex is perfectly functional. This
array of electrodes, implanted into motor cortex could be used to record the
electrical activity of these neurons. The electrode array could then provide
large numbers of signals which could control functional neuromuscular systems or
external mechanical devices (wheelchairs, artificial limbs, etc.). A three
dimensional electrode array could be used in this application. The array is
constructed from monocrystaline silicon and contains 100 needle shaped
electrodes which protrude from a 4mm x 4mm substrate. Each sharpened electrode
is 1.5mm in length and is about 80 microns in diameter at its base. A
modification of this silicon electrode array is used to conduct a set of
experiments in cats 1) to demonstrate that such an array of electrodes is
capable of recording cortical neural activity and 2) to optimize the electrical
properties of the electrodes such that they can provide the greatest isolation
of single unit or unit cluster neural activity.
