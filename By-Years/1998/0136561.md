OpenGeneX will provide a toolkit of capabilities for gene expression data
management and analysis in an extensible system. The work will focus on core
capabilities, such as addition of links to the database schema and an object-
layer application programming interface and a data upload tool for automated
loading into the database. In order to support uniform, efficient data analysis,
a framework for incorporating new methods and defining protocols will be
developed. The analysis protocol manager will be designed to permit storing and
tracking of analysis procedures and validated and tested in a community-wide
effort. A variety of analysis tools, including data preprocessing and
normalization as well as statistical validation clustering methods will be
developed. A prototype of peer-to-peer database connectivity will be created to
test for supporting diverse gene expression resources in a cost-effective
manner. The project is open source, so that other freely available software can
be incorporated, rather than redesigned.
