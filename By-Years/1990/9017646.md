This project is intended to document 1) the degree of temporal variability for
3He/4He ratios in historic and dated lava flows, over timescales ranging from 1
year to &gt;100,000 years, 2) the relationship between He and the radiogenic
isotopes of Pb, Sr and Nd, and 3) the variations in 3He/4He and rare gas
abundances for hotsprings, fumaroles and igneous rocks. Mount Etna is among the
best documented volcanoes in the world and provides an excellent natural
laboratory for helium isotope and rare gas studies. The results should provide
insight into the dynamics of upper mantle- lithosphere-crust interactions
beneath Mount Etna, and constraints on the chemical evolution of the magmatic
reservoir(s) and their degassing history.
