This research project deals with a development of highly accurate approximate
solution techniques for wave-type phenomena characterized by linear hyperbolic
equations. Potential applications include, but are not limited to numerical
simulation of propagation of acoustic, elastic, and electromagnetic waves, as
well as to analysis of various coupled systems. Several features of this
research are significant. For example, high-order radiating boundary conditions
are critical for treating unbounded domain problems, and split boundary
operators promise high accuracy while providing a posteriori indicator of the
error introduce by domain truncation. High-Order Temporal Approximations
including new, implicit, unconditionally stable TG (Taylor-Galerkin) schemes
promise high accuracy while balancing in an optimal way the variable high-order
spatial approximations. Also, hp-data structures and adaptive methods involve
date structure in which the mesh size h and the spectral order p of a finite
element approximation of a spatial variation of the dependent variables can be
varied throughout the (spatial) mesh. If these parameters can be orchestrated in
an optimal way, exponential convergence can be attained, meaning that highly
accurate results are possible with few degrees of freedom. Smart algorithms are
developed in that by monitoring errors in the hp-TG schemes and in radiating
boundary operators, automatic changes in solution algorithms can be introduced.
The research yields highly accurate computational methods having a potential of
reliably resolving the fine-scale and large-scale features of scattering and
radiation phenomena needed in advanced designs.
