This conference will continue the workshop series, Critical Issues in
Mathematics Education (CIME) on teaching and learning mathematics, initiated by
the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in 2004. The topic for CIME
2018 will be "Access to mathematics by opening doors for students currently
excluded from mathematics". The CIME workshops engage professional
mathematicians, education researchers, teachers, and policy makers in
discussions of issues critical to the improvement of mathematics education from
the elementary grades through undergraduate years. Sessions will share relevant
programmatic efforts and innovative research that have been shown to maintain or
increase students' engagement and interests in mathematics across k-12,
undergraduate and graduate education. The sessions will focus particularly on
reproducible efforts that affirm those students' identities and their diverse
intellectual resources and lived experience. Projects in the DRK-12 program
build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and
development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for
proposed projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CIME workshops impact three distinct
communities: research mathematicians, mathematics educators (K-16), and
education researchers. Participants learn about research and development efforts
that can enhance their own work and the contributions they can make to solving
issues in mathematics education. Participants also connect with others concerned
about those issues. This workshop will also focus on developing action plans
that participants can implement once they return to their institutions. There is
also a focus on recruitment of leaders of mathematics departments, teachers, and
other leaders in mathematics education across K-12, undergraduate education and
graduate education in order to examine systemic changes that can be made to
increase access, engagement, and interest in
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
