The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to save significant amounts of water at
power plants and other industrial facilities, potentially saving hundreds of
billions of gallons of water every year in the US. This will help reduce the
water footprint of power generation and other cooling applications, reduce
operating expenses for these facilities, and increase the reliability of power
generation. The annual savings can be several millions of dollars per facility
and the market opportunity in the US is estimated at around $4 B. Furthermore,
this technology can be used for upcycling the captured water from cooling towers
that use wastewater or seawater, potentially producing pure distilled water for
commercial and domestic use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II project
proposes to advance a water capture technology for cooling tower plumes. The
proposed technology uses electric fields to ionize the air around a cooling
tower outlet, charge the water escaping cooling towers, and direct it toward a
mesh-based collector and ultimately a collection tank on the periphery of the
cooling tower. The Phase II proposal includes both systematic experimental
studies to optimize the collection setup for real-world deployment, as well as
material choice and durability studies. This project will optimize the design
and build a pilot system, including a control panel designed for compatibility
with existing systems. Data collected from the pilot installation on collection
efficiency, water quality, and power consumption will be used to iterate and
improve the design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
