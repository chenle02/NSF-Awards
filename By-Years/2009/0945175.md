This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project describes an
innovative concept to enhance the energy conversion efficiency of
polycrystaline-Si solar cells by separating the absorption length from the
minority carrier diffusion length. This new design is called lateral collection.
The fabrication route employs scalable technologies such as imprint lithography
and electrodeposition. The primary research objective is to demonstrate much
higher current with polycrystalline silicon lateral collection solar cells
compared to conventional solar cells of the same thickness.

The broader/commercial impacts of this project will be the potential to
significantly improve the energy conversion efficiency of polycrystalline Si
solar cells. A major factor that lowers the energy conversion efficiency of
polycrystalline silicon solar cell is that current carriers cannot be harvested
from the relatively thick films that are needed to absorb sunlight.
Specifically, the optimum polycrystalline silicon absorber thickness is >10
microns; however the current can only be extracted if it is generated within
about 3 microns of the electrodes. The solution to this problem is to decouple
the directions of light absorption and charge carrier collection. By
incorporating microscale collecting structures into the active layer, this
lateral collection design ensures that all charge carriers are generated within
a short distance of a collecting surface. This technology may produce 60% more
current than conventional devices, thus resulting in much higher energy
conversion efficiency.
