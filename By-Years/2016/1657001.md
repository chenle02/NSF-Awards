A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and
research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the
Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these
institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging,
rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that
may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the
traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project
aligns directly with that goal, allowing tribal college students and faculty to
engage in international research while developing as a cohort of scientists with
share experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salish Kootenai College will
facilitate the travel for up to sixteen students and up to eight faculty to
participate in research experiences at the Organization for Tropical Studies at
the Las Cruces Biological Research Station, in Costa Rica.
