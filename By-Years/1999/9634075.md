9634075 Price The Center for Education and Equity in Mathematics, Science, and
Technology at California State Polytechnic University is working with four
multicultural school districts in eastern Los Angeles County to implement
systemic change in the secondary mathematics programs. Teachers in cooperation
with their administrators are effecting change in mathematics curriculum,
instruction, and assessment in keeping with the NCTM Standards. Workshops
provide teachers with additional content knowledge and renewal of pedagogical
skills consonant with the selected instructional materials and teachers are
forming networks and partnerships among themselves, administrators, professional
societies, and parents.
