9351180 Friedman The Howard Community College Science Department will upgrade
its computer-based experimental laboratory to promote real- life, real-time
problem-solving in its science classes. While the specifics will vary in each
discipline, the new laboratory equipment will allow HCC: 1. To acquire probeware
that will allow the collection and manipulation of real-world data for problem-
solving and conceptual model building exercises; 2. To incorporate more real-
world multimedia instruction into computer-based simulations, experiments, and
problems; 3. To utilize real-time data analysis and manipulation tools to
improve student facility with and comprehension of laboratory observations and
information. The equipment will support a flexible laboratory operation that
will serve approximately 2,500 annually. The laboratory will also be used for
professional development for K-12 teachers as well as a showcase for other area
colleges. ***
