The field of phonetics has experienced two revolutions in the last century: the
advent of the sound spectrograph in the 1950s and the application of computers
beginning in the 1970s. Today, advances in digital multimedia, networking and
mass storage are promising a third revolution: a movement from the study of
small, individual datasets to the analysis of published corpora that are several
orders of magnitude larger.

These new bodies of data are badly needed, to enable the field of phonetics to
develop and test hypotheses across languages and across the many types of
individual, social and contextual variation. However, in contrast to speech
technology research, speech science has so far taken relatively little advantage
of this opportunity, because access to these resources for phonetics research
requires tools and methods that are now incomplete, untested, and inaccessible
to most researchers.

This project fills this gap by integrating, adapting and improving techniques
developed in speech technology research, mainly forced alignment of digital
audio with phonetic representations derived from orthographic transcripts. The
research will help the field of phonetics to enter a new era: conducting
research using very large speech corpora, in the range from hundreds of hours to
hundreds of thousands of hours.
