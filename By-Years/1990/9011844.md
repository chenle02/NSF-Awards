This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the con- tinuing research
of Professor Ronald C. D. Breslow at Columbia University. An important goal of
this work is to prepare stable organic materials that are ferromagnetic at room
temperature. Success in this project could lead to the preparation of new
materials with considerable practical potential in areas such as information
storage and also could lead to increased understanding of the magnetic
properties of molecules and of materials. As part of this project, new triplet
species to be synthesized and studied include stabilized derivatives of benzene
dication, benzene dianion, cyclopentadienyl cation, and cyclopropenyl anion. The
proposed physical studies include electron spin resonance spectroscopy as a
function of temperature, magnetic susceptibility, and infrared spectroscopy. In
addition to their potential practical importance as a new class of magnetic
materials, the organic triplet species provide an experimental basis for
evaluating the structural requirements for a triplet ground state and for
ferromagnetic interactions.
