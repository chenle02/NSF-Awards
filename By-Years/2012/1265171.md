Photosynthesis plays a fundamental role in understanding plant growth and
productivity. The chloroplast, the organelle of photosynthesis, evolved
following the endosymbiotic uptake of a cyanobacterium and massive gene
transfer. As a result, the chloroplast is highly dependent upon nuclear genes to
provide essential chloroplast proteins. A special form of endosymbiosis,
kleptoplasty, has evolved in the marine mollusc Elysia chlorotica. This green,
leaf-like animal carries out photosynthesis for its entire ten month life-cycle,
as if it were a plant, by using chloroplasts it steals and retains from the alga
Vaucheria litorea. It is highly likely that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has
occurred between these two unrelated multi-cellular organisms, to support the
long-term activity of the chloroplasts in the sea slug. The overall approach of
this study is to combine cellular and molecular analyses with studies of whole
animal biology to understand how such an endosymbiotic association can form and
be sustained, and also influence the evolution of photosynthesis in an animal.
These studies will identify specific examples of HGT from the alga to the sea
slug, where and how the genes are integrated into the animal DNA, the mechanism
of recognition and uptake of the chloroplasts, and the specificity of the
association. The broader impact of these studies is seen at many levels.
Fascinating organisms can transform the teaching of basic principles in biology;
hence, the "solar-powered" sea slugs will be exploited in developing multimedia
educational materials for students of all ages. Kleptoplastic sea slugs also
potentially have a direct bearing on human health, through their production of
anti-cancer compounds. The ability to culture the sea slugs will provide a
supply of this unusual organism for classrooms and laboratories, marine
hobbyists, and contributes to protection of a rare species and its native
habitat.
