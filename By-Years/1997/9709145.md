9709145 Markgraf This project involves a 2-year pilot study, Phase 1, of the
Patagonian Lake Drilling Project (PATO), a multi-disciplinary, international
effort to recover, for the first time, long paleoenvironmental and paleoclimate
records from three extra-Andean closed lake basins in Argentina. These basins
lie along a transect from the subtropical to the temperate latitudes of southern
South America. Previous studies on shoreline features from the three basins
document major changes in lake levels during the late Pleistocene, and suggest
high sensitivity to climate change in the accumulated sediments. The objectives
of the Phase 1 project are: 1)to survey and sample the modern lake and
terrestrial environments for climate calibration of the sediment record; 2) to
undertake seismic surveys of the sediments, to identify optimal core sites; and
3) to collect and analyze short cores to determnine the paleoclimatic potential
of the records. An international group of experts in the field of paleolimnology
and paleoclimatology is collaborating, from Argentina, Germany, Switzerland, and
the US. In addition, substantial portions of this collaboration are supported by
other funding sources: Germany (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft); Switzerland
(Schweizer Nationalfond); the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory; and the
Argentine Geological Survey. PATO is a contribution to the long- term
collaborative effort of the Pole-Equator-Pole paleoclimate transect of the
Western Hemisphere (IGBP-PAGES-PEP 1). ***
