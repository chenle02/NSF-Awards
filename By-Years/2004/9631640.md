9631640 Snyder In prior research these investigators began an empirical
investigation of the productivity of campaign spending in House elections. Some
early results from this work indicate that the "vote production functions"
facing U.S. House incumbents and challengers are remarkably similar, and are not
statistically distinct. This finding contrasts sharply with the conventional
wisdom, which holds that incumbent spending is far less productive than that of
challengers. The results suggest that the central issue in the study of campaign
finance is not simply how money translates into votes but why some candidates
are able to raise vastly more than others. In the current investigation the
researchers proceed along two tracks. First, they validate their initial
investigation of the effects of campaign expenditures in incumbent-contested
U.S. House elections. To validate these estimates they extend their analysis to
U.S. Senate races and to open seat U.S. House races. They also improve their
measurement techniques through the use of LEXIS/NEXIS and are thus allowed to
make the most complete and accurate data set of who runs for Congress. Second,
they investigate how the productivity of campaign spending varies across
different kinds of candidates, across electoral settings (such as congressional
district, state, and media market), and over the course of political careers.
Political lore and public opinion research frequently emphasizes that the
effectiveness of a campaign depends very much on the context. With only a few
exceptions, research on campaign finance has ignored these contextual factors,
though there has bee much speculation. Among the specific hypotheses, the
marginal product of spending is thought to be lower (1) if the candidate is
already well-known, (2) if the campaign is conducted in an expensive media
market, (3) if the challenger is running for the second time, (4) if the
challenger is a political novice, and (5) if the electorate is composed largely
of vote rs of the opposite party of the candidate. Using the instrumental
variables approach presented in their earlier work, they test whether the
productivity of campaign spending money varies in any of these ways. While the
statistics are relatively straightforward, additional data collection is
undertaken. This project produces three highly useful new data sets for use by
other scholars: one on the personal and professional backgrounds of
congressional candidates; one on the locations, resources, and activities of
business and other interest groups; and, one tracking the histories of important
federal legislation of the last two decades. ***
