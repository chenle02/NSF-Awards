While races in multithreaded programs have drawn huge attention from
the&lt;br/&gt;research community, little has been done for API races, a
class&lt;br/&gt;of errors as dangerous and as difficult to debug as traditional
thread&lt;br/&gt;races. An API race occurs when multiple activities, whether
they be&lt;br/&gt;threads or processes, access a shared resource via an
application&lt;br/&gt;programming interface (API) without proper
synchronization. Detecting&lt;br/&gt;API races is an important and difficult
problem as existing race&lt;br/&gt;detectors are unlikely to work well with API
races. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Software reliability increasingly affects everyone,
whether or not&lt;br/&gt;they personally use computers. This research studies
and&lt;br/&gt;automatically detects for the first time an important class of
races&lt;br/&gt;that has a significant impact on software reliability. The
study&lt;br/&gt;quantitatively demonstrates how API races are numerous,
difficult to&lt;br/&gt;debug, and a real threat to software reliability. To
address this&lt;br/&gt;problem, this research is developing RacePro, a new
system to&lt;br/&gt;automatically detect API races in deployed systems. RacePro
checks&lt;br/&gt;deployed systems in-vivo by recording live executions
then&lt;br/&gt;deterministically replay and check them later. This
approach&lt;br/&gt;increases checking coverage beyond the configurations or
executions&lt;br/&gt;covered by software vendors or beta testing sites. RacePro
records&lt;br/&gt;multiple processes and threads, detects races in the recording
among &lt;br/&gt;API methods that may concurrently access shared objects, then
explores&lt;br/&gt;different execution orderings of such API methods to
determine which races&lt;br/&gt;are harmful and result in failures. Technologies
developed will help&lt;br/&gt;application developers detect insidious software
defects, enabling &lt;br/&gt;more robust, reliable, and secure software
infrastructure.
