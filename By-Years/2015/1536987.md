E-visits, an alternative to the traditional office visit for medical services
made possible by secure patient-physician communication, has the potential to
improve access to care, and increase provider efficiency and patient
satisfaction. For clinics that adopt e-visit strategy, several operational
challenges arise. For example, how to determine the optimal staffing levels, how
to allocate providers' time across different types of visits, how to schedule
both office and e-visit requests, and how to identify system bottlenecks. An
understanding of these operational dynamics can help in the identification of
implementable mitigation strategies. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison
with Industry (GOALI) research project will be informed by collaboration with
the Dean Health System and validated by utilizing Dean Health as a test case.
The successful completion of this work will provide rigorous quantitative tools
for primary care practitioners and administrators to improve patient access and
quality of care.

If successful, the results of this research will provide mathematical model to
study the complex primary care delivery process with e-visits as part of a mix
of services offered by comprehensive health systems such as Dean Health. Based
on analytical investigation of the stochastic processes underlying primary care
operations, network analyses will be used to model the patient flow and clinic
operations. The research team will begin with analyses of patient flow at the
clinic level and then analyze work flow within an office visit. By addressing
their interactions and considering the limited availability and multiple tasks
of providers through recursive algorithms, researchers will investigate optimal
staffing, resource allocation, and workflow scheduling problems. Bottleneck
analysis will be performed to identify significant constraints and to develop
strategies to mitigate them.
