The New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University is initiating an
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Glass Research. This
center's first-year research projects are: (1) influence of high temperature
processes on the intrinsic and practical strength of glass; (2) effect of
melting atmosphere on gas solubility and glass properties; (3) glass melt -
refractory interactions; (4) composition and chemistry of freshly formed glass
surfaces; (5) study of glass workability; (6) the effect of particle size
distributions on the batching and melting of glasses and on the homogeneity of
the resulting glasses; (7) mathematical modelling of glass tank behavior; (8)
the measurement of thermal diffusivity of glass melts; and (9) an investigation
of the electrochemical behavior of glass forming melts.
