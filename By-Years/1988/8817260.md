This award provides partial (50%) funding to acquire a solid source mass
spectrometer with a 30-centimeter energy filter. The spectrometer will be housed
in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Minnesota. The
University will provide the remaining 50% required for the purchase of the
instrument. The spectrometer system will be capable of very high precision and
sensitivity for measurement of the uranium series nuclides, thorium-232 and
U-234. Initial research with the instrument will focus on obtaining records of
Quaternary paleo- sea levels, records of tectonic movements and associated
earthquake activity in the past, and records of carbon-14 variations in past
atmospheres.
