AST-0407212&lt;br/&gt;Church&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galaxy clusters are excellent
cosmological probes, capable of measuring both the mass distribution in the
universe and the dynamics of its expansion. Measurement of the Sunyaev-
Zel'dovich effect (SZE), which is the inverse scattering of cosmic microwave
background (CMB) photons by hot gas in clusters, determines cluster peculiar
velocities without the need for empirical distance indicators. This research
will continue the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Infrared Experiment (SuZIE), using a new
receiver with additional frequency coverage, capable of faster, higher precision
measurements. The study will measure 100 clusters, determining the density
parameter and the variation of the temperature of the CMB as a function of
redshift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The receiver will be available for other
investigations that can use its multi-frequency capabilities. Students involved
with SuZIE will learn start-of-the-art instrumental techniques, including
optical and electronics design and fabrication. The research will continue to
involve undergraduates, and in the past more than half of them have been women.
The team will also continue giving public talks and participating in Stanford
high school programs for students and teachers.
