Social networks link behavioral and social activities with a myriad of
infrastructural networks that support relationships between individuals. These
infrastructural networks include the Internet, telephone systems and
transportation networks, all of which are in turn tied to power and fuel-supply
networks, such as electricity grids. Social networks play a powerful shaping
role on underlying infrastructural networks, placing great demands on their
capacity and helping determine how they evolve through use.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An initial set of analyses suggests that there are
significant opportunities for improving energy use by analyzing and optimizing
the energy required to build and sustain social networks. This project seeks to
quantify the energy requirements of social networks and identify strategies for
optimizing their energy use by: assessing the ecology of technologies used in
social networks through surveys and crowdsourced data; modeling and empirically
measuring the power consumed in communication technologies; and developing a
social sustainability composite indicator that will be integrated into a tool to
help users make more sustainable choices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit This project will lead to an improved understanding of the behavior and
dynamics of complex, socio-technical networks so that future networks can be
better designed. The project seeks to build an understanding of how different
communication technologies are used together in social networks and to use this
model to address how energy use accumulates in technical networks that support
relationships. Finally, the project seeks to link large-scale problems with the
actions and behaviors of individuals, which is critical for promoting behavioral
change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts The questions answered in this
project are critical to informed optimization and innovation of energy use in
the context of social networks and social life. A better understanding of the
energy cost of social networks and social computing technologies promises to
have impact in climate change, information technology for development and
operational efficiency. Additionally, the project?s findings will be distributed
through a number of national programs for training and curriculum development.
