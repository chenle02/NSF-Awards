This award supports a Southern California Geometric Analysis Research Seminar
to be held once each year for two years at a centrally located university in
Southern California. The participating institutions include UC-Irvine, UC-Los
Angeles, Caltech, UC-San Diego, UC-Santa Barbara, UC-Riverside, USC, and the
California State universities in the area. Each meeting will be of two days
duration and will involve graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The
speakers will be from outside the Southern California region and will be
encouraged to provide lectures at a level understandable to graduate students in
areas of current research in geometric analysis.
