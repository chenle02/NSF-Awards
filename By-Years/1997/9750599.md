The Department of Engineering has a modern undergraduate materials laboratory
equipped with an image analysis system. This system has been used to improve the
capability of students to view and analyze microscopic structure. However, it
has been limited to traditional optical microscopes and two-dimensional (2-D)
views on video monitors. This project seeks to remove this limitation through
the acquisition of an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) and Virtual i.O VGA glasses.
The AFM allows students to see views on the molecular arrangement level.
However, these views are still presented on a VGA monitor as a 2-D view of a
three-dimensional (3-D) view. The Virtual i.O VGA glasses correct this
deficiency. Through the use of special software, the normal static view from the
AFM is turned into a virtual 3-D view. Thus, the virtual image of the instructor
is able to walk onto the object being viewed and point out the significant
details. Students, wearing the Virtual i.O VGA glasses, are able to roam about
the virtual 3-D view of the object being studied. Another objective is to
improve the ability of students to understand 3-D visualizations and
particularly 3-D object rotation. Pre- and post-tests evaluate whether increased
understanding has taken place. *
