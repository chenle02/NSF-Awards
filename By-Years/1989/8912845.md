This is a one-year award to the American Physics Society (APS) for a series of
workshops on undergraduate curriculum development in physics. The PI's are Dr.
Brian Schwartz, APS and Dr. Judy Franz, American Association of Physics
Teachers. They will hold a workshop for physics researchers to organize efforts
to improve the undergraduate physics curriculum. Two additional workshops will
be held in specific sub-disciplines of physics. The sub-disciplines will be
determined by the outcome of the general workshop.
