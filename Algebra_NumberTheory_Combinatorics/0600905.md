The theory of special values of global and p-adic L-functions is of central
importance in number theory. It provides bridges between the analytic aspects of
the theory and the arithmetic-algebraic-geometric aspects, shedding new light on
both and leading to striking solutions to outstanding open problems in the
field. The PI has developed a conjectural program which generalizes and refines
the Gross-Rubin-Stark Conjectures on special values of global L-functions and
generalizes and refines the Main Conjecture in Iwasawa Theory and Gross'
Conjectures on special values of p-adic L-functions. The PI will employ
techniques involving equivariant Iwasawa Theory, the theory of 1-motives, Weil-
etale cohomology, crystalline cohomology and the theory of t-motives to provide
new evidence for his conjectures. He will also attempt to establish links
between his conjectural program and those of Burns-Flach (on the Equivariant
Tamagawa Number Conjecture for Artin Motives) and Ritter-Weiss (on non-abelian
equivariant versions of the Main Conjecture in Iwasawa Theory). The PI will also
study applications of his conjectural program to the construction of explicit
Euler Systems, explicit generation of class-fields over an arbitrary global
field (Hilbert's 10th problem), Leopoldt's Conjecture and refined class-number
formulas. The PI will offer graduate courses and organize seminars and
conferences bringing together students and experts in the field of special
values of L-functions.

An L-function is a gadget of analytic (continuous) nature which encodes a
tremendous amount of arithmetic-algebraic-geometric (discrete) data of interest
to experts working in the fields of number theory and arithmetic-algebraic
geometry, as well as cryptographers, coding theorists, telecommunications
engineers etc. The PIs conjectural program builds upon classical conjectures due
to Gross, Rubin, Stark and Iwasawa among others and aims for determining
(decoding) the discrete data out of special values of L-functions at the
integral points on the real axis. The PI will employ techniques coming from
various areas of mathematics, especially number theory and arithmetic geometry
to prove his conjectures in several significant cases and to establish links
between his conjectural program and those of Burns-Flach and Ritter-Weiss. Aside
from its many far reaching applications to number theory and algebraic geometry
(which will be explored by the PI), this research project has significant
potential impact upon practical fields such as cryptography and coding theory.
