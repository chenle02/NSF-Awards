This is a proposal to characterize the hydrology, hydrogeology, and
geochemistry of the northern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Northern Yucatan is an
emergent platform in which karst features are developing in rocks whose
mineralogy is strongly dominated by limestone and dolomite. Low content of
argillaceous minerals and high permeability insure a rapid throughput of
groundwater in the system. Mixing of fresh and salt water result in a
significant zone of dispersion between the fresh groundwater lens and the
underlying saline intrusion; and this zone of dispersion can significantly
affect carbonate diagenesis. Simple stratigraphy and mineralogical composition,
accessibility, and lack of human development make the northern Yucatan Peninsula
an excellent natural laboratory. The study area will be divided into four
distinct zones characterized by strong differences in permeability. Proposed
research involves drilling holes (in collaboration with Mexican ion content,
environmental isotopes, saturation indices, and Sr content), and making and
calibrating electrical resistivity surveys. Interface behavior and its relation
to diagenesis and corrosion will be studied. Data will be mapped or contoured
and used in numerical simulation of groundwater flow.
