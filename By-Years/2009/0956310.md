The basic research program of the nuclear structure group at the University of
Kentucky (UK) is focused on timely topics in nuclear spectroscopy, neutron-
induced reactions, and neutron scattering. Most of this work will utilize fast
neutrons produced at UK's accelerator laboratory and the radiation detection
capabilities developed in this laboratory. The broad-based research program will
include selected studies of nuclei undergoing shape oscillations and
transitions, the roles of protons and neutrons in nuclear excitations, nuclear
shell structure, and data relevant to rare decay modes. Nuclear level lifetime
measurements, for which the methodology has been developed over many years in
our laboratory, provide crucial information in many of these investigations.
Additional projects that are particularly appropriate to the capabilities
available at the UK accelerator laboratory will be pursued, and collaborative
research with colleagues from other institutions is emphasized.

Education at the graduate and post-graduate levels is an integral part of all
activities in our laboratory, and graduates of this program are trained nuclear
scientists who are important in meeting our national needs. Providing a
supportive professional experience for students is an ongoing, vital component
of our program, and these students enthusiastically participate in experiments
at other facilities, scientific conferences, and the activities of professional
societies. Research at a small accelerator laboratory, such as ours, permits the
mentoring of young scientists on a daily basis. For many years, the research
facilities of our laboratory have been made available to students and faculty
from non-doctoral-granting institutions, as well as scientists from other
research universities, national laboratories, and nuclear-related industry.
Research performed in our laboratory has contributed directly to national
interests, such as homeland security and the design of advanced nuclear
reactors, and will continue to do so. These applications are well represented by
the activities of government and industrial partners who utilize our accelerator
and research equipment. For example, collaborative studies with colleagues from
industry have led to improved neutron-detection-based methods for the inspection
of luggage for explosives and illegal drugs, and data obtained in our laboratory
has been used to evaluate direct energy-storage devices. In each case, the
unique capabilities of our laboratory were important considerations in the
selection of our facility for this work.
