The proposed research program focuses on the development of multigrid methods
for convection-dominated flows on distributed architectures. The research covers
a wide range of activities from fundamental analysis and development of
effective multigrid algorithms for convention-dominated flows, to the
application of these algorithms to a distributed architecture of workstations.
In particular, this effort will focus on the two and three dimensional
compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Particular areas of research
will include an analysis of the importance of propagation effects in multigrid
algorithms; the development of robust, preconditioners, which will not only
enhance wave propagation but will also improve high frequency damping for the
Euler equations; the extensions of these preconditioners to viscous, turbulent ,
and time dependent equations; the development of scalable full-coarsening and
semi-coarsening multigrid algorithms for distributed compute architectures; and
the development of a visualization toolkit to interactively monitor the results
of the distributed multigrid algorithms.
