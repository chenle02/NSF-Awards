CMS-9532061 The failure of systems composed of brittle materials such as
concrete and rock is controlled by the development and accumulation of
microdefects referred to as damage. Macroscopically, damage reduces the elastic
stiffness, causes anisotropy, and reduces the load-carrying capacity of the
material. The objective of this research is to identify damage through the
acoustic emission (AE) technique and to use this measurement of damage to assess
the onset of failure in systems composed of rock-like materials. The
accumulation of damage has a fundamental importance for defining the behavior of
brittle materials in terms of their strength. In addition, the importance of
detecting brittle failure of structures is brought on by the use of high-
strength concrete, by the urgency in preserving classical monuments, and by the
need to evaluate aggregate durability. It is claimed that a quantitative
analysis of damage can be applied to components of full-scale structures by
simplifying the deconvolution process for determining source mechanisms and
orientations. The impact of this research on the infrastructure will be the
real-time monitoring of systems to evaluate damage in the form of cracks, voids,
loss of bond, and other detrimental processes leading to failure. ***
