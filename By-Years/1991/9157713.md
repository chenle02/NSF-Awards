In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Polik will study the chemical dynamics of highly excited molecules using
molecular beam techniques and high-resolution dispersed fluorescence
spectroscopy. Rovibrationally resolved dispersed fluorescence spectra of a
series of aldehydes will be determined, and the implications for intramolecular
energy flow will be analyzed. The pressure dependence of dispersed fluorescence
spectra will be studied to show the role of dipolar interactions in
intermolecular energy transfer. %%% Molecular-beam and high resolution dispersed
fluorescence techniques will be used to prepare and observe excited states of
molecules in order to understand the microscopic details of chemical reactivity.
The results of these experiments will be used to test different models of
reactive and non-reactive collision dynamics. Dr. Polik's studies are part of
the Presidential Young Investigator Award (PYI) Program.
