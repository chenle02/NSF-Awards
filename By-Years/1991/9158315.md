In this Presidential Young Investigator award, modern synthetic organic and
organometallic reactions will be used for the synthesis of new conjugated
organic oligomers and polymers. The molecular architectures are planned so as to
maximize the electronic (conducting) and photonic (nonlinear optical) properties
of the final materials. For example, planar polyphenylene derivatives will be
synthesized by metal-catalyzed cross coupling reactions. Reactive sites within
each monomer unit will then unite to force the final target polymer into a
planar conformation. This should minimize the electrical resistance in
conductivity studies as well as minimize the photonic loss in third order
nonlinear optical studies. Additional studies will involve the synthesis of
chiral and optically active conjugated polymers that are asymmetric along their
backbone due to restricted rotations around single bonds.
