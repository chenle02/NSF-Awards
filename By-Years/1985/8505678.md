The advent of relatively low cost computational aids has recently reinvigorated
efforts to use numerical simulations to solve electromagnetic scattering and
radiation problems that previously required empirical solutions. The research in
progress addresses problems of scattering where proximity of nearby structures
is a complication. Many practical problems varying from flow of signal in small
electronic devices to those involving mobile communication systems are of this
type. Access to a supercomputer will be provided.
