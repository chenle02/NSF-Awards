OCE-0453971&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project continues Scripps Institution of
Oceanography's role as the Pacific Facility of the Ocean-Bottom Seismic
Instrument Pool. Scripps maintains a fleet of 75 OBS/H of which 25 can be used
in a long-deployment, broadband configuration for periods exceeding a year. Over
the initial five years the combined fleet of active and passive instruments have
been deployed over 500 times on 9 major marine geophysical research cruises.
