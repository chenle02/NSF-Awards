This project involves the supporting services for the National Science
Foundation/Conference Board of Mathematical Sciences (CBMS) regional conference
series in the mathematical sciences. The CBMS supporting services consist
primarily of four kinds of annual activities: (1) assisting the National Science
Foundation in drafting and publicizing the announcement and guidelines for the
Regional Conference proposals; (2) selecting and convening panels of experts to
evaluate the proposals and make recommendations to the National Science
Foundation; (3) providing an official observer to each regional conference to
evaluate its degree of success and make recommendations for improvement of
future conferences; and (4) receiving and submitting to the National Science
Foundation for approval, manuscripts of the conferences, and then arranging the
publication of these manuscripts. The regional research conferences survey
current research topics in the mathematical sciences and provide for the
exchange of scientific research related to the conference focus.
