Students are using a computer classroom as an integral part of their learning
environment to discover mathematical principles and concepts, to analyze models
of real world problems, and to gain a better appreciation of program
development. Students are working with their own experimental data from the
science laboratories. An instructional command center gives the instructor
control over the classroom environment and enables the student to interact
through the computer with the instructor and with other students in the
classroom, making computer group work a reality. The project also enables the
institution to provide computer accessibility for the physically challenged.
