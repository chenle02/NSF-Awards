The PI plans to continue his research into the enumerative and topological
properties of matroids. Introduced in 1935 by Whitney, matroids are a
combinatorial abstraction of one of the fundamental structures of mathematics,
linear independence. The enumerative aspect of the work involves combining
techniques from commutative algebra, topology and combinatorics in order to
study h-vectors of broken circuit and independence complexes. These
combinatorial invariants appear in applications to hyperplane arrangements,
linear coding theory, network reliability and quotients of spheres. Topological
properties of matroids will be explored using the investigator's recent
discovery that matroids can be represented as arrangements of homotopy spheres.
This point of view indicates possible applications to combinatorial projective
planes, oriented matroids and classical bundle theories.

This research is in the general area of combinatorics. One of the central themes
in combinatorics is the enumeration of discrete objects with complicated
structure. For instance, this proposal includes methods for estimating the
reliability of large networks of the type that might be found in the design of
telephone or other similar communication systems.
