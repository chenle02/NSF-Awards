The relationship between the cadmium concentration (Cd) and the stable carbon
isotopic composition (S13C) of marine pore waters will be determined. These
parameters are tightly correlated in the water column, but preliminary results
suggest that this is not the case in the sediments. Release of cadmium to the
pore water appears to be localized in a narrow zone close to the sediment-water
interface, while isotopically light inorganic carbon continues to be added to
the pore water below the near-interface zone of most intense organic matter
composition. The motivation for the proposed research comes from efforts to
compare the paleochemical records preserved in the stable carbon iosotope and
cadmium: calcium ratios of benthic oraminifera tests. Quantification of the pore
water Cd:SC13 relationship will make it possible to use enthic foraminiferal
Cd:Ca data to test the hypothesis that the carbon isotope of some benthic
foraminifera species reflects pore water carbon isotopic composition.
