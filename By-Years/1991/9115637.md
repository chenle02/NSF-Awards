Professor George Phillies is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform studies of structured fluids using
optical probes. The objective of the work is to study diffusion and transport in
liquids with extended local structures such as micelles, vesicles and
microemulsions. The primary physical method is light scattering spectroscopy
which can determine the diffusion coefficients of mesoscopic particles through
amphiphile solutions. Computer simulations are used to examine the diffusion of
small molecules through the pores of model glass formed from large immobile
spheres. These simulations, which incorporate Monte Carlo dynamics, molecular
dynamics, and Brownian dynamics computations, model how particle motions are
constrained by random static potentials. %%% Probe motion in surfactant systems
and porous media model aspects of a wide variety of important scientific and
technical processes, including self-organization of complex structures,
intracellular diffusion in living cells, three phase catalysis, and enzymatic
post-processing of polymers in biochemical engineering.
