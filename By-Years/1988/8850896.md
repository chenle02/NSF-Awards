The Society for the History of Technology (SHOT) in collaboration with the
Charles River Museum of Industry will use the history of technology to introduce
students in American history classes to applications of chemistry, physics and
engineering. "Discovering Science and Technology through American History: A
Pilot Project" will stimulate greater interest among middle and high school
students in science and technology and will demonstrate to them the impact of
science and engineering on their daily lives. The broader goal of this
unconventional approach is to encourage students to pursue academic study of
science and engineering. The technology selected to achieve these goals is
textiles and apparel which students care about personally and one that deals
with both science and engineering. The essence of the project will be eight
modular curriculum units which can be inserted into American History survey
courses without disruption to existing curricula and teacher lesson plans. The
units will be prepared by a group of eighteen middle and high school teachers
and historians of technology. Curricular packages will include detailed lesson
plans, bibliographies for students and teachers, background essays for teachers,
descriptions of student projects, black line art and diagrams which teachers can
photocopy for classroom use, experiments and videotapes. The units may include
some simple artifacts and indicate where others can be obtained. The Society for
the History of Technology has the technical expertise and the resources of the
Charles River Museum provide a strong information base for the development of
the project.
