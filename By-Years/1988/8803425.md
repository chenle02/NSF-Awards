A continuation of research at (inter)national accelerator laboratories
performing experiments in the area of intermediate energy physics is proposed.
Particle experiments are performed at the TRIUMF accelerator in Canada.
Presently underway is a measurement of radiative muon capture in hydrogen. This
measurement has never before been made due to the small branching ratio, a few
parts in one-hundred-million. The hydrogen measurement will provide a clean
determination of the induced pseudoscalar coupling constant of the semileptonic
weak interaction. The nuclear RMC measurements, data taking completed, are now
being analyzed. They check on renormalization effects in nuclei. The other part
of the program centers on photonuclear experiments with a tagged polarized gamma
ray beam. These experiments have been initiated at the Laser Electron Gamma Ray
Source (LEGS) being constructed at Brookhaven National Laboratory. This is a
unique new facility in which every photon, at a rate of ten million per second
is tagged and polarization of roughly ninety percent both linear and circular is
expected. The first experiments will study deuteron photodisintegration by
detecting the recoil proton. The second set of experiments will study Compton
scattering and neutral pion photoproduction from protons and deuterons with
polarized photons. The recoil proton or neutron and photon will be detected in
coincidence. These measurements enable the determination of the electric and
magnetic polarizabilities of the nucleons.
