In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism Program,
Prof. Andrei Tokmakoff of the Chemistry Department of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and his graduate student colleagues will develop
ultrafast two-dimensional vibrational spectroscopy and use it in conjunction
with nanosecond laser temperature-jumps to characterize the conformations of
biomolecules and describe their conformational dynamics. These methods will be
used to study the folding of NTL9. New methods for studying DNA G-quadruplexes
will be developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the broader scientific impacts
of the research being supported, the research students working on these projects
will gain experience with advanced laser techniques. Prof. Tokmakoff also
maintains a Web site(http://www.mit.edu/~tokmakof/TDQMS/) through which his most
recent quantum mechanics course materials are made available. Additional lecture
and laboratory course materials are distributed on the MIT OpenCourseWare Web
site(http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/home/home/index.htm/).
