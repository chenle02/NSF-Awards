The VII International Society of Environmental Biotechnology (ISEB) Conference
will bring together a diverse group of scientists, engineers, lawyers, judges,
and community members to discuss potential solutions to current and emerging
environmental problems. The conference will not only address basic science and
technology issues of environmental biotechnology, but also international
collaboration, environmental justice, and ethical, legal, and social
implications of the technology. The speakers include scientists, engineers, and
policy makers from the U.S. and many foreign organizations. The organizers have
selected a geographical breadth of speakers, as well as included women as chairs
for about half of the sessions. Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers
have also been invited to give oral presentations. The keynote lecturers include
distinguished woman scientists and government representatives. The funding
provided by NSF will be used to support the participation of U.S. attendees from
academic institutions, with preference given to junior scientists, postdocs, and
graduate students.
