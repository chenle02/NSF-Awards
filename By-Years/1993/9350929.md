We are proposing to purchase a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS), a
compatible GC, and the appropriate equipment to create a Moravian College
Scientific Instrumentation Network (MOCOSIN) linking laboratories and classrooms
in the Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, and Physics Departments. This
combination of the instruments and MOCOSIN is designed to: introduce mass
spectrometry and GC- MS into the curriculum across the sciences; facilitate
efficient use of expensive resources throughout the science division; encourage
broad collaboration among faculty and students by providing an intellectual as
well as an electronic link among students and faculty of all departments; and
provide all science departments with a connection to NSFNET.The combination of
an MS and a GC, a versatile and powerful tool for separating complex mixtures
and characterizing their components, will be used as a connecting thread for
courses across the natural sciences. GC-MS will be introduced to students in
General Physics and Chemistry courses where it will be used to illustrate
isotopes and mass spectrometry. Students will use GC-MS again in intermediate
level Biology, Chemistry and Physics courses as an analytical tool for
separation and identification of organic compounds. Since all Biology majors
take Organic Chemistry and all Chemistry majors take General Physics, by the
time students use the GC-MS in their advanced Biology or Chemistry courses, they
will have gained considerable sophistication in the use of the instrument. We
believe our particular combination of the experiments and electronic network is
unique and should serve as a model for other small colleges.
