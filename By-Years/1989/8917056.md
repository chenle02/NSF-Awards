Theoretical and experimental work on the atomic description of geochemical
processes will be continued. The current theoretical development makes it
possible to tackle problems as varied as the structure of silica glass, the
adsorption of water on silicates, the nature of zoning during crystal growth,
the high pressure behavior of melts, the aqueous dissolution of feldspars, the
growth of forsterite from its melt and the equation of state of minerals truly
from first principles. With the purpose of establishing widely usable models in
thermodynamics and kinetics, the proposal plans to continue the task of
obtaining high quality quantum mechanical results on the bonding in silicates.
The quantum mechanical results are the incorporated into potential energy
functions. These functions are employed in molecular dynamics and monte carlo
simulations, which relate the atomic physics to the macroscopic thermodynamic
and kinetic phenomena of interest to earth scientists. The high pressure
experimental research will be continued in support of the theoretical studies.
