A fundamental investigation of epitaxial growth and analysis of the properties
of SiGeC will be conducted to assess the viability of obtaining strain
compensation in SiGe by incorporation of 1 to 2 atomic percent carbon into CVD-
grown layers of SiGeC, and thereby raise the energy band gap. In the binary
alloy, the presence of about 10 atomic percent Ge in Si introduces strain and
lowers the energy gap; in contrast, the addition of only 1 to 2 percent carbon
in SiGe is expected to compensate the strain and raise the energy gap. If this
is feasible, and the material is thermally stable to temperatures of 950C, it
may be possible to fabricate a wide range of structures and advanced devices
through band gap engineering of Si/SiGe/SiGeC heterostructures analogous to what
has been successfully demonstrated with compound semiconductors, which would
represent an important advance in microelectronics. %%% This research will
investigate epitaxial crystal growth of silicon germanium carbon alloys to
understand basic materials properties, and to assess the possibility of
controlling the energy band gap of Si/SiGe/SiGeC heterostructures for
utilization of this material in a wide range of advanced silicon-based devices.
The ternary alloy, SiGeC, holds the potential of superior device and circuit
capability while simplifying process integration.
