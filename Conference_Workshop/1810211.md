The conference "Interactions of quantum affine algebras with cluster algebras,
current algebras and categorification" will take place at the Catholic
University of America in Washington, DC on June 2-8, 2018. The conference will
focus on problems related to, or motivated by, representations of infinite
dimensional Lie algebras and their quantum analogues. The recent rapid growth,
rising prominence, and emerging connections between these topics underscores the
timely need for a conference that focuses on new connections by bringing
together leading researchers who work on different aspects of these subjects. A
main goal of the conference is to expose graduate students and early-career
researchers to recent developments in representation theory. In an effort to
foster their interest and engagement, the four day conference will be preceded
by a three day summer school/workshop for junior researchers.

Infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and their quantum analogues play a prominent
role in mathematics and mathematical physics. In recent decades their
representation theory has been connected with a number of different subjects,
such as algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, combinatorics and cluster
algebras, to name but a few. The talks will focus on topics such as crystal and
canonical bases, Weyl, Demazure and Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules and interaction
between them, highest weight categories, Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras and
their applications to categorification, cluster algebras and related structures,
geometric methods in infinite dimensional representation theory (in particular,
the role of quiver varieties), and map algebras. A special emphasis will be
placed on interactions between various structures. Further details can be found
at the conference website: http://www.mi.uni-koeln.de/~dkus/.
