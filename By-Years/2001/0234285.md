Grid computing, or using several potentially heterogeneous computers to execute
an application, is becoming increasingly popular. A grid poses significant
software challenges for parallel computing; in particular, fundamental parallel
computing problems are made more difficult. This project focuses on the data
distribution problem, which is to distribute data to processors to minimize
application completion time. We will re-examine the data distribution problem on
one specific instance of a grid: a local area network of heterogeneous
computers. Processors in such a cluster can have different relative CPU speeds,
different amounts of available physical memory, and different effective I/O
latencies. In addition, we will support the increasing number of out-of-core
programs on these clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will address this data
distribution problem through the design and implementation of what we call
Heterogeneous Cluster MPI (HC-MPI), which will be constructed as extensions and
analysis built into MPI. The extensions will (1) assist users in writing
adaptable programs and (2) allow HC-MPI to collect enough program information to
determine automatically an effective data distribution. The expected impact of
this work is to allow computational scientists to execute parallel programs
efficiently on a variety of heterogeneous clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
