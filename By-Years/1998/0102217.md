0102217&lt;br/&gt;Jones&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas Program award will
provide support for cooperative research between Dr. William D. Jones of the
University of Rochester and Dr. Juventino J. Garcia Alejandre of the Universidad
Nacional Autonoma de Mexico to do a two-year study of new methods for the
cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds using transition metal complexes. A portion of
this support is being provided by NSF's Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
discover new compounds that can cleavage carbon-carbon bonds in a variety of
aromatic and aliphatic molecules. The project will benefit from the
complementary expertise of the collaborators, with the U.S. researchers
providing the necessary equipment to analyze and characterize the compounds, and
the Mexican researchers providing their substantial synthetic capabilities and
reaction product characterization. The cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds by
transition metal compounds is one of the greatest challenges to organometallic
chemists. Only a few examples of this difficult reaction have been reported to
date. Consequently, this project has the potential to increase our understanding
of these important chemical processes.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
