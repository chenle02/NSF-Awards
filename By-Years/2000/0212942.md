Shaul Mukamel of U. Rochester and Rudy Marcus of Caltech are supported by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program for a Summer School for graduate
students and post-doctoral fellows, where instructors will lecture on many-body
techniques in chemical physics. The 12-day school will be administered through
the Gordon Research Conference office. Lectures will emphasize physically
motivated approximations, connections to current experiments, and
transferability of mathematical methods to other, quite different
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of the school are to expose
students to tutorials in targeted subdisciplines of chemical physics,
familiarize them with state-of-the-art techniques in greater depth than normal
course work, and allow them to become acquainted with peers at other
institutions at the early stages of their careers.
