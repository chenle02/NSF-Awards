CBET-0821236&lt;br/&gt;Zhu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MicroCT is a high resolution,
non-destructive imaging method that employs tomography, where digital processing
of sequential x-ray scans is used to generate a 3-D image of an object's
structure. It has become the quintessential tool for research requiring non-
invasive characterization of internal morphology and identification of disparate
phases. This proposal&lt;br/&gt;describes unique applications of microCT in
conducting research on relationships betweenmicrostructure and the physical
properties of hard and soft tissues, biomaterials, and engineered micro-
materials. The specific aims of the proposed research are to:&lt;br/&gt;1.
Detail the vasculature in tumors and structures of the eye associated with
ocular diseases.&lt;br/&gt;2. Evaluate microstructural changes in hard and soft
tissues with aging and/or diseases.&lt;br/&gt;3. Characterize transport in
permeable natural materials and advanced structural materials.
