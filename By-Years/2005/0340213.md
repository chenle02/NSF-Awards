This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to focus on the
development and optoelectronic optimization of a prototype for a new, leapfrog
class of web-coatable solar cells which are flexible with a light weight form
factor, have substantially lower absolute cost per area, and a breakthrough
cost-performance. The objective of the project is the creation and optimization
of a benchtop prototype device with an efficiency, which will represent the
highest solar cell efficiency ever achieved in an organic cell. The project's
plastic solar cells are based upon a 200 nm thick, nanoscale charge-splitting
network which serves as an active layer, self-organized from solution into
highly regular coatings that can be tailored to absorb most of the visible light
spectrum. These solar cells can be coated onto large-area panels without the use
of lithography, vacuum deposition, or high-temperature processes. Commercially,
relative to best practice solar cells, based on thin film, inorganic copper
indium gallium selenide technology, this new approach has the potential to
enable solar cells with a cost per watt that is 2.5x superior to the industry's
anticipated CIGS-based cell performance in 2008, an unprecedented level with the
potential of making solar electricity economically feasible for a broad market.
In addition, with key differentiating attributes including light weight, a
flexible form, and a low cost per area, the technology opens up new markets and
application segments.
