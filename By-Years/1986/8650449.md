The Computer Science Department at the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs
will purchase four Sun-3/160 workstations. The project will provide a laboratory
and laboratory exercises for students taking a required operating systems course
to experiment with the design and implementation of operating system software
components. The objective is to provide a laboratory facility for undergraduate
computer science students to obtain hands-on experience in the design,
implementation, and performance measurement of computer operating systems. In
this way students will be able to function better in their careers as computer
scientists.
