9708148 Latanision Past effort on understanding the structure and dynamics of
interfacial processes in underfilm corrosion has resulted in non-destructive
electrochemical techniques to monitor underfilm corrosion. Most of the data
reported in the current literature have been generated by the technique of
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). These data suggest that: (1)
corrosion initiates well before it can be detected optically; (2) delamination
results from either a loss of adhesion or corrosion at the polymer-metal
interface; and (3) delamination and corrosion rate can only be estimated by EIS.
In order to achieve a better understanding of underfilm degradation, it is
imperative that the correlation between electrochemistry, loss of metal, and
delamination rate is fully understood. While a correlation between
electrochemistry and corrosion rate is well established for non-coated samples,
no accurate measurement of mass loss beneath a polymer coating has been
achieved. This FRG (Focussed Research Group) project circumvents the problems
associated with determining the change in mass of a coated substrate by
following the change in the magnetic saturation of a polymer-coated
ferromagnetic sample. Mass loss is assessed with a vibrating sample magnetometer
(VSM), which provides an unambiguous method for determining the corrosion rate
of a coated sample. In addition, the sample is monitored visually and with EIS.
When correlated to visual and electrochemical data, these results should provide
significant insight into the evaluation of underfilm corrosion and assessment of
coating performance. The current research should also be able to distinguish
between delamination resulting from loss of adhesion or from corrosion. During
an experiment, if no metal loss is recorded on the VSM but delamination is
visually and electrochemically detected, it can not be associated with
corrosion. In this FRG project emphasis is also placed on the development of an
in-situ/real-time electrochemical technique (Fast Transient Technique, FTT) to
monitor solute uptake and the initial stage of coating degradation. The grant is
co-funded by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and the Division of
Materials Research. %%% This project is expected to lead to an improved
understanding of both the reliability of protective organic coatings and the use
of electrochemical techniques (EIS and FTT), thereby providing a basis for the
selection of the most suitable commercially available protective coatings. ***
