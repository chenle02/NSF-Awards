9423943 Dershem The REU program at Hope College is designed to provide talented
undergraduates with a meaningful research experience that will encourage them to
consider in computer science research. The goal is to expose the students to the
techniques, attitudes, and rewards of computer science research and to provide
encouragement and direction in the pursuit of such a career. Women and minority
students will be strongly recruited. Six participants will be selected each
year, three from Hope College and three from other institutions. Those students
will work for ten weeks during the summer in close collaboration with a Hope
faculty mentor. Students will have the opportunity to use the Hope College
Computer Science SUN SPARCstation network as well as the INMOS transputers.
Areas of research include parallel algorithms, system development environments,
data communications, voice recognition, graphics algorithms, algorithm
animation, and programming language comparisons. The students will perform
independent research, give oral presentations on their work, attend workshops on
graduate school, prepare scientific papers, and present their work at seminars
at their home institutions. ***
