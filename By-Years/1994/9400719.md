This project focuses on three important problem areas high performance
parallel/distributed computing: 1) designing, analyzing, implementing and
testing several groups of structured methods for solutions of large sparse
nonlinear systems of equations on parallel and systems; 2) applying numerical
algorithms to solve large real-world problems; and 3) studying execution
patterns of scientific application programs for effective parallel program and
architecture design.
