The goal of this research is to develop and test methods for inferring particle
energy input to the earth's atmosphere using optical and radar detection
systems, and to study the atmospheric changes caused by these fluxes. The PI
will use the latest prognostic and climatological models of upper atmosphere
density and composition. Auroral model results will be made available to the
aeronomy community.
