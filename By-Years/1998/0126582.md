Mathematical Sciences (21)

This project is addressing national and statewide needs to improve the
mathematics skills of undergraduate students, particularly for 'at risk' members
of 'special populations'. The project goal is to increase the retention and
successful completion rates of community college algebra students by developing
a collaborative, research-based approach to the improvement of teaching and
learning mathematics. Project partners, Mesa, American River and West Valley
Colleges are supported by both professional state mathematical organizations and
the Center for Student Success.

Project objectives include adapting, pilot testing and evaluating three
recommended approaches to increasing student success: 1) adapting/refining a
specialized mathematics study skills course developed at Manatee and Valencia
Community Colleges in Florida; 2) adapting/refining a teacher specific peer
tutoring approach, Beacon; and 3) supplementing the course with computer-aided
instruction using ALEKS.

This project is designed to adapt, implement, investigate and determine which of
these strategies are effective with specific groups of 'at risk' community
college students. Project objectives also include the development of a virtual
resource center, regular partner meetings and a summer institute that is
facilitating contact, communication and exchange of information among
mathematics faculty members. The Project Resource Center is also being used as a
clearinghouse for information regarding current research, available curriculum,
instructional resources, and best practices for teaching Elementary Algebra.
Project-produced educational materials, evaluation instruments, pilot test
results and lessons learned are being disseminated.
