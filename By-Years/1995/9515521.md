9515521 Wong This is a 24 month award proposed by Dr. George Wong, Old Dominion
University and Professor Kon-Kee Liu, Taiwan National University. This proposal
requests supplemental funds for travel to Taiwan to work with Taiwan
oceanographers to collect samples to determine iodine concentrations and their
relationship with the dynamics of the nitrogen system in the East China Sea. The
Taiwan National Science Council is providing the ship support. The primary
research support for Dr. Wong is from a grant from the Chemical Oceanography
Program (OCE-9301298), which provides the cost for laboratory analyses. The East
China Sea is a region with little hydrographic and process- oriented data. His
study may provide important data to address the question of why total iodine
behaves conservatively in the South Atlantic Bight but non- conservatively in
the southeast China Sea and whether iodine can be used as a tracer to understand
the mixing process in the East China Sea. The project is jointly supported by
the Taiwan National Science Council and the NSF.
