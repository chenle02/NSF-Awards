The award is to fund a detector array and controller upgrade for SpeX, a medium
resolution spectrograph commissioned on the InfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF)
in 2000. This upgrade to the instrument will enable this unique instrument to
continue having a productive life. It will improve the sensitivity of the
instrument as well give broader simultaneous wavelength coverage. All observing
programs will benefit from this upgrade, in particular the observations of Near
Earth Objects as well as ultracool brown dwarfs and high red-shift quasars.
