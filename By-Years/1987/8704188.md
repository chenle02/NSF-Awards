This award will allow the PI to do five months of ethnographic fieldwork in
Western Nigeria. She will interview small-holder farmers to analyze the effects
of technical changes in farming and social changes in the organization of work
in this African rural economy, which has been exposed to rapid and dramatic
increases in the demand for goods. Due to the oil boom and subsequent collapse,
this part of Nigeria has experienced increased rates of urbanization and food
price inflation during the past 15 years. Economic change in the hinterland of
cities has caused changes in family farms. This project will document farm
organization in small-holder and larger scale farms with special attention to
the use of labor, the gender division of labor, and the relations between small
farms and large farms. The current situation will be compared with the situation
20 years ago, when the PI did a baseline study of small-holder farms. This
research is important because African small-holder farmers are seen by most
development theorists as the major current economic problem facing the
continent. Increased understanding of how small farms function, and specifically
how they relate to the newer, larger farms, and how they have withstood the boom
and bust cycles that the region experienced in the previous 20 years, will be
valuable to theorists and policy makers alike.
