Abstract:

The area of analysis called geometric measure theory (GMT) was formally
introduced in the nineteen sixties, when the book ``Geometric Measure Theory''
by H. Federer was published. Since the beginning of the century a large amount
of relevant work had been done in this area by many authors including
Besicovitch, Carath\'eodory, De Giorgi, Federer himself, Fleming, Marstrand,
Morrey, Reifenberg, and Whitney. However it was only when Federer's book was
published that it became clear how all these results fit naturally together as a
cohesive subject. Unfortunately since its introduction the subject has been
perceived as somewhat mysterious and inaccessible. In this proposal the
investigator exploits one of the outstanding features of the field, its
versatility. The PI intends to apply techniques of GMT to study free boundary
regularity problems, to answer questions regarding the existence of good
parameterizations for certain metric spaces and to classify sets supporting
``Lebesgue-type'' measures.



Free boundary problems arise naturally in physics and engineering. The free
boundary may appear as the interface between a fluid and the air, or water and
ice. In the filtration problem, which studies how water filtrates from a dam
made of a porous medium (say earth), the free boundary separates the wet part
from the dry part. The problem of characterizing the regularity of the free
boundary has been studied by many authors, among others Alt, Caffarelli and
Friedman. In this proposal the investigator addresses this question under very
weak free boundary assumptions. By relaxing the regularity hypothesis a broader
spectrum of physical problems can be covered. The investigator also proposes to
study the structure of sets supporting measures that behave like Lesbegue
measure on an affine space. In the context of weak notions of regularity, these
sets play the role of tangent planes. In particular the problem of classifying
these sets is of primary importance. The ideas discussed here belong to a larger
project that intends to establish that weak notions of regularity are for many
purposes sufficient to answer basic questions in analysis and geometry.
