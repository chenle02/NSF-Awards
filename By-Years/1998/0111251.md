In this proposal funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, David Nesbitt of the University of Colorado will pursue a
program of research on the spectroscopy and dynamics of chemical transients
using state-resolved techniques. The project will examine the spectroscopy of
transient species, quantum state-selected reaction dynamics, and the development
and exploitation of new methods to interrogate jet-cooled transient species.
Jet-cooled radicals, molecular ions, and molecular ion clusters will be
investigated in slit supersonic discharges using direct absorption infrared
laser methods. High sensitivity overtone spectroscopy of clusters and reaction
dynamics with aligned or oriented reagents will be studied using IR-UV-UV triple
resonance methods. The ultrasensitive visible absorption spectroscopy of jet-
cooled chemical transients will be examined using novel optical heterodyne/high
finesse cavity methods combined with slit discharge sources.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program focuses on short-lived molecules and
ions that are created under extremely energetic conditions, and thus they
usually are not found in nature in stable forms. Besides being of fundamental
interest, these studies have practical relevance to solving problems in
combustion and atmospheric chemistry as well as in astrophysical
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;
