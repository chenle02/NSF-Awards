This award provides renewed support for the Natural Hazards Research and
Applications Information Center. The Center's basic function is to serve as a
bridge between the hazards research and practitioner communities in the United
States. The Center monitors and disseminates hazards research information to
multiple users: administrators, practitioners, policy makers, engineers, and
scientists. The Center publishes and distributes the Natural Hazards Observer to
over 13,300 subscribers six times a year; operates an electronic newsletter,
Disaster Research; and disseminates information via the World Wide Web and
traditional hard copy publications. It holds an annual workshop involving users
and producers of hazards research, and it provides information on a day-to-day
basis in response to inquiries. The Center conducts research activities relating
to societal response to natural hazards and it supports researchers throughout
the nation as they carry out `quick response` studies of specific hazard events.
In addition to NSF, other agencies providing support for this activity include
FEMA, USGS, USDA, NOAA, DOT, and the Corps of Engineers.
