Chemistry (12) The Chemistry Department at the University of South Dakota is
increasing the expertise of its students in NMR theory and application by
increasing their exposure to the technique, and by integrating the subject into
courses across the curriculum. To this end, use of a 200 MHz, multi-nuclear FT-
NMR is being integrated into the curriculum. By improving student training and
providing accessibility to the instrument, more students are able to include NMR
among the repertory of techniques that they feel confident in applying in their
undergraduate research projects. A series of summer workshops for faculty
training is being held in order to optimize integration of the subject across
the sub-disciplines of chemistry and in order to facilitate dissemination of
capabilities to regional universities. Adaptation and implementation of similar
curricular improvements and specific experiments cited in the literature,
primarily in the Journal of Chemical Education, within the framework of the
objectives we have defined is allowing us to achieve our goal of improving
undergraduate education in chemistry at the University of South Dakota. The
broader impact of this project is greatest for the integration of education and
research. Students are developing a new set of skills in their course work which
they are applying to their research.
