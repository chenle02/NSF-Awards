9722459 Biesboer This U.S.-Brazil award will support a research collaboration
between Dr. David D. Biesboer of the University of Minnesota and Dr. Francisco
Estevez of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil on the study of
sustainable development and nitrogen cycling in of Lagoa Imboacica, Rio de
Janeiro State, Brazil. This research project will involve the study of basic
aspects of nitrogen cycling and nutrient uptake by aquatic macrophytes in the
tropical lagoons of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. The goal is to determine the
effectiveness of five floating and emergent aquatic plant species to remove
excess nutrients and improve the quality of residential wastewater flowing into
the tropical lagoon, Lagoa Imboacica. After the successful completion of this
study, the PIs will use the resultant information in the creation of a model
aquatic plant wastewater treatment facility that will reduce the environmental
degradation of this lagoon. The information gathered from this project will
serve to increase our understanding of nitrogen cycling in tropical lagoons and
provide experience in artificial wetland design. ***
