The award supports an American research team from North Dakota State University
and senior American scholars to participate in the international conference
"XIII Nordic Theoretical Archaeology Group" (Nordic-TAG) to be held in
Reykjavik, Iceland on April 21-25, 2013. Participation in the conference aims to
(1) increase international dialogue and collaboration with regards to the
archaeological resources of the Arctic region; (2) hold a symposium on the
heritage of science and technology in the Arctic; (3) provide learning and
professionalization opportunities for members of the PI's North Dakota State
University (NDSU) research team; and (4) bring leading American scholars Lynn
Meskell and Charles Orser as honored speakers for the conference. Participation
in this year's conference is timely because it represents the first time Nordic-
TAG will be held outside Scandinavia, to better incorporate the Nordic
communities of the North Atlantic and its neighbors, including the United
States. American scholars who are leaders in the field of archaeology will lend
strong US representation. Further, the symposium supported in part by this
award, "The Heritage of Science and Technology in the Arctic," directly
addresses the history of scientific exploration and international cooperation in
the Arctic that continues to this day across many scientific disciplines,
including archaeology.
