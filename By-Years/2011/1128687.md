The PI requests partial support for the 3rd International Conference of Acoustic
Communications by Animals. This meeting will take place at Cornell University in
Ithaca, New York, August 2-5, 2011. The emphasis of this conference is the
integration of information across animal taxa, and the enabling of exchanges
between young investigators and more established investigators in the field.
They will consider acoustic communication, its mechanisms, and the detection of
acoustic signals, particularly in noisy backgrounds. At the same time, they will
examine communication within the context of how it develops, how it evolved, and
its neuro-ethological basis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will advance the field of animal
bioacoustics. The information, knowledge and results of the meeting in the form
of a program booklet containing the extended abstract will be distributed at the
meeting and will be placed on the conference web site.
