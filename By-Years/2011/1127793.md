The proposed AIR project will allow construction of a prototype of a new scaled-
up device for continuous fabrication of nanofibers, as well as to investigate
and model the fiber formation processes in the device, including hydrodynamic
liquid jet deformation, phase separation, polymer precipitation and fiber
deformation. The proposed work would also allow efficient and reliable control
of the diameter, length and aspect ratios of nanorods and nanofibers in the
scaled-up process; and will be performed in collaboration between the North
Carolina State team and Xanofi, a new small spin-off company.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work would make possible the transition from
an innovative technique into a breakthrough technology that can profoundly
change the emerging market of nanomaterials. The scaled-up technology developed
in this proposal could bolster the $100 million market for nanofibers. The
envisioned applications of these nanofibers in energy-efficient filters and
solid-state lighting would help develop a new generation of greener industrial
and consumer products. The commercial development of this platform technology
would bolster the economy of North Carolina through job creation in partnerships
with local and national companies. The plans for educational outreach include
internships for community college students at NORTH Carolina State and Xanofi,
and demonstrations of nanomaterial fabrication in local high schools.
