The objective of this award is to establish methodologies for error prediction
and control of geometric shapes associated with a wide range of additive
manufacturing (AM) processes. The ultimate goal is to overcome a major barrier
of direct digital manufacturing: inadequate dimensional accuracy in current AM
processes. The proposed research strategy is to establish a methodological
framework for system-level, smart, and high precision shape error compensation
and control. The research plan consists of four research tasks: (1) modeling and
prediction of profile deviations for complex shapes; (2) efficient experimental
designs and analysis strategies for modeling profile deviations; (3) optimal
compensation and smart shape-to-shape control of profile deviations, and (4)
experimental investigation and validation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Successful
completion of the project is expected to significantly improve the geometric
accuracy of AM-built products. The research will produce new knowledge regarding
system-level or universal geometric shape accuracy control methodologies to
reduce duplicated efforts for wider and quicker adoption of AM technologies, and
high-precision and smart shape-to-shape compensation methodologies to avoid
post-processing and extensive process calibration efforts prior to production.
The research outcomes including patents will facilitate wider and quicker
adoption of AM technology, spurring manufacturing innovations and job creation.
The research project will provide new curriculum on AM technology and
manufacturing education. Inter-university workshops and video conferences
involving faculty and graduate students have been and will continue to be
organized for synergistic collaborations.
