In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Gerald B. Hammond of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Louisville will investigate fluorine-gold activation processes
that can mediate tandem sequences leading to novel metal-mediated nucleophilic
addition/coupling/fluorination reactions, which, in turn, should lead to
efficient synthesis of organofluoro compounds. Even though fluorine has a unique
ability to modify the physico-chemical properties of a compound, its
introduction on small molecules is usually cumbersome. Indeed, the syntheses of
fluorinated aliphatic and cyclic systems require tedious reagents or synthetic
procedures that rely on a small pool of commercial fluorine-containing building
blocks. The mechanism-based approach of this research will enable the synthesis
of aliphatic organofluoro compounds, such as fluoroketones and
fluoroheterocycles in a medicinal chemistry-friendly manner, utilizing cationic
metal species capable of metal-mediated fluorinations, oxidations or couplings,
and readily available alkynes or alkenes as starting materials. Ultimately, the
work proposed on fluorine-engendered cationic species will yield substantial
insights on the interaction of fluorine and transition metals.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project is that its well-
defined modules are suitable for training a younger generation of students and
postdoctoral fellows in organofluorine chemistry, a research area that is
performed by a handful of scientists in the U.S., compared to other
industrialized nations, despite the ever-increasing importance of fluorine in
the medicinal or agrochemical fields. This project will impact the manufacturing
field broadly defined because it will give ready access to fluorinated compounds
in a diversified manner and with fewer synthetic steps.
