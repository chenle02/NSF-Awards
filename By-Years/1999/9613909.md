This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial
support for a DS-3 ATM connection to the Very High Performance Backbone Network
Service (vBNS) for the research institutions in the State of Ohio for two years.
It also upgrades an existing OC-3 network between these institutions to OC-12.
Among the applications are PhAROh Meta Center Regional Alliance projects, polar-
global atmospheric interaction studies, Regional Training Center for Parallel
Processing activities, and ATM testbed research. Collaborating sites could
include the Cornell Theory Center, National Center for Atmospheric Research and
North Carolina State University.
