A capillary gas chromatograph (GC) is being widely used in a number of courses.
The use of this instrument is allowing a number of the laboratories to be more
educational and informative for the students, and is making it possible to
introduce a number of new experiments into organic chemistry, instrumental
analysis, inorganic chemistry, physical science, and several upper-level
chemistry courses. New experiments are being added to the physical science
courses in an effort to introduce the non-science major to the gas
chromatograph, one of the most widely used pieces of scientific equipment.
Several of the undergraduate research groups also are benefiting from having a
capillary GC available. The capillary GC also is used by nearby Coastal Georgia
Community College's students as part of a program in which they make use of the
instrumentation at Armstrong for analyzing their laboratory samples. An
additional use of the instrument is in Armstrong's Community Outreach Program in
which a large number of high school and middle school students visit Armstrong
and carry out laboratory experiments. *
