This award supports the study of the response spectrum of the Avalanche
Breakdown (AB) detector, and its high detection sensitivity in the far infrared.
Recently, response has been measured for very low powers at a wavelength of 151
microns. This approaches the ultimate quantum detectivity limit. The detector
element is n-type germanium maintained unconventionally at a bias current above
the point of impact ionization. Under these conditions, the signal current is
found to be proportional to the square rood of the incident power. Although
several mechanisms have been suggested to explain this unusual behavior, none
has yet proven satisfactory. The Free Electron Laser (FEL) at University of
California, Santa Barbara, will be used to measure the detector's response
spectrum over a wide range in the far infrared. These studies will provide the
theoretical framework necessary for further work as well as more complete
experimental results.
