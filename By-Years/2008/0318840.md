This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
evaluate the use of Brassica juncea as a low cost source of human therapeutic
proteins. The proposed research would utilize a newly developed floral
transformation method to introduce the gene encoding human alpha-interferon,
together with a regulated plant promoter and an optimized translation initiation
sequence for high level expression in Brassica juncea. Floral transformation
produces large numbers (25%) of transgenic Brassica seedlings within 3 weeks.
Transformed plants will be selected by herbicide resistance and expression of
interferon after induction of the promoter measured by immunoblotting. The
anticipated outcome of this project will be a well regulated, high level
expression system for a rapidly growing, inexpensive, hydroponically cultivated
crop plant as a source of therapeutically valuable proteins.

The commercial application of this project will be the low cost manufacture of
human therapeutics using plant biotechnology.
