Abstract ATM-9629702 Clayson, Carol Anne Purdue University Title: An Integrated
Approach for Examining the Large -Scale Interactions Between the Atmosphere and
Oceans on Intraseasonal Time Scales This is a three year project to investigate
the ocean-atmosphere interaction occurring within the TOGA COARE (TC) domain and
its ramifications for the entire Pacific basin, by an integrated approach
utilizing data, models and theory. Thus this topic in not only highly relevant
to TC objectives but also central to climate understanding and prediction. The
specific goals to be achieved are 1) Assembly of atmospheric, oceanic and
surface flux data sets and conduct diagnostic studies to do detailed budget
studies. 2) conduct ocean modeling studies of the response to different types
and scales of surface forcing especially during westerly wind bursts. 3)Analyze
the wave structure of the coupled atmosphere-ocean system by using the large
scale data of the ocean and the atmosphere obtained during TOGA COARE IOP.
