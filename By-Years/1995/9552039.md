This project funds the development of an x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy
laboratory in the Department of Geology. Improvement of the analytical
geochemistry laboratory is the next logical step in development of the
department's instructional and undergraduate research program. The new equipment
consists of a Rigaku RIX-2000 wavelength dispersive sequential XRF spectrometer
and associated sample preparation equipment to support complete whole-rock,
major-element, and trace-element analysis of the full range of geological
samples. The acquisition of this instrumentation allows full implementation of a
new geology curriculum that is aimed at improving the undergraduate students
preparation for entry both into the work force and graduate school. The new
curriculum involves reworking the mineralogy/petrology sequence of courses,
significant modernization of the sedimentation and stratigraphy curriculum,
updating of courses throughout the program, and the addition of a capstone
experience that will include a collaborative research project for the majority
of students. The XRF is used directly for instruction in one introductory
course, four upper-division courses, and an interdisciplinary course for
chemistry majors and significantly enhances opportunities for interdisciplinary
teaching and research.
