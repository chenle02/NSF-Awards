Lufkin 9514642 The part of the mammalian central nervous system called the
brainstem is formed embryologically from two regions called the mesencephalon
and the rhombencephalon. The rhombencephalon, or hindbrain, is the brainstem
region through which motor and sensory information for the facial region is
conveyed. Brain development is directed in part by an important group of genes
called homeobox, or Hox, genes. Nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms
which regulate the neurogenic Hoxa-1 and Hoxa-2 genes, which show highly dynamic
spatio-temporal patterns of expression during development. This project uses
biochemical approaches with transgenic mice to locate and characterize the DNA
regulatory elements (promoters and enhancers) that direct Hoxa-1 and Hoxa-2 gene
expression. This work provides important information that will further our basic
understanding of how Hox genes control the complex pattern of neural
development, and the results will have an impact beyond neuroscience to genetics
and developmental biology in general.
