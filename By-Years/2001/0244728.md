The proposed research involves group research in Elementary Particle Theory and
Cosmology. The PI's propose to investigate the experimental consequences of
gravity becoming important at the TeV scale as a result of large extra
dimensions. The PI's intend to investigate various possibilities for physics
beyond the Standard Model. An extra-dimensional approach to the cosmological
constant problem will be investigated. The new geometries that occur when one
studies string vacua when flux is present will be explored. String theory
cosmology and the problem of spacelike singularities in string theory will be
studied. An attempt will be made to construct realistic inflationary models and
a theory of dark energy in the context of supergravity, string theory and
M-theory. Observational consequences of these models will be investigated. An
attempt will be made to develop nonperturbative approaches to string theory that
will allow one to understand cosmological singularities such as the Big Bang.
The PI's intend to investigate supersymmetric Grand Unified Theories that arise
from string theory and M theory compactifications using flux stabilization
techniques. The PI's will attempt to understand how string theory can
accommodate the observed acceleration of the universe. The PI's also intend to
find realistic theories of electroweak symmetry breaking and physics beyond the
standard model.
