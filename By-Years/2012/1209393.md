This action funds Eric Lee King of The University of Georgia to conduct a
research project, entitled "Methane dynamics in Taiwanese mud volcanoes," during
the summer of 2012 at the National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan. The host
scientist is Dr. Li-Hung Lin.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to elucidate emissions of
methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from terrestrial mud volcanoes. Data indicates
the possibility for terrestrial mud volcanoes to have a different mechanism, and
therefore different environmental controls, for methane oxidation than their
more common marine counterparts.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
