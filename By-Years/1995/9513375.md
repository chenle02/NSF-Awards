This award supports Professor Doraiswamy Ramachandran of California State
University at Sacramento to collaborate in mathematics research with Professor
Ludger Rueschendorf of the Institute of Mathematical Stochastics of the
University of Freiburg, Germany. Together they will pursue the connections
between perfect probabilities and duality, develop new duality theory under
marginal inequality constraints and derive stochastic and economic applications
of the new theory. Their joint research in this area will benefit from Dr.
Ramachandran's expertise in perfect probability spaces and Dr. Rueschendorf's
complementary expertise in stochastic optimization. This research focuses on
some very fundamental aspects of measure theory and probability, while holding
the possibility of a variety of practical applications in fields such as
mathematical economics, mass transportation and more theoretical areas such as
duality theory. Despite the long and fruitful history of work in this field by
others, the ideal complementarity of expertise and the track record of these two
collaborators suggests that significant new insights may result from their joint
effort.
