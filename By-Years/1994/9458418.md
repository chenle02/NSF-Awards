9458418 Bettison-Varga Three tightly constrained research projects will include:
1) characterization of phyllosilicates from the Middle Valley, Juan de Fuca
Ridge hydrothermal system to evaluate porosity/permeability controls on their
formation; 2) Pb and S isotope characterization of epidosites and surrounding
rocks from the Troodos ophiolite, Cyprus to delineate fluid pathways that
produced massive sulfide deposits and evaluate isotopic heterogeneity of the
lithosphere; and 3) petrographic and geochemical study of volcanics in the Black
Mountains, Arizona to determine the relationships between detachment faulting
and volcanism. Significant undergraduate teaching will be incorporated in the
career development plan, both in introductory and advanced level courses.
