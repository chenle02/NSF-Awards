This research effort involves synthesis, processing and characterization of
nickel-base nanophase alloys, including pure Ni, Ni-base alloys, Ni with
dispersed oxides, Ni/Al intermetallic compounds, NiO, and Ni/NiO composites. An
ultrahigh vacuum synthesis system is used for production of metallic,
intermetallic and oxide dispersion-strengthened precursor powder particles under
controlled conditions. A second system is used for the NiO and Ni/NiO
composites. Compaction and densification are effected without exposing the
specimens to ambient conditions. The emphasis is on synthesis and processing and
characterization of microstructure. Property measurements are used for guidance
in the control of processing variables. %%% This research is aimed at new and
improved metal-based materials using unique processing techniques. It is
expected that such materials could see use in devices where high mechanical
performance is essential.
