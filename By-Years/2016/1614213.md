The team will use the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to inventory the
cold gas in the universe. Recent technical upgrades to this NSF facility paved
the way for this important inventory. The team will study how galaxies form
stars in the cold gas. They will also test models for how galaxies change as
they age. Senior team members will train junior team members. Undergraduates
from underrepresented groups will be involved in the research. The team will
engage with underserved youth in counties near Ithaca, New York. Podcasts will
be developed to disseminate the research to the public.

The team will use the VLA's superb sensitivity and wavelength coverage to
investigate the volume density of molecular gas in the universe. Their goals are
to (1) conduct the first census of the cold gas history of the universe; (2)
determine what drives the evolution of the volume density of cosmic star
formation; and (3) compare the data to models for galaxy evolution.
