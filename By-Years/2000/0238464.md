Melina Elisabeth Hale&lt;br/&gt;Proposal number:
0238464&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: CAREER: Reticulospinal control of
alternative startle behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad question this
research addresses is: How do nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord control
movement? The aim of this research is to determine the nervous system's control
of a little-studied startle behavior called the S-start and to compare it to the
model startle behavior. Experiments are conducted on larval zebrafish because
they are transparent, making it possible to look into the brain and spinal cord
in the live, intact animal. With combined fluorescence microscopy and high-speed
video analysis, the activity of nerve cells and movement pattern of the animal
will be viewed simultaneously to determine in which behaviors specific nerve
cells function. Individual cells will also be removed from the brain or spinal
cord to test their roles in behavior. Data on behavior suggests that the two
types of startle behavior will be controlled by different sets of nerve cells.
However, because the two behaviors are under the same adaptive constraints--they
need to be fast and reliable to prevent the escaping fish from being captured or
injured by a predator--organizing principles of their nervous control will be
similar. By determining how alternative types of startle behaviors are
controlled by the nervous system, this research provides a foundation of
information on this evolutionarily important behavior. This work has several
educational goals. At the undergraduate level, this program brings cutting-edge
technology into the classroom and students into the research laboratory. At the
middle-school level, this program will examine issues of how animals move with
minority girls from communities on the south side of Chicago. By illustrating
movement control through the biology of familiar conditions, such as spinal-cord
injury and stroke, a specific goal is to empower students to learn about their
bodies and conditions that affect their lives. &lt;br/&gt;
