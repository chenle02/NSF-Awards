This award provides funding for the support of student travel to the Winter
Simulation Conference 2012, Berlin, Germany, 9-12 December 2012. Specifically,
the students will be attending the PhD Colloquium (workshop) followed by the
technical conference. The abstracts of the students' work will be published in
the WSC2012 proceeding, which has wide distribution. The WSC PhD colloquia have
been highly successful in providing a forum for the initial socialization into
the field of young doctoral scholars; many of today's leading simulation
researchers participated as students in earlier
colloquia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This travel grant will encourage the interaction
of the US emerging scholars with their counterparts and senior researchers from
Europe and elsewhere, increasing the international awareness of the
participating US students. The PIs will work with the conference organizers to
identify and include the broadest possible group of highly qualified PhD
students, especially those coming from under-represented groups.
