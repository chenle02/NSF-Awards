9622287 Beaman The traditional Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) solid freeform
fabrication technology is based on only one powder in the sintering process.
This award funds a collaborative industry/university research project to develop
a multi-material SLS which can fabricate parts composed of multiple materials.
The research project consists of (1) design and development of a multi-material
selective laser sintering machine capable of fabricating components containing
material gradients; and (2) fabrication and testing of high stiffness-to-density
ration components possessing shape optimization and metal-ceramic components
possessing blended interfaces. The ultimate goal is to develop a prototype
machine for further understanding of the physical principles of powder delivery
for multi-materials based SLS. The technique has the potential to allow the
creation of many unique components containing improved stiffness-to-density
ratios or the creation of complex metal-ceramic components. The benefits of this
technology include greatly reduced fabrication time and cost, and the capability
to achieve in making multi-materials component in one operation. The project
will be in partnership with industry to identify quantifiable requirements for
implementation.
