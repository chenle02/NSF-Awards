Abstract

Award: DMS-0432603 Principal Investigator: Andreas R. Blass, Edward Griffor

A series of three yearly meetings will bring together U.S., Russian, and other
logicians and set theorists to present progress and new problems connecting
logic to several other areas of mathematics. The first meeting, in 2004,
concerns Logic, Algebra and Geometry; the second, in 2005, addresses
Computability and Models of Arithmetic; and the 2006 session will be on The
Modern Impact of Set Theory.

Logic and set theory concern mathematical investigations of the most fundamental
notions of mathematics, such as: What are the rules of inference? What are the
objects to which we apply them? How does changing this axiomatic background
alter the resulting conclusions? Theories that result from systematic
investigation of these concerns near the roots of mathematics can have
applications much farther up the developmental ladder, for example by providing
estimates of the number of solutions to a system of algebraic equations or by
developing a notion of complexity that can show that different dynamical systems
are similar or genuinely distinct. Each of these meetings will be held in
Russia, at the Euler International Mathematical Institute of the Steklov
Mathematical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg.
This is a joint award of the Office of International Science and Engineering's
Central and Eastern Europe Program and the Division of Mathematical Sciences
program in Foundations.
