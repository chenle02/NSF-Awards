Experimentally and analytically investigate the residual strength of offshore
steel platform members damaged by impact, develop and assess repair techniques
using expansive grout. Experimental assessment of composite (grout and steel)
offshore components for fatigue, ultimate strength, and response to seismic
cyclic loading. Develop improved numerical methods for complex stochastic and
deterministic offshore platform analysis.
