From activities as simple as scheduling a meeting to those as complex as
balancing a national budget, people take stances in negotiations and decision
making. While the related areas of subjectivity and sentiment analysis have
received significant attention, work has focused almost exclusively on text,
whereas much stance-taking activity is carried out verbally. Early experiments
suggest that people alter their speaking style when engaged in stance-taking,
and listeners can much more readily detect negative attitudes by listening to
the original speech than by reading transcripts. However, due to the diversity
of factors that influence speech production, from individual differences to
social context, isolating the signals of stance-taking in speech for automatic
recognition presents substantial challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Early
Grant for Exploratory Research project represents a focused exploration of
spoken interactions to provide a characterization of linguistic factors
associated with stance-taking and develop computational methods that exploit
these features to automatically detect stance-taking behavior. Robust linguistic
markers of stance-taking are identified through analysis of both controlled
elicitations and archived recordings of Congressional hearings on the financial
crisis. The former allow experimental comparisons to highlight sometimes subtle
contrasts, while the latter enable validation and extension of those findings in
real-world, high-stakes discussions. The analysis includes novel acoustic-
phonetic measures of dynamic patterns in speech, such as vowel space scaling and
pitch/energy velocity, with sophisticated visualization techniques developed to
support feature exploration. Findings are validated via stance recognition
experiments combining acoustic and lexical cues, which lay the foundation for
automatic tracking of trends and shifts in attitudes.
