This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
demonstrate the feasibility of a miniaturized MEMS-based, reagent-less
biological agent detector, capable of performing rapid assays for tens (or even
hundreds) of analytes simultaneously, for detection of whole bacteria (or
spores) with single bacteria/spore resolution. National defense against
biological warfare agents and naturally occurring pathogens, such as drug
resistant tuberculosis or food and water contaminates, requires low cost,
robust, and easy to use technologies for rapid detection and identification of
biological agents. Rapid detection is needed to provide early warning to
minimize the numbers of exposed personnel, and to provide timely and effective
medical treatment of those exposed. Current identification technologies depend
on time-consuming amplification, which also adds appreciably to the cost,
complexity, power requirements and size of the detector as it must perform
multiple sample treatment steps and provide the necessary reagents. In this
Phase I Project, Boston MicroSystems, with the assistance of the US Naval
Research Laboratory, will quantify the performance of the proposed biological
agent detector by fabricating prototype single channel detectors, immobilizing
antibodies for bacillus globigii onto the detectors, expose them to samples of
bacillus globigii, and quantify the response and detection limits.

The prinicipal commercial application of this project is in homeland defense.
However, the proposed biological agent detector may have significant additional
applications in the areas of medical diagnostics, agribusiness, and
environmental monitoring.
