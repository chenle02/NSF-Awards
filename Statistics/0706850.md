Although research in the last decade has brought in general awareness of the
seriousness of statistical uncertainty due to model selection, much more effort
is needed to reform the currently still dominating practice of basing all
statistical conclusions on a final selected model. From a methodological
standpoint, a critical component missing in the toolbox of model selection and
model combination is model selection diagnostics (not model diagnostics). The PI
seeks model selection diagnosis methods that go beyond simple bootstrap
uncertainty measures. They will address the uncertainty in variable selection
and in estimation of a quantity of interest via means that take into account the
distances between subsets of variables or between estimates from the candidate
models. For high-dimensional or complex data, it is very likely that different
candidate procedures perform the best in different regions, especially when very
distinct learning methods are considered. This calls for localized model
selection/combination methodology and theory, which is the second major
component of this project. The PI takes new approaches and derives oracle
inequalities on performance of the new methods for localized model selection or
combination.

Statistical methods have become an essential ingredient in all applied sciences.
Proper quantifications of the true uncertainty in mathematical descriptions of
the natural and social phenomena are fundamentally important to draw unbiased
and accurate conclusions. Since model selection and model combination play a
central role in statistical analysis, the proposed work on accurately measuring
model selection uncertainty and the resulting better tools for model selection
and model combination, together with other researches in the area, are expected
to contribute substantially to changing the currently unsound practices of
statistical model selection in applied sciences. The improved use of data in
information extraction will have broader impacts in scientific research, policy
and decision making.
