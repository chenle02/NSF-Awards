0420669&lt;br/&gt;Kurtis Micou&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity will establish a
laboratory at Cooper Union to be used by faculty and students in all engineering
disciplines for cell and tissue based biomedical engineering research. The
requested equipment includes a microscope upgrade (objectives and a temperature
controlled stage), imaging system (CCD camers, computers and software for image
acquisition and analysis), tissue culture equipment (incubator and stereo
microscope), microtome, set of pipetman, -80 freezer for cryostorage.
