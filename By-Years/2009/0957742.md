Recent studies have demonstrated the powerful abilities of deep
&lt;br/&gt;architectures for statistical pattern recognition. Deep
&lt;br/&gt;architectures transform their inputs through multiple layers of
&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear processing. Inspired by the connectivity of biological
&lt;br/&gt;neural networks, the hidden layers of deep architectures encode
&lt;br/&gt;hierarchical, distributed representations of complex sensory input.
&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical results suggest that such representations are needed to
&lt;br/&gt;solve the most difficult problems of artificial
intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous applications of deep architectures
include visual object &lt;br/&gt;recognition, statistical language modeling, and
nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;dimensionality reduction. Building on these successes, this
project &lt;br/&gt;develops new applications of deep architectures for problems
in &lt;br/&gt;speech and audio processing. Current front ends for these problems
&lt;br/&gt;are dominated by traditional methods in statistical modeling and
&lt;br/&gt;signal processing. Deep architectures have the potential to
&lt;br/&gt;overcome many limitations of current
approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has two research components with
interrelated and &lt;br/&gt;overlapping goals. The project's first component
explores &lt;br/&gt;unsupervised learning in convolutional neural networks.
&lt;br/&gt;The goal of learning in these networks is to discover new
&lt;br/&gt;features for audio event detection and automatic speech
&lt;br/&gt;recognition. The project's second component investigates
&lt;br/&gt;the possibility of deep learning in kernel machines. &lt;br/&gt;This
possibility is suggested by a recently discovered family &lt;br/&gt;of kernel
functions that mimic the computation in large, &lt;br/&gt;multilayer
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's research components are tightly
integrated with &lt;br/&gt;its educational activities. The project supports two
graduate &lt;br/&gt;students, including one female student. An important goal
&lt;br/&gt;is to develop publicly available software for use by other
&lt;br/&gt;researchers.
