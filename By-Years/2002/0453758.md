ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summit Greenland is a site of expanding scientific
interest by both U.S. and European scientists. Current U.S. projects are
evaluating ice-core characteristics related to environmental change, are
investigating upper and middle atmosphere phenomena as a basis for understanding
the global system, are evaluating atmospheric conditions in the troposphere and
in the boundary layer contacting the Greenland permanent ice sheet, and are
establishing the radiation, energy, and water balances which occur on the ice-
pack. To better coordinate the disparate communities using this environmental
observatory, a Science Coordination Office will be established. Its goals are
to: 1) coordinate measurements between investigators and the sharing of
facilities and personnel on-site, 2) provide scientific requirements to NSF,
it's support contractor and European partners as the facility is developed, 3)
stimulate sharing of data among science
projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
