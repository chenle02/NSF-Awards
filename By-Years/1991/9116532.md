In this experimental research an induced backflow will be utilized to control
turbulence and mixing in the mixing region of a circular jet. The scheme
utilises the difference between global and local instabilities. Backflow will be
locally induced by applying suction to the jet periphery. The research will also
explore the connection between local/global stability properties and two-and
three-dimensional vortex dynamics. This research is motivated by recent
observations that counterflow can be effectively used to either suppress or
enhance turbulence in mixing layers.
