This project will investigate optimal control of partial differential equations
and viscosity solutions for Hamilton Jacobi systems. Iterative schemes, maximum
principles, and apriori estimates are the main techniques to be used. The
questions to be studied have been motivated by and are applicable to models in
population dynamics such as optimal trapping strategies for diffusing beaver
populations and biodegradation of hazardous chemicals.
