Hardware security, whether for attack or defense, differs from software,
network, and data security in that attackers may find ways to physically tamper
with devices without leaving a trace, and mislead the user to believe that the
hardware is authentic and trustworthy. Furthermore, the advent of new attack
modes, illegal recycling, and hard-to-detect Trojans make hardware protection an
increasingly challenging task. Design of secure hardware integrated circuits
requires novel approaches for authentication that are ideally based on multiple
layers of protection. This project develops a novel framework for embedding
heterogeneity and hierarchy in security and obfuscation at multiple layers into
the design of integrated circuits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses a
combination of server-based global authentication combined with local
authentication of components from third-party vendors reduces communication with
the server, thus reducing the communication overhead as well as error in
authentication. The investigators explore new approaches to increasing
robustness of SRAM based physical unclonable functions (PUFs) by intentional
voltage stress, and the tradeoffs in hierarchies of authentication. The project
investigates techniques for obfuscation based on modifications of finite state
machine (FSM) state transition graphs, and obfuscation metrics that are
developed and validated using data collected from test chips.
