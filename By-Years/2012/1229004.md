This EAGER project develops and tests a new model for integrating education
research and evaluation with education innovation and practice. This project
explores using a Network Improvement Community which aims to eliminate the silos
that frequently arise in communities driven by theoretical interests. Instead,
researchers are encouraged to collaborate with practitioners and
design/developers on understanding and solving high-leverage problems of
practice. The approach developed in the proposal provides an alternative to the
usual investigator-driven one that guides most education research efforts.

The model will be developed and tested in the context of Statway, a large
educational improvement project focused on community college developmental
mathematics led by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
Specifically, the project will create and develop a research network that will
function as one component of Statway. The project will determine if researchers
and students, and can be recruited into the network and sustain their engagement
in investigating a significant problem of practice.
