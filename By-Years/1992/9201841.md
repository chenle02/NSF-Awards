This MISETA proposal will measure the zonal drift of kilometer scale
irregularities and all sky airglow surface brightnesses in addition to upgrading
the Fabry Perot interferometer. The PIs also plan to compare MISETA observations
and predicitons from the current NCAR-TIGCM model. The project will focus on the
modification of the Fabry Perot to enable mesospheric dynamics studies through
the doppler measurements of mesospheric airglow emissions in addition to the 630
nm measurements.
