9319032 Lakowicz Stationary and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy are
widely used in Biochemistry and Biophysics. The information content of the data
is determined by the many lifetime of the excited state, which determines the
time available for dynamic processes to affect the emission spectral parameters.
We propose to evaluate the use of "light quenching" upon illumination of the
samples with long-wavelength non-absorbed light, to alter the decay times and
photoselected orientation of the excited state population. In this exploratory
project we will evaluate the prospects for light quenching using modern laser
sources, as applied to steady-state, time-domain and frequency-domain
measurements. We propose the following goals: 1. Determine the extent of light
quenching obtainable with fluorophores commonly present in proteins, membranes
and nucleic acids. 2. Evaluate the use of light quenching and steady-state
fluorescence measurements based on the principle of "lifetime-resolved" emission
spectra and anisotropy decays. 3. Evaluate the use of light quenching to modify
the orientation of the photoselected population, with emphasis on optical
geometries which can generate oriented (non- symmetric) excited state
populations. 4. Develop the appropriate theoretical expressions and software for
light quenching for one - and two - beam populations. 5. Examine light quenching
of sensing probes, such as those used for Ca2+, pH and CI-, to determine the
prospect for lifetime-resolved imaging in fluorescence microscopy, via light
quenching. Light quenching offers a non-perturbing means of controlling the
excited state population and orientation without the addition of chemical
quenchers. Also, light quenching is rapidly reversible. This phenomena may have
many unforeseen future applications, not only in steady- state and time-resolved
fluorescence spectroscopy, but also in fluorescence microscopy and imaging.
