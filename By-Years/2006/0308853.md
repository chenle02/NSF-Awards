Polyploidization is an increase in genome content by duplication of existing DNA
or fusion of two species' genomes. Polyploidization events provide new material
for natural selection to act upon. For example, genes with new functions may
evolve or large portions of the duplicated genome may be deleted. The proposed
research will focus on studying this phenomenon in gray treefrogs. Some gray
treefrogs are diploid and have two sets of chromosomes, while the others are
tetraploid and have four complete sets. Tetraploid frogs originated from diploid
populations. Molecular data from different genes will be collected to determine
(1) which diploid populations contributed to the formation of the tetraploids
and (2) whether doubling of the genome content has changed the rate of
evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will have broad impacts by advancing
the understanding of basic biological research and educating undergraduate and
graduate students. Women are represented at both undergraduate and graduate
levels. This cross-disciplinary genomics project incorporates phylogenetics,
molecular evolution, and computer science with state-of-the-art techniques and
equipment. Results will be published in scientific journals and presented at
society meetings and in public forums. DNA sequence data will be made publicly
available through submission to the GenBank database. Finally, this work
addresses questions of relevance to agricultural crops, many of which have
polyploid origins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
