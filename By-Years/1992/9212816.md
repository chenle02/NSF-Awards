Doctoral student: Kathryn Steen; Dissertation topic: "Wartime Catalyst and
Postwar Reaction: The Making of the U.S. Synthetic Organic Chemicals Industry."
Prior to World War I, the United States had virtually no synthetic organic
chemicals industry. By the end of the 1920s, however, the domestic industry was
firmly established as a world competitor capable of producing such notable
products as aspirin, plastics, and dyestuffs--all of which had come in whole or
part from Germany before the war. Entering World War I, the United States
possessed one of the strongest industrial sectors of any nation--with the
exception of synthetic organic chemicals. The wartime shortages may account for
the initial impetus for the industry's growth, but it fails to explain the
concrete steps taken to translate the recognized deficiency into a viable
industry. The significance of this topic lies in discovering and analyzing the
specific measures taken by industrialists, policy makers, universities, and
others who worked to establish an industry where virtually none had existed
before. Ms. Steen, under the direction of her dissertation adviser, Dr. David
Hounshell of the Carnegie Mellon University, is traveling to several archival
collections crucial to documenting the process of development of this critical
industry. Included among the collections to be consulted for this research are
the Charles H. Herty papers at Emory University, the Francis P. Garvan papers at
the University of Wyoming, and several corporate records depositories.
