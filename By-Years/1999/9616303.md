PI: Johnston IBN: 9616303 In this proposal the PI seek support for an
international scientific conference, Chemical Signals in Vertebrates, that meets
every three years. This meeting is unique in that is the only focusing on
chemical communication in vertebrates, and the only one that brings together
scientists working at all levels of analysis. Disciplines represented include
chemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, neuroanatomy, neurophysiology,
psychology, animal behavior, and ecology. It also brings together people who do
not ordinarily meet because of their focus on different types of organisms, such
as amphibians, fish, birds, and mammals. Funds are requested to support the
travel of scientists from economically stressed countries, particularly those of
Russia and eastern Europe. Some funds are also proposed to help graduate
students attend the meeting
