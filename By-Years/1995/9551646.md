Through this project, the computers necessary to build a combined laboratory-
classroom dedicated to an integrated style of learning in calculus and
precalculus are supplied. The purpose of this laboratory-classroom, with its
accompanying change in pedagogy and textbook, is to enhance students'
understanding of the basic concepts and appropriate applications of calculus.
This will come about through a change in the style of instruction to one that
requires fluidity of activity during the class period. This computer laboratory
integrates computer use completely into the classroom activities. The facility
reflects multi-use need, with large tables enabling groups of 2 or 3 students to
work together, blackboards around the room so the entire class can be in groups
at the board at the same time, and space for faculty to circulate among students
to offer advice. The room is designed to allow frequent switching from one type
of activity to another with minimal disruption.
