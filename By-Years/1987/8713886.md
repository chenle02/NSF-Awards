Dr. Brenner proposes to undertake a theoretical analysis of the size-dependent
chromatographic separation processes. The analysis will be based on a more
realistic curvilinear approach rather than the current models using rectilinear
approaches. The theoretical results are to be translated into chromatographic
separation parameters. The results should be applicable to separations of
proteins, polymers, biopolymers and all high molecular-weight molecules. Effects
of molecular size, shape, and flow conditions on the separation parameters will
be predicted by the analysis.
