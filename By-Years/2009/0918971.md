U/Th dating of fossil corals provides the fundamental timescale needed to
evaluate the timing and rates of change of past sea level fluctuations during
the Late Pleistocene. Research conducted as part of this project challenges the
use of open system dating techniques and proposes to locate closed system
aragonite in fossil Acropora palmata corals using novel microscopic screening
and laser ablation techniques for fine-scale sampling. Fine scale analyses will
attempt to better understand the magnitude and possible causes for the
heterogeneities of U, Th and Pa observed within fossil coral specimens. The
project will also sample fossil corals to reconstruct sea level variability
during MIS 3 using material from Araki Island and Barbados, as well as to
explore marine isotope stage 5 sea level estimates using the extensive archive
of fossil corals that was previously collected by the PI.
