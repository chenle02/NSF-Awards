Human breast milk is a dynamic, bioactive fluid that provides crucial
nutritional and medicinal advantages to infants, especially those born
prematurely. Breast milk contains hundreds of antibodies and other factors that
protect babies from life-threatening neonatal infections and diseases. Many
mothers, however, cannot provide adequate breast milk for their infants for a
host of reasons including absent or insufficient lactation, the latter of which
is especially acute for mothers of premature infants. Therefore, donated breast
milk, collected and dispensed via non-profit milk banks, is the standard of care
for infants whose mother's own milk is not a viable option. Despite the fact
that over two million ounces are dispensed annually in the US, demand far
outweighs supply. Moreover, milk banks involve many complex operational
processes. Hence, this growing network of facilities is widely regarded as being
in great need of support. This award aims to provide such support by optimizing
the processing, storage, dispensing and prioritized allocation of this precious
scarce resource. The outcomes of the research will benefit society through
better medical outcomes, shorter hospital stays and saved lives.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of this research project are to
optimize how milk from different donors is blended together, how hospital orders
and out-patient prescriptions are fulfilled and how recipients are prioritized.
These decision-making processes will be formulated as large-scale multistage
stochastic programs and will be calibrated using data from multiple sources. The
blending decisions will be modeled as a multistage stochastic mixed-integer
program, a class of problems that has a well-deserved reputation for being very
difficult to solve, but exhibit appealing structure. Patient prioritization
decisions will be modeled as a multistage stochastic convex program and an
ambitious combination of these decision processes will be modeled as a
multistage stochastic mixed-integer convex program. Overall, the main
intellectual merits of the work lie in the timeliness and novelty of the
application (i.e., milk bank operations) as well as the modeling and algorithmic
challenges that will be overcome in solving the models.
