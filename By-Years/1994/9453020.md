The Memphis Urban Systemic Initiative (MUSI) utilizes mathematics and science
education reform as the vehicle for system-wide improvement by initiating new
policies and practices that focus on academic content, graduation requirements,
quality teaching and resource reallocation and development. The MUSI will employ
the following strategies: (1) the use of site based management; (2) focusing the
City's educational resources on the Urban Systemic Initiative (USI) plan; (3)
aligning policies with USI goals and strategies; (4) customizing professional
development; (5) establishing broad and diverse community partnerships; (6)
raising expectations for student performance; and (7) increasing the rigor and
quality of curriculum and instruction. The Memphis USI seeks to realize its
vision in the challenging context of today's urban schools, a context
characterized by increasing violence, socio- economic inequities, and over-taxed
social service systems. The completion of a broadly supported and very promising
citywide USI plan have raised optimism that the USI will be the force that moves
the reform effort.
