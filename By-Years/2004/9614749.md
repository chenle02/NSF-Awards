9614749 Burbank This award provides support for a workshop in Nepal. The
workshop will bring together American and Nepalese scientists involved in a
project to study the interactions and feedbacks between geomorphic, climatic,
and tectonic processes in the Nepalese Himalaya. The purpose of the workshop is
to discuss the logistics of the research project, to preview the available data
already collected by governmental agencies in Nepal, to set up formal
collaborations between the two groups, to partition responsibilities for certain
data-collection tasks, to walk through the study area, to identify tributary
catchments for detailed studies in the future, and to collect samples which can
be used to test the utility of various approaches to the quantification of
erosion, deformation, and climate. ***
