This is a field-based study focusing on surficial processes and landscape
evolution in western Colorado. This region is a spectacular natural field
laboratory, and the location in Grand Junction, CO, makes Mesa State College
(MSC) an excellent base for the proposed research activities. The importance of
this topic is two-fold: 1) given the significant past and ongoing research in
surficial processes in these regions it is highly appropriate that undergraduate
geology students learn about landscape evolution in this classic geological
setting, and 2) the proposed student research activities will provide students
with in-depth exposure to aspects of surficial processes (e.g., geomorphology,
soils, neotectonics) that are not typically required for undergraduate geology
majors in the U.S. (these topics are typically electives). MSC faculty have
extensive experience mentoring undergraduate students and supervising research
projects. Novel aspects of this proposal include 1) its emphasis on field-based
research, 2) research activities that examine landscape evolution at multiple
time scales, and 3) the goal of working with students that are in the earliest
stages of their research careers (e.g., sophomores or juniors; students that
have not yet completed major requirements such as field camp). Research by MSC
faculty has identified a series of viable, cutting-edge student projects ranging
from studies of arroyo entrenchment to the origin of the Colorado River. The
outstanding geology of western Colorado will serve as the natural field
laboratory for all projects, and provides an ideal hands-on learning environment
for project participants.
