A longstanding aim of radiologic research has been the development of accurate
noninvasive angiographic techniques. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
sensitive to flowing protons and may achieve this goal. The research project
plans to assess the capabilities of new, commercially available magnetic
resonance imagers to detect simple and complex flow fields. It is planned to
construct a general, MRI- compatible flow phantom system capable of creating
steady and pulsatile flow in models of the cardiovascular system such as
straight and curved tubes with stenoses, the aorta, and the pulmonary artery.
The specific goals of this study are to: a. develop a general flow system
capable of accommodating a range of simple and complex models (phantoms) which
is compatible with the high magnetic fields utilized in MRI, b. test flows
through established models of the cardiovascular system by MRI and laboratory
flow visualization using hydrogen bubbles and dye injection, and c. correlate
the MRI images with the fluid mechanic physics to define the limits and
capabilities of existing MRI techniques. The results of this study should allow
new MRI pulse sequences to be developed to improve the accuracy and range of
flow measurements by MRI and further the development of non-invasive
arteriography.
