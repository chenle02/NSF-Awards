9322460 Godbole This award provides support for a group of six undergraduate
researchers in the mathematical sciences working at Michigan Technological
University. Students will work on individual research projects in the areas of
combinatorics, graph theory and number theory. The theme of the program will be
to used applications from probability theory to achieve solutions to problems in
all three areas. Students will travel with the project director to the Summer
Meeting of the American Mathematical Society in Minneapolis at the end of the
program. Particular emphasis will be placed on developing student abilities at
presenting results, both written and oral. Computing resources and office space
will be provided for the students. They will be housed in university apartments.
A strong record of recruiting, especially among underrepresented groups, will
again be reflected in this project. The program will run for an eight week
period. ***
