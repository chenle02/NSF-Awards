The focus of the project is to study singularity formation in various geometric
flows. These flows are characterized by the deformation of geometric objects
such as metrics, mappings, and submanifolds by geometric quantities such as
curvature and consist of partial differential equations of parabolic type.
Geometric flows appear in many real world applications. For example, surface
tension along moving interfaces in fluids and materials is proportional to mean
curvature; mean curvature flow and affine mean curvature flow are useful for
image processing. However, studying geometric equations can be challenging due
to nonlinearities and the possible development of singularities, especially
topological changes. One way to understand those singularities is to zoom in and
understand how solutions look as they approach the singular time after which a
smooth solution no longer exists. During this limiting process we get special
solutions to a geometric equation that are called ancient solutions, which have
existed for an infinite amount of time in the past. Understanding those
solutions could be useful in obtaining more topological and geometric
information about a geometric object. The project will also include training of
students and the mentoring of junior researchers.

The aim of the project is the classification of ancient solutions to nonlinear
geometric flows, such as, the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow. This
project will combine the PDE techniques and geometric estimates to study ancient
solutions of these flows. The goal is to classify ancient closed noncollapsed
solutions to higher dimensional Ricci flow (cases n = 2, 3 have been solved),
under the assumption that solution becomes asymptotically cylindrical as time
approaches minus infinity. One motivation for this classification comes from
showing an analogue of the Mean Convex Neighborhood Theorem for the Ricci flow.
This could potentially enable us to perform surgery in the Ricci flow in higher
dimensions without assuming global curvature conditions initially. As a
continuation of a completed project with collaborators, PI will investigate
noncollapsed ancient solutions to the mean curvature flow that are asymptotic to
other generalized round cylinders besides the well understood case of a round
cylinder.
