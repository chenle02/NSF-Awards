Investigators conducting research on human decision-making frequently have been
deterred from working with people of varying experience, expertise, age,
socioeconomic status, culture, etc. because of logistical difficulties. Recent
developments in computer technology may provide a solution to many of these
logistical problems. Potential participants may be reached at home or in their
offices through the Internet using aesthetically enticing video and audio
materials. The primary goal of this project is to develop and test a prototype
Internet-based Decision Research System (IDRS). This system will be capable of
reproducing simulated decision environments and conducting research using other
typical laboratory procedures at remote locations while gathering many of the
measures typically obtained in the laboratory (e.g., time spent accessing
different sources of information, order of access, self reports of confidence,
subjective probability estimates). The efficacy of the IDRS will be tested in a
demonstration project aimed at an important applied problem: providing a better
understanding of the information processing and decision-making strategies used
by aircraft pilots. Pilot errors are blamed for most aviation accidents and
incidents. Understanding how pilots make decisions and how the strategies they
use change with experience could help in the development of improved training
materials and safety procedures. In this study, pilots will participate in
simulations of typical aviation problems. What information they access and what
strategies they follow in making their decisions will be analyzed. If the IDRS
proves to be useful, this system and others like it could dramatically alter the
way behavioral research is conducted.
