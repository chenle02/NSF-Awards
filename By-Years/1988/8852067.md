Improvement of the physical ergonomics laboratory is planned through the
introduction of digital data processing and acquisition capabilities and in
microcomputer applications involving analog to digital conversion. Undergraduate
experiments in physical ergonomics involve the measurement of changes in various
physiological measures under specific physical work environments. The needed
equipment includes instrumentation for (1) establishing precise metabolic
workloads (treadmill, ergometer), (2) monitoring human subject responses
(heartrate, ventilation), and monitoring the environment. This equipment will be
used in several structured experiments and undergraduate research projects.
