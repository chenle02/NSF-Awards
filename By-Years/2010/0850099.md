This project is awarding scholarships to academically talented and financially
needy students at this historically black university and is supporting the
scholars through a variety of structures and programs. This project builds on a
successful CSEMS project and is focused on honors students in STEM fields. The
honors program provides many advantages to the scholarship recipients including
involvement in independent undergraduate research projects as well as access to
seminars and lectures given by visiting scholars. Students are being strongly
encouraged to pursue graduate studies through this program and research
experiences provide the vehicle for fostering interest in post graduate studies.
Student scholars are being advised to participate in on-campus tutoring as
needed and will be paired with graduate students as mentors. The success of the
project is being rigorously assessed through quantitative and qualitative
measures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
