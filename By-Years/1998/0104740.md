0104740 Alvarez-Cohen The objectives of this research are to characterize the
microbial diversity in consortia capable of reductively dechlorinating
chlorinated ethenes to determine the roles of different physiological groups in
those reactions, to isolate pure cultures capable of complete dechlorination of
trichloroethene (TCE), and to construct simple consortia capable of rapid,
stable growth and efficient, complete dechlorination of TCE. Various molecular
techniques will be used in this study, including clone library
construction/analysis, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism
(T-RFLP) analysis, and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. The
anticipated results of this study will provide fundamental information on the
diversity, physiology and biochemistry of microbial species involved in complete
reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes. This information is needed for
designing efficient treatment processes for remediating chlorinated ethene
contaminated sites. This research project will advance the development of
molecular biological techniques as tools for evaluating and monitoring reductive
dechlorination in contaminated subsurface environments. Also, it could lead to
the development of microbial consortia appropriate for application in
bioaugmentation strategies for site remediation. ***
