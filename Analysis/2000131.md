This award supports participation in the Groundwork for Operator Algebras
Lecture Series to be held at Michigan State University during June 28 - July 12,
2020. Operator algebras arose as a mathematical framework for quantum mechanics,
and the field today is a highly active research area. The Groundwork for
Operator Algebras Lecture Series (GOALS) is a two-week summer school and
workshop that aims to provide early-career graduate students with an
introduction to the fundamental techniques and current research in operator
algebras. In addition, GOALS aims to increase, in this field, the participation
and retention of persons from traditionally underrepresented groups by removing
technical barriers to the field and building a strong community of support among
the participants, contributors, and organizers.

The field of operator algebras is a branch of functional analysis, which has a
long-standing dialogue with various fields of mathematics and physics, such as
topology, group theory, conformal field theory, probability, and logic, to name
a few. The breadth of knowledge required to actively engage in operator algebras
can be intimidating; there is a need to provide future researchers with an
introduction to fundamental techniques and current research. The objectives of
GOALS will be accomplished via lecture series on the basics of C*-algebras and
von Neumann algebras; problem sessions; evening discussions on psychological
barriers; expository talks about more advanced topics; and a culminating
conference with leading researchers in operator algebras. The community created
at GOALS will be sustained by providing financial support for the participants
to reunite at major annual operator algebras conferences such as the Great
Plains Operator Theory Symposium. More information about this event is available
at the link below.
