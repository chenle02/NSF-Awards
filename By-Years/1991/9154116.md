In 1983 the President inaugurated the National Partnerships in Education
program and requested that each federal agency establish a partnership with a
local school. NSF formed a partnership with Banneker High School which has a
special emphasis in science and mathematics. The Foundation has initiated a
variety of activities with the school centering on staff and outside speaker
presentations and trips to science facilities. This year the staff in the
Directorate for Education and Human Resources assisted Banneker faculty and
staff in the identification of "critical needs" in the school's science and
mathematics programs. As a result the school is being awarded a grant of $63,000
to upgrade science laboratory equipment, purchase materials and supplies and
implement staff development activities.
