The PI proposes extensive revision and restructuring of an existing simulation
course designed primarily for senior computer science majors by: 1) developing
an integrated set of laboratory exercises using commercially available software
(GPSS/H); 2) incorporating these materials into a formal laboratory manual along
with related computer science reference materials and instructions in the use of
the software; 3) implementing a pilot course using this manual together with a
single text in the theory of simulation; 4) evaluating the new course by
collecting and analyzing feedback from students and faculty; 5) preparing a
syllabus and a detailed annotated course outline for the instructor, keyed to
the manual and the text; and 6) dissemination of the prepared materials. The
materials developed will be flexible and highly modular allowing their adoption
or adaptation at other institutions. This project will be undertaken at the
University of the District of Columbia (UDC), a university whose student body is
89% minority. The instructional materials are designed to be especially helpful
to computer science students by providing them with marketable skills in
computer simulation which can be expected to enhance their ability to obtain
professional positions with a bachelor's degree.
