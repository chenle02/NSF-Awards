Various aspects of nonlinear phenomena will be studied by controlled
experiments. The first will address the problem of turbulence, in gas and liquid
helium, in a Rayleigh Benard experiment of large physical size. A study of the
transitions from chaos to weak turbulence and then to develop turbulence is
planned. The second will study the dynamics of interfaces between various states
of liquid crystals, smecticA-smecticC, smectic A-isotropic phases. The effects
of crystal symmetries on the dendritic shapes will be studied. The third will be
a continuation from the preceeding grant. In R-B experiments on mercury the
effects of noise and or a third frequency on the transition to chaos in
quasiperiodicity will be observed. Finally, in fluid-fluid interfaces of the
Saffman-Taylor types, a number of puzzling questions remain on the selection and
stability of fronts and bubbles.
