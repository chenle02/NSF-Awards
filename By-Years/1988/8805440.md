The partitioning of ions at water/solid oxide and water/clay interfaces is
poorly understood at the molecular level, yet detailed structural information
about surface complexes is essential for quantitative description of many
interfacial processes. These processes play fundamental roles in many fields,
including geochemistry, oceanography, and environmental engineering. The
proposed work will utilize high-intensity, wavelength-tunable synchrotran
radiation and X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), specifically Extended X-Ray
Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure
(XANES), to obtain direct, in-situ measurements of nearest- neighbor, and where
possible, next-neighbor distances and identities, coordination numbers, and in
favorable systems, distances between adsorbate ions and cations in the solid
surface. This information will be used to assist in the definition of
composition and structure of surface complexes and to distinguish among
adsorption, absorption, precipitation, and coprecipitation. Ten systems will be
studied: involving Pb2+, Sr2+, CO2+, Cu2+, SeO4/2-, and SeO3/2- as adsorbates,
and geothite, gamma-Al2O3, rutile, and kaolinite as adsorbents. The proposed
study will provide detailed compositional and structural information about
adsorption complexes, and an opportunity to compare results obtained by several
methods. It will also provide an opportunity to test and refine current
theoretical models for adsorption processes.
