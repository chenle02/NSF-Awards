Abstract EEC-9527784-Texas A&amp;M University, Dr. Sohi Rastegar This award
provides funding to Texas A&amp;M University for the support of a Combined
Research-Curriculum Development (CRCD) Program entitled, "A Multidisciplinary
Program in Biomedical Optics." The CRCD program emphasizes the need to
incorporate exciting research advances in important technology areas into the
upper level undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula and stimulates
faculty researchers to place renewed, equal value on quality education and
curriculum development. The objective of this project is to develop, implement,
and evaluate a unique interdisciplinary curriculum in Biomedical Optics. The
thrust of the new curriculum includes the development of four new senior
undergraduate and introductory graduate courses based on research advances made
within the Biomedical Engineering Program at Texas A&amp;M University in
collaboration with internal and external medical centers. This new curriculum
will integrate optically based therapeutic, diagnostic, and monitoring
principles into the bioengineering curriculum as well as provide unique courses
which by their nature are each multidisiciplinary and cover fundamental
principles highly relevant to other traditional engineering disciplines. *** ??
