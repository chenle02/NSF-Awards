This project funds travel support for students and a few junior faculty to
attend the 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems
(ICDCS) to be held in Philadelphia, PA, July 8-11, 2013. ICDCS is a premier
conference and has a wide coverage of topics in distributed computing.
Attendance will provide an excellent opportunity for students and junior faculty
to interact with senior researchers of international standing. The selection of
the grantees will be managed via a rigorous application process that will
consider the expected benefits and interests of the prospective participants.
