9514888 Becker The gonadal steroid hormones have long been known to influence
female behaviors. However, the mechanism by which these hormones generate their
behavioral effects is largely unknown. There are data that do not conform to the
classical mechanism for steroid hormone action, i.e. binding of hormone to
intracellular receptors and subsequently altering nuclear gene transcription.
Consequently, novel non-genomic effects have been postulated by investigators,
including Dr. Becker, to resolve the temporal inconsistencies between the
behavioral observations and the time required to alter gene transcription. The
present research goes beyond this level to explore the non-genomic effects of
the steroid hormones in specific brain regions and investigates the ability of
steroid hormones to influence dopaminergic neuronal activity in the striatum and
accumbens, and how this classical neurotransmitter acts in these areas to
modulate female behavior. Moreover, other investigator have shown a strong
interaction between striatal dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid in controlling
movement. Logically, Dr. Becker will investigate how estrogen alters the
activity of the neurons containing these neurotransmitters and the direct
consequences on female behavior which is dependent on movement. These studies
are exciting and highly innovative. They will revolutionize the thinking about
female behaviors and the components required for their generation. Investigating
the interaction of dopamine-and gamma-aminobutyric acid-containing neurons in
the striatum may open new avenues for understanding presynaptic regulatory
mechanisms in the brain, which will impact not only the neuroendocrinology
field, but may also reveal more about the behavior of animals in their natural
habitats and the critical cues that trigger female behaviors.
