In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, the PI will apply newly improved dissociation product
imaging techniques to better understand the dissociation of diatomic and
triatomic molecules excited near their ionization limits. Both two-photon
excitation to Rydberg levels and single-photon VUV excitation will be employed.
With the product imaging technique the PI will determine the speed and angular
distribution of the detected dissociation products simultaneously. This research
will be conducted with graduate students and postdoctoral research associates.
