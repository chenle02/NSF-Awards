The objective of this project is to develop a methodology to design the
optimization component of a compiler that learns from experience. The strategy
to be studied involves the use of an explanation-based learning (EBL) sub-system
that, based on analytical and empirical information, will generate policies to
control the optimization component of the compiler. The analytical information
will relate program characteristics to performance. The empirical information
will be obtained by profiling the program and will be stored in a database
containing information from earlier versions of the program and from other
programs in the same problem domain. An experimental compiler will be
implemented to evaluate the methodolog,. The core of the compiler will be a
translator controlled by parameters that could be selected from a standard
collection, in which case the compiler will behave like a conventional compiler,
or be generated by the machine learning sub-system. Specific topics to be
studied as part of this project include: compiler organization, program
transformations and their interaction, performance prediction based on both
static and dynamic information, machine learning techniques and the integration
of both prior knowledge (performance abstractions in our case) and empirical
data, and context-adaptive computing systems.
