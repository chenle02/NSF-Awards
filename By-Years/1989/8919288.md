Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the most powerful analytical method for
structure determination of solids. In synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic
and organometallic chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable
tool to characterize molecular structure. The information gained from the
knowledge of the intermolecular composition and structure helps to develop new
reactions of potentially general interest in catalysis or organic synthesis.
This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry and the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill to
acquire a Single Crystal X-Ray Diffraction System. Among the areas of chemical
research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are the following: 1. Studies
of Metal Oxo Complexes 2. Synthesis, Reactivity, and Spectroscopy of Copper
Complexes 3. Phase Transitions in Linear Chain Compounds 4. Metallophosphine and
Metalloarsine Compounds 5. Organic Transformation of Coordinated Ligands 6.
Organometallic Chemistry
