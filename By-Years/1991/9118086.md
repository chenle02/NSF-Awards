This research will concentrate on the orientation of stress in south-central
Alaska. Stress tensors will be estimated by means of analysis of fault plane
solutions for large numbers of small to medium magnitude earthquakes. The Denali
fault and the deep subduction zone changes strike markedly in this area and one
of the questions to be addressed is how the stress changes relate to the strike
changes and depths of the faults. These are fundamental questions that bear on
the seismic hazard and tectonics of Alaska. This research is a component of the
National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
