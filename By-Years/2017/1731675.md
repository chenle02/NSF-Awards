The future Internet of Things (IoT) will support numerous types of applications
producing overwhelming data traffic with highly different Quality-of-Service
(QoS) requirements, creating challenges in terms of spectrum scarcity, and
prohibitive energy consumption of billions of devices. Cognitive radio (CR) is a
promising technology for IoT not only because of its dynamic spectrum access
capability, but also due to its potential of providing diverse QoS and energy
efficiencies by delivering different types of traffic using different bands.
Although dynamic spectrum access to multiple bands can bring various benefits to
the IoT, it also introduces significant challenges. This research offers
transformative advances in overall network energy efficiencies, by leveraging
order-of-magnitude energy efficiencies of low-frequency bands, novel
heterogeneous battery management, and spectrum access methods designed to take
advantage of these two new advances. This research is truly interdisciplinary
covering integrating advances in circuits/hardware design, device battery
management, and synergistic energy-efficient networking and spectrum access.
This research will generate innovative techniques to serve numerous applications
of IoT technologies, e.g., smart cities and smart homes, mobile health, and
intelligent transportation systems. It will also greatly advance the
understanding of energy efficiency of IoT devices and networks.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this proposal is to design, analyze, and
evaluate transformative intelligent energy-efficient spectrum access
technologies for wireless IoT. This research is the first to systematically
address the energy efficiency issue in wireless IoT spectrum access through
intelligent battery system management of IoT devices and innovative wideband
enhancement for electrically-small antennas to unlock order-of-magnitude energy
efficiencies of low- frequency bands, and where new intelligent energy-efficient
channel rendezvous algorithms are designed to leverage these advantages for IoT
spectrum access. The proposed project consists of three main research thrusts:
(1) energy-efficient channel rendezvous for enhanced spectrum access with
adaptive power management; (2) cognitive battery system to maximize the energy
efficiency of each IoT device by optimally integrating heterogeneous batteries
in each device and dynamically matching the power consumption and battery
characteristics; and (3) digital non-Foster methods to unlock energy
efficiencies of low-frequency bands. This project also integrates research
findings into related undergraduate and graduate courses and diversity support.
