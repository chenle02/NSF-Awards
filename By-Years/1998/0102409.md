Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on the properties
of nuclear matter in extreme environments, such as high temperatures or high
density. Phase transitions are expected in these situations between conventional
matter approximating the interior of a large nucleus and new, highly exotic
large-scale states of matter in which there may be superfluidity,
superconductivity and plasmas of unconfined quarks and gluons, the constituents
of nuclear matter. Computer simulations as well as precise, analytic methods
based on the theory of symmetries, will be employed to search for these new
phenomena. These studies are important because they may tell us about conditions
in the early universe.
