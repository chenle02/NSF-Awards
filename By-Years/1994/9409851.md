IRI-9409851 Silsbee, Peter Old Dominion University $32,641 - 12 mos. (Jointly
funded with Cross Disciplinary Activities - Total Award $34,141) RIA: "Computer
Lipreading for Robust Automatic Speech Recognition" This is the first year of a
three-year continuing RIA Award to investigate four areas: 1) how to advance the
state of the art in computerized lipreading, 2) how to integrate the acoustic
and visual information acquired by the computer, 3) how to develop a database of
natural speech for use in lipreading research, and 4) to demonstrate that
audiovisual automatic speech recognition (ASR) is more robust than recognition
using the acoustic signal only. The project database includes multiple speakers
and uses three-dimensional deformable models. The integration of the visual and
acoustic signal considers the adaptation of the speech signal, the acoustic
environment, and the quality of the visual information.
