The goal of the OxyMS Teaching Scholars project is to increase the number of
highly qualified math and science teachers in high-need urban high schools
through recruitment and retention of fifth-year students and/or STEM
professionals committed to teaching. In order to serve the local community urban
high schools, recruitment emphasizes areas/places with high proportions of
underrepresented groups including community colleges and minority engineering
professional associations. The project is recruiting and retaining 40 Occidental
fifth-year students and/or STEM professionals to complete their teaching
credential for grades 7 -12. This Phase I proposal is a collaboration between
Occidental's Education, Mathematics, and Chemistry departments, and three
community urban high schools - Franklin, Lincoln, and Eagle Rock High School
(Los Angeles Unified School District). Faculty are coordinating/facilitating a
monthly mentoring group for the Teaching Scholars and other math and science
undergraduates who might be interested in teaching (recruiting purposes).
Occidental faculty and the Center for Community-Based Learning (CCBL) are
collaborating with Franklin, Lincoln, and Eagle Rock High Schools to provide bi-
annual (fall and spring) seminars for the math and science teachers (including
the student teaching master teachers) to create a professional network to
support the OxyMS Teaching Scholars.
