The Sixth Conversation in Biomolecular Stereodynamics will be held in June in
SUNY/Albany. Started in 1979, then repeated in 1981, 1983, 1985 and 1987, the
conference has become a main event to discuss and debate the developing ideas
and discoveries in the broad context of biological structure, dynamics,
interactions and expression. Over 500 scientists from 14 countries participated
in the last meeting. The following areas will be covered: 1) human geonome
initiative; 2) recombination and resolvase; 3) molecular dynamics of biological
macromolecules; and 4) structure, dynamics, interactions and expression of
biological macromolecules. Every effort will be made to devote a significant
part of the time to talks by graduate students, postdoctorals and young faculty.
The main lectures will be published within a year of the meeting as the
Proceedings of the Sixth Conversation.***//
