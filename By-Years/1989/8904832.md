The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for the determination
of the molecular structure of compounds as diverse as small polypeptides and
complex metal clusters. When combined with the latest computer software, the
technique is becoming remarkably easy to put into practice. Access to X-ray
crystallographic instrumentation markedly improves the ability of chemists to
carry out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry at the University of
California, San Diego, will use this award from the Chemical Instrumentation
Program to help acquire an X-ray diffractometer. The areas of chemical research
that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the following: 1) Structural
elucidation of marine natural products 2) X-ray diffraction of peptides 3)
Structural aspects of electron transfer processes 4) Metallo-organic molecules
as mediators and models 5) Transmission of stereochemical information 6)
Structure of metallo-enzyme mimics.
