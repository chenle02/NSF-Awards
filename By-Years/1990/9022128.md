This award, to a leading young instrumentalist, supports research on the
structure of high-velocity gas flows in a variety of astrophysical situations.
It utilizes a very high resolution imaging Fabry-Perot spectrophotometer
developed by the Principal Investigator. This work will provide novel
constraints on the dynamics of ionized filaments in the circumnuclear regions of
active galaxies and improve the general physical understanding of high-velocity
radiative shocks.
