We live in a three-dimensional world, and we are aware of it. The perception of
the visual space that surrounds us as three-dimensional is the product of
complicated neurophysiological processes but the three-dimensionality of
movements and forces generated by the arm is given, due to the multi-articulated
construction of the skeleton and the multiple muscles attached to it. The
question is then, how well does the 3-D visual map correspond to the 3-D motor
map? How well can we match directions defined in 3-D visual space with
directions of movements and forces operating in the same space? How well can we
control our force vectors in 3-D space and in time, e.g. when we track a moving
target? How successfully can we intercept that moving target? These and other
questions are being studied quantitatively by Dr. Apostolos Georgopoulos and his
team of scientists. Studies will be carried out using human arm movements. The
visual instruction for the generation of 3-D force vectors will be presented in
the form of a vivid stereoscopic image, and the 3-D force output of the arm will
be monitored using a 3-D isometric manipulandum. The results will be analyzed
using statistical techniques for 3-D data and an information-theoretical
analysis. //
