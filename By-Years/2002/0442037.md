AST-0442037 Bertozzi

This project supports research in mathematical algorithms and implementations to
represent, manipulate, and analyze data, specifically including feature
detection, and registration and characterization of natural images. By building
on a class of active contour models known as image snakes, the investigators
will develop a fast method for object identification, to be used on large
volumes of aerial photographs. Combined with higher order nonlinear PDE-based
methods for resolving piecewise linear signals, and with shape and size
constraints, the final system should be particularly efficient at locking onto
predefined shapes. This interdisciplinary work draws on mathematical ideas from
fluid dynamics and incorporates datasets from the intelligence community.
