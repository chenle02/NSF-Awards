0124350&lt;br/&gt;Scalettar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-year award supports
U.S.-France collaboration in materials research between Richard T. Scalettar,
University of California, Davis, and George Batrouni of the University of Nice.
The project addresses the problem of interacting, disordered electron systems.
The objective is to determine quantum phase transitions in disordered
superfluids and superconductors using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. The
investigators will conduct numerical simulations of the Boson-Hubbard model for
superfluids and of supersolid formation in the Fermion-Hubbard model. The US
investigator brings to the collaboration expertise in fermion determinant QMC
methods. This is complemented by French expertise in dual algorithm bosonic
QMC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disordered electron systems exhibit remarkable
properties including universal conductivity, two-dimensional metal-insulator and
superconductor insulator phase transition, zero temperature liquid behavior and
novel glassy phases. These systems represent fundamental problems in solid state
physics and have important technological applications.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF
and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). NSF will cover
travel funds and living expenses of the US investigator and student. The CNRS
will support the visits of the French researchers. The collaboration will
advance fundamental understanding of disordered electron systems in solid state
physics and provides an international research training opportunity for a US
student. &lt;br/&gt;
