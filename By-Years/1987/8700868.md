This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of electrochemistry. The principal investigator will investigate
the relationship between the microstructure of cyanometallate layers formed on
electrodes and their electrochemical reactivity by means of x-ray diffraction
technique in combination with electrochemical and photothermal deflection
spectroscopic tools. As a result of this research, new methods for the analysis
of alkali metals and some biomaterials may be developed.
