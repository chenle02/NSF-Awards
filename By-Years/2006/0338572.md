This award provides support for a conference to be held at Rice University,
Houston, Texas, November 1-2, 2003 with the title BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN
SCIENCE AND SOCIETY: The Relationship between National Policy and Research in
National Laboratories, Universities, Government and Industry.

The conference will provide a forum for bringing together people with the broad
range of scientific backgrounds and experience in public policy necessary to
permit a meaningful discussion of science policy issues. The conference will
address the gaps in public policy on scientific research and the science and
technology payback to the national defense, security, health, economy, energy
and environment, and to the overall quality of American life.
