This project is concerned with establishing some of the econometric theory for
predicting from models involving time dependent conditional variances.
Specifically, the intention is to examine the form of the optimal predictor of
the conditional mean and the conditional variance equations; their mean squared
error (MSE) and their associated multi-step prediction density. Initial work
that has been undertaken has given rise to analytic expressions for all the
moments of the conditional mean prediction density from a univariate
autocorrelated process with GARCH (1,1) innovations. The project will extend
these results for more general processes and will attempt to derive some fairly
general results for the prediction of future conditional variances. It is
anticipated that there will be many applications of these results in asset
pricing models and option pricing models, where prediction of future volatility
is likely to be important an important component of the asset price.
Applications will also be made to the relationship between stock market indices
and the real business cycle.
