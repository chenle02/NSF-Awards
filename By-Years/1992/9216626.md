9216626 MULLER-KARGER This is a study of the relation of near surface
biogeochemical processes to the downward flux of particulate materials along a
continental margin where down-slope lateral losses into the ocean's interior are
minimal. Specifically, low-cost ocean margin time series station in the Cariaco
Basin, a depression located on the continental margin of the southern Caribbean
Sea, will be inflemeated. Monthly hydrographic casts and bi-weekly sediment flux
at 4 depths using automated moore traps will the conducted high resolution
satellite data will be collected using an antenna located in Caracas, Benezuela.
This program is identified is as CARIACO (CArbon Retention In A Colored Ocean).
The goals of the CARIACO program are to: a) quantify oceanographic processes
that affect the vertical flux of nutrients, carbon uptake, and carbon
deposition, including the interaction between wind speed, sea level (as an
indicator of geostrophic current strength), river discharge, sea surface
temperature, and irradiance above an anoxic basin; to define variability in
biogeochemcial fluxes in an area affected by seasonal upwelling and river
discharge; c) quantify the relative importance of primary production versus
terrigenous inputs of particulate and dissolved materials in the downward flux
and sediments storage; d) determine the seasonal taxonomic composition of
plankton in the water column, with emphasis on vertical variations of
phytoplankton and foraminifera species; e) develop a two-dimensional numerical
model the allows examination of the annual cycle of population responses,
vertical biogenic fluxes, and degradation of detritus at depth; and f) examine
the relationship between water-column oceanographic processes and sediment
fluxes in order to understand the origin of sediment varves and their
relationship to past climate change.
