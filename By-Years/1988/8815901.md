This project will support a workshop on New Trends and Applications of
Distributed Parameter Control Systems to be held August 4-10, 1989 at the
Institute for Mathematics and Its Applications, University of Minnesota. The
conference will be under the direction of Professor E. Bruce Lee of the
University of Minnesota. The topics of the workshop will include the theory and
applications of control, stabilization, inverse problems, modeling and
computation for distributed parameter systems. The organizers plan to bring
together researchers from universities, industry, and national laboratories in
order to exchange ideas and the latest research results, discuss current issues
and problems, and explore future trends and opportunities in this area of
research.
