One method to simulate approximately the effects of earthquake loading on a
full-size earth structure, such as an earth dam or a retaining wall, is to shake
a physical model of the soil structure in-flight on a geotechnical centrifuge.
The various physical simulation methods available are all approximations to
reality, and it is important to understand clearly what these approximations
are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data from centrifuge experiments can be used to study
the physical mechanisms involved in complex problems, as well as to verify
numerical procedures, and to evaluate new design approaches. However centrifuge
modeling is a complex experimental method. There are some uncertainties in
modeling techniques that need further study so as to establish confidence in the
accuracy of the simulation. One of the most significant uncertainties involves
the soil properties in a model during the flight (rotation) of the centrifuge.
It has been accepted practice to measure the properties prior to or after
flight, which can be significantly different from the properties that exist
during flight. It is also generally assumed that the soil samples are uniform
and isotropic, basically because of the difficulty in measuring the actual
degree of uniformity and isotropy. There are other approximations, which also
need to be examined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator is
addressing the accuracy of the simulation by using "bender" elements (a
relatively new technique) to measure the shear modulus of soil. This is a very
promising approach that is expected to lead to an improved understanding of the
approximations inherent in simulating on a centrifuge the earthquake loading on
an earth structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
