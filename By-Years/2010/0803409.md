This project is encouraging interdisciplinary machine learning research and
education that integrates the use of machine learning into the application
areas, solves real science problems, and serves as a catalyst for new research
in both machine learning and the application domains. We are investigating four
basic machine learning issues that arise when working with real-world
applications: (1) optimizing over choices available when generating training
data; (2) assessing and improving the quality of training data; (3) designing
specific algorithms and methods for time series and feature-based data; and (4)
developing methods for abstaining during classification. Our research is
motivated by on-going collaborations with researchers to create solutions for:
training an artificial nose (Chemistry, Tufts); land-cover mapping from remotely
sensed data (Geography, Boston University); classification of sky surveys
(Astronomy, Harvard); non-invasive gluclose monitoring (Biomedical Engineering,
Tufts); and liquification prediction (Civil Engineering, Tufts). The successful
application of machine learning to each of the five tasks will have significant
impact on the lives of humans. Our education initiatives have two complementary
goals: (1) to educate computer science students on how to conduct
interdisciplinary machine learning research; and (2) to educate professors,
graduate students and undergraduates from science, engineering and medicine on
how to recognize and pose problems as machine learning and data mining problems.
