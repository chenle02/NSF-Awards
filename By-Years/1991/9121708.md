In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program, Dr. Louis H. Pignolet of the Chemistry Department, University
of Minnesota, will investigate the synthesis, reactivity and characterization of
heteronuclear cluster compounds containing platinum or palladium, and gold. New
compounds that contain less than thirteen metal atoms and ligands such as
isonitriles, alkyl phosphines, and halide ions will be synthesized. In some
cases a third metal, such as rhodium, osmium, or nickel, will also be
introduced. In addition, larger clusters containing more than thirteen metal
atoms will be prepared. Compounds will be characterized using some methods that
that have not been exploited previously for clusters, including scanning
tunneling microscopy and plasma desorption mass spectrometry. Catalytic
properties of the compounds will be tested, both under homogeneous and
heterogeneous conditions. %%% Discrete compounds containing a large number of
metals and a mixture of metals are being investigated because of their potential
catalytic applications. They may serve as effective models for many commercial
catalysts which are alloys, or mixtures of metals, or they may prove to be
effective catalysts themselves.
