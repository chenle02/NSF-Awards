The last few years has seen a dramatic growth of interest in the application of
computer-aided interactive proof checking. The technology underlying interactive
proof checking has improved as a result of developments in theorem proving and
model checking. There is also a growing awareness of the risks of digital
hardware and software systems, the increasing complexity of these systems, and
the greater exposure to security threats. Interactive proof checking is still
not an effective tool in the hands of nonspecialists because of the lack of
insightful explanations from both failed and successful proof attempts. The main
problem addressed by this project is that of reconciling the development and
maintenance of proofs with the presentation of proofs. The main thesis of this
project is that powerful, appropriate, and transparent automation can improve
the productivity of proof construction and maintenance while enhancing the value
and cogency of the resulting proofs and counterexamples. The project will result
in the transparent inference procedures, structured and readable proof
presentations, and automated support for counterexample generation.
