In several collisional orogens, uplift of large areas has accompanied
tectonism, forming large plateaus of anomalously high elevation. The classic
modern example is the 5,000 in Tibetan Plateau, one of the most extraordinary
irregularities of the earth's surface. Recent modeling has underscored the
importance of understanding the uplift history of these plateaus both in
understanding the fundamental tectonic mechanics involved and in understanding
how these uplifts affect atmospheric circulation patterns, erosion and other
derivative parameters. This project will employ the altitude-controlled
production of 36C1 of surfaces and radiometric dating of volcanic flows to
constrain the uplift history of the Tibetan Plateau. Results, if successful,
will be invaluable in both understanding the formation of this plateau and in
testing general orogenic models.
