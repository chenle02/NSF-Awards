This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of
NCRI's "Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers K-12
education institutions (including vocational technical schools), public
libraries and museums. It provides partial support for two years for a cable
modem network to connect the educational institutions in Jamestown ND to the
Internet. The schools include a high school, middle school, seven elementary
schools, a vocational center and a center for children. Jamestown College
independently is upgrading its existing 56kbps Internet connection to T1 to
handle the increased traffic. The educational institutions and the local cable
company have formed a partnership for this project, with leadership from the
college.
