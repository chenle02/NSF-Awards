Alabama A&amp;M University proposes the establishment of a Center to study
Nonlinear Optics and Optical Materials. Investigators at the Center will perform
reserch in quantum optics and in the preparation of materials for optical and
electronic systems. Studies will include the growth of bulk crystals of
semiconductors and optically active materials from solution. These crystals will
be characterized, resulting in the development of growth models. In addition,
infrared detectors will be constructed and interactions between cosmic rays and
semiconductors will be examined. The center will also be used to motivate
minority students at all educational levels to consider careers in science and
engineering. The strategies to strengthen partnerships with industry will be
developed. This project meets the major goal of the Minority Research Centers of
Excellence (MRCE) program: to increase the minority presence in science and
engineering by making substantial resources available to upgrade the research
capabilities of a highly research productive minority institution. The project
will at the same time enable Alabama A&amp;M to use research as a tool to
increase the effectiveness of related science and engineering activities for
minority groups in its region. In addition, the project will provide
opportunities for minority faculty and students at Alabama A&amp;M and nearby
institutions with significant minority enrollments to engage in meritorious
research that leads to publications in referred journals.
