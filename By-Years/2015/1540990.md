The project embeds a CI Engineer into four University of Pittsburgh research
centers providing a resource for cyberinfrastructure engineering on existing
projects and consulting on the use of campus and national cyberinfrastructures
to advance center missions and objectives. Research centers are the nexus for
campus collaborations and serve as "virtual science organizations" in the
University. These centers provide a rich locus for engagement and development of
cyberinfrastructure use cases and best practices for the use of shared
facilities and information sharing among large collaboration teams. The
selection of centers with different missions and objectives provides an
excellent test bed from which to develop the role of the CI Engineer and
influence future support models. The project integrates the knowledge and
experiences derived from the center engagements into a CI-Consultant curriculum
for use in workforce training and student education. Sharing of the CI-
Consultant curriculum with peer institutions contributes to the development and
maturation of the CI Engineer role at large.
