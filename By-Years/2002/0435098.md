Utah State University is collaborating with Eastern Michigan University to
create DL Connect: Connecting Underserved Teachers and Students with NSDL
Learning Resources and Tools. Workshops are being developed for middle grade
teachers and library media specialists to help them integrate NSDL materials
into the middle school classroom. Prior to this effort middle school children
and teachers were a population segment not being adequately served by NSDL. The
importance of helping this group is evident from the numerous studies conducted
over several decades pointing to the middle school as the place that large
numbers of students begin to lose interest and ability in science and
mathematics. The project is having a direct impact on 250 middle schools and a
large number of middle school teachers within the service areas of the two
universities. Many of these schools are serving impoverished districts including
those located in rural, suburban, and Native American tribal areas. In Michigan,
approximately 100 schools in the targeted area are failing to meet the mandated
adequate yearly progress goals. . Improvements in the mathematics and science
areas are being observed.
