The Pennsylvania State University establishes a multidisciplinary program that
provides training in demography and statistics as well as sociology with the
specific objective of preparing sociology graduate students for basic research
careers in family and the life course. Thematically, the program emphasizes the
life course perspective and innovative methodological and statistical procedures
employed by the investigators in their work on such topics as marriage,
fertility, divorce, single and adolescent parenthood, child poverty, and
intergenerational relations. Trainees undertake a five-year plan of study that
requires completion of extensive coursework, candidacy and comprehensive
examinations, a research apprenticeship, and a master's thesis and doctoral
dissertation. Graduate Research Trainees also gain experience giving
professional presentations and teaching. Program success is ensured through
active recruitment measures, faculty and peer mentoring, and material support of
the trainees.
