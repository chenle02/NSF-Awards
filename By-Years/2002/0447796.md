Collaborative Research: The future of optical communications: understanding of
Choices

Abstract:

This planning grant brings together the communities of optical networking and
optical devices to define new research directions in optical networks over the
next decade. New opportunities in optical networking and resulting applications
are arising due to innovations in optical integration that is leading to leaps
in functionality similar to what (V)LSI brought to electronics forty years ago.
Also new ways (physics) to manipulate photons that could not have been predicted
a decade ago show promise to change the way optics can fundamentally play a role
in networking and communications. The key objectives of this project are to
create a common understanding of optical technologies and their roadmap among
the network research community and to roadmap photonic integrated technologies
and identify which ones have the capability be disruptive and have high impact
in pervasive optical network architectures and applications. A primary result of
this project is to establish a clear vision to launch new, high impact
networking research initiatives in this area. It is also expected that the
results of this research will be to create a common framework and working model
to enable researchers in the non-technology related subjects, working on
interesting problems such control plane and theoretic performance, to understand
how optics may affect their work.

A primary vehicle for this research is a series of two workshops that brings
leaders of the optical and networking communities together to discuss common
objectives and identify these new opportunities. The expected outcome of this
project is to generate new research areas, topics and cross-disciplinary
collaborations that lead to innovative proposals to the NSF and high-impact
results.
