Commodity systems are changing the face of storage and I/O. Commodity disks are
cheap, but unreliable. Commodity file systems are widely used, but bug prone.
Despite these critical problems, people rely increasingly on commodity computing
systems to store data of critical importance, whether from an emotional (e.g.,
family photos), business (e.g., a customer database), or legal (e.g., your tax
return) standpoint.

The Wisconsin Arrays in Software Project (WASP) tackles the problem of building
the next generation of robust and reliable commodity RAID system. Such a RAID
system must be reliable, detecting and recovering from a broad range of disk
faults correctly. Such a system must also integrate properly into existing
systems, thus delivering high performance and proper recovery in the case of
system crashes. Finally, such a system must be flexible, enabling new protection
strategies to be developed and deployed to cope with new problems as they arise.
WASP has two major components: the first is a RAID design checker known as
Sting, which ensures that protection schemes correctly protect data from a given
set of disk faults. The second is a framework to allow the specification and
automatic generation of sophisticated RAID systems; known as WASP Nest, this
part of the project promises a new higher-level design methodology for commodity
RAIDs.
