The Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography will acquire new computer work stations and associated peripheral
equipment for shared use by a number of NSF-sponsored researchers. The upgrade
to the existing Apollo-based computer network will enhance the research
capabilities for a number of investigators. NSF- sponsored research that will
benefit from this acquisition and enhanced data processing capabilities involves
marine multi-channel seismic investigations, interpretation of mid- ocean ridge
processes, whole earth tomography, differential travel time analysis, space
geodesy, and other research areas. The equipment chosen for acquisition was
selected on the basis of compatibility with their existing system.
