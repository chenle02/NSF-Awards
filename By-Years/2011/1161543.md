This grant supports acquisition of an x-ray diffractometer to support geoscience
research and research training that requires the capability for rapid phase
identification of fine grained crystalline and polycrystalline materials and
crystallographic structure refinements for studies of phase transformations and
vacancy substitutions. The instrument will replace an aging (30 yrs old) and
obsolete XRD in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington
University in St. Louis. The instrument will serve the research and training
needs of multiple faculty at across seven departments at WASH-SL. The lead PIs
early career research will immediately benefit from a new XRD for studies of low
temperature mineralization and alteration of iron oxides and studies of
phyllomanganates, ferrous smectites and uranium phosphates with implications for
understanding contaminant fate in aquatic systems. The instrument will support
extant PI educational activities including undergraduate training and High-
school intern activities.
