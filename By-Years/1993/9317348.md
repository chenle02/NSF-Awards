9317348 Bain PI will map, document, and collect unusual lacustrine stromatolites
of Pennsylvanian age from a soon-to-be-reclaimed coal mine in Ohio. Petrologic,
x-ray, microprobe and isotope analyses will also provide information about these
Pennsylvanian-age non- marine water bodies and the growth of stromatolites in
general. Collected information can be compared to other ancient and modern
stromatolites, in particular in the Bahamas (San Salvador) lakes, where PI has
conducted research.
