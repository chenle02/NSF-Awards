Soil erosion reduces soil fertility, resulting in diminished agricultural
production that ultimately threatens food security. The cost of soil erosion in
the U.S. reaches tens of billions of dollars annually. Despite recognition of
the need to conserve soil, there are still major uncertainties regarding the
magnitude of soil erosion in the U.S. and there is virtually no information on
rates of soil formation in agricultural landscapes. Motivated by the need to
address basic research questions in human-impacted landscapes, the study will
assess the balance between soil erosion and formation rates in one of the
world's most agriculturally significant regions, the Midwestern U.S. The
research is integrated with an education plan that will train the next
generation of scientists to generate knowledge that helps society address
pressing sustainability problems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The lifespan of
agricultural soils will be assessed by quantifying the balance between soil
production and soil erosion rates at sites in multiple Midwestern states. A
suite of field and geochemical measurements will be used to quantify the
magnitude of soil loss, determine rates of soil production, and assess factors
that influence the storage of soil organic carbon. Field and geochemical data
will be used to calibrate numerical landscape evolution models that will be used
to make landscape scale predictions of carbon storage and the magnitude of soil
loss.
