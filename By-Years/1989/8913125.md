The analysis of coupling constants and the chemical shift data from a NMR
spectrometer provides basic understanding of the inter- and intra- molecular
dynamics associated with subtle changes in the environment of probe nuclei. The
NMR data help establish structure-function correlations in which the structural
elucidation of intermediates is critical for developing new synthetic schemes
for the preparation of bioactive compounds. The results of such analysis would
have impact in areas such as catalysis and drug design and development. This
award will allow the Department of Chemistry at California State University at
Northridge to acquire a high field multinuclear NMR spectrometer for research in
the following areas of chemistry: 1. Solution Dynamics of Mercury Bridged
Transition Metal Clusters 2. Low Temperature Protonations of Transition Metal
Clusters 3. Rates of Carbon-Metal Hydrogen Exchange in Trinuclear Clusters 4.
Stereospecific Synthesis of Biologically Active Phospholipids 5. NMR of
Nitroxide Spin Labels 6. Conformational Analysis of Pinnacolamines and Related
Compounds 7. NMR Studies of Membrane Lipids and Enzymes and the Metabolism in
Early Sea Urchin Development
