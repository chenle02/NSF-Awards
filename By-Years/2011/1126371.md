1126371&lt;br/&gt;Wright&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this MRI is to
purchase a combined, state-of-the-art high speed stereoscopic particle image
velocimetry system for for thermal-fluids research. The team of researchers
involves four faculty from Baylor University. The acquisition of this new
equipment, which provides excellent performance specifications for the flows to
be studied, would enhance the research capabilities of four researchers across
two departments. The PIs are qualified and have access to resources which
includes testing facilities where the new equipment would be utilized. Similar
lower cost systems have been implemented in these facilities and preliminary
data has been presented. There is a strong potential to advance knowledge in the
proposed research areas, and ito quantify the effect of rotation on cooling
applications in gas turbines.
