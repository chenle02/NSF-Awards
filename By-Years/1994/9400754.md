9400754 Miller This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates award in the mathematical sciences. Ten undergraduate
students will participate in an eight week program, having been selected from
applicants in a nationwide search. Following a period of introductory lectures
and computer familiarization, students will begin their research concentration
focusing on problems having a common theme. This year's activity is based on
computational and combinatorial aspects of group theory with applications to
geometry and topology. Students will be divided into small groups, each working
under supervision of at least one faculty advisor. Graduate students will also
be involved in mentoring activities, bringing their experience and closeness of
age to assist students not only with their research but also to give them first
hand advice regarding the graduate experience. Each team will prepare a final
written report and each undergraduate must make an oral presentation. Those
achieving the most success will be encouraged to participate in regional or
national meetings of professional societies. ***
