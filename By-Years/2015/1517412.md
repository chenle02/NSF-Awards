The primary scientific goal of the project is to determine the structure of
magnetic fields in very low-mass stars. This study will broaden our
understanding of how magnetic fields are generated in stars, which is currently
not well understood. This could also contribute to our understanding of the
Sun's magnetic field, which plays a key role in the potentially damaging solar
magnetic storms that reach Earth during periods of high solar activity. The
program will provide a graduate training opportunity for a student from a group
that is underrepresented in astronomy. Results from this program will be
integrated into a new undergraduate course being developed by the
PI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses a fundamental question in
stellar astrophysics: What is the nature of the surprisingly strong coronal
magnetic fields in very low-mass stars? The research program comprises two
parts. The first is an observational program to determine the dynamical spectra
of a selected sample of ultra-cool dwarf stars that exhibit pulsed radio
emission. The observations will utilize the Very Large Array to obtain wideband
spectra over several epochs to establish the stability of the pulse periods,
polarization, and morphology. The second part is the development of a realistic
magnetospheric model that will be used to create synthesized wideband spectra.
The model will include several plasma physics effects that have not been
previously considered, such as cold-plasma ray tracing and angular beaming
caused by density-depleted cavities. This scheme, denoted spectral tomography,
will compare synthetic dynamic spectra with observations to constrain the
geometry and plasma properties of the stellar magnetospheres.
