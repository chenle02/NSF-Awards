This dissertation research award will purchase a portable micro- computer,
printer, and supplies to aid the research of an anthropology graduate student in
Jamaica. The student's research is also supported by a Wenner-Gren and a
Fulbright award. The project is to analyze the interactions between men and
women in a relatively new "Family Court" run by the Jamaican government to
assure child support. Using participant observation, analysis of court records
and detailed case studies, interviews and cognitive tests, and birth
registration data, the student will analyze how this recent legal structure is
affecting gender relations. The project will study how the definition of
"father" is changing in response to these new laws, and whether the changing
legal definition of out-of-wedlock infants has affected the felt
responsibilities of men and women towards marriage and children. The increase in
children born out of wedlock is dramatic in many countries in the world.
Increased understanding of how legal structures affect young people's values and
behavior will help planners cope with these changing social patterns.
