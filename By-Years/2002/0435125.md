The quasi-periodic injection of energetic particles into the inner magnetosphere
has become one of the most interesting and controversial topics in
magnetospheric physics. These events, knows as "sawtooth events" and sometimes
as "periodic substorms" occur during geomagnetic storms when the interplanetary
magnetic field (IMF) has been southward for a prolonged period. This is a one-
year project to examine to what extent the apparent periodic of the phenomena
can be related to a driving periodic in the solar wind. If there is no driving
periodic in the solar wind it would indicate that the events are driven by some
as yet unidentified normal mode of the Earth's magnetosphere. The project will
examine energetic particle injections at synchronous orbit to determine which of
their characteristics are related to a solar-wind driver and which are better
described as arising due to magnetic substorms initiated deeper in the Earth's
magnetotail.
