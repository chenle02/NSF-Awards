This planning grant, submitted in conjunction with the Minority Research
Initiation program of the NSF, will provide for support to develop a research
proposal to address a Simulated Modelling Process (SMP). SMP is useful because
general purpose simulation languages required in simulation models of many
manufacturing systems do not adequately represent the complexity and detail
found in such systems.
