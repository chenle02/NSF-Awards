The principal investigator and coworkers will study mathematical and
computational issues of blind source separation algorithms of convolutive sound
mixtures. The convolutive sound mixtures appear in any enclosed environment when
there are multiple speakers. The goal is achieve dynamic separation of mixtures
and source recovery adaptively with no prior knowledge of the environment, based
on source independence and received data at multiple locations. Though the fast
Fourier transform helps to localize the problem in the frequency domain, and
separation is quite successful at each frequency with existing methods,
permutation and scaling issues remain indeterminate and may greatly influence
the separation quality. The investigators will use dynamically updated
statistical signal information to fix permutation, and minimization of mixing
filter lengths in the time domain to fix scaling. They will also study dynamic
algorithms in the time domain by optimizing mixing filter lengths and source
independence, as well as the dynamic stability and convergence of the recovered
mixing filters by using probability theory.

The project aims to develop algorithms to separate realistic sound mixtures, a
task that machines (computers) are unable to perform as well as humans. The
challenge, also known as the cocktail party problem, is fundamental to improving
the quality of modern hearing devices. For example, hearing aids and cochlear
implants are known to work well in quiet, however, they degrade rapidly when
there are competing sound sources. Even for normal hearing people, it is
difficult to carry out a conversation over a cell phone call that comes from a
rather noisy location such as a restaurant. Understanding the mathematics of
blind source separation and applying it to actual computation is a key step to
solution. The project bodes well in generating broad impact and making
mathematical contributions to the advancement of information technology and
biotechnology.
