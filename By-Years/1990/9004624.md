This project will support research on inverse problems in partial differential
equations. In particular the research will focus on the impedance tomography
problem, the problem of characterization of the Dirichlet to Neumann map, the
inverse conductivity problem for anisotropic conductivities in dimensions
greater than or equal to three, and related problems in inverse scattering and
inverse problems that arise in differential geometry. When an electric potential
is applied to the surface of a conducting body, the resulting current flux
across the surface depends on the internal resistance of the body. For this
reason, voltage and current measurements made on the boundary of an object can
be used to probe the internal structure of the body. The problem is to determine
as much information as possible about the internal resistivity from measurements
of voltage potentials and corresponding current fluxes at the boundary. This
problem, often referred to as impedance computed tomography or electrical
impedance imaging, arose in geophysics from attempts to determine the
composition of the earth. More recently, it has been proposed as a potentially
valuable diagnostic tool for the medical and biological sciences.
