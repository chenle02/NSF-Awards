Chemotaxis is a remarkable process -- a small amount of a chemical cue in the
environment can direct a cell or organism movement towards the source, like the
smell of freshly baked bread draws us into the kitchen. The goal of our work is
to understand the basic mechanism of chemotaxis using a simple model system for
our studies, the social amoeba Dictyostelium. The chemotaxis pathway is highly
conserved from amoebae to humans so what we learn from the amoebae can teach us
about chemotaxis is a wide variety of organisms. A new player in the chemotaxis
pathway named MyoG has been identified in Dictyostelium. MyoG is a member of a
family of proteins called myosins that work as molecular motors, generating
movements within cells. Our objective is to determine the role of MyoG in
transmitting signals from outside of the cell to the machinery inside that is
responsible for directing cell movement. Determining how and where MyoG acts in
the chemotaxis pathway and identifying what other proteins it works in concert
with will provide new information about the chemotaxis pathway. We will also
search for similar proteins in mammalian cells as a first step towards
understanding the fundamental mechanism of chemotaxis and how it has been so
highly conserved through millions of years of
evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed project will be
used to introduce students at all levels (from high school through graduate
school) to basic research methods and practice. Young students will work one-on-
one with the PI on several subprojects specifically tailored to each student's
talents. Each student will be taught scientific methods, encouraged to think
through and answer their own questions, formulate new questions, and summarize
results as the project proceeds. The PI actively participates in the development
of lectures and laboratory modules for International Training Courses in Cell
Biology &amp; Biochemistry in Latin America based on the chemotaxis project. The
goal of these courses is to foster interactions and relationships between US and
South American students and investigators. Finally, a central web resource for
information about the myosin superfamily, the Myosin Home Page, will be adopted,
updated and maintained. It will serve as a comprehensive resource for students
and non-myosin researchers to gain basic information about the function of
individual members of the large myosin superfamily of molecular motors.
