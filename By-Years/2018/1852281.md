The analysis of a variety of problems in science and engineering, ranging from
population and statistical physics models to the analysis of queueing systems,
computer networks and the internet, leads to mathematical structures known as
distributional equations. In most instances, these distributional equations
cannot be solved analytically, and their solutions need to be computed
numerically, e.g., via stochastic simulation. However, in many cases,
traditional simulation methods require such an extraordinary number of
computations that they become intractable, and therefore there is a need to
develop more efficient alternatives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work that will be
funded through this award focuses in a particular type of distributional
equations, known as branching stochastic fixed-point equations (BSFPEs). These
equations appear naturally in the study of locally tree-like graphs, and are
related to the analysis of weighted branching processes. The proposed work
consists in developing and analyzing new stochastic simulation methods to
compute the solutions to a large class of BSFPEs. In particular, the principal
investigator will provide convergence guarantees and mechanisms to compute
confidence intervals for iterative bootstrap-type algorithms, as well as develop
new importance sampling algorithms for the estimation of rare events. The new
algorithms will be easy to implement by scientists and engineers working on a
wide range of problems.
