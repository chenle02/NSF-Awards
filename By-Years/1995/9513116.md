This award will support travel of ten Americans to a U.S.-France workshop on
engineering sciences in Orleans, France, October 15-19, 1995, organized by David
Channell of the University of Texas at Dallas and Iskendar Gokalp of the Center
of Engineering Sciences, the French National Center for Scientific Research. The
workshop will address the relationship between science and technology in the
modern industrialized world and the role of engineering sciences as an
intermediary in the transfer of knowledge and discoveries to technology. Using
prepared papers as the basis of discussion, the participants will compare and
analyze the cognitive and organizational structure of engineering sciences in
France and in the United States since 1970. The workshop includes a mix of
researchers and engineers from universities and industry, scholars of the
philosophy and history of science and engineering from the U.S. and France. Each
participant contributes his or her own perspective to these issues. Their
interaction will advance understanding of the relationships between science and
technology and the strategies used by researchers and engineers in scientific
and technological problem-solving.
