The Hawaiian Islands with their populations of endemic Drosophila species
provide an ideal natural laboratory for studying evolution and ecological
adaptations. The vitellogenin or yolk protein genes of these diverse Hawaiian
flies comprise an exceptional model system for analyzing mechanisms and rates of
gene evolution in higher organisms. The members of this gene cluster, encoding
three vitellogenin proteins, are subject to strict developmental regulation,
which controls timing, tissue- specificity and rates of vitellogenin synthesis
to coordinate egg maturation of each species with its particular ecological
habitat. The proposed research will use the most recently developed techniques
of molecular biology to expedite determination of DNA sequences of these genes
in nine species and assay levels of sequence variation within and between
populations of two species. DNA sequence comparisons will identify the molecular
basis of interspecific differences in vitellogenin gene structure and function.
Gene changes between species will be related to adaptive shifts in host plants
and reproductive strategies, the goal being to distinguish the roles played by
various types of DNA sequences in species evolution. Comparisons of phylogenies
constructed using divergence in coding versus control sequences will test the
hypothesis that regulatory changes in the genome are more closely aligned with
adaptive and phylogenetic change.
