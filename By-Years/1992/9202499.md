The Fellow will use argon methods to date the cessation of ductile deformation
in compressional orogens in an attempt to make new contributions toward
understanding the evolution of fault systems. Structural geologists have shown
that the locus of deformation migrates in the deforming crust through time.
During different stages of deformation, different parts of the fault system may
be active. Study will be made of micas that nucleate and grow during deformation
below the temperature of significant argon loss in order to track this late
migration of ductile deformation. The Fellow will work at the University of
California at Los Angeles during the tenure of this fellowship.
