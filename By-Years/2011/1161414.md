This research project is on enumerative and algebraic combinatorics, a fast
developing area in contemporary mathematics. The PI explores a series of
interrelated enumeration problems on various combinatorial structures, including
permutations, matchings, set partitions, integer sequences, general graphs, and
fillings of Ferrers boards and other polyominoes. Throughout mathematics a
common and successful approach to studying some objects of interest is to study
functions on those objects. In combinatorics such functions are often called
combinatorial statistics. This research project emphasizes on the algebraic
properties of combinatorial statistics and their connections to other branches
of mathematics. The major topics include (1) developing an algebraic theory for
the interpolating families between equidistributed combinatorial statistics, (2)
studying descent sets and descent polynomials for various combinatorial
structures and their relations to the emerging field of one-dependent
determinantal point processes, (3) characterizing the crossing and nestings in
combinatorial structures with applications in graph optimizations and
computational mathematical biology.

The proposed research is in the center of combinatorics, which is a branch of
mathematics concerning the existence, enumeration, analysis, and optimization of
discrete structures. The investigator uses a combined algebraic and
combinatorial approach to investigate properties and statistics of many discrete
structures, and brings coherence and unity to the discipline of combinatorics.
Results of the proposed research have connections and applications to such
classical areas of mathematics as algebra, group representation theory, number
theory, and probability theory, as well as more applied subjects, notably
computer science, graph encoding and drawing, VLSI design, and mathematical
biology.
