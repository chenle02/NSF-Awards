Edgar H. Brown will extend real and rational homotopy theory and apply it to
classifying spaces coming from Lie algebras and foliations. Jerome Levine will
study problems in link concordance, algebraic closure of groups and proposed new
link invariants. Kiyoshi Igusa plans to continue his investigation into the
relationship between algebraic K-theory and smooth manifolds. He also intends to
apply algebraic K-theory and cyclic homology to the representation theory of
finite dimensional algebras. Daniel Ruberman will continue his work on gauge
theory and geometric invariants of 3-manifolds. Applications in knot theory, and
the study of surfaces in 4-manifolds will be pursued.
