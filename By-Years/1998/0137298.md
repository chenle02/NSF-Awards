This project will take advantage of advanced technologies
and&lt;br/&gt;strategies proven successful in online role-playing games to
create&lt;br/&gt;exciting opportunities for children in an after school context.
There are&lt;br/&gt;almost no examples of learning environments that build on
lessons and&lt;br/&gt;strategies from the commercial success of 3D online, role-
playing games,&lt;br/&gt;environments that are populated by tens of thousands of
users each day.&lt;br/&gt;Leveraging 3-D technologies and principles so
successful for the gaming&lt;br/&gt;community to develop educationally
meaningful environments is a topic of&lt;br/&gt;which we, as an educational
community, know very little and which has much&lt;br/&gt;potential to engage
typically underrepresented groups in SMT learning.&lt;br/&gt;This work is
exploratory and has exciting potential both in terms of its&lt;br/&gt;direct
service to the disadvantaged children at the local Boys and
Girls&lt;br/&gt;Clubs and in terms of the broader implications of the research
to inform&lt;br/&gt;the education community.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Our 18 month
relationship with the Boys and Girls Clubs is currently&lt;br/&gt;strong and
recently Compaq and Microsoft donated $100,000 in equipment,&lt;br/&gt;software,
and service to both local Boys and Girls Clubs to create&lt;br/&gt;Technology
Centers. The Quest Atlantis program is viewed as an
exciting&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to integrate the computers in Club programming,
and staff, and&lt;br/&gt;space will be committed to the project. Continuing this
relationship and&lt;br/&gt;leveraging this still-new technology and the current
interest in&lt;br/&gt;innovating with this equipment and software creates a
timely opportunity.
