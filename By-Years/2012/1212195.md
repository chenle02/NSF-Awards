Although cosmic rays were discovered almost a century ago the details of where
and how they are accelerated and how they propagate to us remain somewhat
mysterious. Acceleration can occur in many cosmic sources, including spinning,
magnetized neutron stars, massive black holes, gamma ray bursts, shock waves
expanding from supernova explosions, and even similar but larger shocks
surrounding clusters of galaxies. The field is being revitalized by recent
discoveries, and by greatly improved measurements of the spectra and composition
of cosmic rays. This project is a theoretical investigation of cosmic particle
acceleration mechanisms spanning several sites and responding to recent
observations. It will explore the mechanism known as unipolar induction, and
analyze in detail how particles can acquire energy and momentum in very small
steps, such as in the vicinity of shock fronts. Qualitatively new types of
magnetic reconnection and relativistic shock fronts will be studied using both
simple analysis and more detailed simulations. The results should help to
explain recent surprising observations of cosmic sources, throughout the seventy
octave electromagnetic spectrum and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These problems
have been only partially understood despite a century of attention, and tackling
them both observationally and through simulation will require quite
sophisticated tools. The work links broadly to the study of solar weather, and
of magnetic and inertial fusion, topics of strong public interest and societal
concern. A student will receive valuable training in plasma astrophysics, which
is a good preparation for many other fields.
