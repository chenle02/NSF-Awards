This award renews the CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at
Harvey Mudd College. A team of computer science faculty mentors have designed a
10-week summer REU program in the broad area of computer systems. The summer
research activity gives students a taste of the most compelling parts of a
graduate school experience as well as an immersive experience in the field of
computer science. The student research projects cover a breadth of areas in
computing science. The students will gain experience in all aspects of the
process of conducting research. The site will target students early in their
undergraduate studies and the faculty is committed to engaging students from
groups traditionally under-represented in computing. The program features
individual and group activities that create a strong common-cohort experience
for students for whom the REU experience should be transformative. The program
develops research ability, improves presentation and communications skills, and
nurtures student interest in research-related careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit of the project revolves around the variety of systems
projects through which students will be exposed to all aspects of the research
process. The research focus areas include text simplification, machine learning,
robotics, program analysis, computational creativity, domain-specific
programming languages, and active transportation planning. Each project connects
with the systems theme, building atop existing platforms, melding theory and
practice, and implementing designs to mitigate complexity. The projects are
designed to be accessible to students early in their undergraduate careers and
share principles of low-cost and low-overhead, external accessibility of
deliverables, and narrowness of focus. The students engage in projects that are
exciting, current, and externally relevant and that have clear applications.
Students actively pursue the entire research process including literature
search, digesting prior work, formulating new problems, designing and conducting
investigations, and preparing presentations and publications of results. The REU
cohorts will regularly share their work with each other and meet daily with
faculty mentors. The project activities will permit students to acquire valuable
professional development skills, gain a broader and deeper understanding of
research, and develop greater confidence in their abilities as future computing
professionals and researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
