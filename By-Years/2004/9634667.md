9634667 Black Anomalous weather regimes are an important component of the short
term climate system, causing persistent extremes in regional weather. Where many
studies have focused on the maintenance of persistent weather patterns, under
this award, the principal investigator (PI) will consider the full time
evolution of these systems and the processes responsible for their evolution. In
this study, the PI will analyze both gridded observational data sets and model
simulations produced with the Community Climate Model (CCM) of the National
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The detailed analyses will done using a
reformulated (for nonconservative flow on a sphere) version of a methodology
known as piecewise tendency diagnosis. They will be focused on determining the
roles of diabatic and frictional processes in regime transitions. In addition,
Dr. Black will conduct numerical experiments in which the model's sensitivity to
initial large-scale anomaly structure and model physics are assessed. The
results of this study are likely to provide important insights into the
intraseasonal variability of the midlatitude troposphere which will allow
improvements in extended range weather forecasting. ***
