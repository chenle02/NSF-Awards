Theoretical studies of the scattering of electrons from one and two electron
targets are proposed. Investigations include the calculation of differential
cross sections and angle and spin dependent correlation functions for the n=2
and n=3 levels of hydrogen, impact ionization of hydrogen, rate coefficients for
excitation of hydrogenic ions, elastic and inelastic scattering of electrons by
He and the profiles of spectral lines of hydrogen like ions in a plasma.
