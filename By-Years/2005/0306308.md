The overall goal of this research program is to use precise laser spectroscopy
on the 1s-2s transition to probe for any tiny difference between antihydrogen
atoms and hydrogen atoms, thereby providing the most sensitive tests of CPT
(Charge conjugation, Parity, and Time reversal) invariance with baryons and
leptons. The antihydrogen is formed in a nested Penning trap called ATRAP
(Antihydrogen TRAP). ATRAP uses antiprotons from CERN's Antiproton Decelerator,
and positrons from a radioactive source, to produce the cold antihydrogen. With
the successful demonstration in 2002 of the formation of antihydrogen, the focus
now turns to optimizing the production of antihydrogen and obtaining the first
antihydrogen spectroscopy. The broad impacts of the program spans from the
training of students to the impact of solenoid design on medical imaging to the
education of the public on antimatter physics.
