Mathematical Sciences (21) The Core Mathematics project focuses on improving the
4-semester core mathematics program at the U.S. Military Academy by adapting and
implementing the program embodied in the text "Principles and Practice of
Mathematics" by the Consortium for Mathematics and its Applications (COMAP). The
core program focuses on problem-solving through modeling and inquiry, supported
by mathematical concepts and techniques. This real-world, problem-based
mathematics program emphasizes the breadth and variety of mathematics to develop
students into competent, confident problem solvers in the social and decision
sciences as well as in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
(STEM) areas; and to promote the process of life-long learning. The concepts and
techniques of calculus, algebra, trigonometry, geometry, discrete mathematics,
probability, statistical reasoning are supporting tools for problem-solving in
the core mathematics program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program involves 2000
students and 50 faculty members each semester. The courseware developed under
this program includes modeling scenarios, assessment procedures for measuring
problem-solving growth, and an annotated syllabus of a four-semester core
mathematics curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;
