9602989 Micha This Americas Program award will fund travel and related expenses
for 15 U.S. and Latin American research scientists and advanced doctoral
students to participate in a workshop on recent developments in the theoretical
and computational aspects of molecular and materials sciences. The workshop,
organized by Dr. David Micha, University of Florida with the collaboration of
senior scientists of several Latin American institutions, will take place at the
campus of the University of Florida, on February 27 and 28, 1997. The purpose is
to promote scientific contacts between scientists in the U.S. and Latin America,
aimed at developing theoretical and computational methods applicable to problems
of common interest in these sciences. Materials science is a priority area both
for this country and throughout the hemisphere, and the topics to be discussed
will address new methods to interpret data and to predict phenomena in several
areas of theoretical chemistry. A book of the proceedings abstracts, including a
summary of discussion comments on present needs and expected future trends, will
be made available to scientists. ***
