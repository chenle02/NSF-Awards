9451937 Ott The Evergreen State College proposes to improve and expand its
upper-division laboratory instruction in physiology by purchasing nine networked
work stations to enhance student explorations in muscle, cardiac, respiratory
and neurophysiology. Each station will include a computer with the necessary
transducers, hardware and software. The College's curriculum consists primarily
of full-time integrated, interdisciplinary programs. Instruction in laboratory
physiology centers on an upper-division program integrating physiology,
molecular biology, organic and biochemistry. A second program emphasizes
neurophysiology integrated with cognition and philosophy. Laboratories in both
programs will be greatly improved by allowing the collection and immediate
analysis of a variety of physiological data such as electroencephalograms,
electrocardiograms and electromyograms. Advanced students, also currently
hampered by the lack of sophisticated equipment, can follow up on proposed
experiments. The new instruments will provide much broader and more up-to-date
laboratory instruction than currently available and will greatly strengthen a
program that has been very successful in preparing many students for more
advanced studies.
