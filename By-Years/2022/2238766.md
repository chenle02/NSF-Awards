The dynamics of quantum systems in continuous time are ubiquitous in quantum
physics, quantum chemistry, quantum biology, and quantum information science. In
these fields, all realistic quantum systems are coupled to an uncontrollable
environment in a non-negligible way. These&lt;br/&gt;systems are known as open
quantum systems. However, the majority of studies of quantum systems have
focused on an idealized model where the systems are isolated from the
environment, referred to as closed quantum systems. A significant challenge
remains in studying these realistic open quantum systems from a computational
perspective, as existing technical tools and models are primarily designed for
closed systems. To address this challenge, this project will develop novel
mathematical frameworks and quantum computing techniques to model, analyze, and
characterize the behavior of open quantum systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will advance the study of continuous-time open quantum systems in
several important directions, including simulating their dynamics, harnessing
their computational powers, and characterizing their computational capabilities.
The overarching goal is to establish the computational and mathematical
treatments of such systems to push the study of quantum computation far beyond
the Hamiltonian regime for broader applications. Specific goals of this project
include: developing novel techniques for simulating open quantum systems;
discovering further algorithmic applications of continuous-time open quantum
systems; identifying the physical implications of evolving open quantum systems;
and characterizing the computational capabilities of open quantum
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
