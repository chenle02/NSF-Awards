In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Susanne Striegler of the University of
Arkansas at Fayetteville studies selected glyconoamidines as putative transition
state analogs of glycoside hydrolysis reactions, evaluates copper(II) complexes
as catalysts for glycoside hydrolysis in alkaline solution and investigates
microgels catalysts derived from inverse miniemulsions. The research encompasses
synthesis, spectroscopic evaluation, molecular recognition and material science
and provides training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.

The proposed catalysts are of outstanding scientific and industrial interest and
are expected to provide a novel platform for a shortened synthesis of
glycoconjugates and biomarkers of potential pharmacological importance as a long
term goal. Further broader impacts on society include outreach efforts of the
team to local high and middle schools, and the development of new classroom
teaching styles to facilitate student retention, increase graduate rate, and
decrease costs and preparation time until graduation.
