The objective of this program is to investigate the soliton dynamics in mid-
infrared quantum-cascade lasers. The soliton effect originates in the
cancellation between the group velocity dispersion and self-phase modulation.
Such effect may play a key role in the generation of ultra-short pulses by mid-
infrared quantum-cascade lasers, which are important to major applications such
as biomedical sensing and environmental control. The elucidation of the
underlying physics may therefore enable a new class of compact ultrafast lasers
in the mid-infrared region since group velocity dispersion and self-phase
modulation are simultaneously present in the same structure and are both
associated with the intersubband transitions in quantum-cascade lasers.

The intellectual merit is that the proposed research will make significant
contributions to the understanding of ultrafast dynamics in quantum cascade
lasers. Such devices are of intense interest for mid-infrared and far-infrared
continuous-wave as well as for short-pulsed sources. The transformative of this
research is that results from the investigation could be applied to design a new
type of quantum cascade laser medium yielding shortened mid-infrared pulses
through bandgap engineering. The design will be pursued through the
collaboration with an experimental group.

The broader impacts are in providing excellent multidisciplinary training in the
area of nanophotonics within a research environment. Two Master?s students are
expected to participate in this research. This program will also provide
training opportunities for local K-12 teachers and high-school students through
workshops. The results from the proposed research will be published in the
scientific and engineering literature and presented at conferences.
