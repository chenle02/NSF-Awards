This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Michigan State U in the purchase of a
quantum chemical visualization system. Specific areas of research include: (1)
Simulations of Excess Electrons in Condensed Matter; (2) Modeling the Structure
and Properties of Complex Biological Membrane Systems; (3) Magnetic Materials
from Ionophoric Organic Radicals; (4) The Electronic and Geometric Structure of
Diatomic and Small Polyatomic Molecules Containing a First Transition Series
Element; and (5) Structure and Properties of Lipopolysaccharides. The computer
hardware and software in the quantum mechanical visualization system allows one
to simulate interactions that take place in molecules in a real laboratory
environment and to present these interactions in a visual manner.
