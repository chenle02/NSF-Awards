Until now, seismic Modelling of three dimensional Earth structure and the study
of mantle convection have been performed separately, with the latter
occasionally employing, a posteriori, the results of the former. One objective
of this project is to further advance understanding of mantle dynamics by
performing simultaneous inversions of long-period seismic waveform data and
geodynamic data consisting of the observed plate velocities and nonhydrostatic
geoid. The second objective is to further refine previous treatments of viscous
flow in the mantle. The simultaneous consideration of seismic and geodynamic
data will help to stabilize the seismic inverions in those geographical areas
that are poorly resolved and it will also allow one to address important issues
in solid-Earth physics and geodyamics.
