This award from the Office of Special Projects of the Division of Chemistry
provides funds to enable strong U.S. representation at the Thirty.Second
Congress of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) which
will meet in Stockholm, Sweden, August 2.7, 1989. To ensure that the United
States will be represented with quality and distinction, and that younger
chemists have an opportunity to participate, the U.S. National Committee for
IUPAC will, through the offices of the National Academy of Sciences . National
Research Council, organize a travel award program and utilize funds from this
NSF grant to provide partial support for selected U.S. chemists, particularly
younger ones, attending this meeting. This activity contributes to the
infrastructure of the chemical sciences and facilitates interactions between the
U.S. chemical community and its international counterparts.
