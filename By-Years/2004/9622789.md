This study will link the distribution, pattern of movement, and resource use of
martens in different forest habitats using Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
in order to determine the marten's response to habitat change at varying spatial
scales. We will determine the scale at which marten movement is most sensitive
to the arrangement of physical and vegetation structure, characteristics that
are frequently altered by human use of forest lands. Most data will be gathered
during the winter when martens show strongly selective patterns of movement and
resource use. Our methods will combine snowtracking of martens and DNA
'fingerprinting" from fur samples collected by hairsnares to estimate abundance
and movement in relation to habitat structure determined from NASA satellite
imagery and U. S. Forest Service data. Models will be developed to evaluate how
the scale of vegetative and weather variables explicitly influence marten
resource use, and how varying levels of forest fragmentation influence movement
patterns and population dispersion relative to landscape attributes. The non-
intrusive, low-cost methods employed by this study are unique additions to
forest ecology and management, and will play an important role as we move to
large-scale and long-term management of sustainable ecosystems and regions.
