In recent decades scholarship has revealed the various ways that technologies
may influence cultures, but rather less attention has been devoted to the
complementary question, how does culture shape technology? Yet this question is
at the heart of the history of technology, which aims to understand the design
and invention process. Beginning with the well-established premise that
technical criteria and economic forces are not sufficient in themselves to
explain technical choices, this project proposes to elucidate the role of
symbolism in bringing cultural forces to bear on technologies. The final product
will be a framework that integrates the varied and scattered work on this topic,
preparing the ground for subsequent empirical investigation.
