The objective of this award is to support the logistics portion of a virtual
workshop that will bring together researchers from the United States and the
United Kingdom in the field of artificial Intelligence (AI). The goal of the
workshop is to identify priorities for collaborative research in AI, develop an
agenda to develop new research areas, build upon existing collaborations and
establish practices for continuous engagement around sharing of new research and
development breakthroughs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will take place
virtually over two days in May 2022. The workshop will bring together about 20
researchers from the United States and about 20 researchers from the United
Kingdom. Each session in the workshop will include presentations from the
researchers, as well as roundtable discussions to identify key areas of research
and set the framework for a collaborative agenda in
AI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
