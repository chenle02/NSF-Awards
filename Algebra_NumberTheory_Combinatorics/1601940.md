This project concerns several problems at the interface of algebraic geometry
and number theory. There is a rich interplay between these two fields which are
at the center of many of the most important past and current developments in
mathematics. A number of important problems in number theory, such as questions
about the number of solutions of Diophantine equations, can be reinterpreted in
geometric terms allowing for the use of powerful tools from algebraic geometry.
Conversely, many important geometric questions are motivated by arithmetic
applications; for example, questions about the geometry of so-called moduli
spaces. The proposed work has connections to other parts of mathematics, such as
representation theory, combinatorics, and mathematical physics.

More specifically, the project explores four principal areas related to this
interplay between arithmetic and geometry. In collaboration with other experts
form this field, the PI will investigate the arithmetic of algebraic varieties
and its relationship with derived categories of coherent sheaves, building on
earlier work on K3 surfaces. The PI will study the main components of moduli
spaces, and various generalizations of log geometry. A third part of the project
is aimed at understanding the motivic nature of sheaves on algebraic varieties
over finite fields, and various invariants thereof. In the fourth part, which is
more foundational in nature, the PI will work with collaborators on a new
approach to the development of a six operations formalism for l-adic sheaves on
stacks.
