This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes the
development of an entirely new MEMS (Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems) pressure
sensor architecture that is capable of providing a combination of sensitivity
and dynamic range much beyond the state-of-the-art. The sensor structure is made
small and light enough to be able to move under the influence of the pressure
bombardment in a manner that can be recorded by phase sensitive electronics. The
differential pressure is eliminated so that there is no net average force on the
transducer membrane and hence no DC term in the output. A purely electrical
measurement technique that exploits the change in the structure's capacitance as
the membrane moves will be used. The proposed detection approach is a phase
measurement technique; promising very high sensitivity and noise immunity.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The worldwide market for compact pressure sensors is in
excess of $2.5B and extends from low-cost consumer products to high-end
scientific and military systems. For all applications, low-cost, small-size, and
especially low power dissipation are essential. &lt;br/&gt;
