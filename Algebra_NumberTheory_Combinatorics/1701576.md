This research project concerns interactions between number theory and geometry,
with connections to physics. Number theory is discrete and geometry is
continuous, but continuous structures can be fruitfully approximated by discrete
structures through finer and finer approximations. Intermediate discrete models
can exhibit both (discrete) number theoretic and (continuous) geometric
properties. In this way, number theory connects with discrete geometric
structures, via packings, leading to connections with problems in materials
science. Certain finite discrete models in large sizes have parallels with
exactly solvable models in physics that exhibit phase transitions when a
temperature parameter is varied, as between water and ice. The projects in this
proposal investigate a number of specific problems related to these analogies in
order to bridge the discrete and the continuous in various limits. This work
will lead to fruitful interactions with researchers in geometry, physics and
material science and will support the training of graduate students in number
theory and in discrete geometry.

In more detail, the PI will investigate several topics relating number theory
and geometry. The first, and main, topic continues the investigation of the
Lerch zeta function, which is a function of three variables, that on
specializing variables yields both the Hurwitz zeta function and the Riemann
zeta function. This research is based on a recently discovered connection
between these functions and representations of the real Heisenberg group and
related solvable groups. The project will study generalizations of the Lerch
zeta function to automorphic representations of various higher-dimensional Lie
groups, via zeta integrals. A second topic concerns the study of various
discrete finite models of arithmetic structures, typically with two variables,
and the study of statistics of such models as their size increases, pursuing an
analogy with integrable systems in statistical mechanics. A third topic concerns
intra-universal Teichmuller theory introduced by Mochizuki. This new theory will
be reformulated from a more accessible analytic perspective. A fourth topic
concerns circle packings on Riemann surfaces. The PI will study scaling limits
of perfect finite circle packings in two directions: a complex variables limit
and a Diophantine approximation limit. These limits will be determined
precisely. How they are related will also be determined.
