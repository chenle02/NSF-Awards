The objective of the REU program at the University of California, Irvine, is to
provide hands-on experience in active research to ten undergraduate students.
The undergraduate students will conduct research in combustion and propulsion
under the guidance of a supervising faculty member. A special attribute of the
program is the close alliance of the research to 1) practical application, and
2) industrial collaboration. A second special feature of the program is the
fostering of independence in research; the development of communication skills;
the promotion of intuitive and innovative skills; experiences in budgeting,
purchasing, and scheduling; and the development of accepting, adapting to, and
resolving the challenges that arise in the conduct of research. The selection
process is geared to promote the involvement of students of Chicano heritage and
females.
