Lotteries are used to distribute billions of dollars annually in cash prizes, as
well as important resources including immigration visas, school placements and
assignments of judges to appeal cases. One would like to have public confidence
that these lotteries were conducted fairly, specifically that the results were
random and without bias and that they were not predictable or secretly known
prior to their official announcement. Today, nearly all lotteries either provide
no technical assurance to the public whatsoever or rely on ancient means of
physical randomness generation such as rolling dice or spinning wheels. This
project will build a solid scientific foundation for cryptographically
verifiable lotteries that can provide strong assurance, even to remote
observers, that a lottery was fair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do so, this project
will develop new tools from the emerging field of temporal (time-based)
cryptography, including verifiable delay functions and timed commitments.
Temporal cryptography is a powerful building block for distributed randomness
protocols and other applications, but key questions remain on how to
parameterize and analyze such protocols. Second, the project will develop the
theory of temporal cryptography and consider its relation to classic bounds and
impossibility results on randomness generation, consensus and general multiparty
computation protocols. Finally, this project will build a practical
understanding of lottery requirements and user expectations through empirical
study of lottery mechanisms and user studies to understand current expectations
and reactions to cryptographic verifiability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
