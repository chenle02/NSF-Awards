This award is made to the University of California at Davis in support of a
national career planning workshop for underrepresented minority undergraduate
chemistry majors. The workshop to be held July 25-28, 1996, at the Davis campus
is the third such workshop, the first having been held in 1992 at Purdue
University and the second at UC Davis in 1994. The objective is to bring
minority students together with high-achieving minority mentors from industry,
academia, and government in order to introduce the students to the opportunities
created by obtaining an advanced degree in chemistry. The workshop will be
hosted by the University of California Davis Chemistry Department and will
provide opportunities for the student participants to observe graduate research,
advanced laboratory instrumentation, and to meet with graduate students to
discuss areas of mutual interest. This award is viewed as a way of encouraging
qualified minority undergraduates to continue their studies in chemistry by
introducing them to successful minority role-models in a supportive setting. The
longer term objective is to increase the participation of minorities in careers
in chemistry that require advanced education.
