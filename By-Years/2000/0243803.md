0243803 Gupta&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a five-year Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Maryland for
fifteen students each summer for twelve weeks for research opportunities at the
university's Institute for Systems Research. Students at colleges, universities,
and community colleges will be recruited nationwide through a process involving
efforts to reach students who would otherwise not have access to a research
experience. The program incorporates activities that will involve participants
in the following research directions of the institute: global communications
systems, sensor-actuator networks, next-generation product realization systems,
societal infrastructure systems, and cross-disciplinary systems education.
Through the program students will be able to (1) establish a basis for systems
thinking by conducting research and thus understand systems engineering as a
discipline; (2) acquire broader and deeper understanding of both the research
process and the practice of engineering and how new knowledge is created and
communicated; (3) develop multicultural understanding and team competence and
become aware of the societal implications of research; and (5) successfully seek
admission in a four-year program and/or graduate school.&lt;br/&gt;
