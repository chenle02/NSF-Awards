This is a one-year collaborative research project between Dr. George Collins,
Colorado State University and Professor Shi Binxing, Tsinghua University. This
project plans to study the laser field using powerful continuous UV sources.
This study tests a new approach which couples a magnetron discharge with
auxiliary e-beam pumping. The goal is to develop single device laser operating
in the UV and VUV spectral region. If successful, these will be used for many
scientific and technological applications, including cell sorting, drug
processing, direct photolithography, etc. This is a collaborative study jointly
support by the NSF and the Chinese State Education Commission. U;.
