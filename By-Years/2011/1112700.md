In this project, research in the algorithm design and analysis of high order
numerical methods, including the finite difference and finite volume weighted
essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes and discontinuous Galerkin finite
element methods, for solving hyperbolic and other convection dominated partial
differential equations, will be carried out. While the emphasis of this project
is on algorithm design and analysis, close attention will be paid to efficient
parallel implementation and applications. The intellectual merit of the proposed
activity lies in its comprehensive coverage of algorithm development, analysis,
implementation and applications. Problems in applications motivate the design of
new algorithms or new features in existing algorithms; mathematics tools are
used to analyze these algorithms to give guidelines for their applicability and
limitations; practical considerations including parallel implementation issues
are addressed to make the algorithms competitive in large scale calculations;
and collaborations with engineers and other applied scientists enable the
efficient application of these new algorithms or new featuresin existing
algorithms.

The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity will be a suite of
powerful computational tools, suitable for various applications with involving
convection dominated partial differential equations, in adaptive, multiscale and
uncertain environments. These tools are expected to make positive contributions
to computer simulations of the complicated solution structure in these
applications. The application areas include (but are not limited to)
computational fluid dynamics, traffic flow problems, semiconductor device
simulations, and computational biology. Graduate students will be involved in
this project, and will get training in performing mathematics research on
problems closely related to applications. Special attention will be paid to the
recruitment and training of Ph.D. students from under-represented groups
including women.
