The purpose of this fundamental bioengineering research is to produce a
mechanical engineering model of the ossicles bones of the inner ear. Such a
model is important and necessary in the investigation of the pathological states
of the inner ear. The PI will initiate a research program of experimental and
theoretical investigations designed to illuminate the dynamics of the ossicular
chain.
