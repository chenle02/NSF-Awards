New and emerging solid-state non-volatile (NV) technologies such as NAND Flash
and Phase Change Memory create a new class of high-speed storage devices, both
as traditional I/O systems and as extensions of system main memory. To make best
use of these technologies in tomorrow's computers we need to be able to model
and understand their behavior in such systems, and create algorithms and
architectures which leverage their strengths while compensating for their
weaknesses.

This work (a) investigates models and algorithms for system behavior of solid-
state persistent memory technologies, to achieve performance, reliability, and
functionality not possible with today's techniques, (b) examines alternate
models for OS-to-storage interfaces to make best use of NV technology
characteristics, and (c) researches new operating system algorithms for managing
the novel memory model presented by mixing NV and DRAM technologies at the main-
memory level within a system.

The coming transition from disk to low-latency solid-state storage as the
primary persistent media in computer systems presents an opportunity for
transformative changes in the way applications make use of storage; the goal of
this research is to achieve such changes, rather than the incremental
improvements possible via the disk emulation strategy used with these
technologies to date. Research results will include open-source software and
hardware; the project also involves development of curricula for undergraduate
operating systems education and student involvement at the secondary,
undergraduate, and graduate level.
