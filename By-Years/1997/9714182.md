9714182 Liu It is proposed to develop a finite element model for computing
harbor oscillations induced by nonlinear transient waves. Vertically integrated
two-dimensional continuity and momentum equations, describing fully nonlinear
and weakly dispersive waves, are the basis of the numerical model. Since the
incident waves are allowed to be irregular waves with a wide range of frequency
components, the model has the capability of examining the excitation and
resonance of the long wave components of the incident waves as well as the free
and bound infragravity waves generated inside the harbor through nonlinearity.
During the development of the numerical model both the frequency domain and the
time domain approaches will be investigated. The final numerical model will also
include the following practical components: bottom friction, dissipative
(absorbing) boundaries, and harbor entrance loss. Special attention will be paid
to the treatment of the open boundary condition in the offshore region. Pre- and
post-processors will be developed so that users can easily modify the input data
including the bathymetry data, harbor geometry and the incident wave conditions.
Graphic displays of input information and numerical solutions will also be
included in the post- processors. The entire software package is aimed to be a
useful and practical design tool for harbor engineers and planners. ***
