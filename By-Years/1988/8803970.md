Louisiana Tech University will provide research experiences for eight
undergraduates in exploring the connection between randomness and fractional
dimensions, particularly the connections between form and function based on the
laws of probability. Projects include generation of high dimension fractals,
investigation of critical behavior of fractals, and thermodynamics of fractal
systems. Projects are designed to put results in visual form. All projects will
be presented to the scientific community. Students will be selected from
Louisiana Tech University and surrounding universities. This project is
supported under the Program of Research Experiences for Undergraduates to help
ensure an adequate supply of scientists for the future.
