9312207 Arruda The work represents planning activities required for the
verification of a spectroscopic polymer characterization technique as a
sufficient apparatus for the in-situ characterization of orientation parameters
from a deforming polymeric network, suitable for implementation into internal
variable based polymer constitutive models. An apparatus for measuring the
polarized fluorescence of elastomers during large strain deformations will be
adapted for the real-time characterization of various deformation states. The
information obtained from model elastomeric networks will be implemented
directly into a constitutive model as internal variables monitoring orientation
state. ***
