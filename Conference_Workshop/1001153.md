This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in a week-long
school of analysis with applications at the University of Arizona on March
15-19, 2010. Much of the funding will be directed to young mathematicians (i.e.,
postdocs, graduate students, junior faculty) who do not have their own support.

The goal of this school is to introduce certain topics of analysis with
applications to young mathematicians. This will be accomplished through the
following four mini-courses: 1. "Isoperimetric Inequalities for Eigenvalues of
the Laplacian" lectures by Rafael Benguria 2. "Universality of Wigner Random
Matrices" lectures by Laszlo Erdös 3. "Kinetic Theory and Kac's Master Equation"
lectures by Michael Loss 4. "Localization in Disordered Media" lectures by
Günter Stolz An impressive group of additional senior researchers have agreed to
participate in the event. The school will afford many junior researchers the
opportunity to learn and interact with established researchers in applied
analysis.
