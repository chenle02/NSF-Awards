9401136 Overton Nonsmooth optimization problems involve objectives or
constraints which are not differentiable everywhere. The term structured
nonsmooth optimization means that the specific nonsmooth nature of the problem
is known. One especially interesting class repeatedly arises in many
applications: problems involving eigenvalues of matrices. This work primarily
focuses on various aspects of eigenvalue optimization, including semidefinite
programming, quasiconvex eigenvalue optimization, and non- Lipschitz eigenvalue
optimization. The goal is fourfold: the development of fast, robust numerical
algorithms; analysis of theoretical questions concerning optimality conditions
and algorithm convergence; development of software which can be used by the
general scientific community; application to the solution of important
interesting problems which arise in practice. Application areas of particular
interest include combinatorial optimization, robust control and structural
analysis. ***
