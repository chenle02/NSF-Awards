With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Viktor V. Zhdankin, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Minnesota, Duluth, is exploring the chemistry of hypervalent compounds of iodine
and xenon. His studies include the preparation and structural characterization
of novel, stable complexes of hypervalent iodine and xenon with chelating
nitrogen ligands, a search for catalytic reactions utilizing hypervalent iodine,
the development of new oxidizing agents based on benziodazoles, and the
preparation, structural study, and exploration of the reactivity of mixed
phosphonium-iodonium ylides and imides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this Research
in Undergraduate Institutions award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program is supporting the research efforts of Professor Viktor V. Zhdankin, of
the Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota, Duluth. Through the
study of new structural types of compounds containing iodine or xenon, Professor
Zhdankin will enhance our understanding of the structure and reactivity of these
unusual compounds, develop new reagents and procedures for organic synthesis,
and search for new compounds with unusual and useful properties. Undergraduate
students from the University of Minnesota, Duluth and from other universities
will carry out these studies.
