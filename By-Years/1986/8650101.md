The planned project, which is a cooperative effort of Central Missouri State
University, the Missouri Chemical Council, the Missouri Department of Elementary
and Secondary Education, and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, is
designed to provide professional growth opportunities for qualified secondary
school teachers of chemistry in Missouri. A weekend meeting with chemists,
engineers, and educators will provide participants with the opportunity to learn
about the state's chemical industry and its interface with the environment. In a
subsequent drive-in conference, participants will design, develop, and report on
a related teaching or research project.
