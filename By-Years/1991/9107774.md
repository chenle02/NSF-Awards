The proposed research program consists of two main parts, i.e., solitary waves
(ultrafast pulses) generation and switching operation in four-wave mixing. For
solitary wave generation, the medium parameters such as loss and the nonlinear
factor in MQWs will be measured and their effects on the results will be taken
into account in the experiments. This part of the research is expected to
produce effective pulse compressors for ultrafast laser spectroscopy and
diagnoses, and for high-rate optical communications. The proposed study of
switching devices will include experimental implementations of switching in
four-wave mixing with different pump formats (forward, counter- propagation with
one or two pumps). The dependence of the outputs of the switching processes on
the material parameters and the control signal will be studied using samples
with different parameters. The input power requirements, and response time of
MQW devices will be measured experimentally using different input power levels
and delays between the input and output pulses. The use of the switching devices
in cascade and array formats will be demonstrated using several pieces of MQWs
in the experiments.
