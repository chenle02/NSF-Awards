9603874 Libby Part 1-Technical The prevailing model for heme enzyme catalysis
ascribes variations in mechanism entirely to characteristics of the protein and
ignores effects of variation in substrate reactivity. The specific research plan
proposed investigates the effects of substrate structure on the pathway by which
it is consumed by chloroperoxidase, a versatile heme enzyme. First, reactions
will be characterized as to products and their distributions. Second, the
kinetics of each process will be probed to determine (1.) effects of one
substrate type on another and (2.) inhibitory effects of trapping agents for
reactive species (e.g. molecular halogens or free radicals). Finally, the redox
potentials of substrates will be determined. The focus of the analyses will be
on independent determination of substrate steric and electronic effects on the
extent of involvement of reactive non-enzymic intermediates in chloroperoxidase
reactions. A number of trapping agents for enzyme generated intermediates will
be identified and characterized. These agents should be generally useful for
detecting significant involvement of enzyme generated oxidative species. Thus,
our results should help elucidate mechanisms of chloroperoxidase catalyzed
reactions, and also provide a series of new inhibitors for probing reaction
mechanisms of many other oxidative enzymes. Part 2-Non Technical Hemoproteins
have a diverse variety of functions in living organisms, including carrying of
molecular oxygen, oxidation. Chloroperoxidase (CPO) is a heme containing enzyme
that has chlorination, peroxidation and catalase activities. Strategies are
described to elucidate the factors responsible for partitioning among the
various reaction mechanisms in the reactions catalyzed by CPO. CPO has been
studied for over twenty years, yet little is known about how each type of
activity relates to the others. This research will play a significant role in
our understanding of CPO and oxidative catalysis of heme enzymes in general.
