The Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) has now completed 18 months of drilling and
coring operations in the Indian Ocean. The results of ODP drilling can now be
integrated with data from earlier Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) drilling in
the region and with new plate tectonic reconstructions. This award will support
US participation in such a synthesis project which has recently been funded in
Great Britain. The basic objective of this study is to document the sedimentary
and biotic response to tectonic, climatic and oceanographic changes which
occurred at four critical time intervals in the Cenozoic (middle Eocene,
Eocene/Oligocene, middle Miocene, and Miocene/Pliocene). Dr. Davies role in this
study is to produce a consistent data base of sediment characteristics for all
Indian Ocean sites, preparation of maps of sediment properties during the
critical time periods, and to determine sedimentation rates and mass balances
for the basins of the Indian Ocean.//
