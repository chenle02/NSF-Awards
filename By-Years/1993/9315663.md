Lewitus 9315663 The recognition that light can stimulate respiration has cast
uncertainties in primary productivity measurements for years. Resolution of this
often pronounced effect is complicated by the existence of several respiratory
pathways in phytoplankton (e.g. "dark" respiration, photorespiration, mealier
reaction), all driven by the cell in different ways. It was recently discovered
in the laboratory that several estuarine phytoplankton contain another such
pathway, "alternative respiration", that previously had been reported in few
species and whose function in phytoplankton is poorly understood. The potential
for expression of this pathway can be very high (up to 99% of the total light-
stimulated respiration), and glucose enrichment in the light can this potential.
Based on this preliminary findings and higher plant research, it is hypothesized
that the alternative pathway has energy dissipating role in phytoplankton -- the
pathway is engaged when the cellular energy supply exceeds the demands for
growth, maintenance, and storage. This hypothesis will be tested by examining
the effects of light, dissolved organic substrate, and nutrient supplies on the
capacity and activity of alternative reparation in recently isolated
phytoplankton clones and in field populations. This will be accomplished, in
part, by the use of membrane inlet mass spectrometry and a newly developed
antibody to the main enzyme of the alternative pathway. Understanding how
alternative respiration works impacts our understanding of how primary
productivity is controlled -- this process may be a rapid and efficient means by
which phytoplankton can dissipate excess carbon and energy in the upper euphotic
zone. ***
