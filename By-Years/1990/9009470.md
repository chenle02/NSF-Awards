This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Thierry- Palmer's sabbatical
visit to Dr. John Suttie's laboratory at the University of Wisconsin. The goal
of the project is to identify vitamin K-dependent proteins and determine their
function, with special attention to their possible role in calcium ion
concentration homeostasis in mitochondria. Dr. Thierry-Palmer has an established
record of productivity in the area of vitamin D metabolism. This sabbatical
visit will permit her to return to her earlier interest in vitamin K, and
develop a new line of research which is anticipated to significantly enhance her
career.
