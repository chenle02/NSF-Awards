The proposal seeks to establish a forum to synthesize computational Techniques
in engineering mechanics, from the continuum to micro- to nano- level,that play
an essential role in all branches of emerging technologies. The goal is to
stimulate more accurate evaluation and more efficient design of numerical
experimentation. In particular, to account for scale effects, suitable topics
have been selected to replace heuristic schemes and associated computational
strategies by fundamental formulations based on the underlying physics of the
problem. Subtle secondary effects, which are currently assessed by Subjective
procedures, constitute the central theme of the workshop. The US engineering
mechanics researchers have been assessing the needs of their colleagues working
on emerging technologies --- micro- and nano-mechanics research in a variety of
fields including biomedical engineering. They seek active collaboration with the
foreign participants to submit proposals for government and private funding.
Such combined team efforts during workshops invariably lead to designing
optimized algorithms appropriate for developing Research projects across a wide
field of engineering science.
