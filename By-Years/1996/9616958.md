A central theme in contemporary environmental policy is recommending the
adoption of watershed-based approaches to restoring native diversity, preserving
ecological habitat and managing ecosystems. A watershed is a complex ecological
system that sheds water, such as a creek, lake, slough, or estuary; its
boundaries do not often coincide with political ones. California's watersheds
supply water for drinking, recreation, industry and farming; and they provide
critical habitat for a wide variety of animal species. Rapid population growth
in these watersheds has led to increased conflict between human users of natural
resources, dramatic loss of native diversity, and general decline in the health
of ecosystems. In California, federal and state government are turning to
watershed-based organizations to develop and implement environmental policy. The
implications of these watershed management activities are not well understood by
scientists, policy makers or the general public. Focusing on these activities in
California, this study will address the following questions: What are the
relevant values of participants currently involved in watershed restoration and
management? What is the role of scientific information in watershed restoration
and management? The research will use a three-part strategy of direct analysis
of documents from watershed groups; a random sample of opinion of participants
in all California watershed organizations, and comparative case studies of eight
of these organizations. Scientists and policy makers can learn from a
comparative analysis of the place of values and science in watershed management
in California. Results will be disseminated through scholarly and professional
conferences and journals. An executive summary will be produced and distributed
to watershed planners, federal and state policy makers.
