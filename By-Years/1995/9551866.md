The advances in optical materials and technology play an important role in the
future of undergraduate science and engineering programs. The Department of
Physics and Applied Optics offers three courses in the area of optical materials
and applications. Hands-on experience with modern optics and its related
technology is essential in the motivation and training of students in applied
optics program. Through this project, new experiments enable students to grow
and to examine electro-optic and nonlinear crystals and organic polymer thin
films. These laboratory experiments investigate three important aspects of
optical materials: (1) crystal fabrication, (2) optical properties, and (3)
applications. Some of these labs are structured while some are open-ended labs
to allow for the students creativity. The major instruments provided through
this project are (1) Neslab bath circulator and Diamond saw for crystal
fabrication, (2) polarization microscope, scanning monochrometer, storage
oscilloscope, and data acquisition system for characterization of materials, and
(3) laser diode system, imaging system, high-speed detection system, and a HeNe
laser for the proposed applied experiments. This equipment acquisition provides
undergraduates skills and experience in crystal growth, concepts, and techniques
that are utilized by researchers and industries.
