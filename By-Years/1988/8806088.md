Miller Appleton Ongoing research is in the area of very high-strength concrete
for which a high capacity Universal Testing Machine is a necessity. Hence,
equipment would greatly enhance the quality and extend the scope of ongoing, as
well as proposed, research projects in the Civil Engineering Department. The
desired equipment will provide a unique facility to the State of Alabama and the
large industrial community in Birmingham, and hence encourage interactions
between researchers and possibly inspire new research ideas. The equipment
consists of a 600 kip high-capacity hydraulic Universal Testing Machine with
automatic closed loop servo control and complete data acquisition and analysis
system. It will provide the capability of conducting continuing research on
high-strength concrete material, as well as the study of new pozzolanic
additives that contribute to the production of high-strength concrete.
