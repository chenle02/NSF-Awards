The aim of this project is to support the travel of US-based doctoral student
researchers to the&lt;br/&gt;premier international conference on autonomous
agents and multi-agent systems and their participation&lt;br/&gt;in the Doctoral
Mentoring Consortium held in conjunction with it. The Fourteenth
International&lt;br/&gt;Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems
(AAMAS 2015) will be held in Istanbul,&lt;br/&gt;Turkey, May 4-8, 2015. AAMAS is
the premier conference devoted to all aspects of research and application of
agent technology, a key area of research with applications to the success of the
WWW, electronic&lt;br/&gt;commerce, digital libraries, robotics, personal
agents, and virtual humans. All students&lt;br/&gt;awarded travel funding will
participate in a Doctoral Mentoring Consortium in which they
will&lt;br/&gt;present their research to other student researchers and receive
in-depth feedback from a group&lt;br/&gt;of senior researchers. Students will
also attend the conference, which has a rich technical&lt;br/&gt;program
complemented with an array of workshops, tutorials and other events. The wide
variety&lt;br/&gt;and significance of the topics typically presented at AAMAS,
in both the technical program&lt;br/&gt;and the workshop program, provides
opportunities for students to share, exchange and learn&lt;br/&gt;from the best
in the field.
