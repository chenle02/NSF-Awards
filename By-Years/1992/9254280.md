We propose a project designed to increase the scientific literacy of
undergraduate non-majors at Northern Arizona University and community colleges
in Arizona with predominantly ethnic minority populations, Navajo Community
College, Pima Community College, and Cochise Community College. The project has
four major foci: (1) We intend to restructure an introductory biology course for
non-majors so that it enhances students' scientific literacy and their
understanding of multidisciplinary approaches to real-world problems. The
laboratory component for the course will provide students the opportunity to do
inquiry-based and research-oriented science. (2) We would effect systemic change
at NAU and the three community colleges by developing and implementing
professional development seminars and practical workshops for graduate teaching
assistants and faculty. These workshops would explore new approaches to
developing relevant and substantive curricular frameworks for introductory
biology for non-majors. 3) We would test the restructuring of introductory
biology through an experimental design that will enable us to determine what is
the most effective design for two kinds of academic communities, state
comprehensive university and a sample of community colleges in Arizona. 4) We
would follow faculty and their students in a longitudinal study of the course's
impacts. Our project -- A Slice of Life: An Introductory Biology Course --
represents an experimental approach to curriculum development that will
determine "what works" in non- majors biology courses.
