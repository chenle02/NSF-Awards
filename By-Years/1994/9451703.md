9451703 Benton Eight sets of field measurement equipment are developed to be
available for loan to architecture departments across the country for periods of
up to one year. This equipment enables students to gain first-hand experience in
the instrumented investigation of the physical environment of buildings and
develop confidence in physical measurement techniques. It is anticipated that
the project will lead to the participating schools' permanent acquisition of
field equipment, and to a broader acceptance in undergraduate education of
quantitative methods for the assessment of physical building performance.
Teaching materials have been developed to support the field investigation of
physical building performance, and summer workshops are to be offered for
faculty to learn how to use these materials.
