Oxford, OH 45056 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Physics Title: Materials Physics
Laboratory Course Miami University has historically based its successful
undergraduate program upon extensive formal and informal laboratory experience,
and in addition, many students do independent research as an extension of the
formal coursework. This project introduces a one semester course on Materials
Physics as a yearly offering into our curriculum. This four credit
lecture/laboratory course will address topics in four broad materials
categories: (1) metals, (2) ceramics, (3) semiconductors and (4) polymers.
Approximately ten experiments per semester will be performed which will give an
overview of the important properties of each material type. Modern techniques
and equipment will be employed and a computer interface utilized where
appropriate. The experience resulting from this course will prepare the student
to be competitive in the research/industrial workplace in a wide range of
subdisciplines. In addition, students planning to pursue advanced degrees will
be prepared to move into Materials Science, Ceramic Engineering, Electrical
Engineering, Polymer Science and other areas in addition to the traditional
Physics graduate programs. Such breadth of experience provides students greater
flexibility in choosing a career and will help in making the physics degree more
marketable.
