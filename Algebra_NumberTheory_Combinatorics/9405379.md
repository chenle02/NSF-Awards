9405379 Conway This award funds the research of Prof. John Conway in geometry.
Prof. Conway will study the geometry of the Monster group and other sporadic
groups. He is also interested in geometrical problems associated with quantum
logic. Prof. Conway will also continue his investigations into the arithmetic
and geometric properties of quadratic forms. This is research in the field of
number theory. Number theory is basically the study of whole numbers, but it
uses techniques and ideas from all other parts of mathematics. Prof. Conway will
study certain algebraic objects using the geometry associated with them. This
geometry manifests itself through sequences of integers. Within the last half
century, this type of number theory has become doubly important as it has been
used to establish advances in computer science and electronics. ***
