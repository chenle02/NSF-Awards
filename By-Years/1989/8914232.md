This multi-disciplinary research is directed at developing ultra precision
machining techniques. Three main tasks are postulated: (1) the development of
new and novel optical methods to improve metrology based on Global Positioning
System satellite processing techniques, (2) the development of laminar flow
hydraulic devices which provide smooth vibration-free actuation and spindle
drive with improved machine temperature control, and (3) implementation of the
computational technology and approach of artificial intelligence to automate
some of the modeling procedures required to attain the ultimate in precision
from a given machine. The knowledge gained from these three tasks will be
combined in the building of a modest scale but realistic diamond turning machine
to advance the technology of precision machining especially as it applies to the
fabrication of optics for short wave form lithography.
