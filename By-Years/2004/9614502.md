9614502 Wiens This research involves the application of advanced analysis
methods to data from recent, highly successful PASSCAL experiments in the Tonga-
Fiji region to better resolve the seismological structure of the Tonga Slab and
Lau back arc basin and address questions concerning the seismic velocity
anomalies and mineralogical composition of subducting slabs, the occurrence and
behavior of phase transitions in and near subducting slabs, and the depth extent
of seismic anomalies associated with back-arc spreading centers. Processes
associated with the formation of new lithosphere at spreading centers and its
return into the mantle at subduction zones are of primary importance in
understanding the dynamics of the earth. This subduction zone with associated
backarc spreading center offers the ideal opportunity to image both processes
and provide insight into the cause of deep earthquakes. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
