****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with high-
resolution measurements of the thermal expansion of single-crystalline ice at
atmospheric pressure. The measurements will provide up to 10,000 times higher
relative resolution than previous measurements, yielding new information about
the anisotropy of the thermal expansion and the first structural investigation
of a poorly understood phase transition at 115 K. Improved knowledge of ice's
thermal expansion will impact cold-region engineering, climate modeling, the
study of Earth's polar regions, astrophysics, and our basic understanding of the
motion of hydrogen atoms in ice and their role in determining its physical
properties. New temperature sensor technology resulting from this project will
increase the relative resolution of temperature measurements by a factor of 100;
this will improve determination of the thermal expansion coefficient, but may
have other applications. A compact thermal expansion cell will be constructed of
single-crystalline sapphire to facilitate measurements in the range 0.35 K to 20
K. Undergraduates will be responsible for a large portion of this project. They
will fabricate experimental equipment, grow and orient single crystals, test and
calibrate highly sensitive devices and learn fundamental physics associated with
solids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Water is
arguably the most important substance on our planet. In its solid form, known as
ice, it is highly complex. Depending on the pressure, it can assume thirteen
distinct crystal structures. The most predominant on Earth is the structure
known as ice Ih, which exists at atmospheric pressure. Surprisingly, its
expansion under changes in temperature (thermal expansion) has never been
measured to very high resolution. This project will produce thermal expansion
data with a relative resolution about 10,000 times better than prior
measurements. Improved knowledge of the thermal expansion of ice will impact
cold- region engineering, climate modeling, the study of Earth's polar regions,
and astrophysics. It will also improve our understanding of the motion and low-
temperature freezing of hydrogen atoms, and their role in determining the
crystal structure and properties of ice. This project will produce significant
improvements in the measurement of temperature, increasing the relative
resolution by a factor of 100. Advances in measuring the thermal expansion at
temperatures close to absolute zero are also expected. Undergraduate students
will be responsible for a large portion of this research. They will fabricate
experimental equipment, grow and orient single crystals, test and calibrate
highly sensitive devices and learn fundamental physics.
