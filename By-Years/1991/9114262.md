The purpose of this research is to develop a general, rigorous approach for
robust optimal design. This methodology will allow a designer to explicitly
consider and control the effects of variability in design variables and
parameters on a design. Variability is defined in terms of tolerances which
bracket the variation of fluctuating quantities. Both linear and nonlinear
tolerances analysis will be studied. The methodology for feasibility robustness
will be validated by applying it to ten engineering design problems. The
problems will be chosen to provide examples with applicability to a broad
spectrum of engineering fields.//
