The Field Museum of Natural History houses the third largest collection of
scientific bird specimens (&gt;380,000) in North America and the fourth largest
such collection in the world. These specimens are used by researchers around the
world in their basic research on the nature and origins of biotic diversity.
Increasingly, conservation biologists are turning to collections such as this
for the basic distributional and natural history information that is required if
efforts to conserve biotic diversity are to be successful. In addition, Field
Museum staff use the collections extensively when teaching undergraduates and
graduates at Chicago area universities, and when constructing exhibits designed
for the very young. However, the sheer magnitude of this collection has limited
in some senses limited its usefulness. Obtaining some kinds of information can
be a very time consuming process. The current project is intended to make these
collections more accessible to Field Museum scientific staff as well as to the
broader scientific and educational communities. The first phase of collection
computerization (entry of specimen data into a relational database) has been
completed. However, only those data present in the written catalog have been
entered and these data have not yet been thoroughly proofed. In this project we
will proof the recently constructed database to insure accuracy and will add
additional information about each specimen. Until each record has been examined
against the associated specimen, the utility of that database will be limited.
