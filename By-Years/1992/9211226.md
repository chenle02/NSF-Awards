This is an accomplishment based renewal project for the principal investigator
to continue his research on various topics in dynamic games and implementation
theory. It includes the following topics. (1) The study extends previous
research on evolutionary games to allow discounting and non-infinitesimal
probabilities of mistakes. (2) The project characterizes equilibria in repeated
games with unobservable actions and no publicly observable outcomes. (3) The
analysis continues to investigate models of credit markets, contract
renegotiation in multi-period models, and the implementation problem in cases of
renegotiation with incomplete information. (4) The undertaking extends the
Markov perfect equilibrium - an equilibrium in which strategies depend only on
those past variables that are payoff-relevant - to the cases of incomplete
information or imperfect information. These studies all deal with important
topics in dynamic game theory which promise to continue to help generate
progress in different areas in economics as well as in other social sciences.
