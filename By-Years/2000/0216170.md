The objective of this project is to explore the fundamental aspects of
enantioselective&lt;br/&gt;chemistry on chiral metal surfaces. The investigation
is focused on naturally chiral surfaces formed from high Miller index planes of
metals such as Cu and Pt. The chirality of these surfaces arises from the kink-
step-terrace structures that are formed by the intersections of three low Miller
index microfacets. In this sense this type of surface chirality is distinct from
the chirality imparted by the traditional approach of templating a surface with
chiral ligands. Past work has probed the structure of naturally chiral surfaces,
enantiospecific adsorbate geometries, and enantiospecific surface reaction
energetics. These properties of chiral surfaces determine the
enantioselectivities of catalytic reactions and chromatographic separations. The
work proposed focuses on the exploration of naturally chiral surfaces of various
structures using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. Although
there are an infinite number of chiral high Miller index surfaces, they are
composed of a finite number of types of kink-step-terrace structures. The
proposed investigation will explore the enantiospecificity of this set of
structures on Cu single crystal surfaces by using chiral adsorbates that have
previously exhibited enantiospecific surface chemistry. The educational
activities are expected to be the traditional mentoring of graduate students.
The fundamental goal of the proposed work is to provide a basic understanding of
the roots of enantioselectivity on a set of highly characterized, naturally
chiral surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;
