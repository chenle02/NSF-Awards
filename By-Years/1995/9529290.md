9529290 Presnall This grant provides $60,000 as two years partial salary support
for a electron microprobe laboratory technician at the University of Texas -
Dallas. This Phase II technician support grant follows a successfully completed
three year Phase I technician support grant (EAR-9205608). The University has
pledged 80% salary support for this position after expiration of this award and
will provide, for up to two years, the additional 20% in the event that research
grant funds are not sufficient. The technician will be responsible for the
maintenance and operation of the electron microprobe and will assist with the
training of graduate and undergraduate students and provide analytical service
to outside users of the facility. Further technical assistance at this
laboratory will allow the PI to continue research in experimental petrology and
geochemistry of basalts for which the electron microprobe is the centerpiece of
this lab's analytical tools. ***
