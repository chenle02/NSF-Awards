Kyanite-bearing mineral assemblages are rare in the Archean where high-grade
plutonic-metamorphic terranes tend to be dominated by low-pressure high-
temperature metamorphic regimes. This has led to speculations regarding higher
geothermal gradients in the Archean and has restricted analogies between high-
grade Archean terranes and younger terranes with established relationships to
convergent margin plate tectonic settings. This work will expand on a study of
Archean rocks in the Quetico subprovince of northeastern Minnesota where kyanite
is present and a plate tectonic model has been developed. The objective is to
determine the relationship of deformation and metamorphism in the deep crustal
level to adjacent shallower levels of the belt exposed to the east. Results are
expected to clarify Archean plate settings and the nature of the Archean
geothermal gradient.
