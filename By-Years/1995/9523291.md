ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS-9523291 PI: Maxworthy This is a comprehensive and
carefully integrated computational and experimental investigation of the
evolution of swirling jets. These flows are of practical significance in a broad
range of applications. In spite of this practical significance, the mechanisms
that govern their spatio-temporal dynamics of these flows are poorly understood.
Swirling jets are subjected to both shear and centrifugal instabilities and
therefore exhibit a rich and varied set of disturbance modes. The generation,
existence, and interaction of these mechanisms has not been investigated in any
detail. It is expected that the identification, quantification, and eventual
control of the governing structures by means of vortex dynamics and direct
Navier-Stokes simulations, as well as experimental DPIV measurements will
significantly advance the state of the art in a variety of propulsion,
combustion and mixing applications.
