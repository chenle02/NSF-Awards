9600398 Murthy The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of ulique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by
Dr. Srihari Murthy to the laboratory of Professor Hannes Lichte at the
Technische Universitat Dresden in Dresden, Germany. Dr. Murthy and Professor
Lichte propose to employ high resolution electron holography to systematically
obtain structure images of individual gold and silver nanocrystals in various
crystallographic orientations, and from this to obtain three-dimensional
morphologies of these nanocrystals with atomic-scale detail. They will also
obtain structure images of the thiolate layer (which is made up of light atoms)
and hence not imaged by conventional high resolution techniques on gold/silver
nanocrystal surfaces using high resolution electron holography. These studies
will serve to significantly extend our understanding of the structure of these
important new materials. ***
