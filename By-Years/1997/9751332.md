A significant portion of recent scientific progress has taken place at the
interface of the traditional science disciplines. It is imperative that the
training of undergraduate chemistry students reflects the current
interdisciplinary nature of chemical research. With this goal in mind, the
Department of Chemistry has established a Bachelor of Science degree in
chemistry with a biochemistry emphasis. This degree better prepares students for
graduate work in biochemistry and medicine and for exciting career opportunities
in the rapidly expanding biotechnology industry. The new degree features an
advanced laboratory in biochemistry, which integrates the concepts covered in
the two biochemistry lecture courses. The laboratory is using the theme of
evolution and providing the students with a collaborative research experience.
This new approach satisfies several pedagogical objectives, including teaching a
wide variety of biochemical techniques, reinforcing an appreciation of the
chemical basis of biology, illustrating both the unity and diversity of life,
providing a research experience, and supporting the development of a team-
oriented approach to investigating a problem. Three centrifuges, an
electrophoresis setup, protein purification equipment, and a spectrophotometer
are among the new equipment providing hands-on experiences with biochemical
techniques actually used in research laboratories. The program is greatly
reducing the gap between undergraduates' education and actual research done in
academic and industrial laboratories. *
