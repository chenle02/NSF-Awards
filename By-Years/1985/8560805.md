This project will determine the feasibility of using a robotic system to wind
filaments in complex shapes with advanced composite materials. Objectives are:
(1) create a robot filament winding workcell, incorporating an intelligent
winding mechaniam and associated controller; (2) develop software to wind
generic shapes using algorithms that map three dimensional curve functions into
two dimensions and robotic indexing motions; and (3) establish the capability of
robotic winding in a practical application. Future research will build on this
program and create a generic winding system for 3-dimensional complex shapes at
a cost significantly less than current winding systems.
