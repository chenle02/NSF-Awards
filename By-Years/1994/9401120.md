9401120 Ramkrishna Description: This project provides travel support for Dr.
Ramkrishna, of the Department of Chemical Engineering at Purdue University, to
spend four months at the Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific
Research in Bangalore, India. He will collaborate with professors R. Kumar and
K.S. Gandhi on research dealing with the engineering aspects of the development
of fine particles of current technological importance. These include ceramics,
pharmaceuticals, paints and others. The work involves two features. The first
deals with precipitation in single drops (or reverse micelles), while the second
is concerned with the precipitation in microemulsions. Scope: The P.I. has an
invitation from the President of the JNCASR in Bangalore to spend his sabbatical
there and to collaborate with its staff. The collaboration is likely to enhance
the progress of the U.S. scientist in his research, and to produce significant
scientific results. This fits well with the aims of the Division of
International Programs. ***
