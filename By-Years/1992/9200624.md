This award provides funds to the Department of Psychology at The University of
South Carolina to support ten undergraduate students in a program called Summer
Research Institute in Experimental Psychology. The program provides a forum for
educating undergraduate students about he field of experimental psychology. The
current appeal of applied psychology is drawing far more applicants to those
programs, particularly among minority students. The Institute focuses student
interest and enthusiasm on the basic science areas of psychology. The eight week
USC Summer Research Institute will permit well qualified minority and non-
minority undergraduate students majoring in behavioral science, an experience in
graduate level research including an opportunity to formulate and conduct an
experiment with individual guidance from energetic and supportive research
faculty. The student will experience major phases of experimental research
including literature review, hypothesis generation, data collection, data
organization, statistical analysis, and writing a report in the style of the
American Psychological Association. Student experience will be enriched by
weekly research seminars where assigned readings are discussed, and by-weekly
sessions on problems of research design and statistics in experimental
psychology. Students receive gratis course credit for their work. This program
emphasis is much needed, as the U.S. is perceived as the leader in the field of
experimental psychology, but our universities must be able to motivate and train
the best students for future careers in the vital areas of behavioral science.
This Summer Institute provides one vehicle to enhance these goals.
