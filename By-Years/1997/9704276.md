Optimized codes for multi-dimensional problems such as image processing and
fluid dynamics often require the problem space to be traversed in a direction
not parallel to any of the basis vectors of the space. Affine transformations of
the iteration indices are needed for these oblique traversals. This project is
implementing affine transformations for loop retiming in code generators, with
consideration of the effect of conditional branches. Architectural support for
anticipating conditional branches is also being investigated. With extensive
undergraduate participation, research is proceeding toward several goals:
identification of new high-level language constructs for describing loop
retiming; development of supporting hardware features; new techniques for
accomodating conditional branches; and development of simulators and other tools
for investigating loop transformations.
