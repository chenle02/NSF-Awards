Greater Antarctica was in tropical latitudes and part of east Gondwana during
the Cambrian. A recent hypothesis postulates: (i) that the North American and
combined Australian/East Antarctic cratons were juxtaposed in the Late
Proterozoic, and (ii) that their Pacific-facing margins were initiated as a
conjugate rift pair during latest Proterozoic-Early Cambrian interval. This
award supports a test of this hypothesis because its acceptance has profound
implications of shared geologic history. This work will compare in detail
Cambrian events and faunas, concentrating in regions where the two continental
masses are inferred to have been closes: south-western United States and the
Queen Maud-Pensacola mountains segment of Antarctica.
