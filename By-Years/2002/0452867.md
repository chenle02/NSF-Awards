Under this award, the PI proposes a computational thermodynamics study that
explores why the major element chemistry of MORB (and OIB) so strongly seems to
suggest they are the by product of melting a peridotite mantle source, not a
basalt-eclogite source, yet the isotopic composition of these same basalts and
their melt-inclusions suggest the presence of significant recycled components in
their source that were not peridotites, at least to begin with. The second part
of the study is a more complete examination of melt-migration processes beneath
a spreading center that explores the potential pressure and stress changes
associated with melt-migration, and their potential feedbacks for melting
episodicity and melt transport processes. The study involves graduate students
and other training activities, and that the results of the study will be broadly
interesting to a wide community of scientists. In addition, the study involves
international collaboration.
