The proposed research by this newly-funded Presidential Young Investigator will
explore the automation of decision-making for engineering design and
manufacturing tasks, at a level above that of the conventional computer-based
automation of Numerically Controlled (NC) machines and robots. The main goal is
to achieve a computer environment in which engineers can acquire, represent, and
utilize domain knowledge in their decision-making processes. This will involve
research in integrating different types of problem-solving methods, modeling
approaches, and domain knowledge. The resulting computer-aided engineering
environment will encompass deterministic, observational, and heuristic
knowledge, and should support engineers in both the analysis and synthesis
aspects of decision-making. The research activities will be conducted in close
cooperation with industry sponsors, and will include creation of an intelligent
decision-making framework, development of a cooperative decision-making
paradigm, and investigation of fundamental links between decisions and actions.
Funding will be shared with the Computational Engineering Program, which is
interested in the aspect of the research addressing parallel computations.
