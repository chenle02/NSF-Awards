Sheu will continue his research on the interaction between C*- algebras and
geometry, with emphasis on the C*-algebraic deformation quantization. The
motivation of this research is the recent worldwide interest in the promising
new theory of quantum groups which links together several branches of
mathematics and is closely related to mathematical physics. The objective of
this research is to advance the understanding of this relatively new area of
mathematics. The main tools to be used in this research will be from various
mathematical branches including C*-algebras, Lie groups, differential geometry,
and pseudodifferential operators. The general area of mathematics of this
project has its basis in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.
Operators can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex numbers.
Special types of operators are often put together in an algebra, naturally
called an operator algebra. These abstract objects have a surprising variety of
applications. For example, they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is
currently being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of fundamental
importance in noncommutative geometry, which is becoming increasingly important
in physics.
