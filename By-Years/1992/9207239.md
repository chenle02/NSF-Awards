This award provides funds to be used to defray a portion of the costs of
construction of two new buildings at the Mountain Lake Biological Station of the
University of Virginia and to aid in purchase of a variety of shared
instrumentation items for the station. The new buildings will permit use of the
station during the winter, which is not now possible, and alleviate crowding
during the summer. The Mountain Lake Station has been an active field site for
study of biota of the southern Appalachians for over 60 years. In recent years,
research at the station has emphasized aspects of population biology and, in
particular, ecological genetics.
