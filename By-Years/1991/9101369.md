This dissertation research project will support a student of cultural
anthropology studying gift exchange in a rural community in north China. The
research will examine the social ramifications of patterned exchanged of gifts
and analyze the cultural rules and operative logic of gift exchange, especially
with regard to the mitigation of the famine that China endured in 1959-61.
Methods include participant observation and a survey of village families. The
student is a native speaker of Chinese. This research is important because
village systems of informal exchange between families are vitally important
means of distributing goods in all societies, yet are invisible to public
statistics. Understanding how the system works in one case, especially focused
on behavior during a famine, will advance our understanding of the limits of
reciprocity in human societies.
