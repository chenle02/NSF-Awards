This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project proposes to use a newly
developed synthetic nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (HAP) bone material to
produce high-strength, resorbable synthetic bone implants for anterior cruciate
ligament surgeries. This material solves the problem of current orthopedic
implants (made of polymer and/or metal) which either permanently reside as
foreign material in the body or quickly degrade into a formless mass of non-
ossified, non-load bearing tissue. The objectives of the Phase II work are to
concurrently scale up manufacturing processes for HAP to near-commercial levels
while developing an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) prototype product for
testing in vivo.

The commercial impact of this project will be in the area of orthopedics. The
proposed technology will help decrease the time of healing in surgeries
requiring implants (fractiures, ACL) and will minimize the need for second
surgeries to remove the screws and/or to correct for morbidities.
