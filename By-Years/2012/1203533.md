Perchlorate is a long-lived environmental contaminant, released from human
activities but increasingly recognized to have a natural source as well. The
investigators propose to measure perchlorate in previously-collected Greenland
ice cores, with the following specific objectives: 1. To obtain a robust
(continuous and annual resolution) 500-year record of perchlorate in the
environment using ice core samples from Greenland 2. To quantify the magnitude
and variability of the natural, probably atmospheric perchlorate source in the
Northern Hemisphere environment using the pre-1850 part of the record 3. To
estimate the relative contributions of natural and anthropogenic sources to
perchlorate in the current environment, and 4. To evaluate the impact of
specific human activities (e.g., space applications) by a close examination of
the perchlorate record during specific time periods (e.g., pre- and post-1950s).
The project will involve the application of a new method to measure extremely
low concentrations of perchlorate in polar ice. Achievement of the main
objective can lead to improvement of our understanding of the natural formation
process of environmentally important substances. Results of this work may inform
decision-making regarding the regulation of perchlorate release into the
environment. The project will involve both graduate and undergraduate student
participants and contribute to an environmental outreach program between South
Dakota State University and K-12 schools in South Dakota.
