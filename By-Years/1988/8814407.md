The proposed work deals with application of parallel processing to
communication systems problems, mostly with particular regard to implementation
with the INMOS transputer device. There are three major areas with quite
distinct objectives: (1) development of a high-speed simulator for analysis of
digital communication systems, (2) investigation of new architecture (
generalized lattice) for implementation of digital filters, and (3)
reformulation of signal processing algorithms typically used in communication
systems ( least squares estimation, Kalman filtering, sequential decoding, etc.)
for a more direct and efficient implementation as a form of systolic array. The
objective of area (1) is to provide an effective analysis tool for designers of
complex communication systems by virtue of the high computational speeds
afforded by parallel processors. Areas (2) and (3) have similar objectives and
represent an investigation of a more fundamental nature. The goal is to show
ways to implement sophisticated signal processing operations (such as; bandpass
filtering, Viterbi detection, adaptive channel equalization) at high speed so
that communication channels can be utilized more efficiently. Another benefit of
this work is the development of design tools for using an exisiting device ( the
transputer) for implementing common signal processing operations.
