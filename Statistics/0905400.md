The investigators examine statistical inference techniques for nonlinear and
functional time series models that work in both stationary and nonstationary
regimes, thereby providing unified procedures that help advance statistical
theory. Since determining whether a given set of (functional) observations is
stationary can be a vexing problem, the proposed research also helps to lighten
the statistical analysis for practitioners. Moreover, the investigators develop
a new framework to deal with dependent Hilbert space-valued random functions
which is both mathematically challenging and important for statistical
applications in various areas such as finance, econometrics, astronomy,
geophysics, climatology and genetics. This research is based on delicately
fusing elements of statistical and probability theory with time series and
functional data analysis.

The investigators' research is aimed at providing flexible statistical tools for
practitioners that are less sensitive to underlying model assumptions and time
dependent changes in environment. In view of the economic crisis in the Fall of
2008, this seems to be of particular importance for the analysis of financial
data, but may also prove relevant in other scientific fields such as
climatology. To enhance our understanding of these complex scientific questions,
the investigators' research will provide novel data-analytic tools for
practitioners by advancing statistical theory.
