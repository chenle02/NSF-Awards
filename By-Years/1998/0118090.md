0118090&lt;br/&gt;Gilmore&lt;br/&gt; Monsters are familiar figures in folklore,
myth and art around the world. Threatening mythical creatures share common
features wherever they are found, including large size, hybrid shapes combining
human and beastly form, violence, cannibalism and of course malevolence. In most
cultures mythical monsters serve as metaphors for abstract evil as well as
antisocial impulses, despised and feared "others" such as deviants, pariahs and
outsiders. This pilot research project by an anthropologist from the State
University of New York-Stony Brook will explore research sites in Spain for a
study of the social role of monsters in community rituals. In town and village
festivities occurring between January and July, colorful demonic effigies
"attack" neighbors, "eat" children, and threaten normative standards until they
are defeated by united, heroic community action. The research will integrate
psychodynamic and social interpretations to gain insight into the processes
which create monsters in the ritual context. Combining a psychoanalytic
perspective which assumes that monsters are created from dreamlike images with
empirically real aspects reflecting repressed desire, guilt, awe and dread, with
anthropological theories of categorical natural schemes, contradiction and
conflict, the anthropologist will observe monster rituals, interview community
members, and discuss the meanings of the rituals with Spanish experts in folk
culture. The results from this pilot project will be used in preparing a major
research proposal.&lt;br/&gt;
