The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in its
capability to promote the safety of people with dementia. According to research,
70% of people with dementia will wander, which can result in a difficult
experience for both missing people and care givers. The demand for protecting
and recovering missing people with dementia has been increased over the past
decades. Advancement of this tracking system has the potential for enhancing
their safety and giving a peace of mind to care givers without compromising the
effectiveness. The core set of methods and processes of the technology has the
potential to be replicated, adapted and used in other crowd sensing applications
globally. Even before the care givers notice, the "crowd" can potentially be
able to help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is focused on technology
to improve the tracking, and protecting paradigm of using mobile devices carried
by the people with dementia as well as will also explore the commercial
potential of an intelligent tracking system. This innovative system, LED-based
Smart Cue (LESQ), can monitor the status of the wearer in addition to tracking
the location. If an abnormal condition is detected, the LESQ system can ask for
immediate help. If the wearer carries a smartphone, the LESQ system can send an
alert message directly to the care giver. One important feature of the LESQ
system is to improve the self-diagnosis of the potential for wandering by the
people with dementia. A smart tag tracks the wearer's status by using the timer
and gaits, in addition to the geo-location. Implementation of the cost and power
efficient, lightweight, and flexible system may significantly improve the
usability.
