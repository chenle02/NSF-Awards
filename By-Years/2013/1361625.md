Quantum mechanics is a fundamental branch of physics whose foundations were
established during the first half of the twentieth century. The study of quantum
mechanical phenomena in disordered environments has been an area of ongoing
active study since the 1950's. The mathematical study of electronic properties
of disordered structures is carried out within the framework of ergodic
Schrodinger operators. This project therefore has a potential impact on physics
as it improves our understanding of quantum mechanical transport properties of
media exhibiting certain kinds of disorder. Through the training of graduate
students the project has in addition an impact on human resource development.

The project will study direct and inverse spectral theory for quasi-periodic
Schrodinger operators with applications to the KdV equation, the structure of
the spectrum and the type of the density of states measure of the square
Fibonacci Hamiltonian at intermediate coupling, transport in quantum systems and
mechanisms that determine the associated transport exponents, the absolute of
continuity of the density of states measure of the weakly coupled Bernoulli-
Anderson model in one dimension, connections between bound states and essential
spectrum for perturbations of periodic Schrodinger operators, and the interface
between direct and inverse spectral theory for almost periodic Jacobi matrices.
Methods from spectral theory and dynamical systems will be used in pursuing
these goals.
