PI: Lynne Billard Proposal Number: DMS 9730906 Project: International Biometric
Conference - Cape Town

Abstract:

The International Biometric Conference is the biennial meeting of the
International Biometric Society, a Society dedicated to the "advancement of
biological science through the development of quantitative theories and the
application, development and dissemination of effective mathematical and
statistical techniques". Members and conference participants are concerned with
the cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary interface of the theoretical and
application oriented real-world problems. This proposal requests partial support
for ten U.S.-based individuals from academic and nonprofit institutions to
participate in the International Biometric Conference to be held in Cape Town,
South Africa, on December 13-18,1998. About one third of those supported will be
those with an official capacity and two-thirds will be new researchers
especially those traditionally underrepresented groups such as women and
minorities.
