This project documents the history of nutrition science in Puerto Rico in the
twentieth century from the Great Depression when the island was known for its
malnutrition, through the post war recasting of malnutrition as an exclusively
biomedical condition to be treated by food enrichment and supplementation
technologies, to the 1960s when a survey conducted by the Department of
Biochemistry and Nutrition at Puerto Rico's School of Medicine determined that
obesity had become a national problem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will
result in a dissertation and results will be shared with interested scientists
at the University of Puerto Rico and to a broader audience in Puerto Rico via
online forums.
