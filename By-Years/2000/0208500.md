Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG+) magnetograms will be employed as the
principal data set to study the evolution of the solar photospheric magnetic
field, and its relationship with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Potential-field
source-surface (PFSS) coronal models will be constructed using the GONG+ data to
specify the inner boundary condition. These will form the basis for the
synthesis of specialized synoptic maps aimed at, (1) establishing the location
of source surface magnetic neutral lines, (2) predicting solar wind
characteristics based on the Wang-Sheeley model, and (3) delineating the
evolution of open and close magnetic field regions. This information will be
posted on a real time updated web site and delivered to the NOAA/Space
Environment Center website. This effort will be essential for understanding the
impacts of active region emergence and fragmentation on the evolution of the
large-scale coronal magnetic field.
