Next generation communication systems will integrate mobile ad hoc networks,
wireless mesh networks, and all-IP cellular networks into hybrid networks. Key
features of these systems are the multiplicity of access technologies and the
diversity of nodes to facilitate always best connected (ABC) communication and
pervasive computing. The survivability of hybrid networks is of paramount
importance to homeland security, where the networks must fulfill their missions
in a timely manner even in the presence of failures or attacks. This project
aims to (1) develop hybrid routing protocols where portions of the same route
span both infrastructure components and multi-hop wireless components of
different networking characteristics, (2) integrate control with computing and
communication to harness mobility and control trajectory to achieve eventual
connectivity, (3) design hybrid transport mechanisms that cope with asymmetry,
and (4) develop utility-based congestion control algorithms that maximize the
aggregate transport utility over wireless networks. The project is investigating
integrated solutions and pursuing cross-layer design, and will yield theory,
algorithms, and protocols that help enhance capacity and survivability of hybrid
networks. In addition, the educational activities of the project are to
integrate control with computing and communication into mobile wireless
networking curricula to foster the next phase of the information technology
revolution, and to develop tools such as protocol animations to help comprehend
protocol concepts, simulation exercises to help learn a complex simulator, and
methodology for simulation and performance evaluation. The results will be
disseminated and will be of value to both the educational community and
industry.
