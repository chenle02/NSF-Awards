9408634 This work is the continuing research on non-equilibrium phase
transitions and their applications to catalysis using a variety of modern tools
in statistical mechanics. The motivation is to study the universality classes by
studying the effect of correlations and fluctuations. The work is of some
relevance in commercially important chemical reactions and biochemical
processes. %%% Catalysis plays an important role in many commercial chemical
reactions and in biochemical processes. The main objective of the proposed
research is to understand the universal features at the onset of instabilities
using modern techniques of statistical mechanics. This work is expected to
provide better understanding of controlling the efficiency of the catalysis
process.
