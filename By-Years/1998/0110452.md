The introduction of double-stranded RNA into cells from a variety organisms,
including plants, nematodes, flies, protozoans, and mammals causes potent and
specific post-transcriptional gene silencing. In animals, this is called RNA
interference (RNAi). It has been hypothesized that the natural role of RNAi may
be to protect the germ line from viruses, transposons, and other molecular
parasites. A mysterious aspect of RNAi is that gene-specific information is
communicated between cells, that is RNAi is systemic. The goal of this project
is to identify and characterize C. elegans mutants that either enhance or
suppress systemic RNAi, but do not affect autonomous RNAi. A transgenic strain
has been constructed that allows direct monitoring of systemic RNAi of a GFP-
reporter gene. This strain will be mutagenized and animals with a suppressed or
enhanced systemic RNAi response will be isolated and characterized genetically
and molecularly. Selected genes will then be cloned and the expression and
function of their products will be further characterized.
