The Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) will plan and host an intensive workshop
to design an instrument for universities to be able to collect and disaggregate
information on the career pathways of STEM PhD students and alumni. The project
includes two preparatory meetings with key stakeholders (one focused on
disciplinary societies and the other focused on graduate deans and provosts),
and a workshop where participants will develop a survey instrument and a
framework document to guide universities in the administration of the survey.
The workshop will help advance the knowledge by (1) providing the basis for
universities to better assess the impact of their curricula and professional
development offerings and (2) capturing the scope of the intellectual, economic,
and social contributions of STEM doctorate holders. The workshop also will
synthesize the results of a gap analysis that was conducted during an earlier
feasibility study. Instrument and survey results will be disseminated to the 500
CGS member institutions and the broader higher education community.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data collection instrument will include variables
using the CGS gap analysis of existing career pathways data collection efforts
and items needed to inform improvements in doctoral programs such as (1) program
of study, institution, graduation date; (2) professional development
opportunities and their value; (3) motivations and determinants for exploring
various career paths; and (4) employment status, employment sector, and
relationship between employment and doctoral training. The variables might
correspond with those in existing datasets such as the Survey of Earned
Doctorates and Survey of Doctoral Recipients for purposes of national
comparisons. A framework document will inform the scope of the effort and
outline guidelines to support the consistent implementation of the PhD career
pathways data collection.
