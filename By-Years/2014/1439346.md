The stability of DNA allows an organism to live and reproduce, but changes in
the genome provide a means for the evolution of a species in response to a
changing environment. Plant breeding has always relied on changes in DNA for
generating the genetic variation needed to develop new varieties. Some of these
changes in the genome occur in a controlled manner during normal seed
development, but this can also occur following DNA damage after exposure to
excessive light, ozone and UV. Biotechnological manipulation of the plant genome
has allowed us to induce controlled genomic changes in plants, providing a huge
potential for molecularly designed plant breeding. Research by the more than 80
laboratories in this field continues to rapidly expand the understanding of how
plants deal with environmental and endogenous threats to their growth,
development, and genomic stability, to advance the long-standing goals of gene
targeting and site-directed mutagenesis of plants, and to develop technologies
for the acceleration of plant breeding. Individuals with previous training and
experience in repair and recombination, who have moved into plant models, have
created a dynamic and productive new discipline.

This proposal is to help support travel for 10 young scientists to attend a
conference on Plant Genome Stability and Change is scheduled for July 17-20,
2014 at the Asilomar Conference Center, in Pacific Grove, California. The
meeting plans to bring together an international group of senior and junior
investigators, postdocs and graduate students working in or interested in the
area of DNA repair and epigenetics and expose them to cutting-edge science via
talks and posters. The meeting venue is also expected to promote lively and
wide-ranging discussions that include all attendees, after talks and in more
informal settings. The organizers plan to encourage, to the fullest extent
possible, participation by women and underrepresented minorities.
