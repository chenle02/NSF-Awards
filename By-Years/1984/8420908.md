Gas lasers were used in industry many years ago, but continue to be of research
interest because the excitation methods and detailed processes involved are not
sufficiently understood. The feasibility of using a new type structure, a
modified wave guide, to achieve high pressure, carbon dioxide, laser is
demonstrated. The implications are that this could lead to small form factor,
tunable, and well-controlled lasers of sufficient power to fit many portable
applications. The discharge processes are elucidated and the investigation is
extended into rare gas lasers to validate the possibility that these also can be
excited by a radio frequency (eximer) method in a small structure. Preliminary
plans for follow-up, developmental research are formulated.
