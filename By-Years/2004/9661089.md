*** 96-61089 Kalkhoran This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will demonstrate large area cold cathode arrays for field emission
displays based on gallium nitride/aluminum nitride (GaN-AlN) alloys grown in a
low-temperature plasma-assisted, chemical vapor deposition and surface texturing
facility. With a bandgap of 6.2 electron volts, AIN may exhibit negative
electron affinity, and thus electrons emanating from the high conductivity GaN
contact will readily pass through the graded AI/Ga nitride region and be emitted
into vacuum at low applied voltages. GaN stripes deposited on glass or another
substrate will form row electrodes, while indium tin oxide (ITO) stripes above
the phosphor on the faceplate will serve as column electrodes. Due to the
expected negative electron affinity of AIN, no grid may be required. This new
cathode material can alleviate the present high voltage problems associated with
high work-function metal "microtip" cathodes, as well as the lack of n-type
conductivity in thin film diamond cathodes. Coupled with on-going development of
cathodoluminescent phosphors, the GaN/AlN cold cathode research will enable
manufacture of flat panel displays under controlled conditions with cathode and
phosphor components. In Phase II, the GaN/AlN alloy cold cathodes would be
optimized and used for lighting pixels on faceplates coated with
cathodoluminescent phosphors, demonstrating an operating flat panel display.
Efficient cold cathode field emitters will find extensive commercial use in flat
panel displays. They can also be used in new sub-miniature vacuum tubes for
ultra-high frequency applications, such as in communications systems. ***
