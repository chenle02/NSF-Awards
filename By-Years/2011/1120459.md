The objective is to broaden participation in the Geosciences by increasing the
number of African-American or Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Hispanic
or Latino, females, and first generation college students. Significant
Opportunities in Atmospheric Research and Sciences Program exposes the students
to the atmospheric and related sciences. The program will give underrepresented
students experience in atmospheric research during a ten-week summer research
internship at the National Center for Atmospheric Research or at laboratories of
other SOARS sponsors. There is a strong, formal mentoring program and a vibrant
learning community support for all protégés. A technical writing workshop is
also part of the summer program to help students to write scientific proposals
