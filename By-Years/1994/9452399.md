9452399 Carrick This project is designed to enhance the undergraduate
instruction in biology by integrating microbial ecology into the subject matter
of three courses. Inclusion of microorganisms in the study of biology is
important since they contribute significantly to the formation and decomposition
of organic matter, in particular biological-mediated oxidation and reduction of
carbon. Emphasis is therefore in microbial ecology and involves 1)
identification and quantification, 2) trophic structure, 3) growth and
metabolism (light, temperature, nutrients). Unifying ecological principles are
also being demonstrated and compared with more complex biological systems that
are often difficult to study in the time allotted for most class laboratories
(3-4 hours). In addition, field investigations cultivate student appreciation
for some environmental realities that need to be taken into account when
designing and interpreting experiments in ecology.
