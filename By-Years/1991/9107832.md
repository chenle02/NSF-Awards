Theoretical research at the interface between astrophysics and elementary
particle physics will include studies of inflationary cosmology (in which the
universe undergoes a period of very rapid expansion), the binding of free quarks
into nucleons in the early universe, and the nature of walls between different
domains in the universe. All of these topics are important elements of our
emerging picture of how the universe evolved to its present state.
