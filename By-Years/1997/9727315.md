Abstract - Lund - 9727315 Prof. Carl R. F. Lund, of SUNY-Buffalo, will
investigate the selective para-chlorination of toluene over ZSM-5 catalyst. This
study on zeolite catalysis is relevant in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, fine
chemical, and basic chemical industries. The research will be focused on (a) the
mechanism of liquid-phase chlorination by Cl2 and SO2Cl2 at low temperature, (b)
the characterization of active sites, (c) the mechanism of deactivation, and (d)
the improvement of ZSM-5 activity, selectivity and endurance. The
characterization methods will include XRD, ICP-AES, IR, BET adsorption, and NH3
and SO2 adsorption and desorption. Adsorption calorimetry will provide
information for the energy terms of a microkinetic model. Procedures for
activity recovery --such as oxidation or solvent extraction-- and for activity
maintenance --such as cyclic operation-- will be investigated. Two graduate
students will be involved in the research; knowledge transfer to undergraduate
courses will occur by means of new problems for kinetics and reactor design
courses.
