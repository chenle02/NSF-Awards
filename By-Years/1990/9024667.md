Plasma diagnostic techniques based on laser induced fluorescence are used to
study transport characteristics in a fully ionized plasma. A recently developed
method for determining locally averaged electric field, from ion acceleration
data, is used to make experimental determinations of the Fokker-Planck
coefficients under various plasma conditions, for comparison with theory.
