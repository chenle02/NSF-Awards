This project is a training grant which allows an ecological anthropologist at
Indiana university to study remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems
(GIS) to advance his ongoing study of the tropical forest environment in Brazil.
The investigator will learn the use of specialized computer programs for
analyzing various types of environmental and social data in a geographic
context. After the training period the investigator will continue his analysis
of the causes of deforestation in the Amazon Basin.
