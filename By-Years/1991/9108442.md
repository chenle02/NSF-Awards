Dr. Feldmann will produce unique transformants of Arabidopsis with the seed
infection procedure using the T-DNA tagging method. The target is to produce
5,000 lines a year. The transformants will be screened initially on agar plates,
and then in soil grown plants. All lines that have a visible alteration in
phenotype will be recorded and made available to the general scientific
community. The availability of the seeds will be announced through the
electronic Arabidopsis bulletin board. Scientists who wish to screen for
specific phenotypes will be permitted to come to University of Arizona to do so
on a case by case basis. Dr. Feldmann plans to deposit the mutant lines to a
national Arabidopsis resource center at the end of this grant period. The
importance of seed transformation in the tagging and cloning of Arabidopsis
genes have been established. It is extremely time- consuming to produce the
tagged lines and this project will provide invaluable resources to the plant
molecular biology community.
