The researcher seeks to develop a network of annually resolved, multi-century
tree-ring records in tropical southern Africa in order to examine regional
hydroclimatic variability. The research aims to explore whether a network of new
tree-ring records from southern Africa can provide unique paleo-proxy data to
help address a variety of questions about hydroclimatic variability, its causes,
and impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary broader impacts involve collecting
data from a poorly sampled region with potentially important insights into
climate, supporting a U.S. graduate student, and helping build strong scientific
ties with African scientists and students.
