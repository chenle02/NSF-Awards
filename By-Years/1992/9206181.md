Spawning periods represent critical times for production and vulnerable times
for harvesting of fish stocks and it is important to understand their causal
basis. This research project explores a new hypothesis in order to explain the
patterns of mating in pelagically-spawning marine fishes: the hypothesis is
that, spawning sites and times are selected in order to improve fertilization
success rates. Previous studies have shown that for the bluehead wrasse,
Thalassoma bifasciatum, the timing of mating varies dramatically between local
populations, that mean fertilization rates are surprisingly low and appeared to
be influenced by turbulence and location on the reef, and that the number of
sperm released by males correlates significantly with the size and fecundity of
the female with whom they are mating. This project will undertake three
interrelated investigations on: 1. the timing of mating, 2. the location of
mating, and 3. fertilization success.
