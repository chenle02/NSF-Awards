The focus of this research is in the area of electron transfer catalysis. A
combination of computational and experimental methods will be used to study
electrocyclic reactions, electron transfer catalyzed vinycyclopropane
rearrangements and the radical cation Bergman cyclization. The educational focus
will consist of the development of a course entitled `Computers in Chemistry.`
The course links computational chemistry to practical applications and involves
industrial participants. With this Faculty Early Development (CAREER) award, the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and
educational activities of Dr. Olaf G. Wiest of the Department of Chemistry at
the University of Notre Dame. Professor Wiest will focus his research efforts on
the area of electron transfer catalysis. A combination of computational and
experimental techniques will help in understanding the role of radical cations
in electrocyclic reactions, an important class of organic transformations. The
educational activities will focus on the interface between theory and experiment
and stresses computational chemistry at the undergraduate and graduate level
