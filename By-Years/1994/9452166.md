9452166 Nelson Given the increasing relevance of distributed network
environments and the social needs they serve, distributed programming skills
should become part of the undergraduate computer science curriculum. This
proposal requests hardware to form a dedicated laboratory for distributed
computing, consisting of ten networked workstations. This will support the
addition of three courses in the regular curriculum, Computer Networks and
Concurrency Control and Recovery, and a senior level projects course. Because
students will require system level access to the equipment, this laboratory must
be isolable through a bridge from a larger departmental and campus network to
which it will be connected. The class Computer Networks will concentrate on low-
level network programming, often at the packet level. The Concurrency Control
and Recovery will address distributed programming at a higher level by
concentrating on the implementation of algorithms from the distributed database
tradition. The third class will be a senior projects course in which students
realize novel network services typically requiring the execution of remote
cooperating clients.
