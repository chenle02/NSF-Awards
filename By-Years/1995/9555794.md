9555794 Merseth The implementation of secondary school instructional materials
is being enhanced by the production of informational and staff development
materials. These new materials include case studies and video segments related
to each of the NSF supported, comprehensive secondary instructional materials
development projects and are being produced in print, video and interactive
formats. These materials illuminate the salient content and pedagogical features
of the secondary instructional materials and are designed for use by those
involved in evaluation and selection of instructional materials for high schools
as well as for staff developers.
