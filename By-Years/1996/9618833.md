If "to err is human," then understanding the origin, nature, detection, and
correction of errors should be an important goal for those engaged in the study
of human-computer interaction. There are many ways in which we may err; the
current proposal tackles one of the most modest, least studied, but most
pervasive types of human errors: errors in performing simple, rule-based tasks.
Rule-based tasks include tasks such as getting money from an ATM, programming a
VCR to record a show, or using a browser to surf the web. Such tasks involve
following a limited set of rules (i.e., well described procedures) to achieve
limited, but well defined goals. They do not involve problem solving or
creativity. Though seemingly modest in terms of their demands upon human
cognition, the prevalence of errors in such tasks seems constant and high even
with experienced users. The increasing number of such tasks at home (e.g.,
programmable voice-mail, thermostats, and bike odometers) and work (e.g., flight
management computer on advanced commercial aircraft, routine use of spreadsheets
or databases, and email systems) suggests that an indepth understanding of
errors in these tasks could significantly improve the design of many simple but
important interactive tools.
