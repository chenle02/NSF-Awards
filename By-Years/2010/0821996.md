The Knowledge for Teaching Secondary School Mathematics (KnoTSS) project
examines the nature and process of collaborations between mathematicians and
mathematics teacher educators engaged in the preparation of secondary
mathematics teachers. KnoTSS participants are teams of mathematicians and
educators who co-teach two courses (one mathematics course and one methods of
teaching mathematics course) aimed at building integrated knowledge of content
and pedagogy. KnoTSS research will answer the following questions: How do
collaborations develop and evolve? How can they be fostered within institutions?
What is the intellectual terrain co-created and traversed by collaborators? How
do they negotiate its boundaries? How do they position themselves with respect
to it and to each other?&lt;br/&gt;
