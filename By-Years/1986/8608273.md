The goal of this research is to develop a theoretical model of a new concept of
laser machining, which utilizes two intersecting laser beams, so that
optimization of the process parameters will be possible. The importance of this
new process will be limited if the material removal rate and the surface quality
and integrity of the workpiece are not optimized. The theoretical model will be
tested and compared to experimental results. Workpiece materials to be studied
are ceramics, composites and hardened steels. This new concept of laser
machining is capable of producing three-dimensional shapes similar to those
produced by conventional machining, but with increases in energy efficiency of
the process by a few orders of magnitude. Potential applications include
manufacturing of ceramic engines and composite aircraft.
