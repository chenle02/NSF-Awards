This award provides $50,000 for supplementary funding for phase two of an
earlier grant (SRS 87-19232). The objective of this project will be to identify
science and technology data sources, collect such information, and provide a
baseline of statistical data on S&T resources in Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore,
Hong Kong, Indonesia and the Philippines. It will also provide an opportunity to
gather more in-depth information in the phase I countries of South Korea,
Taiwan, and the People's Republic of China. NSF has the responsibility to
provide information and analysis of the scientific and engineering resources of
the United States and other countries. This project will provide basic S&T
indicator data for the Pacific Rim countries. Very little quantitative
information currently exists on the S&T resources of these newly industrializing
and important countries.
