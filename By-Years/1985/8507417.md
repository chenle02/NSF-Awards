Recent results from this study indicate that noise measurements can reflect not
only the product particle size distribution but also the character of the
material being broken. Hence, noise parameters could provide valuable
fundamental information relating to the differing mechanisms of breakage found
in the numerous materials which are ground in ball and rod mills. A better
understanding of these mechanisms will assist in the formulation of improved
breakage models and result in increased efficiency of present-day grinding
operations. To investigate the breakage mechanisms, work is performed on a
variety of materials to link particle breakage with overall mill noise levels
and with individual particle acoustic emission.
