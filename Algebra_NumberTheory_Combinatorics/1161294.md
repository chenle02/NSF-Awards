The proposal describes several projects related to algorithmic and asymptotic
aspects of group theory: * Constructing finitely presented groups with
"transcendental" properties (in particular, finitely presented infinite torsion
groups). * Complexity of residually finite groups. * Asymptotic and Burnside
properties of group actions of maximal growth * Asymptotic cones of finitely
presented groups. * Asymptotic properties of amenable groups. These topics are
intimately related. For example, Higman embeddings and S-machines are going to
be used to construct finitely presented torsion groups and in the study of
complexity of the word problem in groups.

Modern group theory is a very fast developing area of mathematics that
accumulates methods from geometry, combinatorics, logic and computer science.
Our proposal describes projects that are require methods and ideas from all
these areas. In particular, constructing a finitely presented infinite torsion
group (which is one of the outstanding problems in group theory) will require
constructing a suitable kind of Turing machine (called S-machines) and adapting
methods from geometric group theory to find suitable quotients of groups
simulating these machines. Another idea coming from geometry (and due mostly to
Gromov) is the idea of an asymptotic cone of a group. We are going to study
asymptotic cones to discover algebraic and algorithmic properties of groups.
