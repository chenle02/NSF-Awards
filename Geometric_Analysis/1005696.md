Abstract

Award: DMS-1005696 Principal Investigator: Victor Guillemin

The principal investigator proposes to study various inverse problems involving
the semi-classical Schroedinger operator and, together with Alejandro Uribe and
Zuoqin Wang, Zoll-type phenomena for these operators. He also proposes to study,
together with Emily Dryden and Rosa Sena-Dias, an equivariant version of the
Abreu conjecture: Does the spectrum of the Laplace operator on a toric orbifold
determine the orbifold? In addition he proposes to investigate, together with
David Jerison, Yves Colin de Verdiere, Steve Zelditch and Hamid Hezari, spectral
properties of the wave trace for the Laplace operator on a convex domain in the
plane in the vicinity of the perimeter, L. He also proposes to continue his
current collaboration with Dan Burns on asymptotic properties of the spectral
measures associated with Toeplitz operators on Kahler manifolds and to work with
his students on a number of problems in equivariant symplectic geometry:
generalizations of the Delzant theorem for Poisson manifolds and manifolds with
degenerate symplectic forms and computations in K-cohomology for GKM manifolds.
Finally, a long-standing project with Shlomo Sternberg is to write an on-line
text book on functorial properties of symplectic manifolds with applications to
semi-classical analysis.

The overall theme of this proposal is "inverse problems" in spectral theory of
which the most famous classical example is Mark Kac's "Can one hear the shape of
a drum." What one "hears" in many of the problems above are discrete sets of
spectral data: sophisticated versions of the vibrations of a drum, and what one
wants to glean from this data are sophisticated versions of the shape of the
drum itself. There has been a lot of progress on problems of this type over the
last two decades, but there have been as well a number of cautionary
counterexamples which show that further progress may require techniques that are
still in their infancy. A large part of the focus of this proposal is developing
such techniques.
