Organic radicals will be prepared in the gas phase and the corresponding
infrared absorption spectra recorded. In a separate set of experiments,
utilizing a flowing afterglow apparatus, the reactivity of hydrocarbon radicals
in the gas phase with negative ions will be investigated. Gas phase species to
be generated and studied include methyl, vinyl, allyl, allene, phenyl, and
benzyl radicals. The radicals will be produced via a pyrolysis supersonic jet
with a high temperature nozzle. A photoionization mass spectrometer will be
employed to follow the pyrolysis effluent at the head of a zirconia nozzle. %%%
This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports an investigation of
radicals and biradicals and their reactions with a variety of species in the gas
phase under the direction of Professor G. B. Ellison at the University of
Colorado. Some of the most reactive species produced during the course of many
chemical transformations are radicals, which contain one unpaired electron, and
biradicals, which contain two unpaired electrons. Whereas most of the previous
work with organic radicals involved reactions in liquid solutions, Professor
Ellison will generate reactive radical species in the gas phase with a high
temperature nozzle. The radicals will be exposed to a stream of charged gas
phase molecules and the chemical subsequent chemical transformations observed
directly. Comparison of the experimental results with computer simulations will
lead to a better understanding of the reactions of radicals and biradicals.
