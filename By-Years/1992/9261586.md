This project deals with the feasibility of developing a small modular
piezoelectric damping element for application in vibration suppression of
structural dynamic systems, such as buildings, bridges, automobiles, machines,
aircraft, spacecrafts and submarines. It involves material research combined
with device design and control strategy research to discover new methods of
noise and vibration reduction and control. Key areas of research investigation
include low-voltage actuation, control strategy and operational modes, and
sensor/actuator/electronics integration and implementation.***//
