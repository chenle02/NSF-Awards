Organized collections of thunderstorms known as mesoscale convective systems
have been identified as producers of most of the rainfall in the tropics and in
mid-latitudes during the spring, summer and fall. The Principal Investigator
will continue his research towards an improved understanding of mesoscale
convective systems (MCSs) and the atmospheric boundary layer. Under previously
NSF sponsored research the Principal Investigator produced many significant new
findings. Among these are the identification of the factors responsible for
several distinctive features of MCSs. This line of research will continue with
both observational and numerical modeling components. Emphasis will be placed
on: 1. The dynamics of a region of low pressure which often trails MCSs, known
as "wake lows" 2. The formation mechanisms of mesoscale vortices which form out
of MCSs. These stable vortices are believed to be a triggering mechanism for
future rounds of severe weather several hours after the original MCS has
dissipated. 3. The controlling factors for series of MCSs which are often
responsible for severe rain events. If successful, this research can be used to
develop better numerical and conceptual models for the forecasting of severe MCS
weather events.
