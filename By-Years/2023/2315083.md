This field campaign is focused on gaining a better understanding of the
mechanisms for atmospheric ozone formation throughout the Wasatch Front near
Salt Lake City Utah. During the summer of 2024, aircraft-based measurements of
ozone and the precursors leading to its formation will be made in the atmosphere
around Salt Lake City. This research is focused on improving the photochemical
modeling that predicts the formation of high ozone concentrations. The results
are expected to contribute to the development of mitigation strategies that can
help reduce ozone pollution around Utah’s Wasatch Front.

This project will: (1) assess how increased albedo from exposed salt flats may
be enhancing photochemistry in polluted air masses that can then be transported
back into the Salt Lake Valley by the lake breeze; (2) identify hypothesized
large primary sources of formaldehyde and other oxygenated volatile organic
compounds that influence ozone production; (3) investigate whether anthropogenic
emission inventories, such as the EPA’s National Emission Inventory, miss a
significant amount of reactive carbon or nitrogen oxide fluxes; and (4) diagnose
how the addition of wildfire smoke changes the sensitivity of ozone production
in the urban environment.

This project supports a postdoctoral scholar and several graduate and
undergraduate students. There will also be public events during the field
campaign to describe ozone pollution and its formation and discuss the specific
challenges associated reducing it in the region.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
