of the Focusing Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation

Abstract

This project addresses the behavior of solutions of the focusing nonlinear
Schroedinger equation in the singular semiclassical limit, with particular
attention paid to solutions that are tied to definite given initial data.
Specific research goals include (i) generalizing a steepest-descents procedure
for matrix Riemann-Hilbert problems to recover asymptotics of the initial-value
problem for general real-analytic and oscillatory-analytic initial data, (ii)
computing rigorous spectral asymptotics for the nonselfadjoint Zakharov-Shabat
operator and taking estimates of the error into account in the inverse-
scattering problem, (iii) studying sets of minimal weighted Green's capacity in
the upper half-plane and relating them solidly to semiclassical asymptotics, and
(iv) determining the sensitivity of the asymptotics to the presence of
singularities in the data and also robustness to structural perturbations. The
analysis will employ numerical methods, careful asymptotic spectral analysis of
a family of nonselfadjoint differential operators, and potential-theoretic
aspects of functional and complex analysis.

The focusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation is a ubiquitous model equation for
the propagation of waves of many different kinds (water waves, light waves,
etc.) in the simultaneous presence of nonlinear effects that can "self-amplify"
the waves and "dispersion" which can pull the waves apart. In particular, it is
a tested and accepted model for the transmission of lightwave pulses along
certain types of glass optical fibers. This project will produce new
understanding of this model equation relevant to situations where the
coefficient of the dispersive term in the equation is relatively small, or
alternatively, nonlinear processes dominate the evolution of broad disturbances
for short times. "Dispersion-shifted" optical fibers currently being installed
in many modern telecommunication systems provide an environment where the
effects of dispersion and nonlinearity are present in precisely such a skewed
proportion. The results of this project will be likely to influence the analysis
and design of the next generation of high-speed optical telecommunications
systems.
