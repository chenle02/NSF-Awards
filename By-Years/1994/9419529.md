9419529 Etler This award provides support for a postdoctoral fellowship for
Dennis Etler to conduct paleoanthropological research in China on important
human fossil discoveries at the Yunxian site. This research is expected to
contribute to improved understanding of the evolution of early man in China. The
research will be conducted in collaboration with the Hubei Archaeological
Institute, Wuhan, China. Initial work at the Yunxian site suggest that the
fossil human skulls found at the site are very old, perhaps in excess of 780,000
years old. They are the most complete crania of such great antiquity found to
date on the Asian mainland and will undoubtedly be the subject of wide-ranging
discussions in paleoanthropological and archaeological circles for years to
come. This postdoctoral fellowship should pave the way for a larger
interdisciplinary effort and provide important access for U.S. researchers to
this site in the future.
