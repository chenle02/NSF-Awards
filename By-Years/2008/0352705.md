AST-0352705/Jeffs, BYU&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will support research into
the development of radio frequency interference excision techniques for
applications in sensitive radio astronomical instrumentation. The work will
exploit recent advances in high speed signal processing and microwave
technology. The work will extend single-dish real-time excision algorithms to
array feeds for medium and large radio telescopes.
