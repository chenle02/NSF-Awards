Ecological knowledge is critical to identifying solutions for the enormous
environmental and health challenges that are facing our globe. The Ecological
Society of America proposes a two-year activity in which key ecological research
needs and opportunities will be identified, a plan of action for meeting these
challenges will be developed, and specific mechanisms for implementing this plan
of action will be defined. These activities will be carried out by a committee
comprised of ecologists from all academic ranks, from conservation
organizations, and from government and private agencies. At least two reports
will be written to articulate important needs and actions. One of these
documents will be used by the ecological community external to the ESA, while
the second document will help the Society determine if it is best organized to
implement the action plans it recommends. By assessing current scientific
priorities, identifying needs for ecological research and training, and
developing an action plan for the ecological community, the proposed activities
will ensure that ecologists contribute to interdisciplinary and integrated
solutions to environmental problems.
