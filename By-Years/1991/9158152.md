The research will investigate applications of imaging technology to the
nondestructive evaluation of civil structures. The initial focus of the research
will be on detection of the reinforcing bars, voids and cracks in reinforced
concrete. The technology also could be applied to the nondestructive evaluation
of wood, masonry and steel structures.
