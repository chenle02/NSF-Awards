The effects of interstitial nitrogen on the crystal and magnetic structures of
new rare earth-iron-nitrogen magnets as well as the effects of cobalt nickel,
manganese, aluminum, and silicon substitution for iron in these nitrided
compounds will be studied. Neutron diffraction will be used to determine
preferential occupancies of the substitutional elements on the different sites
in crystal structure. Both neutron diffraction and Mossbauer spectroscopy will
be used to determine the magnetics structures of these compounds and to reveal
the detailed magnetic behavior at each of the different iron sites as a function
of synthetic methods and processing techniques. The microscopic structural
information from neutron diffraction and Mossbauer spectroscopy will be
correlated with bulk properties as determined by magnetic measurements.
Understanding in detail how the interstitial nitrogen and substitutional
elements affect the iron and rare earth magnetic interactions will be an
important step towards developing even better magnets.
