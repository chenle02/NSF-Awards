Greenland ice loss quadrupled over the last two decades and presently accounts
for one quarter of global sea level rise. The ice loss is due to changes in
surface mass balance and ice sheet dynamics associated with rising air and ocean
temperatures. The associated increasing freshwater discharge is impacting the
regional ocean, including its ecosystems, and has the potential to impact the
large-scale North Atlantic circulation. Thus, Greenland's changes are having
far-reaching consequences for global societies, yet the mechanisms responsible
for these changes are not well understood. Dynamic ice loss, in particular, was
likely triggered by changes at the margins of marine-terminating glaciers,
through ice/ocean/atmosphere processes that are either absent or poorly
represented in climate, ice sheet and ocean models. The interaction of the
ocean, the glaciers and atmosphere at Greenland?s margins is a new research
frontier. The complex processes involved include the coupling of multiple
components of the Earth system, the challenges of obtaining and integrating
diverse data from this region, and of modeling such a complex system. These
challenges make this a problem that can only be addressed by bringing together
multiple disciplines, including data management, collaboratively exploring
diverse approaches and working across national borders. This project establishes
a network to help scientists working in this area to share their data and work
collaboratively.

The goal of this project is to substantially enhance multi-disciplinary
activities and collaboration through the establishment of the GRISO (Greenland
Ice Sheet Ocean) Science Network - an international, multidisciplinary, open
network of scientists and cyberinfrastructure experts. Participants have a
shared interested in advancing collective understanding of problems related to
Greenland Ice Sheet change and its impact on regional and global climate. GRISO
RCN activities will bring together scientists focused on all aspects of
ice/ocean/atmosphere/climate data in Greenland and provide a framework for
productive collaborative interaction. Specific objectives include two workshops,
and a series of synthesis efforts. Additionally, a virtual data portal,
leveraging existing infrastructure, will make interdisciplinary data submission
and data availability easier and promote uniform and appropriate data management
practices. The RCN builds on activities initiated by the former GRISO US CLIVAR
Working Group and explicitly addresses priorities identified in a report from an
international workshop held in 2013.
