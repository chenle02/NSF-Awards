Under this award, the PI will examine a well-documented Eocene- Paleocene rock
complex from a paleo subduction thrust, now exposed in Alaska, in order to
quantify and understand the differences, at a variety of length scales, between
the upper aseismic parts of a subduction trust and the lower seismogenic parts.
This study will test the hypothesis that deposition of minerals in cracks
strengthens and locks subduction thrusts in the periods between major
eatthquakes. During field work, the PI and a PhD student will document changes
in structural fabric and mineral veins of various generations. Later lab studies
will look at changes in physical properties, and mineralogy under similar PT
conditions as presently exist in the SW Japan subduction zone. Quantification of
shear zone paramenters, changes in mineralogy, intensity of pressure solution,
density and porosity, and size/shape of blocks and matrix, will allow
interpretations of the importance of simple sliding (aseismic) vs. stick-slip
(seismic) behavior. Further, the results of the lab experiments can be used to
interpret textures and structural features indicative of sliding, stick-slip,
and heating. These observations and measurements, including fluid inclusion
studies with Vrolijk, will be useful for testing ideas about velocity weakening
in actural subduction zones, providing guidance for experimentalists on what
types of materials are best for deformation studies, a preview of what will be
seen in riser drilling at Nankai, and 10-100m scale constraints on interpreting
3D seismic studies in subduction complexes.
