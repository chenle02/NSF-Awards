"International Survey of Access Technologies" &amp; ABSTRACT Modern technology
is enhancing the capabilities of students with disabilities to acquire higher
education in all academic disciplines, but the importance of this technology is
especially critical in science and mathematics. The project consists of a broad
review and comparison of present technologies and methodologies used in Europe
and the U.S. to improve access to education by students with visual, hearing,
motor, and learning disabilities. Efforts will be made to identify uses of
modern computer technology in various disciplines and the training approaches
used to prepare students for the use of the technology. The research will be
conducted during a sabbatical from Linn Community College, and the results will
be used in the formulation of a comprehensive program at Oregon State University
for the training of students with disabilities in science, mathematics, and
engineering. Results will also be analyzed for publication in appropriate
educational journals. ***
