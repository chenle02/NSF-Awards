The deep interior of Earth, revealed by seismic waves, affects processes at the
surface of our planet. Among these is the solidification of Earth's inner core
from the liquid iron of its outer core. Variations in this solidification,
detected from seismic waves, will be helpful in understanding and predicting
variations in our magnetic field that can affect our atmosphere and surface
life. This project seeks to map the solidification of Earth's inner core using
seismic waves reflected and transmitted through it. Education and training will
be provided to graduate students in computation, digital data retrieval and
processing, and structural imaging from any wave-like phenomena. These skills
are transferable to broad areas of science and engineering, including resource
exploration, computational science, and medical imaging. Results will be
incorporated in undergraduate introductory courses to encourage recruitment and
retention of students across STEM fields. Results will also be regularly shared
with public media having interests in earthquakes and planetary
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transitions in the elastic structure beneath the
Inner Core Boundary (ICB), including their effects on lateral variations in
elastic waves speeds, body waveform complexity and attenuation and the depth
onset of elastic anisotropy are important for understanding the process of
compositional convection. This process has been favored as the mechanism that
currently sustains our magnetic field through the crystallization and the
buoyant rise of light elements as the inner core solidifies. Unique elements of
the proposed activity include separating the effect of earthquake sources on
waveforms to improve estimates of inner core attenuation, evaluating the
relative contributions of attenuation by forward scattering and intrinsic
attenuation, relating small- scale heterogeneity to a solidification fabric and
elastic anisotropy, and exploiting the use of a body wave having high
sensitivity to the shear velocity structure beneath the inner core boundary.
