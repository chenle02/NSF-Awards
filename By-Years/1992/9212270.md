This proposal studies a vesicular membrane based biomimetic system for removing
hazardous metals cation from aqueous streams. In preliminary work, the PI has
used equilibrium detergent dialysis to fabricate unilamellar vesicles made of
soybean phosphatidylcholine harboring a lipophilic metal carrier, the ionophone
A23187, in the vesicle membrane, and a chelating agent (NTA, nitrilotiacetate)
in the vesicle interior. When the vesicle dispersion is mixed with an aqueous
solution containing the metal cations, the cations become bound to the metal
carrier in the membrane. The complex is soluble in the membrane, and it diffuses
across the lamella to the inside surface of the membrane vesicle where the metal
ion is released. The released ion complexes with the chelator, thereby keeping
the concentration of the ion- lipophile complex at the inside surface of the
vesicle membrane extremely small. With this value small, the driving force for
diffusion of additional complexes of the ion and the lipophile remains large,
and the vesicle continues to strongly uptake the metal ions. Results of batch
experiments in which the vesicles were mixed solutions containing only Cu(II),
Cd(II), or Pb(II) cations demonstrate that the vesicles are effective scavengers
of these metal ions with rapid uptake and high loading. The primary problem with
this technique is the high cost of the lipophilic carrier and the
phosphidylcholine. The proposed research will explore less costly lipophilic
carriers such as cleft type metal binding agents and crown ether-based agents,
and less costly components for the vesicles such as alkyl benzene sulfonate
surfactants. Competitive metal ion uptake will also be studied, and a bench
scale continuous metal recovery system will be tested which uses hollow fiber
membrane cartridges to contact the vesicle dispersion and the waste stream in a
countercurrent mode.
