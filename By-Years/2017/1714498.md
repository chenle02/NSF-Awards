Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) are intimately linked with the deaths of massive stars
and with the birth of black holes. They are also the most distant and luminous
objects in the Universe, and some of them are expected to produce gravitational
waves that can soon be detected with the NSF-funded Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory. The team will use data obtained with ground-
based and space-based telescopes to learn about the explosion physics of GRBs
and use GRBs as probes of the early Universe. This project will provide
invaluable technical skills to undergraduate and graduate students as well as
postdoctoral researchers. The research program will be integrated into an
undergraduate course that employs an active learning approach, including an
observing trip to the Whipple Observatory. The growing understanding of GRBs
will be disseminated via public lectures at the Harvard-Smithsonian Observatory
Night program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team will obtain and analyze a
comprehensive set of multiwavelength observations of GRBs and host galaxies. The
goals of this project are (1) to delineate the energy scale, explosion geometry,
and true rate of short GRBs; (2) to determine the composition of GRB outflows;
and (3) to probe high-redshift galaxies and cosmic reionization. This study will
include new data from JVLA, ALMA, and ground-based near-infrared spectrographs,
along with relevant archival data sets. The results will be used to constrain
theoretical models of GRBs and to probe the intergalactic medium at high
redshift. Students and postdocs will lead the acquisition and analysis of data
from a variety of sources.
