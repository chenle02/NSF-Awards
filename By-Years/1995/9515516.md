Electron impact studies are used to probe the three-body problems of Auger and
direct double ionization and electron correlation in atoms. The apparatus is a
sophisticated electron spectrometer which allows coincidence measurements which
are multiply differential in angle and energy. A modification of the current
apparatus is proposed which would considerably extend the range of the
spectrometer without major cost. The information obtained will substantially
enhance our knowledge of the mechanism for double ionization in atoms.
