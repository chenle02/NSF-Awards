The project research is on the surface oxidation process on TRIP steels with
high strength and ductility that are expected to be the future choices for
automotive applications in the form of thin sheets. The proposed investigation
includes unique application of confocal scanning laser microscope for in-situ
visualization of the oxidation process. A major goal is to be able to identify
microstructural sites where the oxides initiate, and characterize the
morpholigical changes during oxide growth. Results from the high-temperature
studies will be combined with room temperature characterization of the scale and
steel chemistries and structures in developing analytical
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The close collaboration between CMU and steel
industrial researchers at US-Steel Technical Center (Monroeville, PA) and
Bethlehem Steel Homer Research Laboratory (Bethlehem, PA), will broaden the
training of materials graduate students by integrating elements of materials
performance into the existing training in processing, structure and properties.
This will give an opportunity to expose students on the various up and down
stream steel manufacturing steps in industrial environments. The graduate
student training is expected to result in an awareness of the criteria by which
materials performance is judged in the modern manufacturing industry. Distinct
plans are outlined to incorporate the collaborative efforts with industry into
teaching at CMU through courses on 'Materials Processing' and 'Transport and
Kinetics' that would include field trips to industrial sites.
