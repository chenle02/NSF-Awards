This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project examines holographic
data storage based on photorefractive recording materials as a promising
approach to overcoming the present I/O bottleneck that exists between high-speed
microprocessors and mass storage peripherals. Many of the needed optical systems
components (SLMs, CCDS, and tunable diode-lasers) are now available with
sufficient performance specifications; however, the lack of a suitable volume
recording medium is the primary problem. The medium should possess high
sensitivity, large dynamic range, and a reliable mechanism for nondestructive
readout. No single material to date satisfies all of these important criteria.
Com:One Devices, Inc., proposes to overcome this limitation by using novel
doping schemes to provide optimized two-photon photorefractive recording.
Evaluation of the dopants is based on detailed spectroscopic and
photoconductivity measurements. This approach is designed to provide a viable
two-photon recording material that will ultimately be used in a first-generation
read-write mass storage demonstration device.
