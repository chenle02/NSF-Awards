Understanding language is at the core of intelligent systems, and a required
component of several end-user applications such as machine translation, question
answering and text summarization. Most computational approaches to extract
meaning from text build a semantic representation capturing some of the meaning
intuitively understood by humans when reading text. For example, semantic role
labelers extract who did what to whom, how, when and where from plain text, and
semantic parsers transform text into logic forms. This exploratory EAGER project
defines new algorithms for extracting positive interpretations from negated
statements by detecting the focus of negation, that is, pinpointing the usually
few text chunks within a negation that are intended to be
negated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Negation is an intricate linguistic phenomenon
present in all human languages. From a theoretical point of view, it is well
known that negation often carries positive meanings ranging from implicatures to
entailments. Despite this observation, current computational approaches to
understand the effects of negation are limited to scope detection and disregard
the numerous positive interpretations immediately understood by humans when
reading text with negated elements. This project builds inter-sentential models
to detect the foci of negation, a key component to extract positive
interpretations from negations. Exploiting the context surrounding a negation is
key to improving foci detection, as existing intra-sentential models fail to
take into account key related events that signal the correct foci out of the
many potential foci for a given negation. Being able to extract positive
interpretations from negation will benefit the overall extraction of meaning
from text, since once positive interpretations associated with negative
expressions have been identified, they can be integrated with the
interpretations obtained for the text as a whole.
