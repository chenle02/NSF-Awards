A dropshaft filled with helical vanes of fixed helix angle has been developed.
These produce swirl and a resulting inward centrifuging effect for entrapped air
in the dropshaft flow. Simultaneously, the vanes act as an effective,
continuously distributed source of friction to dissipate energy. Dropshafts
connect collection elements in municipal surface drainage systems to large
underground conveyance tunnels. Air venting and energy dissipation are key
requirements. The new design integrates both features effectively. The project
is to explore a variation of this design for the case of very deep dropshafts in
which energy dissipation must be limited. This is accomplished with shafts only
partially filled with vanes, with a variable helix angle entrance section. The
flow structure in such a configuration, and optimization of the configuration,
will be determined experimentally. A simple analytical model of the flow will
also be developed. The design holds the potential for elimination of very large
deaeration chambers and separate energy dissipators, leading to much smaller and
more economical installations.
