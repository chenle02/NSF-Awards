The objective of the proposed work is a detailed experimental investigation of
the transition between a particulate bed without aeration and a fully fluidized
bed. Measurements of bed expansion, gas pressure drop, and axial bulk density
profiles are planned. The results will be used to identify plastic yield limits,
reversible stresses in particle assembly, the role of interaction between
particles and solid bounding walls. Different particulate materials will be used
in experiments. The results should provide an improved understanding of the
fluidization mechanism, reference data for modeling, and basic correlations
necessary to estimate the performance of gas- particle transport systems.
