The aim of this research program is to elucidate the physico- chemical
properties of individual binding of multi-site macromolecules and to develop a
new thermodynamic theory for the description of site-specific energetics. Dr. Di
Cera will explore the way individual sites are coupled to each other, and the
way their properties relate to those of the macromolecule as a whole and how the
cooperativity patterns arising locally form site-site interactions translate in
the global cooperative behavior of the macromolecule as a whole.
