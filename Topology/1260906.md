The Cascade Topology Seminar will hold its 49th meeting the weekend of December
1-2, 2012 in Eugene, Oregon within the University of Oregon's Fenton Hall. The
basic goals of the Cascade Topology Seminar are to provide for frequent contacts
between workers in similar fields, to facilitate local mathematician's keep
abreast of recent developments in Topology, Geometry and related fields by
bringing in speakers from outside the region, to enable graduate students and
early career topologists in the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Canada to
hear, consult, and possibly collaborate with the outside speakers and members of
other institutions, and to provide an opportunity for local people to lecture on
their own work.

As the CTS is designed in part to keep its participants abreast of recent
developments in their own and related fields, no attempt is made to limit the
topics covered in the lectures. However, the interests of the various organizers
tend to be mirrored by the interests of the speakers, thus, the lectures usually
concern algebraic, geometric, or low dimensional topology, differential or
algebraic geometry, or combinatorial group theory. The Seminar also coordinates
its activities with the Pacific Northwest Geometry Seminar and the Western
States Geometric Topology Workshop with whom joint meetings have occasionally
been held.
