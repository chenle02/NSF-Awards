VLSI Systems Education: Integration of High Level Synthesis, Analysis and Test
Generation Research Results into Undergraduate Minor Curriculum in VLSI Systems
Engineering This CISE Educational Innovation award supports the integration of
research in high-level VLSI synthesis, performance analysis and test vector
generation into the undergraduate curriculum in VLSI systems engineering. The
model curriculum will contain topics on the development of high-level functional
and behavioral modeling of VLSI designs, use of high-level VLSI synthesis
techniques and tools, developing and using performance models throughout the
design process, and generation of design verification tests. Curriculum support
material will include mini-books on these topics, term project modules, and,
most importantly, free software tools for high-level synthesis, performance
analysis and test generation. All of the curriculum material will disseminated
through the Internet and the World-Wide-Web.
