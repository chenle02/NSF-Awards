The investigators seek to promote interdisciplinary statistical and
combinatorial research by bringing together in this conference both junior and
senior researchers from different disciplines. The investigators have enlisted
many senior researchers of international repute to give plenary talks and/or to
organize academic sessions on various topics representing such diverse fields as
biology, combinatorial theory, computer science, econometrics, educational
research methodology, environmental science, epidemiology, geography,
information systems, psychology, and public health education. The project seeks
funding to support young researchers who are at an early stage in their careers,
particularly from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in mathematical
sciences, such as women and minorities. The opportunity for personal interaction
among beginning and established researchers that this conference provides is, we
believe, essential for the grooming of young researchers.



The investigators seek funding to promote interdisciplinary research involving
statistical techniques, and to facilitate participation in this conference of
approximately 30 young researchers (advanced graduate students and recent PhD
recipients), particularly from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in
mathematical sciences, such as women and minorities, so that they can become
part of existing or newly created research networks. Another vital aspect of
this conference at the local level is that it aims to create a network of
researchers in North Carolina involving those from major research centers such
as UNC Chapel Hill, Duke University, N. C. State University and Wake Forest
University, and those from somewhat lesser known campuses such as The University
of North Carolina at Greensboro and The North Carolina A&T University.
