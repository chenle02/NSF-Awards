This project is to provide for the activities of the Coupling, Energetics and
Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) Science Steering Committee and the
production of the CEDAR Post newsletter. The Steering Committee provides
leadership for the program and advice to the National Science Foundation program
officers who manage it. The main functions are to organize the annual workshop
and to review the scientific progress of the program. Funds are requested to
defray the costs of committee meetings and the production and mailing of the
CEDAR Post.
