The current state-of-the-art for bioprocess measurements is based on dated
technology. A new generic technology that can measure a number of analytes using
a common principle is greatly needed. Phase fluorometry promises to bridge this
gap based on a simple principle: a fluorophore exhibits a lifetime change in
response to an analyte, which can be measured as a phase angle change when the
probe is excited with intensity modulated light. Using fluorescence lifetime
(phase and modulation) measurements, this project will exploit recent advances
in chemistry, optics, and electronics for on-line pH, dissolved oxygen,
dissolved carbon dioxide and glucose sensing in bioreactors.
