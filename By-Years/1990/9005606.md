Polysphondylium pallidum is a cellular slime mold that forms distinctive
spatial patterns during its like cycle. One of these patterns, the radial
arrangement of spore-bearing arms about a central stalk, arises from a
spheroidal mass of cells at the base of the developing organism. The emergence
of the radial patterning from a spheroidal one is a true symmetry breaking event
which Dr. Cox proposes to study in cellular and molecular detail by examining
the structure and function of the genes involved. The genes coding for
patterning elements will be studied by conventional cloning techniques and used
to guess at possible functions; to study the timing and regulation of their
transcripts; and to use them in antisense constructs and gene disruption
experiments to ask whether or not the gene products are essential for
development and morphogenesis. The long range goal of this research is a
complete cellular understanding of morphogenesis in this simple system, with a
view to relating the various contributions made by cell-cell signaling and
physical interaction, the roles played by diffusible chemical signals, and the
possible contribution to the process of forces such as cell movement, surface
tension, and tissue deformation.
