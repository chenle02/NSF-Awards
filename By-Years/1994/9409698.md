In collaboration with Michael Birnbaum (SBR-9410572) the PI proposes to study
risk attitudes. The PI will investigate the behavior and attitudes of people who
participate in "The Big Spin," which is the California State Lottery's TV show.
The PI will be given access to the participants before, during, and after their
participation in the televised portion of the lottery. The risk attitudes of
these persons will be compared at various time periods, and their responses will
also be compared to the responses of a control group of non-participants. A one-
year follow-up of all participants is included in the design.
