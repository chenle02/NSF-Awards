Degradation of near surface ice-rich permafrost may release a large amount of
water to arctic and subarctic ecosystems, and the degree to which plants will
use and transpire the water via new root growth into former permafrost horizons
is not known. Determining the role of plants in affecting the fate of water from
degrading permafrost is important for constraining estimates of
evapotranspiration in models of soil moisture and energy balance. Preliminary
data show that plant species vary in their ability to use permafrost-derived
water. The objective of this investigation is to quantify new root growth into
former permafrost horizons and quantify the use of permafrost-derived water by
different plant species by comparing sites with and without permafrost. Hydrogen
and oxygen isotopes of water from the active layer, permafrost, and plant stems
collected in taiga ecosystems in Alaska will be measured. Bayesian inverse
modeling will be applied to determine water sources used by different species
and how they vary with seasonal changes in active layer thickness. The study
will contribute to understanding the consequences of permafrost degradation and
changes in plant water use for subarctic water cycling, energy balance, and
potential feedbacks to climate. The proposed work is supported by a Post-
doctoral Fellowship that will foster multiple collaborations and will enable the
principal investigator (PI) to initiate her first full-scale research program in
arctic ecosystem ecology. The PI will be trained in Bayesian statistics, ecology
of subarctic ecosystems, permafrost and hydrological science, and science
education and outreach. A workshop for high school teachers aimed at integrating
sub-Arctic ecology into the curriculum will be held at the Museum of the North,
University of Alaska Fairbanks.
