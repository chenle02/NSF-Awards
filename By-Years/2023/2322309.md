The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a next-generation landmine detection biosensor that can be
distributed in a wide range of fields, in various environmental conditions. The
project's primary goal is to provide a safe and efficient method to detect
landmines, which are often buried and camouflaged, causing a significant threat
to both military forces and civilians. The current detection methods are
outdated and risky, requiring physical on-site presence, and they are also
costly. Therefore, the proposed project aims to provide a more efficient and
cost-effective solution by utilizing genetic engineering, microbiology, and
biochemical approaches. The innovative biosensor system will employ two
biosensors that are engineered to use TNT/DNT and toluene as the sole nitrogen-
source and carbon source, respectively, to detect landmines and generate
fluorescent signals that can be amplified several folds for easy detection.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a highly sensitive landmine
detection biosensor. The proposed biosensor will employ bioreporter, genetic
engineering, microbiology, and biochemical approaches. The key features of this
technology include (1) signal amplification, (2) extreme environment adaptation,
and (3) TNT/DNT-response. The project's potential benefits extend beyond
landmine detection and clearance, as it can enhance our understanding of bio-
and nano-technology in explosive detection. It can also contribute to
socioeconomic development by providing a cost-effective solution for detecting
landmines globally, where there are currently an estimated 100 million landmines
in the ground, and mine action costs exceed $500 million annually. Therefore,
this innovative landmine biosensor system can potentially reduce the morbidity
and mortality caused by the buried landmines and promote socioeconomic
development in affected regions.
