Gardner ATM-9403036 This project continues development and operation of several
lidar systems that are being used to explore the composition and structure of
the middle atmosphere and includes the analysis of data collected with these
instruments during past experimental campaigns. In the ALOHA/ANLC-93 campaigns,
measurements were made from the NCAR Elektra aircraft in coordination with an
extensive array of ground-based instruments. Data from these campaigns will be
analyzed and a workshop will be conducted to discuss the results. The project
includes new campaigns using the Na Doppler/Temperature lidars at Urbana and at
the Air Force Starfire Optical Range in New Mexico to test the capabilities of
the 3.5 m telescope at that facility. These observations will be used to address
several fundamental questions related to gravity wave generation, propagation,
and dissipation in the atmosphere.
