The Chemistry Departments at the two schools (Carthage College and Concordia
University) reviewed their laboratory curricula and recognized a need for more
multiweek, project-based experiments. Such experiments better mirror real world
chemistry, foster critical thinking skills, and demonstrate how different
instrumental techniques and different areas of chemistry can be integrated to
solve a complex problem. The acquisition of a Bruker Avance 200-MHz FT-NMR
spectrometer with a quatro-nuclear (IH, 13C, l9F, 31p) probe and variable
temperature capabilities allows these goals to be achieved. With this
instrument, laboratory projects using high-field NMR can be incorporated into
eight upper-level courses. In addition, the spectrometer strengthens and
diversifies projects available to students interested in undergraduate research.
Semiannual poster sessions and meetings with colleagues at several other liberal
arts colleges in the area can be organized to evaluate educational objectives
and share results with other institutions. *
