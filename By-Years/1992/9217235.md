Variations in the rate of recruitment and growth of organisms affects the
relative abundance and dispersion of size classes within benthic prey
populations. These shifts may precipitate further changes in prey size structure
because benthic predators often seek or avoid certain prey sizes. Although size-
limited predation is widely recognized, little is known about size-dependant
feedback, in which changing prey population structure influences subsequent
structure through size dependant predation. Prior studies have suggested
hypothetical feedback mechanisms in the interaction between spiny lobsters,
Panulirus interruptus, and its prey, the intertidal mussel, Mytilus
californianus. The mechanisms are: (1) a positive numerical response of the
predators to densities of small mussels, and (2) changes in mussel recruitment
rates following the establishment of a canopy of larger adult mussels. Physical
gradients of tidal and wave exposure affect rates of mussel recruitment and
growth, and they also constrain predator foraging. Therefore, the relative
strengths of feedback mechanisms may change over the gradients. This project
involves a series of field surveys and experiments which will examine the
various feedback mechanisms.
