The existence of dissolved DNA in the marine environment has been well
documented. Recently, viruses have been shown to be an important biological
component of the dissolved fraction of seawater.It is not known what proportion
of the dissolved DNA is truly soluble DNA or DNA encapsulated within a virus
particle. Differentiation and quantitation of the soluble DNA and the intact
virions in the environment is important for both ecological and genetic reasons.
From the ecological perspective, soluble DNA is a form of nucleic acid
precursors for macromolecular biosynthesis. Viruses no doubt contribute to
dissolved DNA and organic carbon production and control the microbial population
by lysing their hosts. Dr. Paul will develop methods to separate and quantitate
viral particles from free DNA in the water column. This study will lead to
methodology for the rapid isolation of viruses for future study.
