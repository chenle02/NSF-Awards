The investigators will conduct ionospheric research using a new radar technique
called passive radar. The passive radar makes use of commercial FM radio
broadcasts as transmitters. Signals acquired by low-cost receivers are analyzed
to discriminate and recover echoes scattered in the ionosphere. The radar
requires no transmitter and no radio license, and is therefore a useful tool to
demonstrate radiowave observing techniques to students from high school through
graduate school. Existing receivers will be augmented by two receivers in Canada
to study E region irregularities at auroral latitudes. The research has four
primary goals: (1) to create a dedicated radar instrument that is sensitive to
1.5 meter irregularities in the auroral zone, (2) to use the instrument to study
the temporal and spatial evolution of auroral electrojet irregularities, (3) to
improve the capabilities of the passive radar technique, and (4) to provide a
rich educational and research experience for undergraduate and graduate
students. In addition to studying ionospheric irregularities in the auroral
zone, the passive radar will be able to observe the development of the
subauroral polarization stream that develops during large magnetic storms and is
a source of scintillation in communication signals. This novel radar technique
has attracted international attention because of its potential application to
aerospace and military systems. This award will provide for continued
development of the technique, along with training of the next generation of
radio engineers.
