WESTNET is one of several regional networks connecting geographical regions of
the United States to NSFNET, the national scientific network. It interconnects
13 campuses in the Rocky Mountain region: Arizona State University, Colorado
School of Mines, Colorado State University, New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology, New Mexico State University, University of Arizona, University of
Colorado (Boulder, Colorado Springs, and Denver campuses), University of Denver,
University of New Mexico, University of Wyoming, and Utah State University. The
network will use moderate speed lines (56,000 bits per second) except for those
connecting the University of Wyoming and Utah State University, which will use
duoplex lines (19.2 bits per second). The network will be upgraded to T1 speeds
(1.5 million bits per second) as the technology becomes available and the need
apparent. Significant cost sharing is provided by the states of Colorado and New
Mexico, with additional cost sharing to be obtained from the other states and
industry.
