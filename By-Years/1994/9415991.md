9415991 Lea This project will continue experimental culturing of planktic
foraminifera to determine the biogeochemistry of stable isotopes and trace
elements incorporated in the shell. This kind of data is widely used by people
who reconstruct past ocean circulation and chemistry from marine microfossils,
and yet many of the assumptions about the controls on shell chemistry have never
been tested. ***
