This is an RUI Research Instrumentation project. Funds are provided to purchase
equipment for research in computer vision. This equipment includes a color
camera, a projector, a framegrabber, a file server, and two workstations, along
with the necessary ethernet connections. Three specific projects will be
supported by this equipment: 1) analysis of 2-D striped images to obtain 3-D
information, 2) exploration of techniques to integrate information extracted
from multiple sources, and 3) combination of results from color analysis
techniques with model based texture analysis methods.
