Professor Huntley will work on several problems connected with automorphic
forms. In particular, he will study non-holomorphic cusp forms on higher rank
reductive groups. He hopes to prove an analogue of Weyl's law for such groups.
He will also study small eigenvalues and their relation to the Ramanujan
conjecture. Automorphic forms arose out of non-Euclidean geometry in the middle
of the nineteenth century. Both mathematicians and physicists have thus long
realized that many objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their
basic nature. This field is principally concerned with questions about the whole
numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its
historical roots and thus to problems in areas as diverse as gauge theory in
theoretical physics and coding theory in information theory.
