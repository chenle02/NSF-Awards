EIA-0103709&lt;br/&gt;I-Ling Yen&lt;br/&gt;University of Texas-
Dallas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's proposed to develop new innovative
approaches and techniques to advance the component-based development ( CDB) of
complex applications. The proposed effort in developing advanced CBD techniques
spans three dimensions: The research will enable such capabilities by enabling
ontology-based repository, code pattern based component composition and tool
suite for component comprehension and customization. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Technological advances, such as rapidly increasing computing power
and network bandwidth, are enabling advanced high-performance distributed
applications that can significantly enhance the quality of education, health
care, remote monitoring and control, early warning systems, scientific
collaborations, and other high-performance distributed applications.&lt;br/&gt;
