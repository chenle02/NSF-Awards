This is a request to support a Critical Zone Observatories (CZO) meeting on
October 1 - 2, 2013 at NSF Headquarters, Arlington, VA. The meeting will include
NSF staff as well as two representatives from each of ten NSF-funded Critical
Zone Observatories, 5 CZO Steering Committee members, and the CZO national
coordinator.

The meeting will highlight research results and plans from the existing and new
CZOs as a status report to NSF and as a starting point for discussions of
intensified collaboration within the new expanded CZO network. The primary goals
of the meeting are to identify and discuss research and education challenges in
Critical Zone science of common interest within the expanded network, to
vitalize collaborative activities, and to consider issues associated with common
measurements, data management, and observatory management plans. Ample time for
planning and interaction with the new CZOs is included.
