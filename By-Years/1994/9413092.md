9413092 Magrab The University of Maryland will introduce manufacturing education
across its undergraduate curriculum by folding its long-established
relationships with industry, its large manufacturing research program, and its
advanced research facilities into its undergraduate engineering programs. This
new curriculum will give every student the experience of working in product
development teams through industrially-sponsored multi-disciplinary design and
prototyping projects. Moreover, this curriculum will broaden the student's
perspective by teaching the manufacturing enterprise as the integration of
engineering, business, and management challenges. This new curriculum will link
course content directly to faculty research while creating a group of faculty
who can teach a wide variety of manufacturing subjects at any academic level.
