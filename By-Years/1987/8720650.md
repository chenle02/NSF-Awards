The study of the surfaces and interfaces of polymeric materials is extremely
important in determining structure-property relationships relevent to
technological applications in adhesion, coatings, biocompatibility, degradation,
and reactivity. In this proposal, surface-sensitive measurements of organic and
polymeric surfaces are described, based on sputtering induced by and scattering
of a primary low-energy noble-gas ion beam. Specifically, Langmuir-Blodgett (LB)
thin-film preparation techniques will be used to control structure, orientation,
and degree of polymerization of films. These will be utilized to study the ion-
formation processes which give rise to information about the chain length and
bonding of a polymeric chain. Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) methods
will be developed using the LB film as a model system for the polymer surface,
also SIMS will probe the interfacial chemistry of the films themselves. Low-
energy Ion Scattering (ISS) analysis of the orientation of ordered polymer
surfaces will be studied by combining results from molecular mechanics
calculations of average orientation and compared to experimental results under
low-damage conditions. Studies of the surface composition of block copolymers,
compatible blends, and surface-modified polymers will be accomplished by
combining electron microscopy, contact angle analysis, Electron Spectroscopy for
Chemical Analysis (angular dependent methods), ISS and Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy to get a complete description of the surface and dynamics
of the polymer interface.
