Population-based evidence is used when knowledge of how exposure to a product or
behavior causes harm is unavailable (e.g., the mechanism of action of many
therapeutic drugs is not precisely-understood), resulting in reliance on
epidemiological studies. This type of evidence is particularly relevant to mass
torts, wherein the use of a mass-marketed product (such as a drug) generates
harm in a fraction of users, resulting in a population whose experience may
allow inference of defendant liability. Holding all else equal, the PIs have
shown that reliance on population-based evidence results in a higher expected
joint payoff to the plaintiff's side, a higher settlement demand, and a larger
set of lawsuits (e.g., cases with lower damages) being filed, though not
necessarily a higher overall likelihood of trial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The
proposed research uses information economics and game theory to address two
important issues in law and economics. First, the PIs construct a dynamic model
of class-action formation, which accounts for the plaintiff's initial rational
optimism and subsequent waves of filings, as more plaintiffs observe the public
signal provided by previous filings. At the broadest level, a better theory of
the process of class-formation may ultimately identify ways to improve how the
legal system compensates victims and provides incentives for defendant
precaution in the mass-tort setting. Second, users of the product who are not
harmed will rationally have a downward-revised estimate of the fraction of users
harmed. Although these assessments are not relevant to filing suits (since they
were not harmed), users of mass-marketed products may appear as jurors in a
trial. The second project will model the behavior of a jury composed of non-
users and unharmed users hearing such a case, incorporating the litigation
strategies of the parties as they try to respond to the likely composition of
the jury.
