The Urban Institute has prepared a report which provides detailed guidelines to
school systems and businesses to aid them in the establishment of school-
business partnerships. The report is based on a study conducted by the Urban
Institute of twenty-four existing partnerships across the United States which
are serving to improve science and mathematics education. The project plan is to
disseminate the report to approximately one thousand (1000) schools and one
hundred (100) businesses. In addition, wide spread publicity on the availability
of the report is to be made within the corporate sector. There is to be no cost
sharing in this project.
