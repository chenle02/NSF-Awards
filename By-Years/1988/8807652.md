This research is to develop a conceptual framework, theoretical background, and
software prototype for temporal model of intelligent manufacturing systems. In
the development of a temporal model for intelligent manufacturing systems the
principal investigator will (1) demonstrate the soundness and utility of such an
approach or (2) explain the ways in which the approach is inadequate. Whichever
may be the outcome, the investigation will be of significant value in that it
will provide a reference point for future research in the area of intelligent
manufacturing systems.
