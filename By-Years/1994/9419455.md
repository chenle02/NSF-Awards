9419455 Reed It has long been recognized that the exact timing, location and
severity of local weather events are determined by what is termed by
meteorologist as mesoscale processes. The Principal Investigator's main
objective is to carry out numerical simulations of mesoscale weather systems in
order to identify key physical processes of three distinct mesoscale phenomena.
These three phenomena are polar lows (small vortices that form over polar seas
and in intense cases present a hazard to ship operations), mesoscale convective
systems, and fronts. In the polar low work, a wider range of synoptic situations
and geographic setting will be studied than heretofore with the aim of
understanding how different components of polar low formation interact under
different circumstances. The research on mesoscale convection will focus on how
model resolution and model representation of unresolved convection affect the
development of mesoscale convective systems, particularly in the early stages of
oceanic storms. The frontal work will be concerned mainly with diagnosing how
fronts form in the type of oceanic cyclone that does not form on a preexisting
front , but that creates its own fronts as it evolves. Research will be
primarily accomplished through numerical modeling studies conducted in
conjunction with scientists from the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
