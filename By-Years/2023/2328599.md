The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it aims
to restore the autonomy of patients with Parkinson's disease by improving their
physical well-being, easing the costs associated with caregiving, and preventing
the loss of employment. The current approach to treating medication-resistant
Parkinson's disease, called Deep Brain Stimulation, requires electrode
implantation inside the brain tissue that creates potential for surgical
complications like intracranial hemorrhage or stroke. The proposed project
provides a minimally-invasive way to stimulate the brain continuously. The
stimulation device is best suited for treating patients with Parkinson's disease
due to its continuously operable and portable nature. The technology may also
effectively treat disorders like essential tremor, epilepsy, and depression,
which are traditional candidates for deep brain stimulation surgery. This
methodology can open a new chapter in neuromodulation technologies by offering
benefits not shared by prior methodologies of electrical stimulation. This could
have a huge social impact as, according to the Parkinsonâ€™s Foundation, there are
10 million Parkinson's disease patients globally. Specifically, one million
patients in the US live with Parkinson's disease, and nearly 90,000 patients are
diagnosed with Parkinson's disease yearly. In the US, the healthcare costs
associated with Parkinson's disease are estimated to be $52 billion a year.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of brain stimulation implants
that use the superposition of two similar giga-hertz electromagnetic waves,
transmitted by endocranially implanted antenna arrays, for creating a low-
frequency envelop signal to stimulate deep brain targets in a highly focused,
and yet minimally invasive fashion. The stimulation is based on the following
key factors: i) GHz EM waves can be radiated very effectively using antennas, a
mature and cost-effective technology. Since the size of an antenna is inversely
proportional to the operating frequency, one can use very small antennas at GHz
frequencies. (ii) Multiple single antennas can be grouped together to create an
antenna array. The higher the number of antennas in an array, the narrower the
stimulating beams becomes, penetrating deeper into the brain tissue. (iii) Due
to the small wavelength of GHz EM waves, the stimulation offers twice the
degrees-of-freedom as prior brain stimulation technologies to achieve focal
brain stimulation. (iv) Additionally, one can stimulate multiple targets inside
the brain tissue without changing the location of the antenna arrays. This is
significantly more flexible than state-of-the-art invasive electrodes for brain
stimulation.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
