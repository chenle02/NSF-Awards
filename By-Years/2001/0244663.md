Szabo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Division of Mathematical Sciences Focused
Research Group &lt;br/&gt;(FRG) award made under solicitation &lt;br/&gt;http://
www.nsf.gov/pubs/2002/nsf02129/nsf02129.htm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holomorphic
curves recently have emerged&lt;br/&gt;as a powerful tool in low-dimensional
topology.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to unite and
coordinate&lt;br/&gt;research in the area of applications of
holomorphic&lt;br/&gt;curves in order to: &lt;br/&gt;- construct new invariants
of manifolds&lt;br/&gt; of dimension 3 and 4;&lt;br/&gt;- develop new methods
for proving diffeomorphism&lt;br/&gt; between the manifolds;&lt;br/&gt;- find
new relations between string theory and&lt;br/&gt; symplectic geometry on the
one side, and knot&lt;br/&gt; theory and topology of 3-manifolds on the
other.&lt;br/&gt;The core of this project, Embedded Symplectic&lt;br/&gt;Field
Theory, is expected to provide a unified approach&lt;br/&gt;to many seemingly
different problems in low-
dimensional&lt;br/&gt;topology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this project
is expected to be much broader&lt;br/&gt;than its immediate goal of developing
low-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;topology. There is a hope that the newly developed
methods&lt;br/&gt;open new horizons in our understanding of
links&lt;br/&gt;between Topology and Theoretical Physics, and in
particular&lt;br/&gt;String Theory. The project should also have a
significant&lt;br/&gt;educational value. In particular, under this project
there&lt;br/&gt;will be developed a Dissertation Subject Database,&lt;br/&gt;an
actively managed and supported list of problems which will&lt;br/&gt;serve as a
source of topics of PhD dissertation for graduate&lt;br/&gt;students of the
senior project personnel.&lt;br/&gt;
