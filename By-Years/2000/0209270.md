This award provide partial support for the 2002 Gordon Research Conference on
Laser Interactions with Materials to be held at Proctor Academy in Andover, New
Hampshire on July 21-26, 2002. The primary goal of the conference is to bring
together investigators from diverse disciplines studying a wide variety of
materials systems to share their approaches and progress in unraveling basic
mechanisms and applications that arise from laser/material interactions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this conference is to focus on current
state-of-the-art and necessary future directions for the field where
interactions between all participants is facilitated by several key
presentations by a leading scientist in the area. Topics of high current
interest include applications to life sciences and medicine; laser processing
applicable to nanotechnology, optoelectronics, and future electronics systems;
and applications of ultrafast lasers. The program will emphasize participation
of a diverse group of participants, including women, minorities, and young
investigators&lt;br/&gt;
