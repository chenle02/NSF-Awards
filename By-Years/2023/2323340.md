The 2023 Midwest Optimization Meeting will be organized and hosted by the
University of Michigan in fall 2023 to provide a regional opportunity for
graduate students and early career researchers in optimization to communicate
new findings and learn about new advances in the field. Optimization and control
theory are among the major branches of applied mathematics which have important
applications in science and engineering. This biennial conference will continue
the tradition of providing a both educational and exchange opportunities for
graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty to learn about the
most recent advances and trends in optimization and control theory and their
applications.

The main objectives of the 2023 Midwest Optimization Meeting are to communicate
recent advances and identify and develop trends in optimization, convex
analysis, variational analysis, and computational mathematics as well as in
applications such as machine learning and control domains. The meeting will
embrace both theory and diverse applications of the field, with an intention to
enrich graduate studentsâ€™ perceptions of active research areas and open problems
in optimization, as well as help to inform them of new future research
directions and collaborations. The conference is planned for two days with each
day of the meeting consisting of plenary and contributed talks, engaging both
leading experts as well as early career researchers. Details about the
conference can be found on the conference website:
