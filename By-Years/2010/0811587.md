Virtually every high-performance processor today has multiple processing units
(also known as cores) on a single chip. Such multicore hardware designs present
opportunities for significant performance gains, by processing multiple tasks
simultaneously, thus enabling novel compute-intensive applications. Executing
multiple tasks on a single chip requires data to be transported in and out of
the chip at a rate which often exceeds current hardware capability.
Consequently, realizing the performance potential of current multicore
processors requires novel solutions to the memory bottleneck problem. This
project investigates software solutions to alleviate the memory bottleneck. The
main idea is to use program transformation tools (also called compilers) to
restructure programs so that they can best utilize deep and complex memory
hierarchies, and to account for such hardware optimizations as prefetching and
shared caches.

This project investigates novel programming models and constructs for scalable
multicore processors, and compiler techniques to support such models and
constructs. It also aims to develop a runtime infrastructure for message passing
aggregates to support such models and constructs on clusters of multicore
processors. Software developments are augmented by analytical models that guide
application development and compiler optimizations. Software techniques and
theoretical models are validated for performance and scalability on platforms
ranging from multicore desktop machines to clusters of multicore processors.
