AST 0307250&lt;br/&gt;PI Evans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding star formation
is central to a deeper understanding of the formation of both galaxies and
planetary systems. Star formation occurs in dense cores of molecular gas and
dust that are probed by continuum emission from dust and molecular line emission
at infrared to radio wavelengths. Theoreticians have developed several models
for how stars form, including dynamical information. For tests of these models,
they must be converted into predictions of observables: the distribution of
emission over wavelength, angular extent of the core, and (for lines) material
velocities. This project will complete the framework of the modeling apparatus
that converts theory into observables, linking the physical details of the
models to simulate actual observations and making comparisons to extensive
observational data obtained with the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, and
other telescopes. The formation of isolated low-mass stars, of stars in
clustered environments, and massive stars will be studied. For massive stars,
the results will be used to provide a basis for understanding starburst
galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The research will be done in
close collaboration with undergraduate and graduate students, incorporation of
results into teaching and outreach, and enhancing participation of
underrepresented groups. At the present time, 3 graduate students and 2
undergraduate students are women. Graduate students present their work in
scientific meetings, and many have published results in the last several years.
Results from research are incorporated into classes taught by the PI, and the PI
often talks about the research effort in public settings. The PI will enhance
the pedagogical links on their star formation group web site.&lt;br/&gt;
