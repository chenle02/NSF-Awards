9420694 Persson The New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology's
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Energetic Materials is being
funded for one year under the "Self-Sufficient Partnership for Research"
Program. The Center continues to meet the renewal criteria of the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers Program. Additional funding is
provided for an evaluator to study the university/industry interaction occurring
in the Center. Funding is also provided for an undergraduate student to augment
the Center's ongoing research program with a study on "Small Scale Safety
Research." The Program Manager recommends New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology be awarded: $38,000 for one year (includes $8,000 for an evaluator);
and $5,000 for one year with funds provided by the Research for Experience
Undergraduates Program.
