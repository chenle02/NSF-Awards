The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is establishing the
Support for Under-Represented Groups in Engineering (SURGE) program within the
College of Engineering. The college leads the nation in total degrees conferred
and is recognized as a major international center of excellence in both
undergraduate and graduate education, offering an array of research
opportunities unmatched in scope and quality. A comprehensive package of
financial incentives and programmatic services and activities will be aimed at
recruiting persons from underrepresented groups into a PhD program and
supporting them to degree completion. SURGE will admit ten new participants each
year and provide support to each for five years. The SURGE pipeline will reach
steady-state capacity of 40 in the fifth year. SURGE will increase Black and
Hispanic enrollment in all doctoral programs by 300% and also increase the
number of women and persons with disabilities. In each participant's first year,
SURGE will provide a $15,000 stipend (with no requirement of service) and
payment of tuition and fees. In subsequent years SURGE will supplement the
teaching or research assistantships up to the $15,000 per year level.
