Adaptive learning refers to a process where agents learn about the value of
their actions from their direct experience with the actions. There is evidence
that variants of adaptive learning well describe subjects' behavior in
experiments. This project investigates decisions made by agents learning
adaptively from their own experience but also from indirect information about
actions they did not take. In particular, we investigate the effect that
distortions of such indirect information, which we interpret as representing
attitudes towards the source of information, have on the quality of the
decisions. We find that the pattern of behavior depends on whether the agent
inflates or deflates indirect payoff information relative to the objective
payoffs. If the agent inflates indirect payoff information, actions that have
not been played for a while tend to look better than they truly are, leading the
agent to revisit them every so often. As a result, behavior ``cycles'' through
more than one action. On the other hand, if the agent tends to deflate indirect
information, he will settle to playing a single action. Since the unplayed
alternatives are perceived to be worse than they objectively are, the limit
action, which the agent perceives to be the best, can be objectively suboptimal.
The former pattern resembles variety seeking while the latter resembles ``lock-
in'' behavior. Marketing research suggests that both patterns are observed in
consumer choice.&lt;br/&gt; The second key feature of the learning rule is the
degree to which past observations are discounted. In particular, whether the
weight put on last period's payoff becomes arbitrarily small or not. We provide
preliminary results on the role of discounting, suggesting the effect depends
crucially on whether indirect payoff information is utilized or not. While
discounting leads to suboptimal behavior in a stationary environment, we look
for justifications for it in decision situations which involve limited
