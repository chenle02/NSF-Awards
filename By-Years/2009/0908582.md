This award provides funding for a three year continuing award to support a
Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at West
Virginia University, entitled, "RET Site: Energy and the Environment", under the
direction of Dr. Darran R. Cairns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this RET in
Engineering site at West Virginia University (WVU) is to train and empower 30
middle and high school STEM teachers (10 per year for 3 years) from high-need
rural school districts in Appalachia (specifically West Virginia and
southwestern Pennsylvania) to inspire their students through project based
learning linked to energy research projects in collaboration with industry
partners from their community. Teachers will participate in a six-week summer
research program where they will be trained in project based learning, will
attend an International Summer Energy School (ISES) at the University of
Birminghamm, UK, and will perform socially relevant, individualized research on
energy conversion, environmental monitoring and maintenance.
