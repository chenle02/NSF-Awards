This conference is timely. A group of experts will take a careful look at the
effects of predicted climate change on diversity of organisms. There is
scientific concensus that the Earth is warming because of the "greenhouse
effect." While considerable effort has gone into projecting future climate
change, relatively little attention has been devoted to assessing potential
effects on wild plants and animals. Yet, initial studies have concluded that
biological effects could be profound, including large shifts in species ranges,
disruption of biological communities, and extinction of species. Conservation
responses to this problem will need a firm scientific understanding of how wild
species will respond to the warming and how these responses will interplay with
continuing human encroachment. The World Wildlife Fund will convene the first
major symposium to assess affects upon biodiversity. The conference will provide
a scientific overview of current understanding, catalyze discussion and
research, and educate both the scientific and policy communities. Climatologists
will present a range of climatic scenarios upon which life scientists will base
papers discussing possible physiological and ecological responses. The papers
will be presented in plenary session and will be published by an academic press.
