The purpose of this Research Planning Grant for Women Scientists and Engineers
is to perform a preliminary investigation of the possibility of developing a
procedure for materials characterization using ultrasonic attenuation methods.
In particular, this method will be explored to determine if it will be practical
for the examination of the grain of materials.
