The Department of Mathematics at the University of Kansas
will&lt;br/&gt;purchase advanced graphics workstations and a parallel
compute&lt;br/&gt;server which will be dedicated to the support of research in
the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for
several&lt;br/&gt;research projects, including in
particular:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Parallel eigenvalue computations. (Ralph
Byers)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Higher dimensional immersive visualization of
dynamical&lt;br/&gt; systems. (Estella Gavosto)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Adaptive
moving-mesh methods for numerical solution of&lt;br/&gt; evolutionary partial
differential equations and its&lt;br/&gt; applications. (Wiezhang
