Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are used in a variety of embedded
applications in communication, space, automotive, medical devices and industrial
control. Due to the safety-critical nature of many of these applications, the
trustworthiness of the underlying hardware platform is imperative. FPGA-based
embedded systems offer lower cost and reduced power consumption by aggressively
embracing newer deep sub-micron technology process, which brings lifetime
reliability concerns of the systems to the forefront. The impact of performance
degradation is more significant in new technologies, resulting in accelerated
aging and premature failures. Further, the reconfigurable nature of FPGAs and
the heterogeneous components embedded in a FPGA make the reliability degradation
and possible solutions to mitigate them different from those employed for
application specific integrated circuits and microprocessors. Consequently,
techniques to mitigate the impact of aging mechanisms are vital to ensure the
trustworthiness of reconfigurable embedded systems, and are the focus of this
research. The tools and techniques developed as part of this research will serve
as a foundation for designing life-time aware reliable embedded systems and for
catalyzing further research in this area. Due to the pervasiveness of embedded
systems, providing solutions to improve lifetime reliability is anticipated to
have a broad impact on the society. The project will involve both undergraduate
and graduate students in all aspects of this research. The PIs will actively
promote the projects to under-represented communities to improve student
diversity. In addition, the PIs will integrate the research results in existing
courses on VLSI design and reconfigurable systems.
