Stern OCE-9529261 The role that large scale eddies play in determining the
structure of, and entrainment in, oceanic jets like Western Boundary Currents
will be studied using analytical methods and simple numerical models. The
specific objectives of this research are: (1) to explain the behavior of
barotropic jets emerging from a source on the wall of a rotating laboratory
tank; (2) to understand the bifurcation dynamics of a wall jet normally incident
on a continental slope/shelf region; (3) to determine the increase in maximum
mean inshore shear of continental boundary currents like the Florida Current;
and (4) to extend the linear theory of a "self propagating" barotropic eddy in a
shear flow to the non-linear case.
