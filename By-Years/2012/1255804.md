Despite the best efforts of the semiconductor industry, integrated electronic
systems are not inherently robust because they are "born" (manufactured) with a
unique "personality" that stems from the industry's inability to precisely
fabricate their underlying circuits, and to write software that controls the
resulting uncertainty. An integrated system personality is further shaped by its
environment (e.g., temperature, noise, etc.) and usage (i.e., the frequency and
type of applications executed), and since both can fluctuate over time, so can
the system personality. Systems also "grow old" and degrade predictably due to
various wear-out mechanisms but also unexpectedly due to early-life failure
sources. These "nature and nurture" influences make it extremely difficult to
design a robust integrated system that will operate optimally for all possible
personalities. This research achieves integrated-system robustness by
judiciously testing and diagnosing the system for any faults through the
development of a generalized, scalable on-chip circuitry that tests and
diagnoses any system without significant power and performance penalty.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success of this research effort will help ensure that
integrated-system manufacturers can produce robust systems, in the most cost-
effective manner, despite the large number and variety of failure sources that
negatively impact system reliability. Also, our need for continued development
of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education in under-
represented groups will be aided by this effort via involvement of a diverse
group of graduate and undergraduate researchers.
