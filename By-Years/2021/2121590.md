The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a green manufacturing technology for titanium production. Special
metals, such as titanium and its alloys, have unique corrosion resistance, high
specific strength, and excellent bio-compatibility. These metals may be used in
the fabrication of high-performance parts for medical implants and other
applications such as deep sea mining and robotics. In addition, the proposed
room temperature process for titanium production may enable the development of
future alloys such as high entropy alloys, which are not suitable for the
current high temperature manufacturing process. Also, the proposed manufacturing
process may be applied to extract rare earth metals from their oxides,
satisfying critical needs in manufacturing electric motors for the US auto
industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development
of an electrochemical approach for titanium (Ti) parts manufacturing utilizing
low-cost pigments (TiO2) refined into value-added products (e.g., Ti
powders/wires) at room temperature. Though electrochemical approaches have been
exploited by others, the proposed technology is based on a unique liquid metal
alloy as the anode. The liquid metal alloy has a “catalytic” capability, capable
of accelerating titanium extractions from solid TiO2 without the need for
elevated temperatures. The resulting value-added products may be used as raw
materials in additive manufacturing to deliver Ti parts. This proposed room
temperature process potentially may save more than 50% of the energy costs
versus the traditional Ti refining process and may be easier to directly couple
with additive manufacturing. In addition, this technology may decrease the price
of Ti powder from &gt;$50 per pound to $4 per pound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
