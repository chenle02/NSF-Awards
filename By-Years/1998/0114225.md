This award supports a workshop will bring together leading scholars with
expertise on longitudinal studies in cultural and physical anthropology,
epidemiology, economics, sociology, public health, and psychology. During the
workshop they will highlight the importance and power of using longitudinal
research designs for studying questions of social and biological change;
identify areas of consensus and disagreement, develop practical guidelines that
cut across disciplines and qualitative or quantitative methods of doing
longitudinal studies; and identify how best to join qualitative and quantitative
methods in longitudinal studies. The workshop will also assess the feasibility
of designing a training workshop for graduate students of cultural and physical
anthropology and other disciplines to teach qualitative and quantitative
research methods for longitudinal research and techniques to analyze such
information. This workshop activity has the potential to make a significant
advance in the scientific capacity of cultural anthropology
