Although considerable progress has been made in understanding of the mechanics
of thin-skinned contractional belts, it has been difficult to rigorously test
theoretical models due mainly to the lack of adequate data, particularly from
tectonically active examples. This project will refine theoretical models of the
effects of basement obstructions on this thin-skinned tectonics and other issues
and test them using examples from the Salt Range, Sulaiman fold belt and the
Chaman fault of Pakistan. Results should result in more vigorously tested models
of the mechanics of fold-thrust belts.
