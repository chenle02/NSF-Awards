This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for 1996.
This fellowship supports research and training in the area of developmental
biology. The research and training plan addresses the sperm components required
for sperm-oocyte interactions in C. elegans, an important model system used
extensively in studies of normal development. The project uses several genes
that when mutated produce cytologically normal and motile sperm that cannot
fertilize oocytes even after contact. These mutations seem to disrupt either
sperm-oocyte recognition, adhesion, or fusion. Equivalent mutants have not been
described in any other metazoan. The approaches include genetic, cell
biological, and molecular biological ones to gain an understanding of these
genes and their mutant forms.
