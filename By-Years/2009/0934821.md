This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TEAM-Math (Transforming East Alabama
Mathematics) represents a partnership among Auburn University, fourteen school
districts in eastern Alabama (Alexander City, Auburn City, Barbara County,
Bullock County, Chambers County, Elmore County, Lanett City, Lee County, Macon
County, Opelika City, Phenix City, Russell County, Tallassee City, and
Tallapoosa County), and the non-profit East Alabama Council of Teachers of
Mathematics (EACTM). The partners are working together to develop and retain
twenty-two Master Teaching Fellows who will be elementary mathematics
specialists able to lead efforts to improve mathematics instruction in their
schools and districts. The Fellows are participating in courses and professional
development activities that are designed to meet the certification requirements
for an elementary master teacher specialist. Not only are the Fellows learning
about mathematics content and pedagogy, but they are also learning about teacher
leadership and are applying their leadership skills to projects in their high
needs school districts. The project is being rigorously assessed to determine
the impact of the program on the Fellows' content knowledge, instructional
practices, and attitudes about teaching and learning and ultimately the impact
of the program on the attitudes and achievement of the students they teach.
