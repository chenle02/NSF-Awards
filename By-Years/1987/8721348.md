Dr. Thomas Rossby at the Graduate School of Oceanography at the University of
Rhode Island will undertake a project to to purchase and evaluate a new
flextensional acoustic transducer for possible use as sound sources for RAFOS
navigation during the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). Neutrally
buoyant drifters are planned to be one of the major techniques for studying the
subsurface and deep ocean circulation during WOCE. Numerous RAFOS drifters will
be deployed and set to float at different depths. Their trajectories over
periods of up to two years can be determined by analysis of arrival times of
acoustic pulses emitted from fixed and precisely tuned transducers. Presently
available transducers work well in regional studies. WOCE objectives call for
basin-scale studies, so transducers having greater range are needed. The new
transducer design makes use of new flextensional technologies and materials.
Features of the new system include a very high sonic power level, high energy
conversion efficiency, high bandwidth, and manageable size. Once purchased, a
program of testing for long-term reliability and performance evaluation will be
undertaken. Reliability tests involve attaching the transducer to a mooring and
deploying it at 700 meters depth along the New England escarpment. Signals will
be received and analyzed at an established listening station at Bermuda and the
timing of transmissions will be set to support an ongoing long-term research
project. After six to twelve months of deployment, the transducer will be
recovered and examined for physical integrity and wear. Range tests will be
conducted by lowering the transducer package at different depths from 2800 to
4300 km away from a receiving site. Measurements of radiated pressure levels
will be made at each depth to understand the transducer's performance at
increasing hydrostatic pressures. Transmitted signals at the varying distances
will also be received and analyzed at the Bermuda listening station.
