9523327 Parker The Colorado School of Mines and Public Service Company of
Colorado propose to develop a passive emission sensor which can accurately
quantify nitric oxide concentrations and gas temperature in power plant exhaust
flows and demonstrate it's utility as a feedback sensor in an NO control system.
The technology developed for the NO sensor will also be used to produce a sensor
for ammonia. Using an upstream monitor for NO concentration coupled with a
downstream monitor for ammonia, a feedback control system for Thermal DeNOx will
be demonstrated in the laboratory. In addition, we will work toward
implementation and validation of both sensors in a full scale powerplant. The
overall measurement system will be non-extractive and will provide accurate and
reproducible measurements of both transient and steady-state NO concentrations.
In addition, the system concept is simple and robust; instruments that are
suitable for use in the field, and do not require frequent calibration or highly
trained operators will be the end result of this research project. The
measurement technique is based on spectrally resolved emission from nitric oxide
and water at wavelengths near 5.2 microns. Emission from nitric oxide will be
used to quantify NO concentration and water emission will be used to determine
the temperature of the flow. A scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer will be used
within the device for wavelength selection; this device can, in principle,
operate over a large range of wavelengths and can be adapted to become a field
hardened instrument. Investigation on application of the proposed sensor system
principle for measuring other pollutant will be carried out in this study. ***
