Replication and reproducibility are critically important tenets of the
scientific process. Yet, many fields including education research struggle to
regularly support and publish results from replication studies. Although
important strides have been made to ensure that more scientific data is
available, substantive challenges remain with respect to making data from
important publications widely available in a timely manner.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference proposal will bring together journal
editors and early career researchers in education research to discuss issues
related to open science including, replication, reproducibility, and data
sharing related to the publication process. This 2-3 day conference that will
help to develop a fuller understanding of the principles and purposes of
journals in the data sharing process, consider the role of journals in
publishing replication research, broaden knowledge about the mechanisms for
sharing data and cultivating replication research, and provide early career
scholars with opportunities to play a critical role in replicating and
reproducing research findings via open access to data.
