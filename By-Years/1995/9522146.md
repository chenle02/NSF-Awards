9522146 Meyer Abstract Interface '95 is a conference which will bring together
researchers and practioners in statistics and computing science, to discuss the
theme of ``Statistics and Manufacturing,'' with a sub-theme of green
manufacturing, the environment, and quantitative environmental science. Many of
today's environmental concerns are a consequence of past manufacturing decisions
--decisions that were often made with statistical insight. It is surely fair to
suggest that in order to mitigate tomorrow's environmental problems we must
begin by understanding today's manufacturing processes. Here the combination of
statistics, computing science, manufacturing, and the environment becomes
particularly compelling. The Interface conference provides a unique opportunity
for professionals in statistics, computing science, and various application
areas to interact on issues at the interface of these disciplines. The Symposium
fills a critical gap between the activities of our large professional societies.
The 1995 Symposium on the Interface of Computing Science and Statistics will be
held June 21-24, 1995 at the Vista Hotel in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania.
