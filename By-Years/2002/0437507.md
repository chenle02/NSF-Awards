The goal of this project is to employ microemulsion-based protein extraction
(MPE) systems for the rapid, selective, and scalable recovery and purification
of proteins. The research plan consists of first investigating the physical
chemistry and hydrolysis kinetics of the mixed surfactant systems, to determine
difference between this mixed surfactant system with comparable ionic/nonionic
mixed systems, and to identify operating conditions for MPE. In addition, the
mixed surfactant system will be applied to the MPE of single- and multiple
protein systems, the latter systems related to the fractionation of blood plasma
proteins. The success of MPE will be evaluated based on productivity (i.e.,
speed and protein capacity), selectivity, applicability to a wide-range of
operating conditions and protein purification challenges, and non-inactivation
of protein products. Furthermore, pH-degradable ionic and bioaffinity water-in-
oil microemulsions forming surfactants will be synthesized and employed.
