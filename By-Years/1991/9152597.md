Instrumentation (UV spectrophotometer, densitomer analysis system, DNA
sequencing unit, photo-documentation system, water purification apparatus, -70oC
freezer, analytical balance, autoclave, and Macintosh computers) will support a
new undergraduate research core requirement for students pursuing the B.S.
degree in biology. The equipment will substantially upgrade and modernize a
student research laboratory in molecular genetics. Students will gain experience
in computer- assisted data analysis and learn research techniques in the
construction of operon fusions with bacterial genes, and methods for
characterizing the regulation of the gene as well as its gene product. The
Research Core will consist of a series of three courses (Intro. to Biological
Research, Research Techniques, and Independent Research) with emphasis in the
scientific method, literature search and review, experimental design,
statistical data analysis (emphasis on using computer software packages),
writing grant proposals, seminar preparation and deliver. Students will design
and carry out an independent research project in molecular genetics under the
guidance of a faculty research mentor.
