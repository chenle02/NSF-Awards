Abstract for DMS - 0132514

In the past the investigator developed techniques to study Gromov hyperbolic
groups. There are several applications of those techniques in topology,
geometry, algebra, analysis. In particular, hyperbolic groups were characterized
by bounded cohomology, extending results my M. Gromov. This characterization was
used by A. Connes and H. Moscovici for a proof of the Novikov conjecture for
hyperbolic groups. S. Gersten provided several descriptions of hyperbolicity in
terms of various (co)homology theories, and later the investigator made
contributions in that direction. Recently, Guoliang Yu and the investigator were
able to prove the Baum-Connes conjecture for hyperbolic groups and their
subgroups. The techniques will be further developed to address these and other
directions. For example, (co)homological descriptions of relative hyperbolicity
will be studied. As another application, the conformal and other geometric
structures on hyperbolic groups will be constructed. It is the investigator's
hope that this will lead, in particular, to a better understanding of open
conjectures in 3-dimensional topology.

It is an important and interesting task to investigate shapes of spaces, in
particular of the one in which we live. Geometry studies spaces of various
shapes. Group theory studies groups, that is, sets of symmetries of spaces.
Geometric group theory provides links between spaces and groups. Every group has
an orbit (!) in some space (!). The orbit is only a part of the space, but once
something is known about the the group, geometric group theory provides
information not only about the orbit, but about the whole space as well. Tools
from several areas of mathematics are used for that. The research part of this
proposal is to develop and use those tools. Another part of the proposal is
organizing and supporting the G^3 = "Geometric group theory on the gulf coast
conference" that would allow exchange of ideas among mathematicians of various
research interests.
