This proposal calls for the study of, "Microwave/Optical Spectroscopy of Helium
and H2 Rydberg States". The focus is the study of high Rydberg states in these
two electron systems under conditions which allow virtually complete spatial
separation of the electrons. The circumstances provides an opportunity for
extremely precise calculations of the structure of such states, incorporating
relativistic and radiative corrections without uncertainty in the non-
relativistic structure. It becomes a testing ground for fundamental atomic
theory, especially as specialized to few electron systems. The Rydberg states
are produced by neutralizing an accelerated ion beam. The high-L Rydberg states
are detected using a CO2 laser and Stark ionization. High precision spectroscopy
is carried out using microwave methods to look at transitions between states of
the same n.
