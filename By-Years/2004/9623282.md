9623282 Alperin This grant supports the research of Professor R. Alperin to work
on problems in the representation of finite groups on various geometric objects.
In particular he wants to work on groups acting on trees, buildings and their
generalizations. He hopes to use various fixed point properties as an aid in
classifying certain groups with various homological or geometrical realizations.
This is research in the field of group theory. Group theory can be thought of as
the study of symmetry in the abstract. As such, this area has direct
applications to many areas of physics and chemistry. Moreover, within the last
30 years, many connections to problems in data transmission have been solved
using techniques from group theory. There are also direct connections to the
error correcting codes that are vital for modern computing such as working with
CD-ROM's.
