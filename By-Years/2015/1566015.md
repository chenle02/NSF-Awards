Software now dominates almost every aspect of our life: from wrist watches to
the stock markets, and from thermostats to surgeons. And this proliferation is
unlikely to slow down any time soon; in fact, it appears that we are merely
witnessing the very beginning of the software revolution. Society is ever more
reliant on highly complex and interconnected software systems, and this has made
software safety, security, and privacy a first-class societal concern.

To formally and mathematically reason about complex software systems, automated
verification and program analysis techniques have proven powerful over the past
decade, thanks to a plethora of advances in the area. However, most non-trivial
programs and correctness properties of interest remain out of reach for
automated verification techniques. The project investigates new automated
software verification techniques and tools, that are more efficient and
applicable to a wider range of programs and properties. Specifically, the
project develops novel techniques for computing Craig interpolants, which are
logical means for synthesizing proofs of correctness. The emphasis is on
exploring the question of computing optimal interpolants---the simplest possible
ones. The work is motivated by the observation that simpler interpolants are
more likely to generalize to a proof of correctness. The goal of the project is
to develop an algorithmic foundation for efficient verification of complex
programs and correctness properties, thus expanding the applicability of formal
verification techniques.
