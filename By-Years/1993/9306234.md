This award supports travel expenses for US participation in a workshop in China
for planning a US-China cooperative land surface - atmosphere interaction
experiment to be held in 1996. The workshop will concentrate on finalizing the
scientific plan for a study of the grassland ecosystem found in Inner Mongolia,
with emphasis on understanding the physical interactions and feedback processes
between the land surface, the vegetation canopy, the cloud field and the
atmosphere. The study site is representative of the arid and semiarid temperate
grassland zone that is of major importance to global climate. This project is
supported under the US-China Cooperative Research Program.
