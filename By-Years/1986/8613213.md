The purpose of this research is the development of semi-conductor coherent
sources for lightwave applications. While the semi-conductor laser has achieved
prevalence as a suitable source, new materials developments are occurring
rapidly and are influencing such lasers. One such crystalline material is the
so-called doping superlattice. This involves the generation of a periodic
crystal lattice superimposed upon the underlying crystal lattice, the
"superlattice" being obtained by preferential doping. This particular technique
allows design of the coupling between the optical beam and the crystal as well
as a certain degree of tunability of the frequency.
