The objective of this theoretical research on growth kinetics is to extend our
understanding of the generic features associated with the growth of large
ordered structures after a deep temperature quench from a disordered state. In
this growth process, patterns evolve which can be characterized by certain
universal features. Previous models showed how one could understand these
universal features for simple models applicable to magnets and alloys. New work
will be done to understand more realistic and complex unstable systems. %%% The
evolution of a disordered system to an ordered state due to a rapid drop in
temperature is a complex problem which is common to many condensed matter and
materials systems including phase separation in polymers and spinodal
decomposition in alloys. This research will develop new analytic models for
growth kinetics which will be checked against numerical simulations and
experiment.
