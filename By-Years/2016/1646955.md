Many digital information networks such as the Web and the Internet operate in a
rather decentralized manner with little global control. Searching in these
networks is a great challenge because data are increasingly large and
distributed. The proposed research envisions a fully decentralized architecture
in which individual systems (agents) can communicate and work together to assist
people in finding relevant information from growing distributed sources. The
proposed search model will utilize collective intelligence of software agents in
large networks in order to help individuals find access to information of an
unmatched magnitude. The outcome of the research will revolutionize the way in
which large-scale search engines operate and significantly improve the coverage
of the world's information that can be discovered by ordinary
people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decentralization is the nature of many naturally,
socially, and technologically grown structures that scale. The research aims to
address the problem of finding relevant information in large-scale agent
networks with distributed contents. The project will study decentralized search
methods in growing agent networks and focus on their capacity to scale up (out).
The primary goal is to understand how a very large number of search agents (many
of which have limited computing capacity) can interconnect and collaborate to
enable efficient query routing and information discovery. The research team will
experiment with very large agent networks (of at least a million agents) and
study how information indexing and searching can function efficiently in a fully
decentralized manner. The plan is to examine the influences of important factors
such as semantic network overlay (inter-connectivity) and distributed neighbor
sampling (learning) on search efficiency and adaptation. The project will also
investigate the capacity of the distributed agent architecture for greater
search coverage as well as better freshness and timeliness in the search
results.
