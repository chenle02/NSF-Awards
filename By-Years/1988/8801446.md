This project is to study wave propagation in excitable media with special
emphasis on two specific systems, namely, the cardiac conduction system, and the
Belousov Zhabotinsky reaction. Work on the cardiac conduction will include an
investigation of two models for the onset of fibrillation, one based on the
anisotropic coupling of cardiac cells, and the other based on disparity of
recovery of cardiac cells. The investigation will also explore the effect of
discreteness on propagation, and the effect of inhomogeneity on the synchrony of
excitable cells. The investigation of Belousov Zhabotinsky reaction will center
on the dynamics of spiral and scroll waves. Finally, the investigation will
include the study of other phenomena in excitable media such as standing waves
and breathers, and their relationship with traveling waves.
