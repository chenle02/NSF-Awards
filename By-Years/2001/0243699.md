This proposal from a University of Rochester group requests support to continue
their studies within the CLEO collaboration working at the Cornell Electron
Storage Rings (CESR) facility.&lt;br/&gt;The group plans to improve the
measurements of the photon energy spectrum in b -&gt; sg, to study the exclusive
and inclusive b-&gt; ulv decays and to study leptonic and semi-leptonic charm
decays. These activities will lead to improved knowledge of the Cabibbo-
Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements |Vub| and |Vcb| first directly and later
indirectly by supplying information that aids in the interpretation of
measurements at the B-factories, BaBar and Belle. It will also lead to improved
knowledge of |Vcs| and |Vcd|, allowing precise tests of the unitarity of the CKM
matrix.&lt;br/&gt;
