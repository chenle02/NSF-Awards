A new technique for computing a few interior eigenvalues of a large matrix is
proposd. It is assumed that the size and structure of the matrix make
factorization impractical. The new technique is related to the Rayleigh-Ritz, it
finds interior eigenvalues in an optimal way. The technique can be applied to
the Lanczos algorithm for symmetric matrices and to the Davidson and GD methods
for both symmetric and nonsymmetric matrices. While the cost per iteration
increases, the number of iterations needed decreases. The new methods can be a
great improvement. The methods must be tested and the proper implementations
developed. It must be determined for what types of problems the new methods are
better than current methods.
