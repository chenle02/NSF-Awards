This award will partially support a conference focused on Electron Backscatter
Diffraction (EBSD) planned for June 19-21, 2012, at Carnegie Mellon University,
under the sponsorship of the Microanalysis Society (MAS). EBSD is an important
technique that utilizes the diffraction of high-energy electrons to determine
the orientations of crystals in natural and synthetic materials. This approach
has major applications in both material science and geology related to
understanding everything from crystallization processes to microstructures that
record material histories and affect material properties (such as strength and
conductivity).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The previous two meetings of this type were
held in the U.S. and occurred in May 2008&lt;br/&gt;and May 2010 at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison. Both were extremely successful, where
participation grew from ~100 to ~130. It brought together 25-36 students, 65-90
professionals, and 7-12 vendors to exchange information and experiences
involving the EBSD technique. We will repeat the format with some modifications
for EBSD 2012. The first day is an all-day tutorial aimed at beginners (students
and others) who wish to get up to speed with this technique. In the afternoon,
there will be more advanced tutorials for more experienced users. Throughout the
session, attendees will have the opportunity to see live EBSD demonstrations by
all four major EBSD vendors on CMU instruments. The next two days will consist
of invited and contributed talks spanning various material science and
geosciences topics: materials processing, nuclear materials for energy, high
temperature/tectonics, strain, 3D reconstructions and high performance ceramics.
These talks and a planned poster session will allow significant participant
interaction. Students will particularly benefit from these interactions while
also having the opportunity to present their research via oral or poster
presentations.
