NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0072439&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences: Modeling and
Optimal Design of Photonic
Structures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0072439
Dobson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the investigation
and development of new computational methods and analytical techniques for the
modeling and optimal design of photonic crystals and related structures. The
objectives of the project are to extend methods developed for two-dimensional
photonic crystals to the case of three-dimensional structures, to develop
methods for the optimization of defect modes in photonic band gap structures,
and to model and analyze the effects of dispersive media on wave propagation in
periodic structures and study associated optimal design problems. The final
objective is to model truncated photonic crystals in planar geometries and
develop methods to optimize the scattering and resonance properties of such
structures. &lt;br/&gt;The structures studied in this project are periodic
arrangements of optical materials, designed to exhibit useful properties with
respect to electromagnetic wave propagation. Making use of such structures is a
fundamental technology, expected to have a significant impact in applications
including lasers, sensors, optical storage, optical communications, and high-
density optical interconnects. This project aims to develop modeling and design
capabilities, which will improve understanding of the properties of these
structures and facilitate their incorporation into useful
devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
