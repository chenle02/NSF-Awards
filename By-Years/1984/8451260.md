Research will be conducted in the area of very large scale integrated (VLSI)
circuits. High speed analog systems using metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) and
gallium arsenide (GaAs) technology will be implemented as well as projects in
the digital processing of speech and the computer-aided design of integrated
circuits. Emphasis is placed in the area of digital processing of speech where
an inexpensive system will be investigated that permits recognition of human
speech in real time by computer.
