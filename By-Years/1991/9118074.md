The primary objective of this research is to study normal variation in human
ovarian function. This will be undertaken through the measurement of steroid
hormones in healthy women living in the Cambridge Massachusetts area over a time
course. The primary, longitudinal data will consist of progesterone and
estradiol levels, determined from salivary samples, for each female over an
extended time course. A variety of steroid profiles are expected to emerge and
hazards-model analysis will be used to relate these to various life events. This
research will make it possible to assess the impact of normal variability in
ovarian function on female fecundity and increase our understanding of human
reproductive ecology.
