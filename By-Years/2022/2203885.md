This project will investigate hyperbolic manifolds of finite-volume by
understanding the structure of their embedded sub-manifolds. The research
combines aspects from multiple fields, including geometric topology, number
theory, algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and dynamics. The project will also
include participation in activities including mentoring and supporting students
and early career mathematicians, participating in public lectures and outreach
activities, and organizing events and workshops. This project includes specific
research plans for undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The research goals of this project are divided into three main
directions. The first project is to continue working in effective virtual
properties of 3-manifolds by constructing explicit covers. This project will
focus on congruence covers of arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifolds, where the PI
will leverage the rich connection between their geometric and number theoretical
properties. The second project is to study codimension-1 embedded sub-manifolds
in higher dimensional hyperbolic manifolds. A particular focus of this project
is the case of hyperbolic manifolds of dimension 4, to better understand the
relationship between the geometry of hyperbolic 4-manifolds and other well-
studied 4-manifold invariants. The third project involves the study of embedded
surfaces in 3-manifolds and simple closed curves in surfaces through the
representations of their fundamental groups. The project also includes broader
impact activities aimed at broadening participation among students and junior
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
