The principal investigator will study questions related to so-called nonlinear
"functional differential equations" and, separately, to questions concerning
iterates of maps which do not increase distance in some metric. Roughly
speaking, a functional differential equation is one in which the rate of change
of an unknown function x(t) depends not just on the value of x(t) itself but on
the value of x at certain earlier times. Such equations arise naturally in
models from physiology and nonlinear optics. Mappings which do not increase
distance with respect to a norm on a finite dimensional vector space come up in
many contexts, e.g., scheduling problems (the so-called "sup norm") and
nonlinear generalizations of the theory of column-stochastic matrices (the so-
called "ell-one norm").

The principal investigator will study questions concerning certain classes of
nonlinear functional differential equations. An example of interest is the the
equation ax'(t)=f(x(t),x(t-r)), r:=r(x(t)), where f and r are given functions
and one is interested in the limiting "shape" of periodic solutions of such
equations as a approaches zero. In a different direction the principal
investigator will study iterates of maps which are "nonexpansive", i.e., do not
increase distance with respect to a given metric. If the metric is the ell-one
norm on a finite dimensional vector space, one is led to a variety of
generalizations of the classical theory of column stochastic matrices. The case
that the metric comes from the sup norm arises in many applications and has led
to intriguing and apparently difficult conjectures concerning the maximal
cardinality of a periodic orbit for a map which is nonexpansive in the sup norm
on a finite dimensional vector space.
