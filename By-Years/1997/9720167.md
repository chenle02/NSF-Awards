It is important for scientific investigators, engineers, and developers to be
able to interact with their high performance applications running on parallel or
distributed machines. This project will explore technologies to enable the
flexible and interactive use of computational instruments, including on-line
monitoring, analysis, steering, and experimentation. In addition it will permit
users to exploit the new functionalities enabled by future integrated computing,
networking, and user interface platforms, which include 'looking over a
colleague's shoulder' from a remote location, sharing the outputs of
computational instruments among multiple users or instruments, working
concurrently on the same problem using high quality visualization techniques or
immersive environments, or jointly operating a single shared computational tool,
or even temporarily working on alternative or complementary tasks which are then
reintegrated with ongoing experiments or processes.
