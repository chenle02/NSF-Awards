State to state dynamics of the interaction of small molecular ions with well
characterized solid surfaces is the subject of this research project. Professor
Jacobs' work at the University of Notre Dame, supported by the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry Program, uses state specific methods to prepare a beam of ions
in a particular quantum state. This ion is then scattered from a solid surface
prepared and characterized in ultra high vacuum, and the scattered ion identity,
velocity, and energetics are determined. The results of these detailed
measurements are compared with wave packet calculations to enable the
interpretation of the scattering process. The specific systems investigated
include N2+ and CO+ scattering from Pt(111), HBr+ scattering from Si(100), and
C2H2+ interacting with various metallic surfaces. The results of this work
provide important basic information for the mechanisms of ion etching and
surface induced dissociation of organic ions for mass spectrometric
characterization. A detailed mechanistic understanding of ion surface
interactions is vital to several technologically important fields, such as
reactive ion etching of semiconductors, satellite dynamics in low earth orbit,
and surface induced dissociation mass spectrometry. The work of this project is
designed to provide this detailed mechanistic understanding, using the
sophisticated methods of state preparation and surface scattering.
