The department is enhancing areas of developmental, cell and molecular biology
through the purchase of a fluorescence microscope. A major application of the
microscope is localization of proteins within cells using fluorescently labeled
antibodies. This will enhance the learning of concepts of differential gene
expression. The immunofluorescent localization of proteins in embryos, using
specific antibodies, demonstrates the temporal and spatial specificities of gene
expression. A second concept, of specificity of subcellular localization of
proteins within cells, can also be demonstrated, since the fluorescence
microscope allows the localization of different proteins in specific sites
within the cell in a dramatic and visual way. The university will contribute an
amount equal to the award.
