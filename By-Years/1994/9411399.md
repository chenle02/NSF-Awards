9411399 Mandrekar The objective of the Congress is to recall the legacy of
Norbert Wiener and record its continuation in ongoing research. The legacy
comprises first the idealization of Einstein's theory of Brownian motion.
Wiener's work in this context constitutes the foundation of the stochastic
integration, stochastic differential equations, and integration on infinite-
dimensional spaces.. These three major fields in probability have significant
applications to engineering, control theory, finance, and quantum physics. The
legacy also includes Wiener's work on generalized harmonic analysis, which has
had numerous ramifications, the most recent being the theory of wavelets, which
in turn is being used in the statistical application for the storage of data. In
addition, the legacy comprises the notions of capacity and generalized solution
of the Dirichlet problem, which in the 1990's has received a beautiful extension
to nonlinear PDE's of order p &gt; 1. Probabilistic ideas of Norbert Wiener have
led to the solu ions of fundamental problems of Potential Theory and Harmonic
Analysis. These areas are being actively pursued today and the Congress will
strive to inspire young probabilists and analysts to continue Wiener's work in
his innovative way.
