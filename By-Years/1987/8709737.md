Vertebrate paleontology has attracted the attention of the general public for
decades. In the first decade of this century, the infamous "Piltdown Man" was
discovered in a field in Britain but was shown to be a chimera in l953. More
reputable discoveries include the famous Peking Man, lost during the Japanese
invasion of China, and "Lucy," 2.8 million-year-old skeletal remains where over
half the individual was recovered, found in Hadar, Ethiopia, by Donald Johanson
under an NSF grant in the 1970's. The public is less familiar with vertebrate
paleontology as a serious interdisciplinary science. The emergence of vertebrate
paleontology as a well defined, well organized field of scientific inquiry in
the period from 1850 to 1930 involves a delineation not only of who practiced it
and what that practice entailed, but also importantly the different
institutional settings that gave American paleontology its form and structure.
Essential to Dr. Rainger's inquiry is the consideration of the half dozen or so
most important centers where scientists, collectors and preparators pursued
research, learned methods and techniques for work in the laboratory and the
field, and laid the foundations for scientific careers. Specifically, Dr.
Rainger will examine archival materials under this grant in order to obtain new
information and insights into the research of prominent individuals and the
context within which they worked. These are housed in the U.S. Geological
Survey, the Smithsonian Institution, the National Archives, the Library of
Congress, and the U.S. National Museum. The history of science will be enriched
by this examination yielding information on the ways in which institutions
provided financial support for, developed an infrastructure of facilities and
staff for, and promoted work in the science of vertebrate paleontology.
