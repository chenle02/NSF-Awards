Recent disasters in the chemical processing industries have made the public,
government agencies, and the press acutely aware of something safety
professionals have long known: there is a potential for large- scale loss of
life, property destruction, and environmental damage from uncontrolled releases
of toxic or flammable materials. This project is increasing the level of safety,
health and loss prevention awareness in the undergraduate curriculum through
three mechanisms: (1) developing instructional units that are short, stand alone
and can be integrated into current curricula as a part of regular course study,
(2) developing instructional modules that integrate an entire subset of safety,
health and loss prevention principals into a coherent package, and (3) offering
short courses and seminars for training faculty and bringing the materials to
the attention of educators. The materials being developed are being reviewed by
the Undergraduate Curriculum Development Committee of the American Institute of
Chemical Engineers' Center for Chemical Process safety. The grantee institution
is contributing significant funds to this award.
