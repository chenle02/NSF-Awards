9350949 Robert Badger This project is using a petrographic microscope with 35mm
and video camera, an in-lab computer work station and some computer software as
part of a project that is integrating two upper- level geology courses,
Structural Geology and Petrology. The project is developing field-oriented
student research that encompasses and synthesizes elements of both disciplines.
The project involves an investigation of a well-exposed mylonite zone located
approximately 10 miles from campus. Students first are studying it as part of a
petrology project; the following semester they are continuing their research on
the mylonite zone as part of a class project in structural geology,
incorporating their data from the petrology class. Critical to this project is
the ability of the students to work cooperatively. Groups are working on
different parts of the mylonite zone, so they are sharing their data and are
working together to formulate ideas and working models. ***
