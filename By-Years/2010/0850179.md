The primary goal of the S-STEM Nurture Project at the School of Science and
Technology of Universidad Metropolitana in San Juan, Puerto Rico is to support
twenty (20) academically talented, financially needy students enrolled in any of
its Bachelor of Science programs thereby enabling them to enter the workforce or
pursue graduate studies. In addition to scholarships, the project provides
enrichment activities that address the challenges these students face in both
academic and personal areas, including six (6) seminars a year on financial
management, study skills, graduate school, and career fairs, among others.

The expected outcomes are an increase in the number of Hispanic STEM graduates;
a comprehensive assessment plan that allows for the establishment of a well-
suited scholarship program; improved student support services and an increase in
graduation rates from 40% to 60% for the scholarship recipients.

Through involvement in this project, science faculty members broaden their
understanding of student needs and can transform the curricula. The assessment
conducted prepares the project leadership, the institutional leaders, as well as
other scientists and educators to revise their STEM programs to provide a higher
educational level. This translates into a science workforce of free-thinking
individuals capable of becoming leaders in their fields and creates a cadre of
well educated and skilled Hispanic scientists.
