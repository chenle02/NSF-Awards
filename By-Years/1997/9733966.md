Proposal Number: ECS-9733966 Principle Investigator: Michael Santos Title:
CAREER: Electronic Device Applications for InSb-Based Heterostructures. Abstract
The proposed work is related to the development of three devices that exploit
the high intrinsic mobility attribute of AlInSb and InSb heterostructures and
quantum wells. The devices under investigation include magnetic field sensors,
field-effect transistors with high-speed and low power dissipation, and spin-
polarized FETs. The educational component of the proposed work is related to the
PIs involvement in an Engineering Physics students program and to the support of
a number of senior projects in the area of device fabrication and
characterization. It is believed that if successful, the PI will make a
significant contribution in the area of advanced materials and device research.
His partnership with GM was also noted and his strong commitment to educational
activities was appreciated. This is a well written proposal and presents a well
designed research and educational program. High risk areas were addressed with
innovative possible solutions and to this end it is felt that this proposal is
worthy of funding. Based on the written evaluations and the panel discussion,
this proposal is recommended for a CAREER award at $200,000 for 48 months. The
PI has submitted a revised budget without substantial change in the scope of the
work. February 20, 1998
