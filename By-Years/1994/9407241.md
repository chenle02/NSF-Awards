The objective of this research is to experimentally investigate the effects of
temporal variation in resource supply on the outcome and dynamics of competition
between consumers. The proposed research would use planktonic rotifers (small,
multicellular zooplankton) as model systems. Experiments would test the
predictions that temporal variation in resource supply changes competitive
outcome, slows the rate of competition exclusion, and allows competing species
to coexist. These experiments would go beyond existing experimental studies by
combining the following aspects: (1) using multicellular organisms instead of
microbes, (2) using a temporal pattern of resource supply that is more realistic
than that used in previous experiments, (3) measuring the effect of temporal
variation in resource supply on the threshold resource concentration for
positive population growth, and (4) predicting changes in competitive outcome,
dynamics, and species diversity at different scales of temporal variation. %%%
The question of the maintenance of species diversity in natural systems has
intrigued ecologists throughout this century. Many theories have been proposed,
but few are tested or testable. The notion that resources and resource
competition controls community structure is compelling, but nature is highly
variable. This is the first study to adequately test the role of resource
variation in maintaining species diversity in communities. The results of this
work will have important implications for understanding mechanisms controlling
biodiversity in aquatic and terrestrial systems.
