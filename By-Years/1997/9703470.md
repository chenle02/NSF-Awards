CDA-9703470 Huttenlocher, Daniel Cornell University A Next Generation Computing
and Communication Substrate This award is to support researchers at Cornell to
develop technologies for a new computing and communications substrate that
provides "access to anything, anytime, anywhere". To achieve this goal Cornell
researchers plan to: (1) do fundamental new research, (2) develop integrated
systems to demonstrate the power of their results, and (3) test these systems.
In order to develop the proposed systems, it is critical to test them with real
systems and real users. These researchers plan to use their teaching activities
as a ready source of users to test their systems, as well as using the systems
to disseminate their research results and to provide experimental information
services. Cornell University is moving towards a campus-wide hybrid ATM and
switched ethernet communications network, which will eventually enable them to
test their systems with campus-wide network of 20,000 users. They also expect to
release their systems for use by other academic institutions and businesses.
