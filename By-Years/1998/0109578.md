This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
novel photonic crystal defect cavity enhanced photodetector with wavelength
selectivity, fast response speed, and low noise. By introducing photonic
crystals into the design of a cavity enhanced photodetector, the problems
associated with lattice matched reflector growth, low refractive index contrast,
and heterojunction charge accumulation will be avoided. The photonic crystal
defect cavity enhanced photodetector will be easy to fabricate and have superior
performance compared with traditional detectors. The design can be expanded to
photodetector arrays in many materials systems. Phase I will investigate the
fabrication of photonic crystal defect cavity, characterize the photonic crystal
band structure, and test p-i -n photodetector structures. Phase II would produce
the prototype photodetector devices and optimize their performance.

Novel products utilizing a photonic crystal defect cavity enhanced photodetector
are anticipated in optical communications and telecommunications. Since silicon
(Si)-based photodetectors can be easily incorporated into Si-based integrated
circuits, there will be immediate commercial application to the
telecommunications industry. There is also long term potential application in
imaging and optical communications.
