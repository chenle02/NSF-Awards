A curriculum in cellular and molecular biology has been under development in
this department for two years. The purpose is to provide a program which affords
an option in cellular and molecular biology to departmental majors, supports
other intra- and inter- departmental programs, and provides a background for
students interested in doing undergraduate research in these areas. Recent
developments include approval of an introductory course in molecular biology for
sophomore students and the restructuring of existing courses. The tabletop
ultracentrifuge provided through this award was needed to carry out laboratory
exercises essential to the program, support student research projects and to
provide practical experiences that reinforce pedagogical material covered in
lectures. The tabletop model not only is suitable for all these uses, it also is
less expensive to purchase and maintain, requires lower expenditures for
materials, and is both easy and safe to use. The grantee institution is matching
the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
