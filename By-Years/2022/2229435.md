The modern power grid is rapidly evolving towards a distributed and
reconfigurable system dominated by renewable energy resources, represented by
distributed generation, plug-in electric vehicles, energy storage, and demand-
response resources. The goal of this project is to develop computational tools
to address new challenges arising in modeling and control of the distributed and
reconfigurable power systems subject to heterogeneous disturbances. This
objective will be addressed by the development of new mathematical algorithms
and theory that will be deployed in power system applications, leveraging the
fundamental knowledge from machine learning, dynamical systems, and control
theory. This project will contribute to the NSF mission of advancing STEM
through the training of two graduate students and curricular development through
the design of courses on the topics of cyber-physical microgrids and machine
learning for dynamical systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to
devise compositional data-driven modeling, prediction, and control methods to
ensure the transient stability of the distributed and reconfigurable renewable-
energy-dominant power systems, which are inherently nonlinear, high dimensional,
partially observed, and subject to heterogeneous uncertainties. This project
will illuminate the machine learning advances for developing scalable and
cohesive approaches to solve the fundamental challenge of in systemâ€™s operation.
Specifically, the principal investigators (PIs) will (1) develop a noise-
resilient compositional bilinear operator theoretic method to identify a
control-amenable model for the transient dynamics of reconfigurable renewable
energy systems; (2) devise a stochastic dynamics model for the partially-
observed system by integrating a rigorous statistical closure formulation and a
physics-informed topology-aware data-driven model; and (3) integrate the
developed models with the optimal control algorithms to improve the transient
stability of the distributed and reconfigurable system in a predictive manner
towards a real-time autonomous operation capability. The PIs anticipate that
these outcomes will substantially enrich and expand the current research on
dynamic modeling and control of large-scale interconnected systems and support
the development of these techniques for applications of the next-generation
distribution grids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
