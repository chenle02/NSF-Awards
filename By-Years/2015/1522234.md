This project will support forty (40) two-year college economics faculty (twenty
teams of two faculty members each year) to attend the 2016 and 2017 American
Economic Association's (AEA) annual Conference on Teaching and Research in
Economic Education (CTREE). The annual CTREE conferences have become the focus
of efforts to improve student learning of economics in higher education. In
addition to bringing two-person teams of faculty to CTREE, the project will
require each faculty participant to complete a curriculum redesign project. The
forty completed redesign projects will be posted for public use at the Science
Education Resource Center website, Economics at Community Colleges which is part
of the online portal called Starting Point: Teaching and Learning Economics
(that can be entered at http://serc.carleton.edu/econ/index.html). A follow-on
workshop will identify new economics two-year faculty leadership who will work
with representatives of the AEA to sustain two-year faculty involvement with
CTREE and other AEA teaching and learning projects.
