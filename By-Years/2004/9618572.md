Undersea hydrothermal systems at mid-ocean ridges are of central importance to
the solid earth geochemical cycle, and also are the sites of large ore deposits
of Cu and Zn and undersea oases of life. Finding these systems is very
difficult, because they are hidden under many kilometers of water. Sediments
from the ocean ridge system collect settling particles distributed through the
water column by `plumes` of water rich in particles that rise from the
hydrothermal vents. The distribution of metal enrichment in sediments may help
to determine where hydrothermal vents occur, how long they have been present,
and how large a hydrothermal system is involved. Because sediments can be
collected easily from a ship on the sea surface, the sedimentary `halos` may
allow an efficient assessment of the distribution and size of hydrothermal
systems on a global basis. If so, then our understanding of the distribution of
hydrothermal activity, and the scientific processes responsible for it, will be
substantially enhanced. We propose to test the efficacy of this method using
sediments, and to apply it to several first order problems relating to
hydrothermal systems.
