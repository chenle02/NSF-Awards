In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Tomas Baer will use resonance enhanced multi-photon
ionization spectroscopy (REMPI) of jet-cooled molecules to investigate the
ultraviolet spectra and conformational equilibria of ring and open-chain
molecules such as ketones, ethers, and hydrocarbons. Temperature-dependent
spectral data will yield conformational enthalpy differences which can be
compared with values from calculations. Gas-phase measurements will be related
to solution studies via solvent effects. Vibrational relaxation-isomerization
rates in the supersonic expansion will be modeled using the master equation. The
accurate measurement of interaction energies will provide valuable information
about the nature and strength of non-bonded interactions of alkyl groups in
organic molecules. Many molecules have flexible structures, where the overall
positions of atoms can vary significantly without breaking or making any of the
strong chemical bonds that connect the atoms. The many forces exerted among
different regions of a molecule that are much weaker than chemical bonds can
strongly influence the overall arrangement of atoms in the molecule. For large
molecular systems (such as biological molecules), the collective effect of these
small forces can play a dominant role in determining the structure, and thus the
functional behavior, of the molecule. These studies will explore the nature of
some of these weak interaction energies. Results from this project could help to
refine the data bases used for computational predictions of properties of large
organic molecules.
