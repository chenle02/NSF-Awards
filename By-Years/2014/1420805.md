This project tests and facilitates a creative problem solving methodology, in
order to produce radically innovative research agendas. This project establishes
a natural experiment to examine a process that develops multi-disciplinary
research teams in a novel collaborative process to engage in the development of
potentially transformative ideas. Specifically, the project adapts a
participatory action research (PAR) approach to study a real world problem
solving situation in order to: (1) iteratively examine the complex social and
intellectual processes involved in collaboration and in creative problem solving
and (2) develop novel interdisciplinary research agendas in undergraduate STEM
education that address workforce needs unique to the Geosciences. Thus, the
project's impact has potential for serving as a demonstration of the complex
process of collaboration in multi-disciplinary research groups, as a test of
social and individual processes involved in collaboration and in creative
problem solving, and as a means for documenting the development of radically
innovative research agendas needed to address today's workforce needs in the
Geosciences.
