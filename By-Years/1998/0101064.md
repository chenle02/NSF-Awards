The investigators will study the role of high latitude Poynting flux in large-
scale magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. The principal means by which energy is
transported from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere is by Poynting flux and
particle precipitation in the high latitude polar regions. The Poynting flux
will be derived by combining magnetometer measurements from the Iridium
satellites with electric field measurements from the SuperDARN radar system. The
study involves three specific objectives: (1) Establish the principal regions of
electromagnetic energy flux by determining the spatial distribution of the
Poynting flux; (2) Identify the influence of the neutral wind dynamo by looking
for regions of negative Poynting flux; and (3) determine correlations between
Poynting flux and other magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling phenomena. The
combined data set will be used to calculate the global scale Poynting flux and
energy deposition into the atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
