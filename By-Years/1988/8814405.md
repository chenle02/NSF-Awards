It is proposed to hold a small international conference on the subject of
ultra-strong laser-matter interactions at the University of Rochester in June
1989. Among the potential discussion topics are quantum electrodynamics in
strong fields, short-pulse and strong-field effects on atomic structure, induced
correlation states, non-perturbative approaches to light-matter interactions,
laser upgrade paths, high harmonic and x-ray production, chaos in electron
response to strong fields and asymptotic stability. Participation from the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe will be encouraged.
