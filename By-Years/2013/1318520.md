Despite rampant criticism of passwords and an abundance of alternative proposals
for user authentication (e.g., biometrics), passwords are not likely to be
replaced in the near future due to their ease of deployment and familiarity to
users. Indeed, while a number of policies for improving password systems have
emerged, the most widely adopted of these is to simply increase the size of the
space from which passwords are drawn. Even so, for user-chosen secrets, these
policies generally make passwords harder to remember and type, leading to user
frustration. Worse, users generally fulfill these policies in predictable ways,
impairing the security benefits they are intended to
provide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project leverages linguistic expertise to
develop techniques that provide memorable passwords through both user input and
automated processes. Specifically, we explore the formation of pronounceable
authentication strings that lead to improved system security and a decreased
burden on users (by providing memorable, hint-able, easily type-able passwords
that are resistant to attack). Our user-influenced, but system-generated,
pronounceable strings combine source words to make lexical blends (aka
portmanteaus, e.g., flamingo + mongoose -&gt; flamongoose), or elicit user-
generated blends from system-suggested semantic domains. Additionally, we
examine techniques for rating pronounceability of word-like strings, allowing us
to quantify pronunciation difficulty and proactively apply rigorous security
analysis techniques to the space of pronounceable word-like strings. The broader
significance of the work is to increase our collective understanding of the
driving forces behind string pronounceability and the complex relationships
involved in human and automated formation of lexical blends.
