9456000 Child A Quantitative Learning and Teaching Program has been established
at Rollins College. Faculty from nine different departments in Mathematics, the
Sciences, Economics, Politics, and Business have been working together to
establish interdisciplinary initiatives involving teaching and learning of
quantitative skills. In the last two years, with support from the Bell South
Foundation, participating faculty have gathered and studied materials on
quantitative problem solving, have created instructional guidelines, established
a resource center, brought in experts as consultants to address the faculty,
established two computer based classrooms, hired an instructional specialist to
work with faculty, and recruited the first group of students to work with
faculty on the project. An important component of this project is a summer
seminar for faculty. This seminar series is being extended throughout the
academic year. This enables a larger number of faculty to participate. The goal
is to extend participation to faculty in all departments.
