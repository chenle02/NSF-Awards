Each student will conduct research related topic using the laboratory and
computational facilities. Research projects are designed to permit flexibility
in the student's level of preparedness, to develop independence in the student's
work, and to generate an interest in and understanding of the research
methodology. Research topics include consolidator characteristics of phosphate
clay, biodegration of hazardous wastes, finite element analysis of bonded
joints, differential temperature in slab bridges, and variable pulsed flow
valve.
