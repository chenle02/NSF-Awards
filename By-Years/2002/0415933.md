The goal of this research project is to make a qualitative leap in the speed and
accuracy of machine translation (MT) between human languages. The overall
strategy is to marry novel schemes for representing structured knowledge about
translational equivalence with recent and upcoming advances in machine learning.
The use of machine learning offers the practical advantages of broad coverage,
graceful degradation, and rapid adaptation to new domains of discourse. This
work embraces the exciting recent strides forward in machine learning, and
extends them to make structured predictions from structured data. At the same
time, the research is grounded in sound knowledge representation schemes that
can accommodate and exploit whatever information can be efficiently acquired on
a large scale. When properly optimized, rich and extensible knowledge
representation schemes enable MT systems to make important linguistic
generalizations, leading to more accurate predictions in a wider variety of
contexts.

Advances in this field have the potential to promote communication and
understanding between different cultures, grease the wheels of international
commerce, further the national security interests of the U.S. and its allies,
and save lives by facilitating communication during natural or man-made
catastrophes. The research results will be widely published, and the resulting
software will be made publicly available. In addition, the research will be
accompanied by a comprehensive educational program that includes new curricular
materials, conference workshops, and ample opportunities for students at all
levels to learn by doing.
