The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to minimize
landfilled waste disposal and produce clean and renewable solid fuel. The main
objective of the project is to gain insight into customer needs and to determine
if there is a value proposition for this technology. Waste is a feedstock that
is difficult to handle and has large inconsistencies with high chlorine content.
The team has developed a heat treatment that addresses these issues, producing a
torrefied fuel product that will benefit energy intensive companies (cement
kilns, metallurgy, power, etc.), encouraging them to use renewable energy and
reduce costs. Society will benefit from this project through reduced
landfilling, which will preserve the land from future landfilling, reduce
pollution by the toxic leachates, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and turn
waste into a resource, thus supporting the circular economy.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will reveal customer needs and pain
points in the area of solid fuel combustion and help to determine if torrefied
waste can be considered as a solid fuel used in small-to-medium size power
plants. As part of the customer discovery process, problems in using waste for
energy applications such as difficulty in handling, difficulty in transport,
large inconsistencies, high chlorine content, and severe corrosion and emissions
will be explored. The team has developed a torrefaction system that addresses
these hindrances with a series of processes, including downsizing, melting,
pyrolization, and pelletization which reduces chlorine and sulfur. This
torrefied product is pellet-shaped with high uniformity, high density, high heat
content, high consistency, and high durability. The pellets are low in chlorine
content, grindable, safe to store, safe to ship, and low in
cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
