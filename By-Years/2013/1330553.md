There are at least two key features of the move to cloud computing that
introduce the opportunity for significant leaps forward in computer security for
tenant services. First, a compute cloud provides a common software, hardware and
management basis for rolling out cross-cutting services en masse that have
resisted incremental deployment in a one-service-at-a-time fashion. Second,
compute clouds offer providers a broad view of activity across an unprecedented
diversity of tenant services. This research project leverages these features to
develop new approaches to a wide array of fundamental problems in computer
security. By convening Cloud Security Horizons summits with industry
stakeholders, this project further seeks to both contribute to industry
directions in cloud computing and to be informed by them.

Particular longstanding security challenges addressed in this project include
secure transport, authorization, user and software authentication, security
monitoring, and incident analysis. Moreover, since modern clouds are not
sufficiently extensible to support the envisioned capabilities, this project is
constructing cloud software platforms that enable the flexibility, extensibility
and security needed for this research to come to fruition in practice.
