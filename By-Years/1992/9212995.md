This project will study the effects of plant species diversity on the cycling
of nitrogen and phosphorus in a restored California serpentine grassland. Native
forbs and grasses from four functional groups that differ in phenology, C/N
ratio, rooting depth, root-to-shoot ratio, and other characteristics relevant to
nutrient cycling will be used. Plots will be planted with different compositions
and diversities of these functional groups to test five hypotheses: 1)
Differences in plant phenology and associated functional characteristics result
in different patterns of nutrient turnover and retention in plots composed of
separate functional groups; 2) Increasing diversity causes an increased
importance of plant uptake relative to microbial immobilization; alternatively,
it results in decreased nutrient loss from the system; 3) Increases in
functional group diversity result in decreased seasonal variability in nutrient
availability; 4) Maximum rates of nutrient turnover do not increase with
increasing diversity; and 5) Below-ground litter turnover and diversity in
below-ground plant functional characteristics have greater effects on nutrient
dynamics than does above-ground litter.
