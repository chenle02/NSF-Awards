This CSA will continue support ongoing operations of the Data Analysis and
Archive Center (DAAC) for the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology
Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC). DAAC will provide remotely sensed data for
research in meteorology, climate, ionospheric physics and Earth's gravity field
as specified in the proposal entitled "Establishing and Operating the COSMIC
Data Analysis and Archive Center (CDAAC)."
