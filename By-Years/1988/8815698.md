The evolution of complex social organization is a problem of central interest
to archaeology. Many theories have been advanced to explain the development of
pre-state chiefdoms. This project will test one of these theories: that the
development of chiefdoms is an oscillating process involving the interaction of
competing chiefs, inter-group warfare, and trade. The researcher will test this
theory of the development of regional political entities with materials from
Cahokia, the largest Mississippian period site in eastern North America.
Temporal and spatial patterning of architecture and artifacts from a large
residential area will be used to monitor variations in household organization
and production and in elite control of the production and trade of prestige
goods. This project will increase our understanding of the social and political
organization of Native American groups that lived in the American Midwest
region.
