9804739 Kurtz The problems facing molecular biologists in understanding and
analyzing the flood of molecular genetic sequences and structures resulting from
the Genome Projects raise a range of challenging biomathematical research
questions. The Newton Institute will host a program on "Biomolecular Function
and Evolution in the Context of the Genome Project." This inter-disciplinary
program, on the function, structure and evolution of molecular sequences, will
bring mathematicians and computer scientists working on subjects such as
probabilistic modeling, stochastic processes, geometry, statistical data
analysis, computational complexity, neural networks, genetic algorithms and
expert systems, together with molecular biologists working in medical and
biological fields. This award will support participation by US researchers. US
participants will include graduate students and postdoctoral and senior
researchers.
