Thirteen/WNET New York will develop and produce ten new episodes for a fourth
season of "Cyberchase." Now in its third production season and second year of
daily PBS broadcast, "Cyberchase" has helped millions of children acquire a
stronger foundation in mathematics. The new programs will enrich the series'
content by emphasizing science-mathematics connections and financial literacy.
Ancillary materials, outreach and a highly popular Website extend the learning
and help make "Cyberchase" the sole mathematics media project available for
young audiences. Plans for season four include enhancing the Website, building
the inventory of multi-media outreach activities, strengthening the show's
presence in after-school programs and launching a new relationship with the
museum community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
