NCR-9502615 Vojcic, Branimir An objective of this research is to assess the
performance limits of communications systems employing multiuser detection and
find receiver structures with practical complexity that achieve near optimum
performance. Topics treated include: multiuser transmitter precoding for
synchronous channels; combined multiuser detection and forward error correction;
soft interference cancellation and optimization in multiuser detection; hybrid
nonadaptive multiuser detection and adaptive interference cancellation;
multiuser detection design for mismatched channels; limiting performance of
multiuser detection and interference cancellation in terrestrial, satellite, and
indoor communications. In the education component symbolic computation and
visualization software will be used to improve the presentation and learning
processes. Combined software/hardware simulation tools will be used and
developed, involving both undergraduate and graduate students.
