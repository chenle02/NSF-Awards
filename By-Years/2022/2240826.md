Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of injury death in the United
States. More than three million Americans have lost their lives due to traffic
accidents in the 20th century. Despite the gravity of the issue, research and
public policy on this issue has been inconsistent over the course of the 20th
century. Periods of intense attention have alternated with decades of
indifference. This research project will illuminate why some solutions to
enhance car safety have been contentious and polarizing, while others were
readily adopted. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using historical analysis, the project
will focus on automotive safety. Outcries over automotive deaths in the 1960s
resulted in suggestions for various technological improvements or
implementations. While redesigned dashboards were generally accepted,
requirements to wear seat belts and to adhere to speed limits often met with
apprehension or rejection. Focusing on drivers and their public voices, the
research project will analyze why so many motorists were reluctant to buckle up
and to adopt limitations on how fast they could legally drive. In public
protests, letters to political leaders, and in letters to the editor, drivers
invoked personal freedom and a right to choose, while regulators presented these
changes as contributions to the common good. Even more so than other
transportation technologies, individually owned and operated automobiles became
sites of democratic negotiations over what kind of technological changes
governments should or should not require in the name of
safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
