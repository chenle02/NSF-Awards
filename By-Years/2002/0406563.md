Davis and Orr investigate several issues concerning the classification
&lt;br/&gt;of manifolds, as well as the classification of embeddings of
manifolds &lt;br/&gt;in manifolds, i.e. knot theory. A variety of tools are
used: surgery &lt;br/&gt;theory, localization and completion of groups, rings
and spaces, index &lt;br/&gt;theory, von Neumann algebras, Whitney disks
techniques, algebraic K- &lt;br/&gt;and L-theory, and controlled topology. Some
problems of interest are &lt;br/&gt;the study of connected sums of manifolds and
corresponding Nil and UNil &lt;br/&gt;phenomena, the concordance classification
of knots, actions on a &lt;br/&gt;product of spheres, and the ribbon/slice
problem. The goal, as usual &lt;br/&gt;in geometric topology, is to use a
variety of algebraic, geometric, and &lt;br/&gt;analytic techniques to find and
compute invariants for classification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric topology
is the study of manifolds. An n-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;manifold is a set of
points locally modeled on n-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;Euclidean space. For
instance, a 2-manifold is a surface and looks &lt;br/&gt;like a plane near each
point. Many physical phenomenon are represented &lt;br/&gt;by manifolds, and as
such, understanding the global structure of a &lt;br/&gt;manifold, and what
possible manifolds exist, is fundamental to the &lt;br/&gt;sciences, as well as
to mathematics. Additionally, one asks how &lt;br/&gt;manifolds can sit within
manifolds, a subject known as knot theory. &lt;br/&gt;Knot theory has been used
to model genetic structures and chemical &lt;br/&gt;bonds.&lt;br/&gt;
