This proposal is part of an integrated scientific investigation to study the
properties of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere, sea-ice and biology in the Northeast
Water (NEW) Polynya, which occurs near northeastern Greenland, in order to gain
an integrated understanding of Arctic shelf-slope processes. This element of the
NEW program will provide complimentary data to studies evaluating the magnitude
and spacial-temporal variation of phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass and
taxa, primary and new productivity and its environmental controls, as well as
associated parameters related to the impact NEW on water masses and shelf
processes.
