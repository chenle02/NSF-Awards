This award supports the NSF Workshop: Data Curation: Ensuring Quality and Access
to Enable New Science, to be held in September 2012 in Arlington, VA. The value
of data to the global economy has been well-documented and spawned calls for
training professionals who practice data curation and stewardship, data
analytics, and "big data" management. It is evident that poor data is worse than
no data because it wastes time, leads to poor science and decisions, and
diminishes trust in the entire data enterprise. Data curation demands tools and
techniques at each phase of the data life cycle that lead to effective and
efficient data services that people trust. This workshop brings together leading
researchers in data curation to establish a research agenda to guide development
of these tools and techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will have
impact on the emerging data curation research and development community by
defining directions for tools and techniques that support selection, metadata
annotation, storage, access, use and reuse, and preservation of scientific and
scholarly data. Such tools and techniques will make science and scholarship more
effective and may be adapted to personal data management applications such as
personal health or educational records. The workshop web site
(http://datacuration.web.unc.edu/) provides will be used to disseminate further
information, including the resulting workshop report that will provide a roadmap
for the future data curation research and follow-up activities.
