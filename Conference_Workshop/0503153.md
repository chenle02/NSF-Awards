This is a project to support a three-day commutative algebra conference at the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), May 7-9, 2005. The main goals of this
conference will be to help recent Ph.D.s and graduate students in the field to
meet experienced researchers, to learn about recent developments in commutative
algebra, to exchange ideas with one another, and to develop collaborations for
future research. The primary topics will be aspects of representation theory,
homological algebra, computational algebra and ideal theory that interact with
commutative algebra. Speakers will be invited to discuss connections among these
topics. We seek support primarily for a target group of participants: those who
are recent Ph.D.s, graduate students or women, as well as faculty from under-
represented groups or primarily teaching institutions. Most of the talks will be
accessible to graduate students and will demonstrate the main problems and
techniques in the discipline.

Over the last fifteen years there has been intense and ground-breaking activity
in commutative algebra, activity which has been rapidly transforming the field.
There is also extensive interaction with researchers in areas as diverse as
algebraic geometry, coding theory, combinatorics, homotopy theory, K-theory, and
rep- resentation theory. The proposed gathering will provide an opportunity for
algebraists to interact and establish research connections with each other; in
particular the targeted participants will benefit from the interaction and from
seeing recent developments in the field and its relationships with other areas.
