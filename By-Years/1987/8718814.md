This project has four goals: (1) to measure the Rydberg constant in atomic
hydrogen to a precision of one part in 10.10; (2) to determine the ionization
potential of atomic helium to one in part in 10.9; (3) to apply molecular
analysis to the sharp peaks in electron-positron and photon pairs produced in
heavy ion collisions; (4) to study effects of a squeezed radiation field on
atomic transition. It is suggested that the Rydberg constant may be used as a
unique wave length/frequency standard, which can serve throughout the entire
spectrum. Measurements in helium will test recent progress in its theory,
including relativistic effects and Lamb shifts.
