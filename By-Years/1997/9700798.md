This award provides supplemental funding for the First IEEE Signal Processing
Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communication (SPAWC) to be
held at La Villette, Paris, France, April 16-18, 1997. This workshop is
organized by Professors Lang Tong, Georgios Giannakis and Jean-Francois Cardoso.
The objective of this workshop is threefold: (1) to present the most recent
research results in the area of signal processing applications in wireless
communications; (2) to provide a forum for exchanging ideas on current trends
and future research directions; (3) to encourage cross-fertilization of ideas
between signal processing and communications communities, and between academia
and industry. The scope of the workshop includes the following key areas in
wireless communications where advanced signal processing techniques are making
significant impact: Array Signal Processing in Wireless Communications; Signal
Separation, Channel Estimation and Equalization; Detection and Estimation in
Wireless Systems; Modeling of Wireless Channels; Multi-user Wireless
Communications: DDMA, TDMA, FDMA; Synchronization and Tracking; Mobile, PCS and
Indoor Systems; Underwater and Satellite Communication Systems, and, Performance
Analysis and Experimental Results.
