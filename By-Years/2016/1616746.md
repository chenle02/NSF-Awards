Thin film deposition is a critical manufacturing process for many industries
including solar, semiconductor, flat panel display, LED and others. Thin film
vapor deposition is accomplished using complex and expensive manufacturing
equipment in which thermal and vapor flux uniformity are critical to producing
high quality products. To create new or improved designs, thin film
manufacturers rely upon inefficient, iterative, trial and error design
techniques. This project will develop high fidelity computational simulation
tools for the thin-film industry. These advancements will allow manufacturers to
design better fabrication equipment and optimize processes with faster design
cycles. Outcomes will be the increased performance and reduced cost of thin film
products.

This project will develop high fidelity computational simulation methods for
industrial thin film processes and equipment. The commercialization pathways of
these software tools will be developed and potential customers identified and
contacted. The predictive simulation methods combine thermal, fluid dynamics,
and film growth models into a comprehensive simulation which will be optimized
for industrial usage. The scope of this project is to start with manufacturing
hardware specifications and processing conditions which will be modeled on a
case by case basis. The interactions between manufacturing equipment, processes,
and product performance will be developed for the end user. As the project
advances, this analysis will be tailored to specific industries by creating
unique standalone software applications. These packages would be licensed
annually and used by design teams enabling engineers to leverage the significant
benefits of high fidelity simulation without requiring the years of specialized
training. This project will result in the development of unique simulation
capabilities that will benefit the thin film industry.
