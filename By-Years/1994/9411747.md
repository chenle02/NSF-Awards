9411747 Younkin The award is for the purchase of a tilting, open channel to be
used in studies of flows in channels with compounded cross-sections and for
experiments on the flow-induced vibrations of gates and overflowing nappes.
Provisions will be made for the installation of different highs, widths and
cross-slopes of symmetrical and asymmetrical flood plains of various surface
roughness, as well as for the installations of hydraulic gates models. The flume
is designed to permit the measurement of flow velocity distributions and, by
integration, the discharge in compound section channels over a wide range of
channel shapes and relative roughness. The flow-induced vibrations of hydraulic
gates and oscillation of the nappe will be examined as well with both over-and-
under-flow. The equipment will be used by undergraduate and graduate students
working with faculty in research and course projects providing them with an
excellent research experience. ***
