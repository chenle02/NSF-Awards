The research centers on the development of next-generation high-precision
methods of many-body relativistic theory for univalent atoms. A new partial
summation scheme to all-orders of many-body perturbation theory will be
implemented. This ab initio summation scheme will improve accuracy and
convergence of a recently derived and computed 1,648 fourth-order diagram
calculation. Second, an incorporation of valence triple and disconnected
quadruple excitations into a hierarchy of coupled-cluster equations is proposed.
The development of many-body formalisms has a long-term goal of improving
accuracy of calculations of atomic parity-violating amplitudes. These amplitudes
are important for revealing possible new physics beyond the Standard Model of
elementary particles. Applications to the design of ultrastable optical clocks
is also discussed.
