1144237&lt;br/&gt;Anvari&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal explores a new class
of nanoparticles, thus, may have widespread implications in science and in
patient care. Visualizing residual tumor deposits at surgery has the promise of
improving patient survival for multiple tumor types, including ovarian cancer.
Further, addition of phototherapy has the potential for killing tumor deposits
that may be too small to see by the surgeon. Successful outcome of the proposed
research activities has direct relevance towards future clinical strategies
aimed at staging and treatment of ovarian cancer. At one level, targeted OVGs
may be utilized in conjunction with the current standard of practice that
consists of open surgical cytoreduction to identify small peritoneal lesions
that cannot be identified with existing pre-operative imaging methods (e.g., CT
and MRI). Identifying these lesions is detrimental to tumor relapse and
patient?s survival. Furthermore, with future advancement in microendoscopy
technologies, OVGs may prove useful during laparoscopic procedures aimed at
staging and clinical management of ovarian cancer, particularly in high risk
individuals due to family history.
