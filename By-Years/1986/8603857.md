Stochastic network theory has progressed along "micro" lines, with the emphasis
on detailed, structured models whose analysis has become almost hopelessly
complex. An alternative, which the principal investigator will follow involves
the study of aggregated systems which can be modeled as control systems using
the concept of Brownian motion. The applications of such stochastic models
extend to material and data flow problems, common in transportation and computer
technology.
