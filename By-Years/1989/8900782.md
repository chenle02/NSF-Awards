This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the area of
Materials Chemistry. For a three-year period beginning April 1989, nine (9)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks engaged in research activities,
ranging from synthesis of new materials to characterization of their physical
and chemical properties. The goal of this program and its unique feature - its
concentration on highly-qualified women - will ultimately introduce into
graduate programs women who have been directly involved in the creative fusion
of Chemistry and Materials Science.
