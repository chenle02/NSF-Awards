Contemporary Materials Science and Engineering spans a wide spectrum of topics,
ranging from theoretical studies of the electronic structure of materials to the
design, synthesis, and processing of advanced materials. The faculty of the
University of Minnesota's Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials
Science has been productive in these areas of investigations. Departmental
research is conducted in Amundson Hall, a 1950's structure deficient of quality
research space. Currently, rooms dedicated for research activities, are used
inefficiently because of the interspersion of wet laboratories and theory space.
The shift in research emphasis toward experimental science has contributed to a
mix arrangement of laboratory and theory space, which impedes the interactions
of students with appropriate research groups. Funding received from the National
Science Foundation will be used to renovate existing research laboratories
needed to enhance and consolidate research groups by function. Renovations will
include the creation of wet laboratories from theoretical and modeling research
space. Laboratories for the synthesis and characterization of polymers,
ceramics, and molecular materials will be equipped with chemical fume hoods and
laboratory benches. Segregated instrument rooms will be designed to house
materials characterization equipment, and scanning, tunneling and atomic force
microscopes. By altering the configuration of research space, efficiency will be
maximized which will lead to increased productivity of faculty and graduate
students, in addition to improved research training. The project will enhance an
already productive Department, and allow for the adaptation of new developments
in Chemical and Materials Engineering.
