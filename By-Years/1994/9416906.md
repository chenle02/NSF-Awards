9416906 Girvin The main objective of this project is to enhance the
understanding of electronic phenomena in condensed matter systems. The proposed
work will include investigations of the quantum and statistical mechanics of
various quantum phases of matter including, electronic Fermi liquids, integer
and fractional quantum Hall systems, mesoscopic devices, superfluid films and
fractal structures, and both high-temperature and conventional superconductors.
Interest is in how the properties of materials can be modified by the presence
of disorder or by the imposition of artificial structures, and by the
application of high magnetic fields. Analytical methods of quantum field theory
and many-body theory, as well as numerical quantum Monte Carlo techniques will
be applied to the study of these phenomena. %%% The objective of this project is
to enhance the understanding of the properties of electrons in various materials
such as metals and semiconductors. The proposed work will include investigations
of metals in the superconducting state and investigations of ultra- small
eletronic devices in which quantum mechanics plays an important role. Interest
is in how the properties of materials can be modified by the presence of
disorder or by the imposition of artificial structures, and by the application
of both analytical mathematical methods and numerical computational techniques
which have proved valuable in this field of science.
