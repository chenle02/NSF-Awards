The ARM processor, a leading processor design for the embedded domain, supports
a 32 bit ARM instruc-tion set as well as a 16 bit Thumb instruction set. This
project is aimed at exploring two approaches for generating code that will
simultaneously achieve the goals of small code size, low energy consumption, and
good performance. The frst approach judiciously combines the use of ARM and
Thumb instructions to generate mixed code either dynamically or at compile time.
The second approach focusses on changing the data layout in a way that compact
code can be generated without sacrifcing good performance. To thoroughly explore
the above approaches an experimental infrastructure based upon the Simplescalar
simulator and the gcc compiler is being developed.
