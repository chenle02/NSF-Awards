The major question Malecki will examine is the degree to which the labor market
for technical workers affects the locational decisions made by research and
development firms. He will first study the location of R&D within corporations
and then survey both corporate staffs and R&D personnel to determine
considerations included in the locational decision making of corporations and
workers. He will then identify the degree of correspondence between the
locational criteria of firms and workers. The research links two issues in the
study of high-technology location: the labor market for professional and
technical workers and the location of corporate facilities for which such
workers are critical. The project will yield a better understanding of high-
technology industry location process, and therefore of broader questions of
regional growth and decline, by linking the two perspectives.
