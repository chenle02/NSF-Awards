Dr. Richard Kemp (PI) of the Department of Chemistry, University of New Mexico,
and Dr. R. Thomas Baker (co-PI) are supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry program of the Division of Chemistry to host the 2004,
2005 and 2006 NSF-sponsored Annual Inorganic Workshops. The purpose of these
workshops is to assemble researchers from different geographical areas and broad
diversity at different stages of their careers to encourage informal and
detailed discussion of in progress investigations. The workshops will focus on
emerging ideas, new techniques, and unsolved problems. A group of Scientific
Advisors will assist in selecting the participants.

The aim of the proposed workshop is to provide a means for efficient,
concentrated communication and discussion of current research ideas, progress,
problems, and new opportunities in inorganic chemistry. An effort will be made
to involve researchers from interfacial areas to encourage new research
initiatives. Areas such as materials science, pharmaceutical chemistry,
asymmetric synthesis, industrial catalysis, polymer chemistry, analytical
chemistry, biochemistry, spectroscopy, theoretical chemistry, gas phase
chemistry, and experimental physical chemistry are but a few where creative
breakthroughs might occur by cross fertilization of research approaches.

The NSF Inorganic Chemistry Workshop has been an essential element of U.S.
education and communication in Inorganic and Organometallic Chemistry over the
last 25 years. The workshops bring together inorganic chemists, particularly
younger chemists at the Assistant and Associate Professor levels to give them an
occasion to test their ideas. An annual report will be made available to the NSF
IBO program and to the community based on input from the participants to provide
insight into emerging research areas.
