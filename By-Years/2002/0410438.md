This award supports the development of robust and adaptable sensor arrays and
related software for observing and analyzing bird diversity and behavior. Birds
have been selected as the test group for this work because of their importance
in biodiversity, and because they are well-characterized with regard to the
properties that will be explored (i.e. bird vocalizations). This project will
make use of existing sensor arrays developed by the UCLA Center for Embedded
Sensing (CENS).

The work will be performed in laboratories at UCLA and at several field sites:
(1) the UC Riverside James Reserve, near Idyllwild, CA. - a heavily instrumented
field site with full-time specialists on sensor arrays. Here, methods will be
initially tested, then deployed to either (2) the Hastings Reserve, near
Monterey CA, where acorn woodpeckers have been marked and studied. The sensor
arrays will be used to identify individual woodpeckers, locate them, and to
identify patterns in their behavior associated with the approximately 10 calls
they employ. Arrays will also be deployed to (3) the Montes Azules Biodiversity
Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico, which has a rich diversity of bird species in a
tropical rainforest. Here, the sensor arrays will be developed to identify and
locate different bird species in the region.

The sensor arrays, software, and methodology developed by this project will
serve a severe need to assay biodiversity in ecosystems. The tools needed to
remotely sense, record and automatically analyze acoustical behavior will be
enormously helpful for studies of ecology, biodiversity and behavior.
