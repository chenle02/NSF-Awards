This is a 5-year continuing award. Intelligent machines capable of recognizing
and analyzing human actions will play an important role in next generation
human-computer interfaces. This research effort will address development of a
computational vision framework for recognizing dynamic human movements. The goal
is to model the perceptual dynamics associated with human activities to
automatically identify various action categories and action efforts. The PI will
examine a key-feature approach within a three-mode principal components
framework to learn the expressive features needed for the model to produce
results qualitatively similar to human judgments of the actions. Experiments
will be conducted using motion capture and video data of multiple people
performing common activities at different efforts. Results at each stage will be
compared to perceptual experiments and alternative non-expressive methods. To
demonstrate the approach, an automatic surveillance and monitoring application
will be implemented. If successful the research should have broad impact on
human-computer interaction in numerous domains as diverse as ergonomic
evaluation, sports analysis, and computer animation. In conjunction with the
research, the PI will create an educational plan that integrates topics on
computer vision, human perception, human-computer interaction, and computer
animation into a new cross-disciplinary curriculum that combines classroom
discussions with practical laboratory experience, and which fosters
undergraduate research-related opportunities.
