gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0435303&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Panwar,
Shivendra S.&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Polytechnic University of New
York&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: High-Performance Stable Packet
Switches&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While switching capacity
follows Moore's Law and doubles every 18 months, op-tical fiber line bandwidths
double every 12 months. Consequently, packet switching technology continues to
be one of the bottlenecks in the development of broadband networks. In this
project, the research team has devised a new class of low complexity matching
algorithms, i.e. Exhaustive Service Match with Hamiltonian Walk, which achieves
stability and low packet delay, as opposed to cell delay, which was the focus of
most previous research. Specifically, the fol-lowing two important issues are
studied: (i) determination of the optimal packet delay for a matching algorithm,
and (ii) options for the packet delay to increase sub-linearly with switch size
under a general traffic pattern. This project will also address the class of
switches that resolve the output contention by using the load balancing, where
no scheduler is used, and re-sequencing is needed at the output. The total
packet delay being investigated consists of the queuing delay and the re-
sequencing delay. Another goal is to re-examine switch archi-tectures and their
performance under more realistic long range dependent (LRD) traffic, and suggest
improved architectures tuned to LRD traffic based on the insights thus
derived.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Admela Jukan&lt;br/&gt;Program Director,
