The University of Florida will conduct a four-day workshop during which fifty
State Science Supervisors, or their designees, will use a new technology known
as CD-ROM to increase the amount and appropriateness of hands-on activities in
K-8 science. One thousand lessons which provide students experiences and were
produced by NSF-funded projects (ESS, SCIS, SAPA, MINNEMAST, COPES, USMES, and
ESSP) have been collected, analyzed, abstracted and stored on a compact disk
during a 1984-1987 Carnegie project. A powerful search system allows rapid and
selective use of lessons through criteria such as grade level, science
processes, subject, vocabulary words and content themes. Lessons are in the
public domain and can be printed. Workshop materials will be based on results of
a pilot program in ten Florida school districts and workshop personnel are from
the program and the original CD-ROM project. Though no dollar figure is
attributed to the cost-share, the University, through their School of
Architecture, is providing sufficient computers so that there will be one
available for each two participants.
