The Department of Chemistry at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in
collaboration with the Department of Materials Engineering, is equipping a
laboratory for a freshman chemistry course that emphasizes materials chemistry.
This innovative course uses materials-oriented laboratory experiments that are
relevant to the 'real world' and show the beauty, the complexity, and the
discovery aspect of science. The grantee is matching this award from non-Federal
sources.
