Cutkosky will investigate four projects: toroidalization, local monomialization
and ramification of surfaces in positive characteristic, asymptotic properties
of powers of ideals and semigroups of valuations on local rings. In
toroidalization, the main conjecture is to show that any dominant morphism of
varieties can be made into a toroidal mapping, or a local monomial mapping, by
blowing up nonsingular subvarieties in the domain and range. Cutkosky will
extend his recent work proving the conjecture for 3-folds, towards a general
proof of the conjecture. On the problem of ramification in positive
characteristic, the proposer has found with Oliver Piltant stable forms of
mappings between germs of characteristic p surfaces. Cutkosky proposes to refine
the formulation of these forms, and apply them to a study of ramification of
maps of surfaces in characteristic p. Cutkosky will continue his work on
computing asymptotic properties of Hilbert type functions on functors of powers
of ideals. Cutkosky also seeks to understand the semigroups which can occur as
the value semigroup of a (possible noetherian) valuation dominating a noetherian
local domain.



Algebra is of increasing importance in modern science and technology. Cutkosky
will investigate several problems of theoretical importance in the general area
of Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry. The main objective is to
understand the structure of polynomial mappings, and systems of polynomial
equations. Cutkosky will train undergraduate and graduate students, and mentor
young researchers through this project.
