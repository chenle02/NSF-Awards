This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
development of a unique, scalable membrane pervaporation process that can be
used in a wide array of separations that are of national and economic
importance. This research will demonstrate the technical viability of a novel
pervaporation system, which generates its vacuum by passing a special working
fluid through a Venturi nozzle. More specifically it will show that an
intermediate cat naphtha stream having up to 2000 ppm sulfur can be selectively
separated into (1) an aromatic-rich permeate fraction that contains almost all
of the sulfur-bearing molecules and (2) a virtually sulfur-free saturate-rich
retentate fraction that contains almost all of the olefins. A small scale
laboratory system will be used to generate permeation rate and quality data on
model feeds using membranes that have previously been shown to have high
aromatic/aliphatic selectivities.

One application of particular interest is the reduction of sulfur in gasoline.
The National Petroleum Council has estimated that it will cost U.S. refiners $8
billion in 1998 dollars to meet the 30 ppm Tier 2 requirement for sulfur in
gasoline, primarily because of the limitations of existing commercial
hydrotreaters. If successfully demonstrated, this technology could be used in
tandem with existing hydrotreaters worldwide to allow refiners to more cost
effectively meet lowered sulfur specifications for gasoline.
