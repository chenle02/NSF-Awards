A set of multimedia modules ia being developed and is designed for use in core
chemical engineering undergraduate courses (e.g., thermodynamics, fluid
mechanics, process design and control). Each module typically consists of
digital video, sound, animation, and text and stresses the connection between a
traditional mathematical representation (e.g., as seen in textbooks) and a
laboratory experience. These modules are being developed with Macromedia's
"Director" package on PowerMacintosh machines. Each completed module can be
placed on the World Wide Web by way of the client Mosaic for easy access by
other educators.
