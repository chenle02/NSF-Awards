This award supports participation in the conference "Pan-American Conference on
Differential Equations and Nonlinear Analysis" that will take place at
University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, February 9-20, 2015. The conference is
the tenth installment in a series of triennial conferences started in 1994.
Locations alternate between North and South Americas. The project will support
participation of junior American researchers who will be exposed to their
international peers and to the stimulating atmosphere of the conference.
Educational program of the Conference is integrated with research activities. It
includes a series of mini-courses, half of which will be taught by the US women
mathematicians. The Conference will further foster international collaboration
between mathematicians of the Americas. The conference and related mini-courses
cover a wide array of subjects from some of the most important applications of
differential equations as well as some of the latest mathematical analysis
techniques for their study. The type of questions to be discussed is
instrumental for many applications, ranging from mathematical and statistical
physics, fluid dynamics to engineering macro and micromechanics, mathematical
finance, collective dynamics in social sciences, as well as biological and
climate sciences.

More specifically, the intellectual focus of the conference is to bring together
a group of experts in different aspects of continuum and statistical models for
gas dynamics and associated free boundary problems, as well as well as the
associated dynamics, and stochastic noise effects, among others. Some of the
leading world experts in applied partial differential equations, dynamical
systems, financial mathematics, analysis and geometric analysis will serve as
plenary speakers or mini-course lecturers.
