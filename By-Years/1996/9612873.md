9612873 Acrivos This well integrated Research for Undergraduate Institutions
(RUI) proposal advances education and research by involving undergraduate as
well as graduate students in a study of low dimensional solids. It will focus on
common properties exhibited by a variety of compounds such as graphite,
dichalcogenides, superconducting cuprates and nickelates, and organic metals,
all of which have layered structures. Common properties to be studied include
the ability to undergo intercalation reactions involving different
donor/acceptor groups as well as metal to non metal to superconducting phase
transitions. Methods that will be used in these investigations include electron
spin resonance and x-ray absorption spectroscopy. %%% Intercalation reactions
are used for the synthesis of low dimensional solids as materials for high-duty
batteries, catalysts, and solid lubricants. The synthesis of these materials and
their evaluation by spectroscopic measurements will promote solid laboratory
experiences for the undergraduate and masters degree students. The integration
of research with education through the training of students in this
fundamentally and technologically significant materials area, together with
strong collaborations at IBM and the Universities of Purdue, Notre Dame, and
Cambridge (UK), make this a most unique RUI program. ***
