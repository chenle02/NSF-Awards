Miniaturization of electronic components into integrated circuits (semiconductor
devices) has dramatically affected our lives. No where is this more apparent
than the large dependency American manufacturing has on semiconductor design and
fabrication. The production of an integrated circuit requires a four state
process: 1) wafer fabrication; 2) wafer probe; 3) assembly (packaging); and 4)
final test. Because of the high capital costs and fairly low variable rate
production costs, manufacturers of semiconductors try to maintain high
utilization of the wafer fabrication equipment The proposed research focuses on
the task of effectively generating schedules which improve performance of the
production system. With a small number of bottleneck processes dominating the
schedule, it is reasonable to expect that concepts such as aggregation and
decomposition can be applied to reduce the original problem to one which
essentially involves only the bottleneck processes. Then, given a solution to
the simpler problem, techniques of disaggregation can be applied to "explode"
the solution into the full schedule.
