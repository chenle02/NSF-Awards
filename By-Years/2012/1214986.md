This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate
feasibility by developing a novel sampling system to detect 103-4 cfu/g
Salmonella typhimurium in spinach within 2 hours. Foodborne diseases resulting
from Campylobacter, Escherichia, Listeria, Salmonella, Shigella and Vibrio
species affect as many as 76 million persons in the United States each year,
resulting in 325,000 hospitalizations and nearly 5,000 deaths. Unfortunately,
current methods used to detect these pathogens rely on lengthy growth enrichment
steps that take 1 to 4 days, negating effective prevention of contaminated food
distribution and consumption. During the Phase II project, a prototype Foodborne
Pathogen Analyzer will be developed to extract, detect, identify, and quantify
the presence of the above listed pathogens in a variety of food matrices in 1 to
2 hours at the required sensitivity (e.g. 1-100 cfu/g).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader/commercial impacts of this research are 1) to detect pathogens in or on
food in 1-2 hours, hence preventing the distribution and consumption of
contaminated food, 2) to speed the process of identifying the source of an
outbreak, helping minimize illnesses and deaths, and 3) to allow developing
similar systems that can detect bioagents in support of the military and
homeland security, and other infectious pathogens in support of medical
diagnosis (e.g. detection of MRSA, HIV, TB).
