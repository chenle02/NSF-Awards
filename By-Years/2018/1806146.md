The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to create a
product that will facilitate assessment of transportation fuels to ensure they
will pass fuel specification tests. In particular, the project will provide a
device that producers can use to more accurately determine whether their fuels
will meet the specifications for soot/smoke emissions and should create a
framework that allows fuel specifications for particulate matter (PM) emissions
to be defined more precisely. This will benefit the fuels industry by reducing
costs and increasing certainty. It will also enable them to confidently
introduce alternative fuels that have lower PM
emissions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project further develops an
instrument that characterizes the sooting propensity of a fuel by its soot
luminosity. Unlike the methods currently in use, this technology allows a
quantitative measurement to be fully automated and performed online. It will
deliver more accurate results faster than existing qualitative methods while
requiring less sample. Extensive academic research has verified that this
approach correctly detects the effect of fuel composition on PM emissions. This
I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of this instrument across
a variety of potential customer segments.
