AST-1108700&lt;br/&gt;Cen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observations indicate that the
cosmological reionization history may be quite complex, and to understand at a
fundamental level how the universe was reionized and what reionized it, requires
a satisfactory understanding of the formation of galaxies during the
reionization epoch. Current and future observations are, and will be, detecting
many galaxies in the reionization epoch above redshift six, and interpreting
this rich dataset will require a comprehensive theoretical framework for
galaxies in halos of tens of millions to ten billion solar masses, constructed
as much as possible ab initio and from first principles in the standard cold
dark matter model. This research program will establish such a framework by
carrying out ultra-high-resolution, cosmological, adaptive mesh refinement
radiation-hydrodynamic simulations focusing on galaxies in the right mass range,
combining a detailed physical treatment with sophisticated post-simulation
analysis. The work will significantly advance the fields both of galaxy
formation at high redshift and of cosmological
reionization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These research activities will be integrated
into the training of graduate and undergraduate students, and will feed into an
effective outreach program that improves the scientific understanding of the
general public about cosmological research. The demands of carrying out these
simulations push technological advances in supercomputers and related hardware
and software, and drive the development of national research infrastructure.
