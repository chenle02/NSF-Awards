An award is made to South Dakota State University to purchase an Illumina
NextSeq500 nucleic acid sequencer and ancillary equipment to support research in
the Life Sciences. The purchase of this instrumentation will contribute to the
development of learning and training opportunities for undergraduate and
graduate students at SDSU as well as researchers in the State of South Dakota
and the region. In addition the instrumentation will allow introducing the
technology and its applications to students (7th-12th grade) participating in
the Annual Eastern South Dakota Science Fair.

The purchase of this equipment will advance research projects in both plant and
animal sciences and in cell biology. The sequencer will allow plant scientists
to answer fundamental questions in plant development; how plants adapt to and
interact within their environment. Genetic scientists will make gains in food
crops to ensure a safe, secure food supply. Animal scientists will improve the
nutrition of animals that are raised as food sources. Cell biologists will apply
the technology to study the basic mechanisms of all living things on a cellular
level, laying a foundation of knowledge for scientist worldwide. This knowledge
gained with the use of this new equipment will lead to scientific advancements
in health, nutrition and disease prevention in plants, animals and humans.
