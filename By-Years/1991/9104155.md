The proposed research is focused on a new computational method developed for
solving variational problems with a large, possibly infinite, set of
constraints. An investigation of various aspects of this method is proposed,
with emphasis on the error analysis, discretization techniques, generalizations
and convergence acceleration. On the basis of this method computational
algorithms are expected to be developed for a class of equilibrium and slow
evolution problems and for evolution problems with a large number of
conservation laws. A large class of applications in physics and engineering is
proposed for the investigation with the help of these computational algorithms.
Applied problems include problems in ideal magnetohydrodynamics (tokamak design,
analysis of the experimental data), fluid dynamics (design of efficient
computational algorithms with improved convergence and stability properties) and
astrophysics. The variational approach is also proposed for developing numerical
methods for finding periodic solutions of nonlinear wave equation and quasi-
periodic solutions of second order dynamical systems.
