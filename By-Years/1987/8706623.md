The investigators will analyze geostationary and polar orbiting satellite data
as well as climatological station data for the period 1976-1985 examine the
causes and consequences of precipitation regimes in Venezuela. By determining
why the seasonal march of precipitation in Venezuela differs sharply from that
in other tropical regions, especially monsoon areas, the project will increase
our understanding of the climatology of a region with a unique precipitation
regime, of its possible teleconnections with events and processes outside the
study region, and our knowledge of tropical climatology more generally. The
results of the project will also serve as a benchmark for future studies of
topographic effects on climate in the study area and for other geoecological and
paleoclimatic investigations.
