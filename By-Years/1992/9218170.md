An important aspect of this program is that the observational data from this
campaign will be made available to all interested solar physicists. The
instrument that is proposed will be a small, low-scattered- light refracting
telescope consisting of a 15-cm doublet, a fast guider, a 0.2 nm CaII K filter
and several additional filters for continuum observations at other wavelengths,
and a commercial 2048x2048 CCD camera. The entire enclosed telescope package
will be on an equatorial mount. Data rates will be sufficiently low that a pc-
class computer can be used for both telescope control and data acquisition. This
proposal will aid in making the High-Degree Helioseismometer data available to
the community. This instrument, which was operated last year at the South Pole,
has been installed at the Kitt Peak Vacuum Telescope, and is now producing high-
quality Ca K-line images. With the modest help requested here, these data will
be made available to the community on a weekly basis. This will start important
science associated with the Sun's variable radiative output now. In addition,
the project can begin purchasing equipment needed for a future RISE PSPT
telescope.
