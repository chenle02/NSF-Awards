The aim of this project is to improve course content in chemistry laboratories
at the institution, with emphasis on organic chemistry. Implementation involved
acquisition of Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR), a modern
ultraviolet-visible recording spectrophotometer (UV-VIS), two gas chromatographs
(GC) and other accessories. Student have direct hands-on experience with these
instruments and have acquired skill in interpreting the measurements they
provide. FTIR and UV-VIS are used for molecular structure determination and have
allowed enhanced knowledge of structure/property interrelationships. The new
instruments are used in conjunction with computer-assisted molecular graphics
and molecular mechanics methods. New student exercises have been implemented
which take advantage of the increased capabilities of the equipment. GC is a
valuable adjunct to these methods because it allows rapid separation,
identification, and quantification of organic substances. The institution
contributed to the project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
