9508013 Hanson This project will conduct mapping and geochronological studies of
the Zambezi orogenic belt in southern Africa. Although this belt is highly
significant to Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic plate reconstructions, it is
geologically very poorly understood. The study will collect U/Pb, 40Ar/39Ar and
Sm-Nd isotope data from critical samples in Zimbabwe during detailed mapping
traverses. The results will constitute the first data set of its kind from the
Zambezi belt and will allow its tectonic history to be determined for this first
time. The data will also be significant for Neoproterozoic plate reconstructions
and understanding the assembly of the central part of the Gondwana
supercontinent.
