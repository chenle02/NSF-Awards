CBET - 1500377&lt;br/&gt;PI: Larson, Ronald&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surfactants are
used in many household, medical, and industrial products. Surfactant molecules
in solution can spontaneously assemble into structures, which can strongly
influence the properties of the liquid. This project will develop a theory to
predict the properties of solutions of thread-like micelles, which are long
flexible surfactant structures. The particular focus of the proposed work is to
explore the role of micelle branching in the behavior of these interesting
solutions. The results of the work will be incorporated into an open source
software package that will be made freely available for use in the industrial
formulation of surfactant solutions. Students involved in the research will have
the opportunity to gain experience in industrially-related research through
internships at collaborating companies.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A detailed,
quantitative theory will be developed to predict the linear rheology of
solutions of branched threadlike micelles, including effects of reptation (or
sliding) of the micelles through the entanglement network, as well as
fluctuations in the "primitive path" of the micelles, micelle breakage and
rejoining, formation and breakage of network junctions, and other relaxation
phenomena. These phenomena will be modeled using a "Pointer Algorithm" developed
by the PI that accounts for micelle relaxation phenomena, but not for micellar
branching. The incorporation of branch formation will represent a major advance
in understanding the dynamics and rheology of surfactant solutions. This
methodology will provide accurate estimates of micelle lengths, breakage rates,
and rates of formation and breakage of branch points, and the number of branches
per micelle, extracted from rheology data by fits of this data to predictions of
the Pointer Algorithm.
