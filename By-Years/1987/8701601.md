The eighth in a series of Gordon Conferences on Atomic Physics will be held
July 6-10, 1987 at Brewster Academy, Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. This meeting will
continue the tradition of dealing with emerging areas and major advances in
existing areas. The specific topics and speakers will be determined at a meeting
of the program committee in October, 1986 with supplementary areas and speakers
added in the Spring of 1987 to allow response to new development in rapidly
evolving areas. The areas to be included in the meeting include both theoretical
and experimental programs with emphasis on fields which have presented
conceptual challenges and which have a broad impact beyond their initial area of
activity. Interest in recent atomic physics Gordon Conferences has been very
high. The meetings represent a unique opportunity to assemble a critical number
of the leading researchers in related but differing specialization to bring new
points of view to the most exciting current problems. This proposal requests
National Science Foundation assistance in support of the Atomic Physics Gordon
Conference by participants.
