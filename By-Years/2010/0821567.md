The Chemistry Department at SUNY College at New Platz will acquire an atomic
force microscope (AFM) mounted on an inverted optical microscope platform with
this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program. The proposed
AFM/inverted optical microscope system will advance the following research
areas: (1) chemical and physical strategies used by Pseudomonas putida to
enhance bioavailability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; (2) subunit
dissociation and unfolding of acellular polymeric hemoglobins; (3)
characterizing chemically derivatized surfaces, modified for hybridization and
protein binding reactions; and (4) modeled microgravity induced cytoskeletal
changes. These research topics have important implications in the domains of
bioremediation, medical treatment, physical aspects of biochemical reactions,
and space travel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An atomic force microscope is used to
characterize surface topography on a nanoscale level, distinguish different
molecular coverage on surfaces, unfold polymers, calculate substrate stiffness,
and quantify interaction forces. The inverted optical microscope platform will
confer additional versatility so that samples can be located or simultaneously
imaged by phase or fluorescence microscopy and AFM. The instrument will be used
by undergraduate research students and in laboratory experiments in 3 courses.
It will be employed in collaborations with three Marist College faculty. Other
nearby colleges will have access to the instrument.
