This project improves undergraduate introductory physics instruction for many
college students, including under-represented and under-prepared populations, by
changing their learning environment to a more active one. The Activity Based
Physics Group achieves this goal by 1) identifying and recruiting faculty who
are interested in changing their teaching, conducting action research in their
classrooms, and sharing new approaches with colleagues; 2) developing and
presenting a series of Activity Based Physics Institutes at the University of
Oregon and Dickinson College using curricula and tools from the Activity Based
Physics Suite; 3) creating and maintaining follow-up and support mechanisms to
help implementation; and 4) organizing follow-up sessions at national AAPT
meetings.

Project activities directly reach 160 faculty and affect an estimated 60,000
students, many from under-represented and under-prepared groups. Staff and
participant dissemination activities built into the project assure that the
impact will be much broader.
