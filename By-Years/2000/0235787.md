Clines are regions of blending between geographically abutting populations with
different genetic makeup. Powerful theoretical and statistical methods are
available to study the evolutionary forces that maintain natural clines. Here we
demonstrate that clines also provide a powerful manipulative tool for the
experimental study of dispersal and selection. We develop a new model of non-
equilibrium cline dynamics that is suitable for studying rapid evolutionary
changes. We use the model to study dispersal and natural selection in
insecticide resistance in the Colorado potato beetle, a major defoliator of
potato crops. We will create resistance clines in replicate potato fields in
Massachusetts and Maine, and use them to test hypotheses about adaptation to
spatially varying habitats, including dispersal patterns and the strength of
selection. New 'refuge'-based strategies to slow the rate that pesticide
resistance evolves also depend on knowledge of dispersal.

Our measurements of dispersal apply directly to new management strategies to
slow the rate that resistance to pesticides evolves in potato beetles, and our
new methods can be applied to other crop-pest systems. Our results will be
shared with potato growers, who will directly benefit.
