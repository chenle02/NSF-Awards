This is a proposal by Dr. Elizabeth Bernays and her graduate student, Mr.
Raymond V. Barbehenn, of University of California, Berkeley. Overall, this is a
very well-conceived and well- executed grant proposal. It addresses questions
about herbivore utilization of C3 and C4 grasses that have benn inadequately
addressed in previous work, and proposes to test hypotheses about the use of
these grasses by herbivorous insects. The perspective of assessing three levels
of this relationship (nutritional ecology, macronutrient use, and mechanisms of
digestion) is a good one. The methodologies of various of the planned
experiments are adequately described. The work has implications for advances in
pest control and in agriculture, especially with cereal systems. Dr. Bernays is
increasingly applauded for her fine work in this area of ecologyy and the
facilities at Berkeley are ideal for pursuing this research. The Program
recommends funding.
