Current paleomagnetic data from Africa suggests that either a small permanent
rotation between West Africa and South Africa occurred before mid-Cretaceous
time or that the earth's field was not a centered dipole. This project will
improve the paleomag- netic data base for South Africa. Results are expected to
allow refinements in the detailed history of Gondwana breakup
