This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award is to prepare detailed
plans and protocols for university-based remote- accessed MultiChip Module (MCM)
testing services for universities. Current MCM testing is proprietary, product
specific, and without university involvement. This research contributes to the
development of standard public domain processes that can be used for prototype
quantity testing of MCMs whose electrical, physical, and test designs are done
at universities. Plans provide for testing of bare chips, bare substrate and
assembled modules for various assembly methods and degrees of testing
automation.
