A series of new experiments will measure the thermal diffusivity of core (iron
and iron compounds) and lower mantle minerals. In these experiments, different
thickness films of core materials such as Fe, stainless steel, Si, or FeS, are
embedded in a mantle mineral such as Mg2Si04 or A1203 and the thermal decay of
the generally hotter core material is viewed radiatively. The radiation versus
time profile can be inverted to yield strong constraints on thermal
diffusivities of the poorer conducting transparent mineral undergoing shock
pressure. Experiments will use A1203, MgO, LiF, and Mg2Si04 windows and film of
Si, Fe, Ni, FeS, and FeS2. These data re of importance in determining whether
the core-mantle thermal boundary layer is stable with respect to convection, as
well as determine how much of the earth's heat flow comes from conduction across
the core- mantle boundary.
