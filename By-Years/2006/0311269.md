Computer Science (31) It is generally recognized that programmable computing
elements are increasingly appearing in devices used by the populace. The
software in these devices has constraints that are markedly different from
software designed for a general-purpose computer. Most computing curricula deal
almost exclusively with developing software for that general-purpose class. This
project enables our undergraduate students to study issues related to developing
real-time and embedded software systems in a "studio" format classroom-the new
Real-time and Embedded Systems Lab. The adaptation of exemplary real-time and
embedded systems courses to RITs academic environment and the equipping of the
new laboratory are the key activities of this project. Exemplary course models
from Arizona State University and Southern Polytechnic State University are used
in this project. These institutions are also involved in the adaptation process
and the evaluation of completed work. Increasing student's interest and
improving their qualifications for developing real-time and embedded software
systems is the goal. The target audience is upper-level undergraduates in our
Software Engineering and Computer Engineering programs.
