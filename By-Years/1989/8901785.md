The research will use flouorescent dye markers to investigate the potential
pathways for movement of water-soluble compounds between green leaf cells, which
produce water-soluble photosynthetic compounds such as sugars and amino acids,
and the vascular cells which distribute the photosynthetically produced
compounds throughout the plant. Experimental treatments will be devised to
modulate or disrupt the flow of dye between leaf cells and the vascular system.
A comparison will then be made of the effects of these treatments on the
recovery of photosynthetically produced compounds such as sugars and amino acids
in the vascular system. The results should reveal which photosynthetically-
produced solutes are delivered to the vascular cells and also the route that
these solutes take as they move from the leaf tissues and into the vascular
cells.
