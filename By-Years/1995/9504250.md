9504250 Pinsky Abstract This project supports the seventeenth annual Midwest
Probability Colloquium, to be held at Northwestern University in Evanston,
Illinois on October 20-21, 1995. The Colloquium is an annual gathering, at
Northwestern, of 75-100 experts in probability theory from the Great Lakes
region and other parts of the U.S. and Canada. The 1995 program features Charles
Newman of New York University's Courant Institute as the main speaker, with
David Griffeath and Claudia Neuhauser--both of the University of Wisconsin--as
other invited speakers. Newman will speak on first passage percolation theory,
Griffeath on threshold growth dynamics and Neuhauser on spatial competition
processes. The NSF support is targeted toward stipends for graduate students, as
well as honoraria for invited speakers. This project supports the seventeenth
