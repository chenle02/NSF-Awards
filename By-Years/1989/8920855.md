The collection of modern echinoderms in the Los Angeles County Museum of
Natural History comprises more than 30,000 lots, and ranks as the third largest
collection of echinoderms in the U.S. The collection has grown rapidly over the
past ten years by absorbing the large collection in the Allan Hancock Foundation
of the University of Southern California, as well as several smaller orphaned
collections. The Los Angeles County Museum's collection is the most important
research resource in the western U.S. for echinoderm specialists and marine
biologists using this taxonomic group in studies of ecology and environmental
management. Dr. Gordon Hendler, Curator of Echinoderms, proposes extensive
curatorial improvements to the collection, including installation of a high
density storage system and integration and reorganization of the newly acquired
orphaned collections. The proposed curatorial activities will increase the
availability and utilization of these important systematic reference
collections. Systematists, ecologists, and evolutionary biologists are
increasingly dependent on access to collections such as this. The continued
growth and proper curation of collections in natural history museums will yield
important research dividends in the study of biological diversity.
