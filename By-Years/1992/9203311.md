Dr. Thomas J. Meyer of the Chemistry Department, University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, will continue to study the detailed mechanisms for oxidation of
organic substrates by high oxidation state ruthenium and osmium polypyridyl
complexes. This work will be supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Chemistry Program. Of particular interest are reactions of di-oxo
complexes which can accomplish the transfer of four electrons. New compounds
will be synthesized in which the metal-oxo sites are linked by briding groups,
thus giving spatial control to the reaction. In addition, the chemistry of the
analogous imido complexes will be investigated. Special attention will be paid
to aqua to oxo conversions, so that the nature of the hydrogen transfer step,
perhaps as hydride or a proton, can be elucidated. %%% This fundamental research
is relevant to understanding the behavior of selective catalysts for organic
reactions and the development of effective industrial catalysts which utilize
atmospheric oxygen. Olefins, aromatic hydrocarbons, amines, and other classes of
compounds might be oxidized by the catalysts developed.
