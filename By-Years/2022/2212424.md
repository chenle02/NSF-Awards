With growing healthcare demands, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has grown
significantly in recent years and is dominating the healthcare industry.
However, these smarter and advanced medical devices are very complicated in
terms of software and hardware, with defects and vulnerabilities that are found
regularly and they are also vulnerable to possible malicious attacks. Healthcare
organizations are the new focus of attackers for carrying out IoMT-focused
cyberattacks, which are becoming more common. In recent years, ransomware and
distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are malware-based popular attacks
on IoMT devices. Cyberattacks and disruptions in clinical care can have a
catastrophic effect on patient safety, which trickles down to the medical
staffâ€™s responsiveness. Moreover, because different medical devices have varying
vital capabilities, it is critical to enable differentiated network services for
these devices with varying critical levels of operation under varying network
dynamics. Hence it is crucial to efficiently detect and identify any malicious
network activities to eliminate or minimize the impact of these attacks, as well
as to detect and identify network traffic belonging to different medical
devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MedKnights project will extend knowledge in
networking, machine learning, and the digital forensic domains in developing a
holistic framework that can be deployed at the network edge components and
effectively support different fine-grained security services for IoMT networks
and devices. The main objectives of the project include: (1) creating a novel
medical device testbed, IoMT network traffic datasets, IoMT device behavior
signature datasets, and attack datasets; (2) employing generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to identify many of the interesting features for medical
networks and devices, to perform multi-class classification, automatic feature
extraction, and be robust to noise, support drifts in networks, and support
continual learning for new devices for securing IoMT networks and devices; and
(3) enabling remote memory forensic capabilities for IoMT devices. The project
will also carry out a number of educational activities involving K-12,
undergraduate, and graduate students, make strong outreach efforts for
recruiting and mentoring students from underrepresented groups, as well as
enrich undergraduate and graduate curricula through exposing students to
cutting-edge research in networking, security, and machine learning. In
addition, multiple industrial collaborations are expected within the scope of
the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
