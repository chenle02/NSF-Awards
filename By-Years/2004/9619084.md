9619084 Lindgren This three year project includes 5-weeks of a mentored research
experience and a 2-week workshop to help translate the research experience into
improved classroom instruction. In year-1 ten three-teacher teams, of physics
and physical science (middle and high school) teachers, join scientists at the
University of Virginia, Jefferson National Laboratory and at six other Virginia
sites for the research experience. The workshops to facilitate transfer to the
classroom will be done at the University of Virginia-Charlottesville. In year-2
this cohort will continue their work and be joined by a new cohort of 30
teachers. Teachers may earn 8-graduate credit hours for both summers through the
University of Virginia-Charlottesville. An important feature is the field
supervisor who will track and keep in constant contact with teachers during the
summer and academic year to facilitate transfer back to the classroom. The
pedagogy and leadership workshop component will prepare teachers to conduct
workshops for their peers, improve computer networking skills, and construct
apparatus to facilitate transfer of the research experience back to the
classroom.
