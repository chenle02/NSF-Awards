This research is relative to a compartmental model of the cell growth cycle to
better understand the triggering mechanism for the initiation of DNA synthesis
and mitosis. The model was first proposed and analyzed by Busenberg and Mahffy
who showed that the increase in cell size can trigger biochemical oscillations
leading to DNA synthesis. The relation between nutrient supply and increase in
cell size is, however, now well understood. In addition, the geometrical shape
of the cell is an important factor in the triggering mechanism and so far only
the case of a spherical cell has been treated. The research will investigate the
effect of nutrient supply and the shape of the cell on the initiation of DNA
synthesis. The project furthers VPW program objectives to provide opportunities
for women to advance their careers in science or engineering through research,
and to encourage other women to pursue careers in these areas through the
investigator's enhanced visibility as a role model on the host campus. The
proposed activities which contribute to the second objective include: teaching
two sections of an elementary differential equations course, which will enable
the P.I. to interact with many students in their freshman or sophomore years;
organizing, jointly with Busenberg, a weekly Mathematical Biology Seminar;
giving a series of lectures on her own research; and inviting applied
mathematicians from other universities as guest speakers, six of whom would be
women; providing guidance and counseling, especially to women students.
