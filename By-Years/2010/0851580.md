This award funds research on four topics in evolutionary game theory and its
applications. The first project uses evolutionary game dynamics to study
residential segregation. Thomas Schelling has famously argued that a mild
preference for not being in 'the minority' can result in highly segrated
neighborhoods. Using new tools from evolutionary game theory, the investigator
constructs and analyzes a new model of location choice dynamics. Using this
model he investigates whether residential segregation is a stable outcome that
arises from a wide variety of starting conditions. He also determines whether or
not other preferences (for example, a preference for living near good schools)
increase or decrease segregation in the model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second
project examines local stability of equilibrium under deterministic evolutionary
dynamics in general population games. The third and fourth projects develop and
analyze different models of stochastic evolution based on sequential arrival of
revision opportunities and payoff noise. The PI also develops software to teach
evolutionary dynamics to undergraduates and graduate students with little
background in game theory.
