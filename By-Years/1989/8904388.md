The sodium pump is the major ion transport ATPase of animal cell plasma
membranes which energizes many vital homeostatic transport activities in cells
and organs. The first objective of the proposed research is to analyze movements
of the sodium pump on the cell surface. Through the use of synthetic peptides
and purified proteins, new antibodies will be made that react with the beta
subunit of the human enzyme. Such antibodies should bind to the enzyme on the
outside of human cells and permit quantitation of the number of sodium pump
molecules on the cell surface. These antibodies will also be used to study the
folding pattern of the beta subunit, and to study the traffic of the pump to and
from the surface of the cell. The second objective is to understand how cells
previously selected for overproduction of the sodium pump inhibit the excess
enzyme activity. Assays of subcellular fractions will attempt to localize a pool
of inhibited enzyme in the overproducing cells. Antibodies to enzyme subunits
will be used to detect alterations in subunit production or recognize protein
modifications. The combination of activity and antibody analyses is expected to
define a site inside the cells where biochemical regulatory events turn off
sodium pumps. The sodium pump is the major ion transport enzyme of animal cell
plasma membranes. It maintains a low concentration of sodium inside the cell
compared to outside, and this difference between the sodium outside and inside
provides the energy for many vital homeostatic transport activities in cells and
organs. The ability of cells to control the sodium pump activity could be
important for conserving cellular energy, controlling other membrane transport
activities, and responding to ionic stresses. This research should contribute to
our understanding of the control of cellular sodium pump activity.
