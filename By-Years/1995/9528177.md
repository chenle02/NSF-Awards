Landolt, Arlo 95-28177 Dr. Landolt will complete a career long work on
photometric standard star sequences. The goals of this effort are to establish
UBVRI sequences approaching the 21st magnitude at the celestial equator, to
establish UBVRI sequences at the +45 deg declination zone, to refine some
previously observed sequences, to compare the CCDphot and photoelectric data for
some of the +45 deg sequences, and to monitor and reduce the results for the
secondary program objects as time and resources permit. ***
