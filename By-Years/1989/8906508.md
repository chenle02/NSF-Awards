This research project addresses the role that architectural precast cladding
systems can and should play in the seismic response of building structures.
Architectural precast is often dismissed as nonstructural and does not normally
form part of either precast frame or wall-panel building construction.
Nevertheless, architectural precast panels are widely used on steel and
reinforced concrete frame buildings, and therefore this segment of the precast
industry constitutes an important part of the overall market for this type of
construction. The research explores the possible use of precast panels and their
attachments to the structure in an integrated building cladding system to
provide both increased lateral stiffness and damping for the structure as a
whole. Analytical models are formulated and laboratory tests conducted for
promising advanced connection designs that offer improved energy dissipation,
ductility and failure characteristics/modes when compared to present precast
cladding systems. Results of the project are expected to include an improved
understanding of behavior of heavy cladding systems on modern buildings during
earthquakes and the development of both conceptual models and results for
particular integrated cladding designs.
