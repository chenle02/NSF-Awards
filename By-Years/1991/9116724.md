The purpose of this grant is to send the PI and two Philippino graduate students
to the Philippines for approximately one month. Last April the volcano Pinatubo,
north of Manila on the island of Luzon began erupting for the first time in 600
years. All indications were that this was the beginning of a major eruptive
cycle which would endanger thousands of area residents including the Americans
stationed on Clark airforce base. A major danger is posed by lahars, rapid mud
flows that occur when recent volcanic ash and rock debris is mobilized by
monsoon rains or other sources of water. The PI is an expert on Philippine
lahars, having studied them with NSF support for several years on Mt. Mayon, and
the two grad students have also had experience on Mayon. Their presence at
Pinatubo during the actual eruption will be invaluable on two counts; valuable
data and samples will be obtained which could not be after the eruption ceases,
and their knowledge and advice will important in limiting the loss of life and
property should the eruption continue as is expected. Therefore a small grant
for experimental research (SGER) award of $8,500 is recommended which will cover
their airfare and some subsistance during their anticipated stay in the
Philippines.
