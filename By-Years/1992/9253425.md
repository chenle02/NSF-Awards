We propose to develop conceptual frameworks, system architectures, and domain-
oriented knowledge-based design environments in support of learning on demand.
Our approach will exploit the power of high-functionality computer systems in a
project-oriented learning environment for under-graduate students (in computer
science as well as in other related disciplines). We will place special emphasis
on integrating working and learning and on supporting self- directed and group
learning; we will study and evaluate these issues in a naturalistic setting.
