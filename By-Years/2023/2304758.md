Concurrent search structures are data structures and parallel algorithms that
provide fast access to key-value pairs on multicore and distributed servers. The
parallel algorithms perform fine-grained synchronization between threads, making
them notoriously difficult to design correctly. Indeed, bugs have been found
both in actual implementations and in the designs proposed by experts in peer-
reviewed publications. The rapid development and deployment of these concurrent
algorithms has resulted in a rift between the algorithms that can be verified by
the state-of-the-art techniques and those being developed and used today. The
project's novelties are new reasoning principles and accompanying static program
analyses techniques for verifying concurrent search structures that will close
this rift. The project's impacts are an increase in the reliability of software
systems by verifying the highly complex concurrent data structures found in real
world applications. The project's outcome includes a modular library of verified
concurrent search structure algorithms. That is, a user will be able to freely
choose both the search structure (e.g., linked list, B-tree, hash table, Log
Structured Merge-tree) and the synchronization algorithm (e.g., lock-based,
lock-free, or a mixture of the two). Verified code will result. Finally, the
developed program logic and accompanying static analyses apply to program
verification broadly, beyond concurrent search structures.

The research rests on two key ingredients. The first is that concurrent data
structures can be described by template algorithms that dictate how threads
interact but abstract away from the structure's concrete memory layout. Thus,
the same template can apply to diverse data structures such as hash structures,
B-trees, and lists. Once a template algorithm is verified, its proof can be
instantiated on individual data structures. The second ingredient, the flow
framework, is crucial for verifying the template algorithms. The flow framework
provides a separation logic-based abstraction mechanism that allows one to
reason about global inductive invariants of general graphs in a local manner,
while abstracting from low-level heap representations. The project addresses the
following specific research challenges: (i) how to automatically construct
linearizability proofs for concurrent data structure operations whose
linearization points depend on future interferences by other threads; (ii) how
to automatically infer data structure invariants that are expressed in terms of
the flow framework; and (iii) how to construct new template algorithms for lock-
free, as well as mixed lock-based and lock-free concurrent data structures.
