A high-purity germanium detector system and PC-based multichannel analyzers have
been added to the Nuclear Instruments and Methods Laboratory course to upgrade
and improve it. The germanium detector gives students experience with modern
high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy, and enables them to undertake more
advanced experiments. The PC-based multichannel analyzers make it possible for
students to execute experiments and data analysis at levels of sophistication
common to research laboratories today.
