The WiMAX technology (IEEE 802.16) can provide high-speed and long-range
wireless communications for a large variety of applications. Smart antennas,
such as Digital Adaptive Array (DAA) and Multiple Input and Multiple Output
(MIMO) antennas, can offer a long transmission range and improve network
capacity via interference suppression and spatial multiplexing. The objective of
this project is to provide a comprehensive networking solution for a WiMAX mesh
network with smart antennas by investigating the fundamental problems, including
scheduling, routing and relay station placement. Specifically, their
computational complexities will be investigated, and efficient and standard-
compliant algorithms and protocols will be proposed to solve them. The PI will
also develop a relay station model in the OPNET Modeler, and a DAA antenna based
testbed to evaluate and validate the proposed
solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The algorithms and protocols proposed in this
project can be applied in the WiMAX product development and are expected to
impact the standardization activities in IEEE and IETF. The relay station model
and the testbed can be used by other researchers for evaluation and validation.
Moreover, the proposed research activities will complement and enrich the
curriculum on wireless communications and networking.&lt;br/&gt;
