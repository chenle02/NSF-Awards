This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports acquisition of
an automated susceptibility core logging system and a field free-space. The
equipment will support a range of paleoclimatological investigations on core
material already collected from the Central High Plain aquifer and regional
paleosols and modern soils. The equipment will complement existing paleomagnetic
equipment at this minority serving undergraduate institution and support student
experiential learning with modern techniques in paleomagnetic analysis and data
interpretation.
