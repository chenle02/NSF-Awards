This award supports the participation of mathematicians based in the United
States in the program "Model Theory, Combinatorics, and Valued Fields" at the
Insitut Henri Poincare during the period 8 January 2018 to 6 April 2018. The
program includes four specialized week-long conferences, "Model Theory,
Combinatorics, and Valued Fields" at CIRM 8 - 12 January 2018; "Model Theory and
Combinatorics" at IHP 29 January 2018 - 2 February 2018; "Model Theory and
Valued Fields" at IHP 5 - 9 March 2018; and "Model Theory and Applications" at
IHP 26 - 30 March 2018.

The main themes of this program are model theory and its applications to
combinatorics (including such topics as additive combinatorics, variations of
the Szemeredi regularity and density theorems, Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory, NIP
theories and tame structures), model theory of valued fields (including such
topics as henselian fields, motivic integration, Berkovich spaces, and
transseries), and applications of model theory in geometry, analysis and number
theory.
