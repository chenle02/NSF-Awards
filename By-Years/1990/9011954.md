Under the direction of Professor Sarunas Milisauskas, Mr. Hugh Jarvis, a
graduate student at SUNY Buffalo, will conduct field and laboratory research to
collect data for his doctoral dissertation. As part of a larger archaeological
project, he will address the question of how late prehistoric hunters and
gatherers adapted to harsh desert-like conditions. Over a decade of research in
the Zeekoe valley of South Africa has provided an excellent data base which maps
approximately 16,000 lithic scatters which are the result of prehistoric
activities. On this basis archaeologists have attempted to reconstruct human use
of this landscape and document how it changed over time. In particular they wish
to know how human groups were organized. Mr. Jarvis will examine this question
through the analysis of hornfel, a locally available mineral which was used to
make stone tools. Hornfel outcrops are widespread within the valley and
preliminary work indicates that many are chemically distinct. Mr. Jarvis will
conduct an extensive geological collection program and use neutron activation
analysis to distinguish among sources. He will then similarly characterize stone
tools from a number of archaeological sites. A comparison of tools to sources
will provide a basis to determine how people moved over and subdivided the
landscape and, thus, elucidate social organization. This research is important
for several reasons. It will increase our understanding of how groups at simple
technological levels adapt to harsh and unpredictable environments. It will also
help to develop a general technique which should prove useful in a wide variety
of archaeological situations. Finally, it will assist in the training of an
extremely promising young scientist.
