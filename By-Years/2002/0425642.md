Riparian (i.e., stream side) forests are known to restrict light availability
and plant growth in streams while providing organic matter that fuels stream
food webs. Lateral interactions of this type generate intimate links between
terrestrial and aquatic systems. There are equally strong upstream and
downstream linkages within streams. By altering the linkages between terrestrial
and aquatic elements, forest harvest is a disturbance that influences both
hillslope and stream subsystems of watershed landscapes. Riparian processes may
dictate how hillslope disturbance influences streams. In this project, the
investigators address how interactions between riparian vegetation and streams
influence stream responses to forest clear-cutting. They focus on the role of
riparian vegetation through comparative studies among watersheds where clear-
cutting will remove upslope vegetation but leave riparian zones of differing
widths. Two research elements are designed to, 1) address how riparian
vegetation buffers disturbance to the stream and organizes lateral linkages
between terrestrial and lotic ecosystems, and 2) quantify in-stream gradients or
'recovery distances' when different widths of riparian vegetation remain after
forest harvest. Response variables include aspects of the stream's physical
template (sediment, light, heat), organic matter dynamics (leaf breakdown),
biogeochemistry (nutrient composition and concentration), and biotic
composition.&lt;br/&gt;search. The project will interact directly with members
of the NSF Coweeta LTER program and further development of the research and
education infrastructure. Finally, results will advance our understanding of
disturbance and its influences, link research and policy formation, and address
manager's concerns for southern Appalachian watersheds.&lt;br/&gt;
