This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at the University of
Massachusetts at Boston to give ten undergraduate students the opportunity to
participate in research projects in ecology and conservation biology. Students
will be recruited intensively in the Boston area and also elsewhere in New
England. The two major components of the program are complementary: 1) a series
of lectures/discussions for all the students, and 2) individual research
projects in which each student is closely associated with an advisor/mentor.
Initial group meetings that address the theory and practice of research continue
as weekly meetings at which students focus on topics that relate to the conduct
of research or its implications. Students will also visit one or more field
sites and learn directly about each others' projects. A small hands-on workshop
on molecular techniques will show the great potential of such methods for
ecology. An end-of-session retreat at the University Field Station will serve to
articulate impressions and explore philosophical issues. Seven potential
research topics will be suggested, some of which can effectively involve two or
more undergraduates. The topics are focussed on issues of biodiversity and
conservation ecology but are intentionally diverse to illustrate several
approaches. They include three on the behavioral ecology of rare/endangered
vertebrates, and others on the physiological ecology of hawkmoths, the diversity
of naphthalene-degrading bacteria, the genetics of endangered plants, and the
genetic diversity of deep-sea molluses. At the end of the session each student
will prepare a written report and present a short paper in a mini-conference.
