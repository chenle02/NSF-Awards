Understanding how animals and plants interact with microorganisms is critically
important to basic biology, agriculture, and medicine. Obligate beneficial
symbioses refer to interactions where a microorganism can only live in a
particular animal or plant, and reciprocally the animal or plant can only
survive if the microorganism is present. Most known beneficial symbionts of
insects are bacteria. However, another large and important symbiotic association
occurs between a family of viruses named the Polydnaviridae and parasitoid
wasps, which parasitize and consume other types of insects. This biology makes
parasitoid wasps very important control agents of insects, including many
species that are economically harmful to humans. Polydnavirus-carrying wasps can
survive in wasps only if they introduce the virus into parasitized hosts. Recent
results from the PI's laboratory indicate that polydnaviruses function in
parasitized hosts by rapidly integrating their DNA genomes into the genome of
the host. However, the mechanism by which this integration event occurs is
unknown. The goal of this project is to understand how polydnavirus-mediated
integration occurs. This project will characterize the location in the host
genome where the viral genome inserts itself. Functional experiments will also
be conducted to identify the molecules that control the integration process. In
addition to enhancing understanding of polydnaviruses, wasps and hosts, the
proposed research will provide insights into a new mechanism of moving genes
from one organism to another. The work will promote scientific training and
education by providing independent research opportunities for postdoctoral,
graduate and undergraduate students. Results from the study will also be used to
enhance classroom instruction at the high school and university level.
