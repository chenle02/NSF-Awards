Thomas Beck of the University of Cincinnati is supported by the Division of
Chemistry through the Information and Technology Research (ITR) program. He will
develop multiscale algorithms for density functional theory, and apply them to
computations of current-voltage curves for a range of prototype organic
molecules which have been proposed for realistic device applications.

The computing revolution of the last twenty years has been driven by the
continued miniaturization of electronic components. Therefore it is of great
interest to develop molecular computing devices. In this research, electron
transport in synthetic organic molecules proposed as prototype molecular wires
will be investigated via accurate quantum chemical calculations.
