Technical Abstract: The Chemical Catalysis Program supports the efforts of
Professor Li Jia of the University of Akron for the investigation of the cobalt-
catalyzed, carbonylative polymerization of heterocycles (e.g., aziridines) and
heteroalkenes (C=O and C=N bonds). The research focuses on understanding the
mechanisms of these processes and developing efficient synthetic methods for
preparing both commodity and functional polymers. The process, which could lead
to new classes of aliphatic polyesters, remains unexplored. The key to realizing
the polymerization appears to be the activation of the acyl-cobalt bond.
Nucleophilic and bifunctional organic co-catalysts with nucleophilicity and
latent Lewis acidity will be used to accomplish the metal-carbon bond
activation. The polymerization reactions developed in this project are powerful
tools for the synthesis of tailor-made polymers for biomedical materials and
environmentally friendly plastics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Abstract:
The Chemical Catalysis Program supports the efforts of Professor Li Jia of the
University of Akron for the investigation of novel, catalytic copolymerizations
of aldehydes and carbon monoxide (i.e, the carbonylative polymerization of
aldehydes). The research focuses on the rational design of catalytic cycles that
utilize inexpensive starting materials derived from non-petroleum sources. This
high risk research effort may result in the high reward, commercial development
of degradable polymers. The products of the reaction, aliphatic polyesters, have
a wide range of applications as specialty and commodity plastics. The research
activity trains students and postdoctoral associates at the interface of
organic, inorganic and polymer chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;
