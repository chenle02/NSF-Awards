The objectives of the research proposed are, a) to provide a better
understanding of the role that interactions between spanning segments of a
membrane protein play in membrane insertion and folding, and b) to help
characterize the cellular metabolism of mutant membrane proteins. The studies
will use Escherichia coli lac permease as a model to analzye whether spanning
segment interactions contribute to the membrane translocation of two of the
protein's periplasmic domains. This analysis will include: a) developing an
assay for the periplasmic localization of individual domains of unfused lac
permease. b) the role of interactions in the folding of the topological
structure (identifying missense changes in part of the protein (tm9-tm12) that
alter folding). This research will also investigate two phenomena involving
mutant membrane proteins. First, the production of altered membrane proteins is
commonly toxic to cells, perhaps due to abnormal interaction with the membrane
itself or the membrane insertion apparatus. Isolating mutants reducing this
toxicity will help identify its source. Second, altered membrane proteins are
often rapidly degraded by cellular proteases; Mutant screens can identify the
protease or proteases responsible for this instability. %%% Cells are surrounded
by membranes which protect them from the outside environment while allowing
inward passage of nutrients. Membranes are composed mainly of a combination of
lipid and protein molecules. The research proposed investigates the mechanisms
used by cells to assemble membranes by examining how proteins are inserted into
them in the appropriate functional structures. The research will analyze mutant
forms of one particular membrane protein (lactose permease of the bacterium
Escherichia coli) which should show aberrant insertion. The patterns of altered
insertion should provide insights into the normal membrane assembly process.
