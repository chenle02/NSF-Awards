This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will investigate
the use of a fast switching ferroelectric liquid crystal structure, particularly
in the inverse twisted smetic structure (ITSS) to make a polarization
insensitive diffraction grating structure. This will be done using the high tilt
ferroelectric liquid crystal material. In this program two different approaches
will be explored to make a polarization insensitive beam deflector. In one
approach, a fast switching ferroelectric liquid crystal in combination with
doped cross-linking agents will be used to make a switchable grating without the
use of holography. A second approach will make the polarization insensitive
structures using patterned alignment layers. The optimal method will be
identified for further development and implementation.

Commercially these diffractive structures are expected to form the basis of
optical attenuators as well as beam steering devices. Although several
applications, such as optical light attenuators for the telecommunications
industry can be expected, the ultimate application as always will depend on the
performance of the device.
