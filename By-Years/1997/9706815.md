9706815 Wuttig This is a renewal grant for quantitative studies of the evolution
of the martensitic phase in constrained thin films with an emphasis on the
martensitic transformation at constant strain. Much is known already about this
transformation as it occurs at constant stress and, of course, normally the
differences in mechanical behavior of materials under conditions of constant
stress and strain are not very large. This is not the case for the martensitic
transformation, where a special kind of pseudo-elasticity can occur. The studies
build on results and experiences gained during the previous three-year NSF
grant. Specifically, the evolution of the two phase state, alpha prime and
gamma, is investigated by examining the simultaneous evolution of the
microstructure, stress and modulus of single crystalline shape memory alloy
(SMA) films on a substrate which serves to constrain this state. Microstructural
evolution is modeled and the results are compared to the experimentally observed
mesoscopic two-phase structure and related macroscopic stresses and pseudo-
elastic moduli. It is expected that complete closure will be achieved leading to
an understanding of the evolution of the martensitic phase transformation in
constrained films on the mesoscale. The studies focus initially on NiTi films.
In later stages of the research other systems, such as ternary FeNi-based
alloys, Ni-free SMAs, FePt, FePd and Cu- based SMA alloys will be investigated.

film actuators based on shape memory concepts. ***
