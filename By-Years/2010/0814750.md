This project would use a sample of Wisconsin families to study the role parents
play in increasing students' perception of the utility of science as a means for
increasing student participation in high school science courses. The researchers
are collecting survey data on high school students and their parents in a sample
of students ages 11, 13, and 15. These survey data will be used with prior
information from the families in a longitudinal survey to examine some
hypotheses about the use of parents? knowledge of the value of high school math
and science courses on student choices.

Previous research by the investigators has demonstrated that programs that focus
on the value of a course leads to increased interest and enhanced performance
for students in high school and college. The research would to study parent?s
knowledge of the utility value of high school M&S courses and their ability to
convey it. It is a three-year longitudinal study and an experimental study on
parent?s information. The study would be made of 166 families with a child who
completed data collection at 9th grade. A random assignment will be made so that
some parents receive professional training on how to discuss course taking with
their students. Parents and students will be followed up in 9 months and in 2
years to assess the impact on course taking.
