This project allows the chemistry students at Truman College their first
opportunity to use contemporary, computer interfaced scientific instrumentation
in their organic and analytical chemistry laboratories. This instrument, a
Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), gives the students a powerful
tool to enhance their skills when using microscale organic chemistry laboratory
experiments. The FT-IR allows fast, accurate identification of organic compounds
when enhanced with computer interfaced data acquisition and interpretation
capabilities. Use of this instrumentation enables our student population to
acquire the laboratory skills necessary to compete successfully when they
transfer to baccalaureate programs or seek professional employment. The
institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
