This grant supports theoretical studies of specific mechanisms responsible for
supernovae explosions. Hydrodynamics code will be used for detailed simulations.
Some of the topics to be studied are the role of dense matter equations of
state, predictions of neutrino fluxes and spectra, the influence of neutrino
processes on cooling, supernovae collapse and neutron star formation.
