This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). In recent years, graphics processing units( GPUs)have
emerged as a powerful alternative to CPU based computing, especially for
scientific computing. However, GPUs follow the stream programming model. It is
completely different from traditional serial programming and requires the
invention of entirely news set of algorithms to suit the architecture.

This project supports research into data-parallel algorithms to model multi-
scale phenomena in biological systems using agent-based models (ABMs). ABMs
capture system level behaviors of complex systems by simulating the local
interactions of individual entities or agents. This project funds the
acquisition of two graphics processing unit (GPU) racks and software development
to support application of the previously developed algorithms in systems
biology.
