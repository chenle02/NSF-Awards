Professor Paul Barbara is supported by a grant from the Throretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to conduct experimental studies of ultrafast
chemical dynamics in polar solvents. Four specific areas of research are
planned: 1) an investigation of the vibrational relaxation in small radical
anions in polar solvents; 2) the evolution of reactant electronic structure
during a chemical reaction; 3) the dynamical coupling of proton and solvent
motion in reacting systems; and 4) the role of quantum solvent nuclear degrees
of freedom in charge-transfer reactions. %%% Since many commercially important
chemical reactions take place in polar solvents such as water, it is important
to understand the influence which such solvents have on the reaction dynamics. A
number of effects, such as solvent cage effects, vibrational relaxation and
quantum mechanical tunneling, which are not present in the gas phase completely
dominate condensed phase chemical reactions. It is important to develop reliable
theories for model chemical systems which can then be applied to improving the
efficiency of commercially important chemical reactions. The work which is being
performed by Barbara provides an important experimental basis for the
development of such theories.
