With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation Program,
Professor Isaac VonRue from King's College and colleagues Julie Belanger, Karen
Vavrek, Ronald Supkowski and Trent Snider will acquire a differential scanning
calorimeter (DSC). The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at
all levels, especially in areas such as (a) polymer science for polymer
characterization to investigate thermoreversible gelation and measure glass
transition and melting temperatures of new polymers; (b) biochemistry for
characterization of new lipids and liposomes; and (c) silica characterization
for catalyst science to study water molecules that are chemically and physically
attached to the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DSC instrument
allows the measurement of the difference in the amount of heat required to
increase the temperature of a sample and reference as a function of temperature.
This technique provides information on the chemical composition of various
materials. The basic principle for this technique is that when a sample
undergoes a physical transformation such as melting or freezing more or less
heat will need to flow to it than the reference to maintain both at the same
temperature. Whether less or more heat must flow to the sample depends on
whether the process releases or needs heat (exothermic or endothermic processes,
respectively). The instrument measures the heat flux versus temperature or
versus time. This information can be used to calculate enthalpies of the
processes. The instrumentation will be used not only in research but also in
research training and teaching of undergraduate students.
