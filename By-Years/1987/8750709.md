Cartography, the art and science of map making is rapidly converting to
computerized, digital data bases and highly interactive computer graphic
displays. The Cartography and Map Technology Program is taking significant steps
towards computerizing the map-making process taught to students. A mini-computer
graphics system is being used in two separate ways: for teaching interactive map
design; and in teaching data base concepts necessary in handling map data bases.
The system includes graphics work stations with digitizers and controllers as
well as a color hardcopy device to print the maps being produced. Since
cartographic data represents some of the largest, most complex, and rapidly
changing data bases, an advanced graphics computer system is helping students
acquire the theoretical and practical knowledge necessary for dealing with
mapping problems in the future.
