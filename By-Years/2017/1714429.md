This research project aims to further our understanding of cardiac arrhythmias
by analysing the properties of spiral waves, which are anomalous electrochemical
waves in cardiac tissue that may lead to fibrillation. A particular focus will
be on studying how robust spiral waves behave under spatial perturbations in
specific model systems. In addition, the principal investigator will study the
role of different mechanisms that can lead to complex spatio-temporal dynamics
in models of cardiac tissue. The project will include research activities that
will train both graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project focuses on the spectral and linear stability of spiral waves in
reaction-diffusion systems. Building on earlier work in one spatial dimension,
the goal is to elucidate spatio-temporal responses to spatial perturbations of
spiral waves in the core and far field. The main approach will involve deriving
estimates of the resolvent kernel using spatial dynamics and the construction of
the spatio-temporal Green's function about a spiral wave. The second part of the
project will focus on an analytical approach to backfiring and pulse-splitting
in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model using steady-state approximations and geometric
singular perturbation theory.
