The use of in-situ produced cosmogenic helium to measure surface exposure ages
has many applications in the earth sciences. Because 3He is stable and has a
high production rate (by cosmic ray spallation), it can be used to measure the
ages of both young (~ kyr) and old (~myr) surfaces. However, there are a number
of important problems that must be addressed. Most important, it is critical to
have accurate determination of the production rate as a function of latitude,
altitude and depth and time. The acquisition of new data from young radiocarbon
dated lava flows will help constrain the reason for the apparent 3He production
rate changes during the last 10 ka (which may be partly due to dipole moment
fluctuations). In addition, it is critical to know diffusion rates to assess the
importance of diffusive helium loss. This proposal seeks funds to address these
problems with new measurements of dated lava flows and glacial moraines,
production rate experiments, and diffusion measurements. The combination of
field work and laboratory experiments proposed is critical to evaluating the
precision of the technique, the basic assumptions involved, and for developing
surface exposure dating for use in geomorphology, glacial geology, volcanology,
and archaeology.
