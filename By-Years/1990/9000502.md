The School of Oceanography at University of Washington will acquire components
for a modern six-channel autoanalyzer that will be placed in a pool of shared
use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with
research vessels operated by the University. The instrument- ation will also
increase the capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support research
and engineering activities. This new device will replace existing and outmoded
equipment that is no longer serviceable and will be operated as a shared use
facility. The instrument provides rapid and accurate measurements of several
nutrients and chemical constituents in seawater samples. Such measurements are
important in modern oceanographic and marine biological investigations. The
instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the University
to support NSF-sponsored research, engineering, and education projects.
