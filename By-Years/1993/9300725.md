The investigator will conduct research on empirical processes, U-processes,
their bootstrap and some of their applications in statistics. The limit theory
for degenerate U- processes has not yet reached a satisfactory stage, and the
bootstrap of U-processes, degenerate or not, is far from being resolved. The
applications include asymptotic theory as well as uniqueness and robustness
properties of the empirical simplicial median. Open questions for U-statistics,
such as almost sure convergence to zero of sums of normalized products of random
variables will also be considered. Modern empirical process theory, developed
during the last twenty years and not yet totally completed, not only sheds light
on one of the basic questions in Statistics (namely, how well do sample
properties approach population properties) but has been providing a high road to
the study of important problems in asymptotic statistics. U--processes, a non-
linear generalization of empirical processes, should play a similar, although
more restricted, role. We propose to continue work on empirical and U--processes
and their bootstraps, and to investigate some applications, such as to
multidimensional robust location parameters.
