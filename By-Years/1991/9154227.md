A laboratory workshop based on recent Nobel experiments is being offered for
undergraduate faculty from two-and four-year colleges throughout the nation.
Participants in this four-week long, summer workshop carry out up to four
experiments based on seven recent Nobel prizes: 1987 Nobel Prize for High
Temperature Superconductivity; 1986 Nobel Prize for the Scanning Tunneling
Microscope; 1983 Nobel Prize for Nuclear Reactions and Nucleo-synthesis; the
1981 Nobel Prizes for Electron Spectroscopy, Non-Linear Optics, and Laser
Spectroscopy; and the 1977 Nobel Prize for the Quantum Nature of Solids. The
"Nobel" Workshop offers participants "hands-on" laboratory experience using up-
to-date instrumentation purchased with a recent ILI Grant from NSF. Participants
interact daily with local and national experts in the various topic areas of
Modern Physics, and work to develop instructional materials for teaching the
physics concepts to science students. Continued contact with the participants
will be maintained through a newsletter and electronic mail. The intellectual
stimulation and personal involvement experienced by the participants help them
to relay the excitement of science to students at their home institutions.
