The project's objective is to establish a suite of five state-of-the-art
optical instruments near the Poker Flat Research Range near Fairbanks, Alaska.
This entails acquiring, calibrating, installing, and commissioning the
instruments, the main components of which will be purchased from commercial
vendors. Efforts will be made to minimize size and weight of the instruments to
allow for ease of portability as well as establishing capabilities for remote
operations. The imagers will be used to investigate the two-dimensional emission
characteristics of upper atmospheric phenomena, including both fine-scale and
large-scale auroral structures, as well as airglow, OH emissions, and possibly
metal layer emissions. The science objectives to be pursued center on aspects of
magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling; specifically, two questions will be
addressed: (1.) Can electron acceleration processes by determined by use of 2-D
emission profiles at 3 or 4 selected wavelengths? (2.) How accurately can
ground-based optical measurements be used to quantify in situ ionospheric wave
processes, including Alfven waves, enhanced ion-acoustic waves, broad-band
extremely low frequency waves and ultra low frequency waves? The images obtained
during the project will be made available to the community through a web-based
application.
