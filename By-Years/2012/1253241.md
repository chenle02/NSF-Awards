Since maize (corn) is one of the most important and productive agricultural
crops both in the United States and world wide, a clear understanding of maize
leaf development could inform attempts to improve productivity. Critical gaps,
however, remain towards understanding how leaves initiate during the earliest
stages of growth. In this project, genes that control leaf initiation will be
identified by investigating maize mutants that fail to suppress leaves after the
reproductive transition. Reproductive leaf (or bract) suppression presents a
promising means to identify genes acting in the earliest stages of leaf
initiation. The project will use genome-wide techniques identify the network of
genes that are regulating maize bract outgrowth. Since bract suppression has
evolved multiple times, these results should also shed light on the evolution of
developmental mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to increase public
understanding of evolutionary mechanisms, the project will develop novel
curriculum and assessment materials designed identify and address misconception
related to evolutionary thinking. Specifically, an assessment that can reveal
common misconceptions related to evolutionary trees will be developed, and
future high school teachers will be trained to teach biological diversity from
an evolutionary framework. The ability to interpret evolutionary trees is key to
biological literacy, but the necessary skills are rarely taught and often poorly
understood by high school teachers. Ten future teachers and one biology
education graduate student involved in this project will be given state of the
art training in the nature of science and be uniquely qualified to address this
hole in the evolution curriculum.
