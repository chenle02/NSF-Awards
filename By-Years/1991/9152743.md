The National Undergraduate Research Observatory (NURO) is a consortium of 11
primarily undergraduate institutions who have joined together to encourage more
students to go into science by introducing them to state-of-the-art research.
The focus of NURO is a 31-inch telescope belonging to Lowell Observatory and
located near Flagstaff, Arizona. The consortium, directed from Northern Arizona
University, is using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and associated
computing equipment to make astronomical observations in courses and for student
research, particularly the monitoring of supernova light curves and the
determination of obits of faint asteroids.
