This award will establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site in the
Department of Sociology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The program is
designed to provide undergraduate sociology majors attending academic
institutions in the Northern Great Plains region with a ten-week research
experience in sociology. The primary objective of the program is to provide a
high-quality research experience to students who have limited access to research
facilities and training at the schools they are attending and to minority
students (racial, ethnic, women, and the physically disabled). Using the
facilities of the Bureau of Sociological Research and under the guidance of
faculty directors, students will initiate and carry out research projects from
formulating the problem to writing a final report. Students will participate in
morning seminars where they will learn research methods and share their ongoing
experiences with each other. Under the supervision of faculty members and a
Graduate Research Assistant, afternoons will be spent engaging in individual
projects and learning to use appropriate research technologies. A recruiting
plan that takes advantages of an existing statewide network of sociologists at
Nebraska colleges, and which will be expanded to included the entire Northern
Great Plains region, will be used to locate and recruit qualified students to
ensure success of the REU summer program.
