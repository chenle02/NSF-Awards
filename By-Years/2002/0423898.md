The project will develop a method to visually identify each of the ten
chromosomes of maize. A set of probes that localize to specific sites on each
chromosome and that produce a specific pattern of fluorescence will be
generated. Once this method is optimized, the variation of karyotypes
(chromosome images) among diverse maize germplasm and closely related species
will be determined. The types of organelle genome transfer to the nucleus in
these materials will be established. The karyotyping system will be used to
examine the nature of genome size variation in hybrid plants by determination of
changes in quantity of repetitive sequence arrays at different locations in the
genome. Primed in situ labeling coupled with polymerase chain reaction
amplification will be adapted for maize chromosomes and used to test the ability
to detect specific subclasses of repeated sequences as well as the visualization
of individual genes and introduced genes. Chromosome painting probes will be
developed from diverse sources and used to label the chromosomes with multiple
colors as an aid to detection of subtle changes in chromosome structure.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of a robust chromosome identification
system will enhance studies of maize genomics. With the ability to identify each
chromosome, determinations of changes in chromosome number and structure can be
easily made. Investigations that examine chromosome behavior or rearrangement
will be greatly facilitated. Variations in gene structure in different lines of
maize can be visualized using primed in situ polymerase chain reaction
amplification. The completion of this project will reveal new knowledge about
chromosome structure, organelle genome transfer, the behavior and variation of
repetitive sequences and the evolution of the genome.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access to project outcomes&lt;br/&gt;The results will be
presented in publications and a project website that will be linked to the
MaizeGDB database.&lt;br/&gt;
