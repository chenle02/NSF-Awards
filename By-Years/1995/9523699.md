This project will investigate a linear stage of the plasma wave generation in
the ionosphere-plasmasphere system due to the presence of superthermal
electrons. The PI will continue to develop a kinetic theory of superthermal
electrons in the ionosphere and plasmasphere. Project goals will be accomplished
through exploration of: (1) a numerical study of the non-steady- state
Boltzmann-Landau kinetic equation for superthermal electrons in the ionosphere
and plasmasphere along open and closed geomagnetic field lines, (2) the non-
steady-state coupling of the superthermal electrons in a new time-dependent 20
moment transport model of multispecies low-B plasma flows, (3) an
electrodynamical aspect of the non-steady-state transport of superthermal
electrons, and (4) the linear theory of plasma wave generation in the
ionosphere-plasmasphere system due to the presence of superthermal electrons.***
