This grant supports research by Drs. Peter Pesch and Nicholas Sanduleak based on
observations made with Case Western Reserve University's Burrell Schmidt
telescope, located on Kitt Peak in Arizona, and with the Curtis Schmidt, located
at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The principal survey now being
carried out is a very fruitful search for faint blue and/or emission line
galaxies, quasi-stellar objects with and without emission features, probable
blue stars, main-sequence late B and A stars, Population II stars of types A and
F, F and G subdwarfs, and faint carbon and late M type stars. Exploratory
observations with a charge coupled device on the Burrell Schmidt are planned to
determine what direct and spectroscopic observational programs would be
worthwhile to undertake. Investigations of galactic structure and the
distribution of extragalactic objects require surveys to identify the objects
which will be studied in detail. Surveys over large parts of the sky are
especially important for studies of the population distribution in our galaxy to
determine the different characteristics towards the nucleus, halo and
anticenter. The surveys conducted by these researchers at Case Western are a
vital first step to detailed follow-on investigations.
