This award supports the work of a group of seven researchers, Sergey Bravyi,
Matthew Hastings, Bruno Nachtergaele, Robert Sims, Shannon Starr, Barbara
Terhal, and Horng-Tzer Yau, on three clusters of problems in the mathematical
theory of quantum spin systems. The first cluster, locality and Lieb-Robinson
bounds, spin diffusion, and large-spin asymptotics, is aimed at improving
understanding of quantum lattice dynamics. The second cluster focuses on ground
state properties: area laws for the local entropy and entanglement, the spectral
gap above the ground state and its relation with the behavior of correlation
functions, and the quality of approximation of ground states by matrix product
states. The third cluster contains a number of questions in computational
complexity theory: computational complexity classes, QMA-completeness, the
connection between gapped Hamiltonians and complexity, and the computational
power of stoquastic Hamiltonians, all of which relate to quantum spin systems.

Condensed matter physicists, mathematical physicists, functional analysts,
workers in quantum computation, and computer scientists recently have begun to
discover the close relationships that exist between several of the important
questions in their respective fields. A small number of key properties about
quantum spin Hamiltonians, the dynamics they generate, and their ground states
are the main ingredients needed to address questions about the physical behavior
of quantum spin models, about the computational efficiency of numerical
algorithms to compute ground state properties and simulate dynamics, and about
new complexity classes that are emerging in the theory of quantum computation.
This project brings together experts in condensed matter physics, functional
analysis and spectral theory, probability theory, and computer science to
develop a coherent mathematical theory that clarifies the interrelationships of
these key properties and, in particular, their relevance for the emerging field
of quantum complexity theory in the context of quantum computation.
