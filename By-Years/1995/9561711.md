This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at an
important issue in environmentally conscious manufacturing - design for
disassembly (DFD). In a product's disassembly stage, parts are separated and
sorted based on their environmental characteristics, or the ability to reuse,
recycle, treat, or dispose of them. Successful product reuse or recycling can be
achieved with the appropriate disassembly analysis methodology and software
tools. This Phase I will formulate an economical disassembly model in a
realistic manner based on a detailed understanding of the disassembly process
and its cost drivers. An efficient and effective solution procedure will then be
sought to solve the model. Finally, a Windows-based software environment will be
developed to implement the methodology. Results of the disassembly analysis will
include the following information for an assembly design: the optimum
disassembly sequence; the terminating disassembly point (part) in the sequence;
and the maximum net profit. As no commercial design for disassembly systems are
on the market, the potential applications of the proposed project are promising.
Based on the results and observations of this research, commercial DFD software
systems will be developed for product reuse and recycling analysis. Ultimate, a
commercial decision support system will be developed for environmentally
conscious manufacturing.
