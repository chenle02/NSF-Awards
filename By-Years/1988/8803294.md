This is a continuation of ongoing research into the possibility of
automatically generating user interfaces for interactive computer systems. The
approach taken is to specify an interface formally as a relation between a
source object (such as some information in an application program) and a view
object (such as a graphical image on the computer's screen). This relation is
implemented as a "filter"--a program which can satisfy some con- straint on the
two objects it relates. Filters are bidirectional: if the source changes, the
view must be updated; if the view is edited, the system must find a
corresponding change to the source to keep the constraint satisfied. In previous
work the investigators developed a formal theory of filters and a language for
defining user interfaces in such terms. They now seek to refine and extend their
ideas and test them in a variety of applications. Success in this project would
lead to faster and easier construction of computer systems which are precisely
tailored to specific needs and yet uniform in the way they interact with a user.
The learning and use of ever more powerful and complex systems would be
facilitated.
