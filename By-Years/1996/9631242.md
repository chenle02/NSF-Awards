This program is addressing the lack of participation in science, engineering,
and math endeavors by rural middle school girls, and should serve as a model for
programs in rural settings throughout the nation. It will provide rural
Mississippi girls with hands-on experiences with computer hardware and software,
a nurturing environmental in which to build problem-solving skills, a network of
other girls interested in SEM studies, and exposure to a variety of female role
models who are pursuing SEM careers. Program activities feature an intensive
weeklong stay on the University of Mississippi campus; monthly programs at the
girls schools continuing through the school year; electronic mentoring form
university women in computer science, and a capstone weekend back on campus. A
complementary program for teachers will emphasize the need for gender equity in
science and math teaching; and establishing a support network of middle school
teachers and university faculty committed to inspiring girls to succeed at SEM
Major program goals are that: participants will understand SEM concepts, and
develop improved critical thinking abilities and problem-solving skills through
cooperative, discovery- oriented activities, participants will gain self
confidence in their science and mathematics abilities and their overall
competence, participants will be motivated to participate fully in science,
engineering and mathematics education and to consider SEM careers, and teachers
will develop contacts, and revitalize and recommit their efforts to promote
gender equity in SEM at their schools Significant spill-over effects should be
expected on other groups: teachers who participate along with the girls;
families of girls involved in the program, and other girls at the participating
schools.
