Large-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks pose an imminent threat
to the availability of critical Internet-based operations, as demonstrated by
recent incidents that brought down a number of highly popular web services such
as Twitter, Spotify and Reddit. While several solutions to counter DDoS attacks
have been proposed by both industry and academia, most of the solutions that are
currently deployed on the Internet - such as traffic scrubbing - tend to detect
and mitigate DDoS attacks close to the victim edge network, once the attack has
already caused damage. Creating systems for early DDoS attack detection and
mitigation that can be deployed at the core of the Internet has the potential to
significantly improve Internet security and reliability.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates innovative machine learning-
based DDoS attack detection and mitigation solutions that can be deployed at the
core of the Internet, within Internet eXchange Points (IXPs). IXPs are high-
density peering hubs that provide infrastructure used by autonomous systems
(ASes) to interconnect, and are therefore well positioned to observe significant
fractions of global Internet traffic. The project leverages IXP-based traffic
monitoring to develop advanced traffic analysis and classification methods for
efficient, automated early detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks. The
researchers aim to first investigate methods for defending against distributed
reflective DoS (DRDoS) attacks, which rely on spoofed IP traffic to amplify the
attacker's available bandwidth, and to then expand the investigation to
volumetric DDoS attacks that do not rely on spoofed traffic. As part of the
project, the researchers aim to develop collaborations with IXPs and Internet
operators around the world, to facilitate research on DDoS defenses and increase
opportunities for high-impact technology transfer.
