The ultimate aim of this work is the understanding of the rheology of the
mantle and the conditions there which are responsible for plate motion. The
movement of tectonic plates must be accommodated by flow in Earth's mantle. This
flow occurs in the solid state and in turn must be accommodated by the motion of
defects within crystals and along grain boundaries. As seismic strain waves
traverse the mantle they interact with these defects which results in
attenuations. This study is aimed at gaining an understanding of the interaction
of seismic waves with defects in single crystals of mantle minerals. An
experimental apparatus has been developed to measure the attenuation of strain
waves at seismic strains and frequencies and under mantle conditions of
temperature and chemical environment. Olivine has been chosen as the first
minerals to be studied because of its proposed abundance in the mantle and
because it is quite deformable under mantle conditions. The state of stress in
Earth's mantle is probably the major factor controlling the defect structure
there. An understanding of that structure, gained through the comparison of
laboratory attenuation measurements with seismic data, should eventually yield
stress mapping of Earth's mantle.
