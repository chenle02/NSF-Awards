This grant supports the acquisition of an ultra high-resolution field emission
scanning electron microscope for materials science research and education. This
state-of-the-art microscope will be equipped with standard secondary and
backscattered electron detectors, a low kV backscatter detector, a scanning
transmission microscopy (STEM) detector, an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX)
analysis system, an electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) system, and an
attachment for electron beam lithography. The instrument and accessories have
been chosen to meet the diverse needs of the multi-disciplinary, multi-user
Central Analytical Facility. Specific research projects with immediate needs for
this equipment include: Fundamental Micromechanics and Materials Dynamics of
Thermal Barrier Coating Systems Containing Multiple Layers; Electron Beam
Lithographic Patterning of Magnetic Nanostructures; Development of a Simplistic
Method for Processing Intermetallic Sheet Materials Using Cold Roll Bonding
Annealing; Surfactant/Polymer Templated Synthesis of Nanostructures; Deposition
of Metal and High K Dielectric Thin Films by Plasma Enhanced Atomic Layer
Deposition for Research and Education; and Membrane Microstructure
Characterization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The materials science enterprise at the
University of Alabama encompasses the departments of chemical engineering,
chemistry, electrical and computer engineering, metallurgical and materials
engineering and physics. Within this enterprise the Center for Materials for
Information Technology educates students in the different science and
engineering disciplines for careers in high technology. The acquisition of this
instrument will aid in the recruitment and retention of African Americans
through a unique three-week summer program administered at The University of
Alabama to introduce mathematics and science educators from HBCU's to materials
science and engineering (NSF DMR-9976488 Introducing Science Faculty from
Historically Black Colleges and Universities to Materials Science and
Engineering). This workshop, which is provided to faculty and instructors from
HBCU's at no cost, is designed to provide faculty members and educators with a
thorough introduction to the materials science and engineering discipline and to
familiarize them with the instruments needed to develop materials science based
examples and/or experiments for use in their own courses. A teaching module is
in place that could utilize the proposed instrumentation.
