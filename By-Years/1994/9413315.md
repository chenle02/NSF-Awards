9413315 Rubin The PIs wish to extend existing U-Th disequilibrium technique to
date young MORBS by pursuing an internal isochron method. The internal isochron
method relies on obtaining different isotopic ratios of the matrix and
phenocryst phases in the same rock. They will also combine the U/Th-series
nucleides with "traditional geochemistry" to obtain an insight into the crustal
accretion process. ***
