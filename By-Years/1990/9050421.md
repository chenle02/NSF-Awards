Sophisticated instruments are being introduced into the undergraduate
petrography lab. The instruments consist of a cathodoluminescence unit and the
TV digitizer which will be combined with existing resources to create an
innovative and comprehensive curriculum. The goal is to integrate
cathodoluminescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, reflected light
microscopy, and image analysis techniques in a manner that provides hands-on
experience with the instruments, including analytical capability and computer-
interfacing, and a deeper knowledge of petrography and petrologic processes.
This program gives students the experience to enter good graduate programs and
to be more competitive in the job market. The university will contribute an
amount equal to the award.
