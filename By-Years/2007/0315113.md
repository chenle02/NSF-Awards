Evi Goldfield of Wayne State University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to develop theoretical methods that accurately
calculate reaction cross sections by exploiting parallel, distributed, and grid
computing. Specifically, codes and methods, both rigorous and approximate, will
be applied to the dynamics of systems containing four or more atoms. The
rigorous study will include hydrogen exchange reactions while the more
approximate methods will be used on energy flow and conformational changes in
large molecules such as peptides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Progress in computational
chemistry is the result of powerful methodological advances, coupled with equal
advances in computing capabilities. Methods that permit the accurate treatment
of quantum effects in the dynamics of large molecules impact chemistry, biology,
and nanotechnology.
