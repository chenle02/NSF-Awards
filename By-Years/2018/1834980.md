This award supports the participation of approximately 12 researchers drawn from
Arctic Indigenous scholars, early career scientists, and students from primarily
Alaska to attend the UArctic One Arctic - One Health Conference in Oulu, Finland
in February of 2019. The UArctic One Arctic-One Health Conference is hosted in
the country that holds the chairmanship of the Arctic Council, which is
currently in Finland. The engagement of these new and underrepresented
investigators in all aspects of the Congress will facilitate the next generation
of interdisciplinary and collaborative researchers who will shape the science of
tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The term 'One Health' was coined by the
veterinary profession to identify the relationship between human and animal
health and the influence the environment exerts on zoonotic disease outbreaks.
Currently, over 70% of the emerging human diseases in the world are of zoonotic
origin, making this a critical area of research, education and outreach. As the
concept has evolved, the interdependence of animal, human and environmental
wellbeing has broadened with the realization that none of these can be truly
healthy unless they are all healthy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
