In this research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, detailed studies of the interaction of polyatomic ions with well
characterized solid surfaces will be undertaken. An understanding of the
molecular ion-surface collision event is important in the development of surface
induced dissociation as a method for the mass spectrometric analysis of the
structure of large molecules. The goal of the present work is to identify and
quantify the various events which may occur when a molecular ion strikes a clean
or adsorbate covered surface, including fragmentation, sticking, reaction,
implantation, sputtering, and ion neutralization. %%% The structural analysis of
large and complex molecules is often carried out using mass spectrometric
methods. One of the most promising of these methods is the use of surface
induced dissociation to enable structural analysis. This research project
addresses the details of the molecule-surface collision which controls surface
induced dissociation. A more complete understanding of this event will enable
the widespread application of the surface induced dissociation approach to the
analysis of complex, biologically relevant molecules.
