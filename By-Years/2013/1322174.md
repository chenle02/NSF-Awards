The big question the PIs are addressing in this project is how to unobtrusively
track silent reading of novice readers so as to be able to use an intelligent
tutoring system to aid reading comprehension. This EAGER project focuses on the
first steps in answering that question. This pilot project builds on previous
work in vision and speech technology, sensor fusion, machine learning, user
modeling, intelligent tutors, and eye movements in an effort to identify the
feasibility of using eye tracking techniques, along with other information
collected from an intelligent reading tutor, to predict reading difficulties of
novice/young readers. In particular, the work plan includes collecting gaze data
in real-world conditions in the context of using the existing Reading Tutor,
designing software to display those traces so that accuracy can be guauged,
testing gazepoint accuracy and detecting gaze-speech discrepancies, and using
that data to develop heuristics for detecting tracking errors in real time and
calibrating eye tracking data to noisy school environments, a primary
environment where the augmented Reading Tutor would ultimately be used. The
intellectual merit of this project is in identifying and addressing challenges
in relating children's gaze data to their silent reading, in making technical
contributions to calibrating eye trackers so that they can be used in normal
everyday applications, and in setting the stage for intelligent tutors across
diverse domains to exploit gaze more broadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's
most important potential broader impacts is in establishing a foundation for
exploiting gaze input to build intelligent computing systems that can be used to
help children with reading difficulties learn to read and read to learn. If
successful, the PIs will develop a larger project that will extent the
successful Project Listen Reading Tutor so that it can track readers as they are
reading silently and help them with their comprehension -- both comprehension of
text itself and strategies for coming to deep understanding.
