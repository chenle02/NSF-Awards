This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses a
liquid crystal based, magneto-optic sensor for direct visualization of
discontinuities. This approach uses eddy currents but has advantages over
conventional eddy current methods. The sensor has potential for significantly
increasing the field-of-view of eddy current instruments (5x) without a dramatic
increase in cost. Moreover, there is good potential for making the sensor
flexible enough to test curved and contoured parts. Phase I will focus on the
design and fabrication of magneto-optic sensors using new, high-sensitivity
liquid crystal systems to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed eddy
current testing approach. This sensor will have commercial applications in the
$500 million nondestructive testing market, where eddy current testing is
currently oneof the fastest growing segments. There may also be applications in
other fields such as biomagnetics and military surveillance.
