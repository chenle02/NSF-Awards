Because of their speed and cost effectiveness, machines are continuing to
replace "unskilled" human labor. If the United States is to maintain its
competitiveness in the world markets, its machines must become still more
sophisticated, replacing human labor in more complex or dangerous tasks. This
transition would be greatly accelerated if machines could "see" like humans. The
front end preprocessor for human vision is the retina. By parallel edge
processing, it transfers to the brain, in real-time, the essential
characteristics of the scene being viewed. The brain then interprets the image
outline and initiates behaviors. This is a project for a very high-performance
retina-like microelectronic processor called the Super Retina Analog Parallel
Processor (SRAP). The SRAP is a high-speed analog parallel processor that
outputs retina-like compressed-image information. It is faster than the human
retina and in addition, could be used in the infrared as well as the visible
spectrum. It is equivalent to hundreds of conventional digital processors
working in parallel and is orders of magnitude smaller in size, weight, and
cost. The research objectives are: 1) Define the imaging requirements for SRAP-
relevant machine and robotic vision scenarios, isolating and emphasizing near-
term commercial applications. 2) Translate these requirements into modifications
of the baseline SRAP chip designs with as much general applicability as
possible. 3) Verify the function and fabrication of the chip designs by SPICE
simulations.
