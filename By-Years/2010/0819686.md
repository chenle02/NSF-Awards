With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program (MRI), Roger
Rowlett and colleagues Anthony Chianese and G. Richard Geier III from Colgate
University will acquire a single-crystal X-ray diffractometer (XRD) to support
research in chemistry and biochemistry including the study of enzyme mechanisms
and structure, organometallic catalysis, porphyrinic macrocycles as well as
examination of the mechanism of bacterial carbonic anhydrase in E. coli. The
instrumentation will also impact undergraduate research, training, and teaching
at Colgate and regional undergraduate institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
technique of single-crystal X-ray crystallography allows accurate and precise
determination of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including
bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about the
spatial arrangement of molecules relative to the neighboring molecules. These
studies will have an impact in a number of areas ranging from synthetic
chemistry to systems of biological interest.
