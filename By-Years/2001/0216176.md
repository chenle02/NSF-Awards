0216176&lt;br/&gt;Bonner&lt;br/&gt;Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi, in
collaboration with the University of Texas at El Paso and CODAR Ocean Sensors,
proposes to extend High Frequency (HF) Radar data processing and hardware to
improve the measurement of surface currents and wave conditions, and to
incorporate directly into radar data output both transport and water quality
model coefficients. The collaboration between these Minority Institutions and
Industry partner will extend HF-Radar applications to predict the origins and
fates of oil spills, water quality, thermal and contaminant plume tracking,
study coastal processes, and develop improved techniques of real-time
management, display and distribution of HF-Radar data. In addition, the extended
HF-Radar system will improve navigational safety for Texas ports and waterways,
which involve complicated hydrodynamic systems with shallow enclosed, embayment
features. &lt;br/&gt;
