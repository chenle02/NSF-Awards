In this project, the principal investigator will participate in a cruise to
gather a variety of oceanographic data along 10 degrees North in the Pacific
Ocean. The P.I. will be responsible for measuring the distributions of tritium
and Helium-3. These distributions will be used to study exchange and transport
in the upper layers of the ocean on annual to decadal time scales (1-30 years).
A second goal is to obtain more detailed data on the large scale distribution of
primordial Helium-3 in the deep water, which will ultimately be used as both a
"far field" diagnostic of the deep circulation, and as an integral constraint on
the flux of this isotope from the mid ocean ridges.
