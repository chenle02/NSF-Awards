9310006 Trappe Research is proposed to determine whether mycorrhizal fungi
accelerate plant community development. A series of greenhouse and field studies
at the Lyman Glacier forefront in Washington are planned to test: whether VAM
enhance the survival and growth of early colonizers; whether surviving
mycorrhizal plants allow greater mycorrhizal fungal diversification; and whether
the resultant positive feedback between plant establishment, environmental
modification, and fungal diversification ultimately increase rates of community
development and system carbon accretion. Specifically, researchers will measure
how mycorrhizal formation and soil carbon accretion vary as a function of
distance from existing plant islands; how mycorrhizal fungi, environmental
modification by established plants, soil organic matter, and inorganic nitrogen
and phosphorus affect new plant survival and colonization in the field; and test
the ability of dark septate endophytes to act as bridges between established
plants and colonizing plants. %%% Results of these studies would provide
evidence on the degree to which mycorrhizae are responsible factors aiding plant
colonization, particularly in nutrient poor, harsh environments. ***
