The goal of the project is to improve instruction in both lower- and upper-
division mathematics courses through the incorporation of technology and
alternative pedagogical strategies made possible by technology. Classes have a
'laboratory' component to be spent in the Computer laboratory, and the
laboratory is open and available for student use during evenings and weekends.
Projects, group exercises, and writing assignments are part of the syllabus for
each course. Laboratory manuals and developed computer programs are being made
available to others in the Mathematical community through presentations at
professional meetings. The project is having an impact on secondary mathematics
education majors through use of these students are tutors for laboratories.
