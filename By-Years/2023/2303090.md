Non-technical Abstract: The unprecedentedly high transition temperatures in
iron- and copper-based superconductors remain as one of the most important
unsolved problems in condensed matter physics, and understanding the complex
normal state of these compounds has become a major physics challenge in its own
right, one that sits at the core of our quest to understand strongly correlated
electron systems. But the appearance in the vicinity of superconductivity of so-
called electronic nematic phases, where the electrons in a material exhibit a
spontaneous preferred orientation, drives the need to better understand this
degree of freedom in a generic manner. This project studies the details of this
relationship in a model system, providing an important next step in elucidating
the potential for enhancing superconducting pairing via nematic fluctuations and
understanding the role of electronic nematicity in condensed matter.

Technical Abstract: Understanding nematicity, and its impact on
superconductivity, is limited by the dearth of materials demonstrated to exhibit
an electronic nematic phase. These materials are mostly limited to certain high-
Tc superconductors and a small handful of other complex materials where other
complicating factors, commonly long range magnetic order, make the impacts of
the nematic phase challenging to isolate. This program investigates a
nematically enhanced superconductor free of magnetism, namely the nickel-
pnictide solid solution series Ba1 xSrxNi2As2, which has been shown to exhibit
novel structural, charge and electronic nematic orders that are highly tunable
by chemical substitution. The project involves transport, spectroscopic and
thermodynamic measurements of the superconducting gap dependence on strain,
evaluation of symmetries and band structure using thermal transport and
photoemission, and the interaction between charge order and superconductivity to
1) further build the connection between nematicity and superconductivity, and 2)
better understand the relationship between nematicity and charge order. The
broader impact of this program involves undergraduate students, graduate
students, and postdoctoral scientists in interdisciplinary research and areas of
scientific and technological significance, including collaborative and exchange
programs with external institutions, and includes participation in the Graduate
Resources Advancing Diversity with Maryland Astronomy and Physics (GRADMAP)
program. The program also interfaces with the University of Marylandâ€™s annual
Fundamentals of Quantum Materials Winter School, which focuses on training the
next generation of scientists pursuing careers in quantum materials research.
