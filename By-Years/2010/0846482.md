The objective of this research is to demonstrate integrated nonlinear dynamical
systems that can efficiently generate extremely low-phase-noise signals, at
radio frequencies, millimeter-waves, and possibly sub-millimeter-waves in
standard silicon processes. The approach is nonlinear and stochastic analysis of
integrated oscillators, and using phase-noise reduction
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research
is in improving our fundamental understanding of integrated nonlinear dynamical
systems when their constituting devices operate close to and beyond their
maximum unity power gain frequency, and to demonstrate fundamentally new
frequency synthesis concepts with orders-of-magnitude performance improvement in
terms of phase noise, power consumption, chip area, and frequency agility
compared with existing methods such as phase-locked loops or direct digital
synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed research is
its potential transformational ability of virtually all electronic systems such
as communication transceivers, computers, radars, and imagers, where an accurate
frequency reference or clock plays a central role. The proposed research will be
carried out by students who appreciate the need to coalesce applied mathematics
with device physics, electromagnetics, and circuit design. Women and minority
students will be actively recruited at graduate and undergraduate levels, and
will be educated to be independent critical thinkers in a collaborative
engineering research environment. Focus will be on improving their analytical
and experimental abilities while maintaining an intuitive engineering problem-
solving mindset. Research results will enter course syllabus in an interactive
lecture-laboratory format. Interdisciplinary workshops around the research theme
are envisioned, and their output will be available to the public through the
internet.&lt;br/&gt;
