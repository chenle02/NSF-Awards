0221124 Hartley Partial support is provided for an NSF-AFOSR-ARO workshop on
materials in design, to be held April 10-12, 2002, in Tampa, Florida. The
purpose of the workshop is to explore the modeling and simulation processes of
use in development and application of materials in design. The goal is to
eventually improve these processes to the point where the materials development
cycle can be radically shortened to match the cycles for other steps in the
design and manufacturing processes. The results will significantly impact the
development cycle for new products of many different types and should have
substantial cost and safety benefits to society. ***
