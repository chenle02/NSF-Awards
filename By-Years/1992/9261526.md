The objective of this project is to develop a method of image compression
offering advantages over the more traditional vector-based algorithms (transform
coding and vector quantization). It is expected that the blocking artifact can
be eliminated and edge fidelity can be improved. Further, the multiresolution
representation itself provides a solution to many imaging applications which
need to handle the same image at different resolutions for display, printing or
browsing, for example. This research could provide a technique for designing
optimal filters for multiresolution coding; it is expected that optimal filters
will be designed and applied to typical imagery. The algorithm could provide the
basis for more effective commercial compression subsytems, critical to the
success of electronic imaging in computer and consumer applications.
