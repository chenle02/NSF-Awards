Non-technical description&lt;br/&gt;This Research Infrastructure Improvement
Track-2 Focused EPSCoR* Collaboration (RII Track-2 FEC) involves researchers
from three jurisdictions: Oklahoma (OK), Nebraska (NE), and Kentucky (KY). The
research team will study atmospheric physics using small unmanned airborne
systems (UAS). Oklahoma State University, the project lead, is collaborating
with the University of Oklahoma, the University of Nebraska, and the University
of Kentucky. The interdisciplinary project team includes researchers with
expertise in robotics, autonomous control, unmanned aircraft systems,
atmospheric physics, and numerical weather prediction. Education, outreach, and
workforce development activities include public education about UAS technology
and its policy implications, educational workshops on locally specific
applications of UAS technology, and rapid dissemination tools for communicating
and responding to severe weather threats and hazards. The project will support
interdisciplinary collaborations among early career faculty in the three
jurisdictions.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Technical description&lt;br/&gt;This RII
Track-2 FEC collaborative research team will develop and test easily-deployable
UAS-based remote sensing systems to characterize the Earth?s lower atmospheric
boundary layer. Research topics include meteorological convection, storm-scale
microphysics, airborne sensing of soil hydrology, infrasonic sensing of
environmental phenomena, and local-scale temporal and spatial climate variation.
The research team will also investigate cooperative control of UAS formations,
spatially distributed data from moving sensor platforms, and heterogeneous
autonomous systems. Expected outcomes from this project include complete UAS
system packages suitable for measuring wind, atmospheric chemistry, soil
moisture, and thermodynamic parameters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Experimental
