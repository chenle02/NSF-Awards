The conference in Biology and Medicine through Mathematics (BAMM!) will take
place May 30 - June 1, 2018 at Virginia Commonwealth University. The aim of the
conference is to highlight recent developments in the broad fields of
mathematical biology and medicine. The plenary speakers will cover a range of
expertise and will provide highlights from advances in the field in recent
years. The goals of this conference are to: i) provide a regional biomathematics
conference that promotes junior investigators (graduate students, postdoctoral
fellows and junior faculty); ii) give visibility to a range of applications and
methods in mathematical biology; iii) provide a good environment for networking
between junior and senior researchers. The conference will host approximately
100 attendees. The conference will be a mix of plenary talks, break-out sessions
and a poster session. Travel support will be used to increase the accessibility
of the conference by junior researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Junior researchers
(undergraduates and graduate students, postdoctoral scholars and early career
faculty) will benefit from participating in this meeting. BAMM! will provide an
intimate conference environment with opportunities to present a poster or give a
talk for researchers at all levels. The travel award funds will promote junior
presenters attendance at BAMM!. Given the diversity of the planned talks,
student researchers new to the field will have the opportunity to attend talks
from many subfields. This will be an excellent opportunity for undergraduate and
master's students from VCU and other regional institutions. Participation of
women and underrepresented minorities in mathematics and science will be
encouraged and supported. More information can be found at

NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
