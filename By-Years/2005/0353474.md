This five-year project will develop six video-case modules for use in K-8 pre-
service teacher preparation programs. Modules will be directed toward specific
grade bands (K-3, 4-5, or 6-8) and address standards-based content domains. Each
module is intended to help future teachers deepen their content knowledge,
pedagogic skills and ability to analyze student thinking. The video cases will
illustrate both reform classroom practices and more traditional instruction,
include interviews with teachers and students and incorporate a set of analytic
tasks that promote users' critical observations of the cases. The Principal
Investigators bring to the project an expertise acquired through their analyses
of the TIMSS videos and extensive prior research experience in science teacher
education.
