This grant permits Ms. Laura Levi, under the direction of Dr. Patrick Culbert,
to conduct her doctoral dissertation research. She will carry out archaeological
work at the Mayan site of San Estevan which is located in the lowland tropics of
Belize. Prior work by Ms. Levi and others has revealed the presence of a large
series of prehistoric house mounds which date to the height of Mayan
development. Ms. Levi will conduct a survey of the site to determine mound
locations. She will also collect surface ceramics and undertake limited
archaeological excavation. Through use of aerial photographs, microenvironmental
zones will be defined and the size and distribution of mounds related to this
ecological variable. Ms. Levi postulates that prehistoric lowland Mayan farming
is based of the detailed knowledge of slightly different microenvironmental
zones and that success involved use of more than one zone. She also argues that
decision making took place on a family or household level, and that household
success and size is directly related to the ability to farm more than one zone.
Through comparison of house mound location (in relation to microenvironment) and
size, it is possible to test this hypothesis. This research has great practical
value. The Middle American tropical lowlands today permit human occupation at
only low population densities. The ancient Maya lived in the same environments
in much larger numbers and inhabited regions for very long periods of time.
Understanding of Mayan agricultural practices may permit more effective
contemporary use of such regions. This project will also further the career
development of a very promising young scientist.
