Geisinger's wide-area-network (GEN), linking the three main Geisinger campuses,
will be complete in the fall of 1992. While the primary function of GEN is to
support clinical activity, i.e., appointment, schedules, billing, purchasing,
etc., with an INTERNET connection, GEN's functionality can expand to encompass
Geisinger's research and education missions as well. Given access to the many
resources available through an INTERNET connection, Geisinger research
scientists, clinicians, and educators can work as though they are at one of the
major medical academic centers in Philadelphia or Pittsburgh instead of in
scenic, but isolated, rural noncentral or northeastern Pennsylvania. With and
INTERNET connection at Geisinger, pharmacists will be able to exchange protocols
for new drugs, scientists can query their colleagues at other institutions for
protein purification techniques, authors can submit and revise manuscripts
electronically, physicians participating in clinical trials or protocols can log
patient-care information, receive updates, and share concerns without leaving
their offices, students can stay in touch with their home universities, and
librarians can transmit and receive documents and other information required by
all of those listed above with greater efficiency and speed.
