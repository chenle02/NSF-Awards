An automated DNA sequencer will be purchased for studies in systematics,
evolutionary biology and environmental studies at Louisiana State University.
Among the projects to be explored are: characterization the algal- invertebrate
mats on off-shore platforms; the elucidation of the relationships of primary
clades of green algae to land plans; cospeciation in a host-parasite assemblage;
modes of reproduction in marine invertebrates; and the interpretation of
historical patterns in ecology, behavior, and geographic distribution through
construction of bird and mammal phylogenies via comparative molecular methods.
