This projects explores problems in the area of approximation algorithms, with
emphasis on two themes: (1) Primal-dual schema based on approximation
algorithms; and (2) Approximation algorithms for problems in network design.
First, several problems are investigated that appear to have ``optimal''
approximate solutions using primal-dual schema, including generalized Steiner
network problem, integral multicommodity flow and multicut in trees, the set
cover problem, and the k-minimal Steiner tree problem. The second goal of the
project is to provide ``good'' approximate solutions to problems, identified by
AT&amp;T Bell Labs and Bellcore, in the area of implementation and maintenance
of low-cost broadband networks.***
