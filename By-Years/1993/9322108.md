9322108 Teeri This award provides funds for another three years to continue the
successful REU Program. Ten undergraduates (per session) interested in research
in field biology will be selected to participate in a program at the University
of Michigan Biological Station in Pellston, MI. Students will both learn and
live at the Station during the nine-week summer session. The research experience
is the focus of their academic activities during that period. Students will work
with a faculty mentor, attend special REU evening workshops, attend REU weekly
discussion meetings, attend general seminars at the Station, and develop their
own research projects (from conception of the ideas through data collection to
verbal and written presen- tation of the study). Students are selected on the
basis of academic excellence, letters of recommendation, and evidence of
interest in research. After participation in the program, each student will help
in the evaluation of his/her experiences in the program . ***
