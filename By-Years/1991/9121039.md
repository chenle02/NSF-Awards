Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include studies of
high energy elementary particle and nuclear reactions, based on quantum
chromodynamics (QCD). There will also be applications of techniques borrowed
from string theory to QCD, studies of the nonconservation of the nucleon number
of physical systems, and a variety of analyses in string theory. String theory
is a promising candidate for a theory of all the forces of nature, including
gravity, and QCD is an increasingly-verified theory of the strong nuclear force.
Improved knowledge of the nature and consequences of string theory and QCD - the
goal of this project - is clearly important.
