This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I research project will
demonstrate the feasibility of a high-precision optical metrology system that
meets a current market need for extremely precise distance measurements with
rapid update rates. The project will actively stabilize newly developed Micro-
Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) tunable Vertical Cavity Surface-Emitting
Lasers (VCSEL) that can be rapidly tuned mode-hop-free over 6 terahertz. Using a
Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) technique, this system has the
potential to reach 25 micrometer resolutions and sub-10-nanometer precisions in
real time. Extensive experience in laser stabilization will help to overcome the
daunting challenge of stabilizing and linearizing the frequency sweep of the
VCSEL sources, which inherently exhibit significant frequency noise. These
VCSELs, however, offer sweep rates 100-1,000 times faster than competing
technologies and would therefore enable the same enhancement in the system?s
update rate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At short ranges, the system can be used for
industrial metrology and precision manufacturing. At medium ranges, the system
can be used for navigational aids including pilot assistance for landing in
brownout conditions. This application has the significant potential to save the
lives of airmen and passengers in unprepared landing zones. At long ranges, the
system can be used to accurately position sparse aperture telescopes and
formations of nano-satellites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under
