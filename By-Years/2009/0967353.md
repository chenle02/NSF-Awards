The objective of this proposal is to develop and verify a mixed unit life cycle
analysis model of the US electric industry that includes environmental effects
and the relationships to many major industries. The model will include both
economic and energy/electricity flows. It is anticipated that this model will be
a useful tool in energy and environmental policy decisions. Advances in the
model will be due to including more interactions with other industries and a
disaggregated (i.e. source-specific) power generation sector in the US. The
model, if successful, will be an important tool for planners and policy
makers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Bruce K. Hamilton&lt;br/&gt;2/24/10
