This award will provide opportunities for 16 undergraduate students each summer
to participate in the Research Experiences in Molecular Biology program at the
University of Minnesota. This program has two parts. First all students spend
three weeks learning basic molecular biology techniques in an intensive
laboratory course. This course will cover basic principles of gene regulation
and will provide students with the most current information on specific
techniques as well as background terminology and concepts. Following the course,
each student spends the next seven weeks completing an independent research
project under the direction of one of the 50 faculty mentors affiliated with the
program, all of whom are conducting research using Recombinant DNA technology.
The students' research experience will be supplemented by weekly student
seminars and evening workshops to strengthen the quality of future applications
to graduate programs. Students will prepare a summary of their research project
in the form of a display or a poster session at the conclusion of the program.
This award will foster the continued education and training of individuals who
will be part of our next generation of basic researchers in the biological
sciences.
