This award to the University of Washington is made in response to a proposal
submitted to the NSF's Instrumentation and Facilities Program, a program whose
goal is to extend support for undergraduate instructional equipment. The award
will provide one-half of the funds needed to acquire computer workstations that
will allow students to examine weather systems. The University of Washington is
committed to providing the remaining half. The workstations will provide a
powerful new tool that will aid instructors in describing the complex three-
dimensional structure of weather systems.
