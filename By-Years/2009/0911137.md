In this project, researchers will install an array of 8 land broadband
seismographs in Fiji for one year to complement an array of 55 ocean bottom
seismographs that is already funded by NSF-Ocean Sciences for different
objectives. The additional stations will expand the aperture of the seismic
deployment to encompass the Tonga deep seismic zone, which contains ~ 66 % of
the worlds deep earthquakes, allowing optimal raypath coverage for study of deep
earthquakes and imaging mantle processes associated with the interaction of the
slab and the transition zone.Slab processes at depths of 200-700 km, including
deep earthquakes, mineralogical phase changes, and volatile transport and
release into the surrounding mantle, are of great importance for understanding
the dynamics of the earth. The goals of the study include placing constraints on
the mechanism of deep earthquakes by mapping the configuration and studying the
characteristics of individual faults in the Tonga deep slab. They will use high
precision earthquake relocation methods for this task. They will study
systematic patterns in deep earthquake rupture parameters in the subduction zone
to see if they fit with global trends. They will place constraints on
termperature and composition analmalies in the mantle wedge above the slab using
seismic tomography, and using receiver functions, they will study the
implications of reflectors in the mantle wedge.

The researchers and students supported by this work will assemble a unique high
density combined land-sea dataset from broadband seismographs immediately over
the most prolific deep seismic zone in the world. They will also be working
closely with seismologists from the Fiji Mineral Resources, thus facilitating
scientific exchange and the training of younger scientists from a 3rd world
country.
