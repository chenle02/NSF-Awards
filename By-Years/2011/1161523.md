The Southwest Center for Arithmetic Geometry will continue its series of annual
"Winter Schools" in 2013, 2014, 2015, with the 2013 Arizona Winter School taking
place March 9-13, 2013 at the University of Arizona in Tucson, AZ. The Southwest
Center for Arithmetic Geometry was founded in 1997. The NSF has provided the
primary support for the center since its inception, with renewal of funding in
2002, 2006, 2009, and 2012. The primary activity of the Southwest Center is the
Arizona Winter School (AWS), an annual meeting which has become a prominent
national event and provides high-level training and research experience for
graduate students in arithmetic geometry. The AWS is an intensive five-day
meeting, organized around a different central topic each year, that features a
set of courses by leading and emerging experts. The AWS is not a traditional
conference: the speakers organize courses of four lectures, provide lecture
notes in advance, and propose projects for graduate students to work on during
the meeting. Nightly working sessions on these projects and on separate problem
sets are run by the speakers and postdoctoral fellows. On the last day, students
present their findings to the participants of the meeting. The result is a
particularly intense and focused five days of mathematical activity for everyone
involved. Recent Winter School topics have included Number Theory and Dynamics,
Stark-Heegner Points, and Ramification and Geometry. The topics of upcoming
Winter Schools will be guided by future mathematical
developments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the Winter School, connections among peers
are formed, and mentoring relationships between students and senior researchers
are developed. As has been the case at previous Winter Schools, subsequent
collaborations between participants at all levels are the norm. Students make
concrete strides toward becoming research mathematicians, post-doctoral
assistants gain valuable mentoring experience in their academic careers, and
faculty develop new interests and see new connections that lead to important
published results. The Southwest Center website shares reusable content from the
Winter Schools, including lecture notes, project descriptions, and audio and
video of lectures. Through these thorough records, the dialogues begun at the
AWS are extended to the greater mathematical community, and the efforts of the
AWS participants are made freely and indefinitely available to all. More
