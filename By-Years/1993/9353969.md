9353969 Smith The proposed project would support a coalition of two- and four-
year institutions (The Washington Center Coalition) interested in helping
faculty learn about new advances in their disciplines and new ways to
incorporate these into their classes. The project emphasis is on
interdisciplinary science curricular designs. Four, eight-day interdisciplinary
summer institutes would be team-taught over the two year period of the grant.
Each Institute would be residential and have 30 faculty participants. Follow-up
activities after the institutes include a two-day retreat, involvement in on-
going Washington Center activities, and communication among the participants via
InterNet and written publications. The Summer Institutes, which are the core of
the project design, are miniature versions of some of the most successful
interdisciplinary programs in the state. They provide a "high challenge"
curriculum and are based upon pedagogical principles of student involvement that
are recommended by an increasingly convergent literature on improving education
in the sciences. ***
