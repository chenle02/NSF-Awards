9500584 Morse An absorbing material placed within a laser cavity has a great
effect on the output of the laser. This technique is well known using an
absorption cell within the cavity of a dye laser. We propose to use the concept
of intra-cavity laser absorption in conjunction with the Tm-Ho fiber laser that
has gain from 1.65 to 2.095 um. Many gases have rotational-vibrational overtones
in this wavelength region, and it should be possible to detect them using this
sensitive technique. We believe that a field-hardened instrument that will yield
spectroscopic information can be the result of such research. ***
