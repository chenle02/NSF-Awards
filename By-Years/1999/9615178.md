9615178 MEYER Cichlid fishes of Lake Tanganyika, the oldest of the great African
rift lakes, represent a paradigm example of unprecedented diversity in
morphology, behavior, and ecology that occurred over a geologically-short period
of time. Lake Tanganyika cichlids display a complexity of differences in
external shape and coloration, breeding systems, parental care patterns, and
trophic specializations that are not found elsewhere. Lake Tanganyika also is
pivotal in the geographic history of eastern Africa, and undoubtedly served as
the bio-reservoir from which ancestors to species in other African rift lake
were derived. The research to be carried out by Dr. Axel Meyer will employ
nucleotide sequences from two different, mitochondrially-encoded genes and from
three different, nuclear-encoded genes to investigate genealogical relationships
among the twelve tribes (representing 170 species in 50 genera) of cichlids in
Lake Tanganyika. These DNA sequences will be used to generate a molecular
scaffold that will provide answers to critical questions regarding the origin
and diversification of the morphological, behavioral, and ecological
specializations that characterize these fishes. Answers to these questions have
implications to the understanding of east African cichlids fish assemblages, and
in a general sense, to understanding of adaptive radiation and biological
theory.
