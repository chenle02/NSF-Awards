The proposed research is part of a continuing study of the computational
complexity of boolean circuits and related models of computation, such as
threshold circuits and branching programs. All the problems to be investigated
concern the manner in which the size, depth and type of gates in a circuit
affect its computational power. The focus is on circuit whose depth is small
(either independent of input length or logarithmic in input length) and whose
size is either bounded by a polynomial in the input length or is slightly
larger. The principal goal is to prove that certain problems cannot be solved
under such size and depth restrictions, and thereby determine the structure of
complexity classes defined by small-depth circuit families. These questions will
be investigated by two distinct methods: The first is the representation of the
behavior of the circuit or the program by polynomials or similar algebraic
objects, and the use of Fourier analysis to discover properties of these
representations. The second is the representation of a circuit's behavior as a
program over a finite monoid, which permits the application of methods from the
global structure theory of finite semigroups.
