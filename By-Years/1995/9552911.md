*** 9552911 Granger Florida State University will initiate a six-week, summer
residential with MSTP, Young Scholars project in science, mathematics, and
computer science for 36 students entering grades 11 and 12 and 5 teachers. Each
student completes an individual research project in collaboration with a faculty
research mentor from Florida State University and participates in activities
involving mathematics, computer science, and science (biochemistry, physics, or
science communication). Evening seminars on science ethics and career
exploration and weekend field trips complete the summer program. Student
computer networking and the results of the individual research projects form the
basis for the follow-up activities that take place during the academic year.
Five high school teachers participate in a mathematics and science teaching
perspective. ***
