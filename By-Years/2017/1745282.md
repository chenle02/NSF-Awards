As a participant in the Antarctic Artists and Writers Program, Caitlin Scarano
proposes to spend time in the McMurdo Station region to study the intersections
between landscape and humanity and interpret these relationships through poetry.
A primary goal of the project is to promote dialogue and greater understanding
about the unique Antarctic ecosystem and the role of humans within that
ecosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scarano will conduct formal and informal
discussions with researchers and other individuals working at the station and
field camps that she visits. During her time in Antarctica, she will maintain a
blog on her author website to log her experiences and share her reflections,
photos and poems with the public. Upon returning home, she will compile her
poems into a full-length manuscript which will be submitted to several
publishers for national distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
