Principal Investigator: Victor Ginzburg proposal Number: 0303465 Institution:
University of Chicago Abstract: Symplectic reflection algebras

The main theme of the present proposal is applying the general machinery of non-
commutative geometry to concrete problems in algebra and geometry. The proposal
establishes several new unexpected links between seemingly unrelated branches of
mathematics, such as noncommutative algebra, algebraic geometry, representation
theory, and physics. Specifically, given a finite dimensional symplectic vector
space and a finite group of symplectic automorphisms of that vector space, the
authors study symplectic resolutions and symplectic deformations (both
commutative and noncommutative) of the corresponding orbifold. This gives a new
approach, through Hochschild cohomology, to various "stringy" topological
invariants of the orbifold. Thus, one of the main ideas of the proposal is to
approach the algebraic geometry of an orbifold via the techniques of
noncommutative geometry. The "symplectic reflection algebras" provide a basic
tool for implementing this idea. A systematic use of symplectic reflection
algebras leads to various new results in conventional "commutative" algebraic
geometry, which have been inaccessible by purely "commutative" methods.

The proposal opens up a wide variety of independent directions for research.
One of the basic goals of the proposal is in applying the methods and results
developed in one branch of mathematics to a totally different area of
mathematics. For example the proposal involves systematic applications of
various algebraic techniques to problems in geometry and representation theory.
Thus, the proposal enhances the idea of "unity" of mathematics. This proposal
also has far reaching applications not only in various areas of mathematics, but
also has applications in modern mathematical and theoretical physics, especially
in quantum physics. Mathematical science as a whole makes a profound
contribution to society. The current proposal goes a long way toward promoting
interactions between different disciplines and enhancing scientific
understanding.
