This project involves collaboration between two research groups at the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Water Quality at
the University of Arizona and the Queen's University Environmental Science and
Technology Research Center (QUESTOR) at the Queen's University of Belfast,
Northern Ireland. The overall aim is to develop genetic technology for the
exploitation, expression and characterization of two potentially useful enzymes
(cytochrome P450 and amidase) from 'extremely halophilic archea' (hgaloarchaea).
One specific aim will be to improve vectors for over-expression of proteins in
haloarchaea.
