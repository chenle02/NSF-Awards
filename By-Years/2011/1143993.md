This project will explore the future of molecular programming area via a Special
Session at the 17th &lt;br/&gt;International Conference on DNA Computing &amp;
Molecular Programming (DNA17). The conference will take&lt;br/&gt;at California
Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, USA on September 19, 2011. The
conference website is http://dna17.caltech.edu. The goals of the event are to
elucidate future directions and specific challenges for the field of DNA
computation and molecular programming, and to facilitate discussion on how these
visions are to be met. The DNA17 conference is the flagship conference in this
emerging area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A report will be provided to NSF after the
event, consisting of a short statement from each invited panelist and a summary
of each panel discussion by the organizers. The panel discussions will provide a
timely assessment of the field and the challenges and opportunities for the
future, which will be useful to conference attendees and other researchers
working in this area as they formulate their next research directions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requested funds will primarily go to support registration
and travel expenses for the invited panelists, &lt;br/&gt;as well as incidental
costs associated with the impromptu parallel sessions.
