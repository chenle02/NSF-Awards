With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is funding Professor Norito
Takenaka of the University of Miami to develop asymmetric organocatalytic
methods for carbon-carbon bond forming reactions including ketimine allylation
and crotylation, periselective nitroalkene Diels-Alder reactions, and Claisen
rearrangements. These asymmetric reactions will be promoted by chiral Lewis base
catalysts or Br√∏nsted acid catalysts, which are based on previously unexplored
1-azahelicenes. Studies emphasizing understanding helicene-derived catalyst
structures, reactivity and selectivity will also be undertaken to enhance
mechanistic understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the
rigorous training of undergraduate and graduate students in modern asymmetric
synthesis, and broadening participation through the inclusion of researchers at
the University of Miami from groups that have historically been underrepresented
in sciences. The scientific broader impacts include the development of a
fundamentally new class of chiral catalysts with advantages in efficiency,
economy, and environmental friendliness over stoichiometric chiral reagents.
Such advances are expected to benefit the basic synthetic research community, as
well as the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries that rely upon methods to
access enantio-enriched small organic molecules. The ease of handling these
bench-stable catalysts adds to their likely impact upon industrial and academic
science.
