This study deals with a primarily experimental investigation of a number of
aspects of buoyancy-induced heat transfer. Specific areas of interest are
natural convection in differentially heated layers inclined at various angles to
the direction of the gravitational body force; convection from open cavities;
and the flow of thermal plumes in a stratified layer. Mass transfer systems will
be used in some of the studies to simulate heat transfer. Many of the
experiments will be performed with high Rayleigh number flows where turbulent
model predictions are uncertain. The results should serve as a testing ground
for numerical calculations as well as provide important heat transfer
correlations.
