This research focuses on a topic of central importance in the field of
international relations: the initiation and escalation of international
conflicts. The research assesses how domestic economic and political conditions,
as well as international political and military ones, influence the decisions of
policy makers to threaten and use military force. Two phases in the process of
escalation of force are analyzed: 1) the initial decision whether to confront an
adversary directly and threaten him with force, and 2) after such a challenge,
the decision whether to escalate the conflict and engage in sustained and large-
scale use of military force. A theoretical model is developed for both phases
and tested by means of statistical analysis 1) on a sample of 13 enduring
international rivalries in which threats to use force were plausible, or did in
fact occur, and 2) on the total set of 90 cases of international deterrence
crises between 1870 and 1985. A subset of cases, comprising some well-explained
by the statistical analysis and some poorly explained, are examined in depth to
assess the adequacy and limits of the statistical analysis. This research should
help answer several kinds of questions important to the social-scientific
understanding of international relations such as: are the influences on
decisions to initiate a conflict or crisis also central to explaining decisions
to escalate international crises, or are the causes significantly different; how
important are domestic economic and political conditions in explaining
international conflict behavior. Is a more aggressive and conflictual foreign
policy often a response to internal problems and weaknesses; what is the
relative importance of defensive vs. opportunistic and expansionary incentives
in decisions to threaten and/or resort to the use of military force; how
important is a reputation for firmness or conciliation in a previous crisis to
the success of deterrence in a new crisis. The research promises to
significantly enhance our understanding of these topics.
