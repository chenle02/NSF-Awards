Cummings proposes a program of research in combinatorial set
theory.&lt;br/&gt;Infinite graphs, trees and orderings are the main objects of
research in this program. The proposed research uses a wide range of techniques
including forcing, PCF theory and inner model theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
immediate goal of Cummings' research program is to get a better understanding of
certain infinite mathematical structures. Problems about these structures arise
in many areas of mathematics including algebra, analysis, topology and (perhaps
surprisingly) the study of finite structures. The long term goal is to forge new
tools for the construction and analysis of infinite structures, which should
then find broader application.
