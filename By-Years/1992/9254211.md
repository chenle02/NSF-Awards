The project is developing new laboratory exercises for non- science majors in
introductory geology courses. Each exercise is divided into a 1) data
acquisition 2) data analysis and 3) model visualization/testing phase. RISC-
based graphics work stations, electronic measuring devices and field tests are
being used to bring 3-D visualizations into the elementary course sequence. With
the introduction of computer analysis of data and with computer modelling of
geologic processes, non- science students are developing scientific methods and
learning about critical environmental problems. Although these approaches are
being developed for classes with large enrollments, the laboratory portion of
the course involves 20- 25 students in each section, requires individual
participation and introduces the use of computer visualization models to
evaluate each simple hypothesis.
