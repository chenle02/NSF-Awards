0134511 Lee The objective of the proposed research is to develop techniques to
significantly increase terpenoid indole alkaloid (TIA) production from cell
cultures of C. roseus. The proposed hypothesis is that to maximize the
production of secondary metabolites such as TIAs, the relative flows of
precursors and energy resources at various levels must be balanced. The proposed
specific aims for achieving this balance for increasing TIA production are to:
(1) increase flux to both primary and secondary metabolism, (2) maximize the
metabolic flux to TIA production while maintaining an appropriate metabolic flux
to cellular machinery for supporting essential cellular activities, (3) tune the
flux between the glycolysis, citric acid, and pentose phosphate pathways for
maximum secondary metabolite production, and (4) characterize the optimum
balance the various pathways and activities. This research could produce results
to increase the yield of important antitumor and antihypertensive compounds.
