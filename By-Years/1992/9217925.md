This award supports the participation of 11 U.S. scientists in a U.S.-Japan
Seminar on Molecular and Cellular Aspects of Vascular Smooth Muscle Function, to
be held in Hawaii, Feb. 1-4, 1994. The co-organizers are Professor R. Clinton
Webb of the University of Michigan and Professor Yoshiaki Nonomura of the
University of Tokyo. This seminar builds upon the success of two similar
bilateral meetings held in 1977 and 1989. In addition to the U.S. and Japanese
participants, scientists will be invited from Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark,
and Russia. This seminar will bring together specialists in the four processes
in the contraction and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle: 1) membrane
excitation, 2) excitation-contraction coupling, 3) energy metabolism, and 4)
chemomechanical transduction. Although these are the same processes that are
involved in the function of other muscle, there are important individualities
among the various muscle types and there is a high degree of specialization
among the investigators. Since the earlier two meetings on the subject,
important new insight has been developed in basic research in vascular biology.
Participants in this seminar will exchange information and plan directions for
future research.
