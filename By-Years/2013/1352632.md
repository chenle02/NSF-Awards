Nearly every movement we make is a decision under risk. People making economic
or movement decisions seek to maximize rewards and minimize costs. However,
instead of monetary costs, one of the predominant costs in movement is effort:
the metabolic energy required to perform a movement. Surprisingly, there is no
good representation of the subjective value that the brain assigns effort or how
this valuation may vary across individuals, populations, or environments. In
this project, the Principal Investigator will use a neuroeconomic decision
making framework to quantify the subjective value of effort and gain fundamental
knowledge about the role of effort valuation in movement decision making. Young
adults will perform movement tasks requiring significantly different amounts of
effort. During these tasks, metabolic cost (objective effort cost) will be
measured. They will then make choices between risky effort and monetary
lotteries, and perform a movement task that involves a tradeoff between effort
costs and monetary costs. Findings will determine whether subjective valuation
of effort provides a mechanistic explanation for changes in movement decision
making and whether subjective valuation of effort exhibits similarities with the
well-documented subjective valuation of monetary outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In terms of broader impacts, this work can inform studies on the generalization
of subjective valuation across motor and non-motor commodities, and how
subjective valuation changes across the lifespan. The proposed studies will
significantly advance the state-of-the-art in the areas of sensorimotor control,
rehabilitation, and decision making and inspire future studies that leverage
effort valuation to modulate movement in lieu of error and incentivize better
motor and non-motor decisions. Findings will direct future research on the
design of rehabilitation therapies and exercise incentive programs that optimize
movements and improve decision-making in motor and non-motor domains. Broadening
of participation will be achieved by working to introduce K-12 students at
underrepresented schools to basic science and technology concepts related to
movement decision making.
