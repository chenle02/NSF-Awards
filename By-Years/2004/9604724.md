9604724 Pape The primary determinant in recognizing and activating the large
rRNA gene promoter in eukaryotes is an essential transcription factor for RNA
polymerase I (RNAP I), which maintains a species-specific and polymerase-
specific complex with the promoter. This factor is composed of TBP (TATA binding
protein) and other RNAP I-associated subunits. The yeast Schizosaccharomyces
pombe is unusual in that the rRNA gene promoter contains a canonical TATAAA
element upstream from the transcription initiation site. This TATA element,
which normally binds the TBP subunit of RNA polymerase II initiation factor
TFIID, plays an important role in directing the initiation of transcription of
the S. pombe rRNA genes. This research will genetically and biochemically test
the ability of the TBP subunit of S. pombe RNAP I essential transcription factor
SL1 to direct assembly of the transcription pre-initiation complex via the
TATAAA element. This analysis includes preparative purification of SL1, cloning
and sequencing of at least one TBP-associated subunit, and identification of
additional interacting factors by in vivo genetic analysis. The interaction of
purified SL1 with a second apparently inhibitory promoter domain will be
characterized. The vertebrate rDNA promoter/enhancer binding protein UBF
(Upstream Binding Factor) also appears to play a pivotal role in stimulation and
regulation of rRNA synthesis. An S. pombe UBF-like activity that specifically
interacts with anti-UBF antiserum, and with both the rDNA promoter and
intergenic enhancer region will be further characterized by purification of the
UBF complex, cloning and sequencing of component subunits, and genetic and
biochemical analysis of function. In addition, the DNA binding properties of
another S. pombe intergenic rDNA binding protein, the RNAP I transcription
termination factor Reb1p, will be defined with respect to binding affinities and
sequence specificity. The S. pombe model system has potential application to a
wide vari ety of eukaryotic organisms and general relevance to understanding the
evolution of transcription. This research will analyze the molecular
interactions governing activation and regulation of the large ribosomal RNA
genes in eukaryotes. The yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has transcriptional
mechanistic and regulatory features with potential application to a wide variety
of eukaryotic organisms, and has general relevance to understanding the
evolution of transcription in animals, plants and the more widely investigated
yeast model system S. cerevisiae.
