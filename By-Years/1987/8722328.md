Starting in the late twenties, Danjon made careful measurements in France to
determine the brightness of the "ashen light" on the dark side of the moon. That
light produced by illumination from the earth, is controlled by the sun-earth-
moon geometry and is proportional to the earth's visible albedo. Careful
repetition of Danjon's measurements sixty years later might be a useful test for
a possible secular change in the earth's albedo. Under this award, Professor
Twomey will examine the feasibility of repeating Danjon's experiment.
