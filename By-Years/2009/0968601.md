Expanding NSF Course, Curriculum and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) Type 1
projects to Type 2 projects is sometimes difficult. Challenges include
developing faculty communities, using more robust evaluation methods, and
encouraging broader adoption. This project supports a two-day workshop for
computer science PIs to expand the scope of their Type 1 projects and write
competitive TUES Type 2 proposals. Twelve teams of two investigators are being
recruited. The workshop leaders and guest speakers have experience managing Type
2 projects. It is hosted by the University of Texas at El Paso. Materials will
be made available to the computer science education community.
