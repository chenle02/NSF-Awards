This award will provide support for US students to participate in the primary
annual international conference on accelerator science and its applications, the
8th International Particle Accelerator Conference (IPAC`17) to be held in
Copenhagen, Denmark on May 14-19, 2017. The IPACs are an annual series of
conferences that rotate between the Americas, Europe, and Asia to highlight the
science and engineering of major accelerator facilities, provide scientists with
a forum for presenting results from research conducted using accelerators, and
serve as a venue for describing new applications of accelerators. At a time when
not just old jobs but entire old industries are disappearing, accelerators and
accelerator-driven light sources are burgeoning worldwide, offering new
prospects not only for fundamental discovery science, but for medicine and
biology, for energy and environment, for security, and for
industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will be used to provide partial travel
support for US students to attend the conference. The recipients of the travel
support will be making presentations at the conference and will assist in
conducting the conference. Attendance of 15 US students will be facilitated by
the funds provided by this award. The conference will be an excellent
opportunity for young scientists to interact with more experienced researchers
and their colleagues in the broader international scientific community.
