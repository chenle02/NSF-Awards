The overall research objective of this award is to advance the state-of-the-art
in mechanistic theoretical modeling of the response of cells and tissues to
cryopresevation in order to make possible the rational design of freeze/thaw
protocols which cause minimal cell damage. This is to be done by: (1) modeling
water &lt;br/&gt;transport in high Peclet number regimes; (2) modeling of the
thawing process; (3) measuring physical properties of cryoprotectant solutions;
(4) verifying the models; (5) analyzing tissue cryopreservation; and (6)
integrating the optimization of freezing and thawing protocols. The educational
objectives are to: (1) enhance awareness of biology among engineers and of
engineering methods among biologists and clinicians via cross-cutting
educational activities; and (2) use these interactions to enhance educational
experiences for students. The educational objectives are to be achieved by using
four integrated strategies. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
