This project will focus on the study of the static and dynamic properties of
self-entangled double stranded DNA in micro and nanofluidic devices. The central
goal of this project is to develop an understanding of how self-entanglements
affect the transport properties of DNA. Both single molecule experiments and
computer simulations will be performed. The three main objectives of the project
are: (1) develop means to efficiently generate and characterize self-entangled
DNA, (2) study the stretching and relaxation of self-entangled DNA subject to
planar elongational fields, (3) use coarse-grained simulations to study self-
entangled DNA. Applications of this work are in the emerging field of single-
molecule genomic analysis and inter-nuclear DNA dynamics.

Intellectual Merit : The research proposed will result in work at the front edge
of fundamental studies of nonequilibrium dynamics of polymers and DNA. The PI
will leverage a newly discovered and novel method to create self-entangled DNA
to be used as the model polymer system. New mechanistic insights will be
developed regarding self-entangled polymer systems. The fundamental discoveries
from this project will result in contributions to polymer physics texts and
journal articles.

Broader Impacts : This project will train undergraduate and graduate students to
enter the workforce (academic and industry) to work on cutting edge engineering
topics combining molecular manipulations and microfabrication. Through the PI's
involvement in the MIT Laureates and Leaders Program, minority students will be
involved in research and mentored to pursue a PhD in Science, Technology,
Engineering, or Mathematics (STEM) fields. High school teachers will be involved
in summer research through the Center for Material Science and Engineering RET
program. A new text for undergraduate chemical engineering fluid mechanics will
be completed by the PI during the course of the research period. Undergraduates
will partake in collaborative international research experiences during summers
in either France or Singapore.
