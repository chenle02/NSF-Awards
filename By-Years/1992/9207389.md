The primary objective of this US-Hungary research project between Dr. Laszlo
Guczi of the Institute of Isotopes, Budapest, and Dr. Joe Hightower of Rice
University is to examine the kinetics and mechanism of selective hydrogenation
of acetylene in ethylene and butadiene in n-butenes over Pd-based catalysts. The
researchers hope to learn more about the nature of active sites of a bimetallic
catalyst, what factors affect the selectivity, why the catalysts deactivate, and
how to make them more active. Funds for the project are awarded through the US-
Hungary Joint Fund, Budapest, in accordance with established guidelines.
