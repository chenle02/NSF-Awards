The principal investigators will continue work on various areas of differential
geometry including large time heat flow on Riemannian manifolds and Teichmuller
space. The work on heat flow will use method from probability to attempt to
describe the relationship between heat diffusion and geometric quantities. One
of the investigators will also study discrete versions of some problems in
spectral theory. The research on Teichmuller theory will focus on applications
of the theory to dynamical systems. The principal investigators will also
attempt to develop a Teichmuller theory for quadratic and polynomial-like maps.
This award will support research in the general area of differential geometry
and global analysis. Differential geometry is the study of the relationship
between the geometry of a space and analytic concepts defined on the space.
Global analysis is the study of the overall geometric and topological properties
of a space by piecing together local information. Applications of these areas of
mathematics in other sciences include the structure of complicated molecules,
liquid-gas boundaries, and the large scale structure of the universe.
