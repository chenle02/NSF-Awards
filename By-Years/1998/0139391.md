EIA-0139391&lt;br/&gt;Shah, Mubarak&lt;br/&gt;University of Central
Florida&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Projects: REU Site Principle Investigator
Meeting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Each REU site in way is unique and follows
different model for providing research experiences to undergraduates. It will be
nice to bring together Pis of different REU sites in one place so thats and NSF
program directors can share their experiences, and exchange ideas on Research
Experience for Undergraduates. Therefore, we propose to organize a meeting of
PIs of CISE REU sites in January 2002 in Orlando, Florida. This will be a one-
day meeting, all twenty or so PIs of REU Sites will be invited to attend. Since
Orlando has several tourist attractions, and January is a very good time to
visit Florida, we expect maximum attendance.&lt;br/&gt;
