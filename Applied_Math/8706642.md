The main mathematical aspects of the research will be modeling (derivation and
presentation of equation of motion) and analysis (by perturbation methods,
bifurcation techniques, and numerical methods) devised for and applied to
problems in nonlinear, non-Fickian diffusion with free boundaries. The research
is an exciting new devlopment for both its mathematical novelty as well as the
wide range of applications of its results. These applications range from
controlling the release time of pharmaceutical products and the reduction of the
observed degradation of solid rocket fuels in polymer containers, just as these
problems become pressing technical issues.
