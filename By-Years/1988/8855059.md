The School of Engineering of Western New England College, in cooperation with
the mathematics and physical science faculty from the School of Arts and
Sciences, proposes to conduct a program to stimulate the interest of high
ability eighth grade students in science and mathematics with application to
engineering, to give them hands-on experience in various aspects of engineering
and science, and to provide mentors and role models, with the result that they
will elect to take and persist in math and science courses in high school that
will qualify them for post-secondary education leading to careers in engineering
and/or science. The college proposes to accomplish these goals through
activities planned for a six-week summer program for students followed by a
series of after-school sessions one day a week during the academic year.
Interaction with local industries relevant to individual projects is also
planned in the form of plant visits and a day in industry one-on-one as
understudies to practicing engineering or scientists. The program will be an
expansion of two different pilot programs that have been conducted successfully
during the past few months with groups of underachiever junior high students.
