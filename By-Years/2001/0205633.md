This project brings together two disciplines, computer science and artificial
intelligence on the one hand, and economics and game theory on the other, and by
doing so addresses some fundamental problems of computing in the Internet era.
Some of the problems addressed are rooted directly in today's Internet
applications: How do you charge for network usage so as to smooth out peaks in
the demand? How do you incent people to contribute personal information and
recommendations in recommender systems and discretionary databases? While this
project is motivated by its potential application to electronic commerce, the
focus is on foundational matters. Computing in the Internet era means computing
in the context of multiple self-interested entities, which in turn means that
reasoning about computing must take the incentives of these entities into
account. This, in turn, calls for a fundamental integration of ideas from
computer science (such as fault tolerance, fairness, verification, algorithms,
complexity, graphical models of uncertainty, machine learning) with elements of
game theory (such as mechanism design, equilibrium analysis, game
representations, learning, and agency theory). The outcome is expected to
benefit electronic commerce, but also more fundamentally to help lay the
foundations for a new area of research called "non-cooperative computing."
