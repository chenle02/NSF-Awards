The Natural Science and Mathematics Department is acquiring an integrated
microscope/video camera system to significantly improve the impact and range of
topics that can be effectively prresented in the biology curriculum. The
microscopes are equipped with phase contrast optics and are capable of
interfacing with either the video camera or with existing still cameras. One
microscope is further equipped with epifluorescence illumination; the other is
equipped for Momarski Differential Interference Contrast. This system permits
the department to more clearly present basic materials in the introductory
courses for majors and non-majors, allows the advanced courses to pursue more
sophisticated and relevant laboratory exercises, and provides advanced students
with greater opportunities for independent research. Furthermore, the equipment
will enable the department to illustrate and make available to education majors
a very powerful tool for presentation, and to present short courses and
workshops for the local educational community on both content and pedagogic
themes. The college is contributing an amount equal to the award.
