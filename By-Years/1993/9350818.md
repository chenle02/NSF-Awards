A computer laboratory for enhancing the teaching and learning of calculus will
be established. The investigators have developed open-ended laboratory projects
to be worked by teams of students. The proposed laboratory will allow further
implementation of Georgia Tech's Calculus Reform program. The laboratory will be
used by students working on team projects and will be used for in-class
instruction on the use of the computer algebra system Mathematica.
