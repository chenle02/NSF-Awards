Set theory underlies all of mathematics. The two main avenues to laying the
foundations of set theory rely either on axioms postulating large cardinal
numbers or on various axioms about the determinacy of so-called set theoretic
games. Woodin will investigate the relationship between large cardinals and
determinacy, descriptive set theory in the context of determinacy, and the
possibilities for the definability of the well-ordering of the reals in the
presence of very large cardinals. He also intends to investigate the global
structure of the Turing degrees and of more general degree structures. The basic
question concerns rigidity.
