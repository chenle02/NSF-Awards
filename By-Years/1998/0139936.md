It is proposed to conduct local spectroscopic and potentiometric measurements on
submicron scale devices to investigate some of the most interesting issues in
mesoscopic physics. The tools that will be developed will enable a host of new
experimental investigations that would not be possible by any other
means.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The probe to be used in these studies is scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM), one that has been used extensively in recent years
to investigate structures on the nanometer scale. The requirements of the
proposed experiments necessitate the assembly of a number of experimental
techniques in one experimental tool, which has not been done before. After
assembly of the instrument, the experiments to be performed involve imaging the
magnetic vortices created in a superconducting film by an external magnetic
field, and by the magnetic field emanating from ferromagnetic particles embedded
in the film. The project will entail a close collaboration with Professor Herve'
Courtois' group at the CRTBT in Grenoble,
France.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ferromagnets are becoming increasingly important as
components of a wide variety of potentially useful devices. These experiments
seek to answer a number of fundamental questions regarding the properties of
ferromagnets on the nanometer scale, and their interactions with other materials
such as superconductors. Given the increasing importance of scanning probe
microscopies in investigating and characterizing the properties of nanoscale
systems, the students involved in this project will be well-trained in
techniques that will be useful in their future careers, whether those careers
are in industry, academia, or government laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;
