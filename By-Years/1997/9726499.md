National Center for Improving Science Education is investigating how reform in
mathematics education in the middle school grades has been received by the
public and how school personnel in these districts have responded to this public
reaction. Visits are made to five reform sites to conduct interviews with school
personnel, parents, and other community members identified as taking a position
on mathematics education reform.
