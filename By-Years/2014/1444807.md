This award provides funding to the University of Southern California for the
support of the NSE Education Workshop to be held in Arlington, Virginia on
December 11-12, 2014. The workshop will be under the direction of Dr. James
Murday and co-funded by the NSF Directorate for Engineering and the Directorate
for Education and Human Resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop
will address the challenges/opportunities facing nanoscale science/engineering
education (NSEE) worldwide, with special attention to: a) an assessment of the
global NSEE efforts to see what has been working best; b) the goal of scaling up
availability/usage of the best NSEE resources, c) the symbiosis among NSE,
information technology, biology/medicine, and cognitive processes (U.S. BRAIN1
and European Union Brain Project initiatives2); d) the NSEE Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) opportunities engendered by the newly
released U.S. Next Generation K-12 Science Standards3; e) changing needs in the
workforce as nanotechnology continues its rapid market penetration; f) the need
and possible mechanisms for ongoing public education and engagement with
nanoscale science, engineering, and technology; and g) roles for NSEE in
broadening participation in the STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed workshop will address the NSE needs for all the stages of education.
This integrated approach is necessary since the stages of education are all
interrelated.
