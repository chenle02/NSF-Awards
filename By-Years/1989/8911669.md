This is a project to carry out trace element and isotopic analyses on samples
from the East Pacific Rise at 9> 16' to 9> 40' N and 13> 30' to 15> N that have
been obtained by dredging on a fine scale. The objectives are to investigate
trace element and isotopic heterogeneity among lavas from a single magma
chamber, to study nature of ridge segmentation and its controls on fine scale
geochemistry, examine temporal variability and test hypothesis the local Pb-Pb
correlations are isochrons recording the age of local mantle heterogeneity. %%%
One of the most interesting results of geochemical measurements on rocks dredged
from the sea floor in recent years has been fine scale variations of composition
along the axis of mid-ocean ridges where the rocks are formed. These
compositional variations appear to be related to tectonic segmentation of the
ocean ridge axes themselves, but the details are not well understood. This
project, being carried out by an established geochemist (White) and a bright
young geochemist (Castillo), who was engaged in the initial collection on the
sample set, on a suite of rocks from an area where much geophysical data exists,
should yield significant insight into the relationship between tectonic and
magmatic segmentation of ridge crests.
