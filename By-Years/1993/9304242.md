The Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics and the
Department o Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of Northwestern
University propose to purchase a Silicon Graphics IRIS Crimson/VGXT graphics
workstation together with peripheral equipment to allow for hard copy and video
output. The equipment will be used to provide graphical analysis and animations
for the following research projects: . Visualization of the complex spatial and
temporal patterns that occur in combustion. . Visualization of the development
of microstructures in solidification. . Visualization of complex spatial
patterns an temporal dynamics governed by Ginzburg-Landau, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
and other generic amplitude equations. . Visualization of both the spatial
structure and the evolution of shear bands in viscoplasticity.
