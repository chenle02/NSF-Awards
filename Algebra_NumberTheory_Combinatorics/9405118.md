9405118 Keef This award supports research on p-local abelian groups, that is
modules over the integers localized at the prime p. The principal investigator
will apply some of the new approaches of abelian group theory to the theory of
p-alpha-purity. Of particular importance are tools stemming from the increasing
interplay between set-theory and abelian groups, recent work on the structure of
the torsion product, important structure theorems relating to the class of IT
groups, the theory of valuated groups and vector spaces, and the higher derived
functors of the inverse limit. This project is in the general area of abelian
group theory and is concerned with the classification of abelian groups.
Although the classification of finite abelian groups has been well understood
for a century, the classification of infinite abelian groups remains elusive.
This research involves this old problem of classification of the infinite
abelian groups approached by new tools from logic and topology.
