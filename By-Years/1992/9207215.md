One of the basic goals of evolutionary biology is to assess the extent and the
nature of the genetic variability that occurs in natural populations and to
determine the roles that different types if variants play in adaptive
evolutionary change. In recent years, a great deal of information has been
obtained about the variability of DNA sequences in natural populations. However,
there is still very little information about the possible effects of the
sequence variants on the phenotype of the organism. The general goal of this
project is to begin to fill this gap by determining the molecular basis (in
terms of DNA sequence variations) of naturally occurring variation in the
expression of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) in model organism, the
fruit fly Drosophila.The specific goals of the project are briefly summarized
below.Previous studies have shown that a large part of the genetic variation of
ADH activity levels within D. melanogaster populations is associated with the
segregation of two common allozymes, which differ by a single amino acid, Fast
homozygotes generally have a two to three fold higher activity level than Slow
homozygotes for two reasons: they have a higher concentration of ADH protein and
the Fast protein has a higher catalytic efficiency. One specific goal of the
proposed work is to determine what DNA sequence alteration(s) cause this ADH
concentration difference between the allozymic classes. A second specific goal
is to investigate the genetic and molecular of a threefold difference in ADH
expression between two species, D. simulans and sechellia.
