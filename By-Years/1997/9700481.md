Motif-based hidden Markov models (MHMMs) are a new extension of hidden Markov
models (HMMs), which are the most promising method available for characterizing
families of biological sequences. An MHMM is an HMM based on conserved regions
(i.e. motifs) within a family of biological sequences, as discovered by our
existing MEME software. Motif models discovered by MEME serve conceptually as
individual model states in an MHMM. Therefore, Unlike traditional HMMs, MHMMs
closely model only the relatively highly conserved regions of the proteins in a
family. Therefore, MHMMs will be trainable from small datasets. In addition,
MHMMs will have a more general topology than standard HMMs, which are linear, so
MHMMs will be capable of modeling repeated occurrences of a motif in a single
sequence. Although MHMMs are applicable to genetic sequences. the work proposed
here will focus on families of protein sequences. This proposal describes plans
to develop the algorithms necessary to train MHMMs. Our software will be made
available through a web server, like our existing MEME software Grundy et al.,
1996 .
