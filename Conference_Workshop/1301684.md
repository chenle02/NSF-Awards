This award will provide support for participants, especially women and
mathematicians from other under-represented groups, graduate students, postdocs,
and young faculty, to the Maryland Dynamics Conference. This is a long-standing
series of conferences that are held each spring at the University of Maryland at
College Park. The award will fund the 2013, 2014 and 2015 iterations of this
conference.

The semi-annual Maryland Dynamics Conference is a spring workshop/conference.
This workshop first met at Penn State in 1991. It has hosted by Maryland each
spring and by Penn State each fall since 1992. The workshop is devoted to recent
progress in dynamical systems and related fields. It have been regularly
attracting leading experts in the field. Such outstanding mathematicians as
Fefferman, Furstenberg, Lindenstrauss. Margulis, Mather, Ornstein, Sinai, Yoccoz
