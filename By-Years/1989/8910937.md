This research activity is supported under the Research Opportunities for Women
- - Planning Grant Program. This award will allow the principal investigator to
begin to assess how the political effectiveness of an interest group is related
to the group's ability to mobilize members. The planning grant activity will
explore the link between individual member motives and group mobilization
strategies. The principal investigator will develop a plan for investigating the
kinds of mobilization strategies that interest group leaders pursue and the
conditions under which particular types of appeals are more effective than
others. The investigator has a solid background for this type of research and
the issues to be addressed are both timely and important. There is good reason
to believe that, consistent with the objectives of the Research Opportunities
for Women Program, this award may result in a successful follow-up proposal.
