Prinicipal Investigator: Paul Humke This award furnishes support for the 22nd
meeting (June 23-27, 1998, at the University of California-Santa Barbara) of a
continuing series of Real Analysis Symposia that have been held at different
U.S. and international sites virtually every year since 1978, in the process
becoming the major international meeting each year devoted to Real Analysis.
That term is to be construed here in a broad sense, so as to include not only
classical measure and integration theory but also such topics as geometric
measure theory. In addition to meeting the usual objectives of the Symposia, the
1998 conference will serve as a medium for public recognition of the lifetime
contributions of Andrew Bruckner to the field.
