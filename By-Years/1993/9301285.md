Higher, thicker landfills with steeper side slopes raise legitimate concerns
about slope stability and liner integrity, particularly during earthquakes. The
most important landfill properties for seismic safety are moduli and shear
strength. The objective of this research is: a. to investigate techniques for
characterization of landfills and other highly nonhomogeneous materials
containing large aggregate; b. develop correlations between seismic velocity
measurements and landfill shear strength measurements, and use these
correlations to develop three- dimensional profile of shear strength variation
within a landfill section; c. apply the methodology to one existing landfill.
