This project is focused on investigating the nucleation or formation of very
small new particles in the atmosphere. The method relies on complex calculations
involving the structural and thermochemical properties of atmospheric clusters.
Modeling results will be compared with measurements where they are available.
The project will result in nucleation schemes that can be incorporated into
regional and global models to reduce uncertainties in the assessment of the
climatic and environmental impacts of atmospheric aerosols.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this effort is to develop new schemes of
multicomponent nucleation in the atmosphere involving sulfuric acid, water,
ammonia, methylamines, and organics. The project consists of 4 tasks: (1)
Quantum chemistry studies of neutral and charged ternary clusters; (2)
Development of new nucleation models; (3) Application and evaluation of new
nucleation schemes in the atmosphere; and (4) Assessing the climate implications
of ternary nucleation processes. The implications of the new nucleation schemes
on the aerosol indirect radiative forcing will be evaluated using the GEOS-Chem
model.
