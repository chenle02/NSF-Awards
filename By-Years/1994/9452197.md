9452197 Dewey The Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, as part of the
effort to insure that graduates are environmentally literate as well as
technically competent, is restructuring the Civil Engineering Materials course
sequence. Unifying themes of the revised three course sequence include an
awareness of the environmental impact of material acquisition and use along with
the development and use of material evaluation protocols as decision making
tools. The course sequence includes an introductory class in civil engineering
material properties, a class in civil engineering composites, and a class in
properties of soils. Laboratory experiences are considered important to the
understanding and appreciation of material behavior, and these revised materials
classes will provide extensive hands-on opportunities to understand experimental
procedures and determine material properties. The laboratory experience will
start with manual equipment operation and data collection and progress to
computer controlled experiments coupled with automated data collection and
display. Materials considered and characterized include traditional construction
materials as well as industrial and post-consumer residuals. An awareness of
non-conventional or novel materials will permit graduate engineers to
effectively utilize these materials as an important part of pollution prevention
efforts. One of the manual universal test frames and a data acquisition system
procured under this project will be mounted on a portable cart to permit
classroom demonstrations in later design classes.
