The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project is advancing new language learning by incorporating facial and
lip recognition along with sound analysis. This visual aspect of creating sounds
is vital for mastering pronunciation, one of the significant hurdles of learning
a foreign language and even improving a native language. Current language
learning methods often fall short in helping learners achieve speaking
proficiency and fail to provide real-life language usage experiences. This
language learning platform aims to change this by addressing the growing need
for multi-language proficiency in workplaces and academic settings, providing an
effective and engaging language learning experience.

Current language learning methods and apps often fail to develop speaking and
writing proficiency, focusing instead on memorization and standardized tests.
This language trainer addresses this gap by offering insights into the science
of speech production. By combining visual cues of oral shapes with auditory
input, learners can master pronunciation, a significant challenge in language
acquisition. This research will include obtaining near-perfect voice files for
machine learning model training, signal processing of the voice and video files,
development and comparison of machine learning models, data visualization
development, incorporation into the mobile test suite, and preliminary testing.
The machine learning algorithms will use the insights extracted from students'
voice data to provide learners with highly targeted, fine-tuned activities.
