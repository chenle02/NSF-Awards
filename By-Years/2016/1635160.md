It has become increasingly challenging to match supply and demand as firms have
extended their supply chains to a global scale. One major concern for many
multi-national firms with global supply networks is supply uncertainty,
especially supply disruption. Another big concern is the reduced responsiveness
due to longer lead times. Dual-sourcing has been commonly implemented in
practice as an effective strategy to mitigate supply risks and provide a
tradeoff between cost and responsiveness. This practice calls for advanced dual-
sourcing models that incorporate supply uncertainty and large replenishment lead
times simultaneously, and the development and analysis of effective inventory
strategies. The objective of this research is to provide a comprehensive
understanding of complex dual-sourcing systems as well as provide new insights
and analytical tools to handle this level of complexity. The research has the
potential to provide new tools and methodologies to effectively manage value
chain systems and thus improve companies' competitive advantage. In addition, it
will provide educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students,
and has the potential to broaden participation of underrepresented groups and
minorities through the Multi-Cultural Engineering Recruitment for Graduate
Education Program (MERGE) at the University of Illinois.

If successful, the results of this project will have a significant impact on the
theory and practice of dual-sourcing inventory optimization. First, the research
will develop novel transformation techniques to convert non-convex minimization
problems to equivalent convex minimization problems applicable to complex dual-
sourcing models. Second, the research will, provide theoretic support of several
heuristics widely used in practice, design new efficient algorithms, and explore
potential applications of the advanced methodologies developed under the
auspices of this project in other problems.
