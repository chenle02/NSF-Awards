O-minimal structures are tame expansions of the field of the real numbers in the
sense that every set which is definable in such a structure (namely, a set which
can be described using the languauge of the structure) has finitely many
connected components. There are many applications of o-minimality to various
areas of mathematics and recently such applications were found to arithmetic and
algebraic geometry, yielding new proofs to classical problems (the Manin-Mumford
conjecture) and and solving some open cases of the Andre-Oort conjecture. This
proposed research project intends to take some of the ingredients which appeared
in these recent applications to arithmetic and extend them to a more general
setting (locally symmetric spaces), with the hope that such results will enable
to solve other open cases of similar conjectures. An important feature of the
proposed research is the inter-play between infinite discrete objects (eg.
arithmetics groups or periodic functions), which are not definable in o-minimal
structures, and their trace on definable sets in such structures. The goal is to
prove definability of classical periodic maps when restricted to appropriate
definable sets, and then to explore the implications which this definability
might have on the periodic sets and functions.

Model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, studies sets definable in
mathematical structures by first-order formulas. In many cases it allows one to
eliminate wild phenomenas and to provide a rigorous definition of a tame
geometry. This approach is useful for solving problems in areas such as number
theory and arithmetic geometry. This project proposes to use tamness of various
structures to answer some open problems in arithmetic geometry which is a very
important area of mathematics.
