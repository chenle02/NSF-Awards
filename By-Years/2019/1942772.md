Privacy concerns are becoming a major obstacle to using data, and it is often
unclear how current regulations should translate into technology. As
differential privacy and other privacy tools are brought to bear in practice,
new challenges arise in ensuring these applications maintain the privacy
guarantees intended by theory. How, then, should organizations utilize advances
in privacy technologies to make use of potentially sensitive data? This project
bridges the gap between theory and practice in the formal study of privacy by
addressing new technical challenges that arise when theoretical privacy
technologies are implemented in real-world settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project addresses three main technical questions: Firstly, how should a data
curator optimally allocate a fixed differential privacy budget across multiple
analysis tasks, to trade off the value of accurate analysis with the privacy
budget? Secondly, how do people reason about and value their privacy in
practice, and how do these valuations change based on context of the data or
analysis task? Thirdly, how should markets for personal data be regulated to
protect individual privacy and population-level fairness, while still enabling
valuable data-driven decision making? Answering these questions requires an
interdisciplinary approach that integrates tools from computer science for
differentially private algorithm design, economics to understand incentives of
organizations and individuals, and public policy for regulation of privacy
technologies. To ensure the broad impact of this research, this project also
includes a significant educational and outreach component, including curriculum
development, mentorship of students, and workshop organization aimed at
improving diversity in graduate education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
