This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an
economically competitive, novel, catalytic process for low temperature
hydrocarbon partial oxidation. An innovative process for ethylene epoxidation
will be developed as a commercially significant application. Most heterogeneous
hydrocarbon partial oxidation reactions utilize engineered catalysts, which
incorporate novel promoters to enhance selectivity. However, reactor heat
management significantly impacts process energy efficiency, catalyst
selectivity, and ultimately, process profitability. The Phase II project will
develop an innovative process for hydrocarbon partial oxidation which addresses
these issues. In Phase I, technical and economic viability of the novel process
was demonstrated. The Phase II project will focus on the intrinsic reaction
kinetics, heat transfer, and mass transport. A continuous ethylene epoxidation
process will be demonstrated at the bench-scale and small pilot-scale in novel,
three-phase reactors. In addition, an engineering process design and cost
analysis will be developed.

The commercial application from this project will be the heterogeneous
hydrocarbon partial oxidation, if successful would greatly increase raw material
and energy efficiency as well as increase process profitability in the chemical
and petrochemical industries.
