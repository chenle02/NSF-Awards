This project is in the area of computational biology; specifically, problems
which deal with how to construct evolutionary trees, or phylogeny, (i.e., models
of the evolutionary history of various species). There are three standard
criteria on which tree construction algorithms are based: distance methods,
maximum likelihood, and parsimony. The first two methods are used by the
biologists and are dealt with in the statistical literature. The traditional
algorithms literature for tree construction is focused on the parsimony methods;
notably the Perfect Phylogeny Problem. Although this problem has significant
combinatorial appeal, there is a gap between the results for this algorithmic
theory and the theory for distance based tree construction methods. The project
focuses on problems in the distance based phylogeny, including: (1) Methods for
computing distances from strings; (2) Methods for comparing different trees for
consensus; (3) Methods for fitting distance data to metric models. The second
part of the project involves developing empirical methods for testing the
statistical robustness of heuristic methods currently in use. The Educational
Component of this CAREER Grant includes: (a) Development and implementation of a
post doctoral training program in computational molecular biology at DIMACS; (b)
Modification of the graduate seminar in biocomputing; (c) Development and
modification of the Rutgers University undergraduate program in biomathematics
which focuses on combinatorics and molecular biology.
