A workshop on the future directions of probability will be held in Arlington,
Virginia, May 29-31, 2002. The purpose of the workshop is to discuss the future
of probability, both as a discipline and as a component of research in other
areas of science and engineering. Participants in the workshop will include
prominent researchers in probability theory, as well as researchers at the
boundaries of probability with other areas. A general interest paper is expected
to be generated by the workshop participants and disseminated widely.
