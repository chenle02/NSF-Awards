Exponential improvements in computing performance known as the Moore's law, that
drove economic growth in the 20th century, are now perceived to be stalled due
to fundamental barriers of power dissipation and bandwidth associated with
electronic circuits. The workshop will explore future possibilities of new types
of logic circuits and interconnects to address the technical challenges
associated with low power computing. Specifically, the Electrical Communications
and Cyber Systems (ECCS) Division in the Engineering Directorate at NSF, and the
Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF) Division at the Computer
Information Sciences and Engineering (CISE) Directorate at NSF are holding a
workshop in collaboration with the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) to
explore the future research directions in the domain of low power electronics as
may be required to satisfy the needs of next generation computing by the
semiconductor industry. The invitation only workshop will assemble leading
experts in the field from both academia and industry research laboratories for a
period of two days. The workshop will generate a report which may form the basis
for NSF and SRC to formulate new programs and/or modify existing programs in the
area.
