This project will continue development of techniques to extract better
information about the kinematics of mid-ocean ridge spreading center evolution
from seafloor lineation data. The project will address the difficults that
marine magnetic data are limited in their resolution. The technique to be
developed here will use as many lineated structures as possible near the
spreading center. Synthetic fabric is then generated for the entire region,
assuming that the lineations reflect isochrons, and the fit between the data and
models is numerically measured to provide an objective estimate of the fit.
