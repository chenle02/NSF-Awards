This award will support a Synthesis Workshop to identify community-based
perspectives, research imperatives, and policy needs linked to the interactions
of ice, water and global climate. This workshop will precede and assist in the
science community in preparation for the emerging U.N. International Year for
Snow and Ice and the Celebrating Glaciers campaigns. It is the intention of the
organizer to bring together key representatives of the cryospheric-hydrologic-
social science research, policy, education, and outreach communities to
elaborate plans for creating a transdisciplinary ice-snow-water nexus
communication community, as well as set the groundwork for creating strategies
and toolkits for effectively communicating science to the public and to policy
makers.

The workshop has as its themes, interdisciplinarity, innovation, integration and
engagement. In order to have the full engagement in the workshop sessions, the
PI suggests limiting it to 10-15 people with expertise in producing, using, and
communicating science. The goal of the workshop being to bring together a key
group of earth system and interdisciplinary social scientists, users of natural
and social science knowledge - people who can articulate their needs and
interests in science products e.g., policy makers, environmental managers, and
public stakeholders, and education and outreach experts, including public
relations practitioners.

The proposed workshop is structured as a three day meeting: the first two days
will be conference-style, consisting of plenary talks, discussion, and breakout
sessions focused; the final day will be an intensive writing workshop to
synthesize key knowledge production from the prior two days. The final results
of the meeting will be a short community-reviewed report summarizing key issues,
common challenges, general lessons and ideas for steps forward that emerged
during the workshop.
