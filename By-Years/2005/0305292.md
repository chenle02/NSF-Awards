Under this award, the PIs will use finite-element viscous flow models to study
the different melting mechanisms likely to be occurring beneath volcanic arcs.
The three main mechanisms to be studied are: flux melting from hydration of the
mantle wedge from the subducting slab, decompression melting that occurs when a
temperature-dependent mantle rheology is considered, and possible sediment
melting at the subducting slab surface. Different arcs can have large
differences in the amount of magmatic production and may also vary in the
relative production of each melting mechanism. The PIs will investigate the
various parameters affecting the production of each melting mechanism such as
slab dip, subduction rate, subducting and overlying plate ages, etc. Some
parameters will have a greater influence on one mechanism than another, leading
to the possibility that the dominant melting mechanism could change from one arc
to another, and affecting what is observed at real arcs.
