9708659 Stepp The strategic plan (April 1996) for the National Earthquake Loss
Reduction Program (NEP) opens with the statement, "Although earthquakes are
inevitable natural hazards, they need not be inevitable disasters. Through
prudent actions our nation can reduce losses of life, casualties, property
losses, and social and economic disruptions from future earthquakes." This is a
renewal of the national commitment to managing losses in earthquakes that
motivated implementation of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program
(NEHRP) in 1977. An integral part of the NEP goals is the availability of an
adequate data base of strong motion information. Given the broad need for strong
motion data to develop earthquake loss reduction measures, recent studies of the
key needs for earthquake engineering and earthquake hazard mitigation have
emphasized the need to establish an entity to overview and provide broad
national perspective of needs for strong motion information and to provide
leadership for coordinated development of plans to advance strong motion
programs to meet established national goals and strategic targets for reducing
earthquake losses. The U.S. Committee for Advancement of Strong Motion Programs
(CASMP) was established in 1996 in response to this need. The objective of CASMP
is to provide continuing broad national overview of strong motion program needs
and to encourage advancements in the collection, dissemination and utilization
of strong motion data as a tool for improving public safety in earthquakes. The
Committee plans to accomplish its objectives through a series of workshops
focusing on the identification of national strong motion data needs; assessment
of the degree to which existing strong motion programs meet the national needs
for strong motion data; and facilitation of the development of a national
strategic plan for strong motion programs. The Committee will promote actions to
enhance strong motion programs implementing the national strong motion plan, and
will facilitate development of coordinated international strong motion programs
to augment U.S. programs. This action is to support the first of the workshops
planned. The goal for this workshop is to develop an action plan for strong-
motion programs, referred to as Vision 2005, to mitigate earthquake losses in
urbanized areas. This workshop will be held in Monterey, CA, 2-4 April 1997.
