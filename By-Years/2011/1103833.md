Glaciers: A Chronology of Climate Change is a CRPA project that seeks to explain
the historical cycling of glaciers in the context of climate change. By using
chemical isotopes (Beryllium 10), the age of rocks that have been covered with
glacier ice and exposed to sunlight later can be determined fairly accurately.
Through this method, the glaciation cycles have been determined for the last
70,000 years. In collaboration between the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at
Columbia University and the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), this
project is designed to impact adult audiences, youth in grades 6th-12th, and
teachers writ large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research results shall be
expressed via an eight-minute high definition film for large screen viewing in
the "Science Bulletins" section of the AMNH and the affiliated museums. A
rigorous front-end evaluation will be used to inform the presentation and assess
audience impact. Subsequent formative evaluations are designed to measure the
learning impact of the film and the retention of longer term
concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that more than 700,000
individuals will have access to current, scientifically accurate data and
related information on glaciation cycles and climate change through the
educational film and website. Materials will be easily accessible to teachers
and the film will be closed captioned in both English and Spanish.
