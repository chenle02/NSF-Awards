In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, the PI will conduct research on the properties and behaviors
of individual nucleobases, nucleosides and nucleotides, with controlled numbers
of water molecules. Experiments will be done by laser spectroscopy of water
clusters, formed with laser desorbed, jet cooled bases. Molecular dynamics
simulations and state-of-the-art nonempirical chemical ab initio calculations
will complement the experimental work. Graduate and undergraduate students as
well as postdoctoral associates will participate in the research. In addition,
an outreach program is focused on minority students and high schools, and the
development of a web based interface to facilitate access to science museum
resources by grade school science teachers.
