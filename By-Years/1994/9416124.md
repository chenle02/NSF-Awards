The long term goal of this research is to understand the cell signaling that
occurs between Arabidopsis pollen (and/or pollen tubes) and the pistil. This
proposal initiates an investigation of the molecules essential for pollen-stigma
communication. Previous analyses of male- sterile cer6-2 Arabidopsis plants
showed they produce pollen lacking a normal extracellular coating. While this
coating is essential for communication with the stigma, it is not clear which of
its components (lipids, proteins, small molecules) play a critical role in
communication. This proposal is aimed at characterizing further the signaling
component(s). These experiments rely on recently developed methods for obtaining
large quantities of pollen and for extracting the pollen coating. When the
extracted wild type pollen coat is dried and added to the cer6-2 pollen, it
restores fertility, providing a bioassay; this bioassay will allow initial
purification of the active pollen coat components. Specifically, the coating
from wild type grains will be fractionated and each fraction will be added
separately to the mutant cer6-2 pollen. Restoration of fertility will identify
the active fraction(s). Recent experiments have shown that the Arabidopsis
pollen coating contains only a few proteins. One or more of these proteins may
play a significant role i interaction with the stigma, including adhesion of
pollen to the stigmatic cells or communication with the stigma. The fractions
prepared for the bioassay experiments will also be used to characterize the
protein components.
