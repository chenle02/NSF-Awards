9457268 Glaser The research plan focuses on application of nondestructive
evaluation techniques to geotechnical engineering, combining elements of
electrical and mechanical engineering with the rich heritage of geotechnical
engineering. The plan attacks on two sales. 1. Diagnostic acoustic emission
analysis of rock failure mechanism for real-time monitoring. 2. Application of
recursive system identification to soils excited by earthquake strong motion for
anlaysis of nonlinear behavior and damping. ***
