Most of the populated regions of the world are concentrated in valleys, that
is, on sedimentary deposits composed of different layers of cohesionless and
cohesive soils, including nonplastic and plastic silts. The phenomenon of the
amplification of ground motion in sedimentary deposits, as well as the loss of
bearing capacity in all types of soils, and the liquefaction of saturated sandy
or silty soils due to earthquake shaking, are only partially understood. The
engineering properties if all soil materials (gravel, sand, silt, clay) under
irregular seismic loads must be known in order to fully understand the above
phenomena. This research project involves a laboratory investigation and
analytical modelling of the response of saturated silty soils to irregular
seismic loads. Loading conditions corresponding to the propagation of seismic
waves will be simulated in the laboratory using cyclic direct simple shear and
cyclic triaxial devices. Degradation of soil stiffness during cyclic loading,
the associated variation of cyclic pore pressure, and the rules governing
irregular cyclic stress-strain behavior are being investigated. The results
obtained for silty soils are being compared to the corresponding available
results on sands and clays. This comparison provides a basis for the development
of mathematical models for the reduction in stiffness and the development of
pore water pressure, valid for all three types of soils.
