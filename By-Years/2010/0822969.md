Neurons in the brain analyze the sensory world by making appropriate neural
connections during development despite an ever-changing environment. This
process occurs during a sensitive period of early brain development and requires
specialized receptors found at the synapses (connections) between neurons. The
NMDA receptor is one such critical receptor. Although this receptor has
traditionally been thought to function only at postsynaptic sites, recent
evidence suggests an importance for NMDARs at presynaptic sites. Currently, the
role of presynaptic NMDA receptors is poorly understood. The goal of this
project is to determine how presynaptic NMDA receptors regulate neurotransmitter
release and why this regulation is important for the development of appropriate
neural connections. The proposed studies will specifically test the central
hypothesis that plasticity mediated by presynaptic NMDA receptors is required
for the normal development of early sensory functions within the brain. By
demonstrating that presynaptic NMDA receptors contribute to early forms of
neural plasticity, and that their contributions may shift with development, the
findings from this proposal are expected to define a novel property of synaptic
plasticity in emerging cortical circuits. Moreover, a fundamental understanding
of the unique differences between presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDA receptors
will aid future pharmacological manipulations that target NMDA receptors for the
treatment of neurological disorders. The goals of this proposal will be met
through promoting the involvement of underrepresented minorities in this
intensive neuroscience research project.
