Displacement chromatography will be applied to increasingly complex biological
mixtures. Chromatographic columns operated in the displacement mode will be
subjected to alternate modes of operation prior to the displacement step to
further increase throughput and purity. New displacer compounds will be
identified and synthesized. The research will address fundamental questions
about critical physico-chemical properties of displacers and help establish
guidelines for selection of appropriate displacers for specific bioseparations.
Group-specific affinity chromatographic materials will be investigated for use
in the displacement mode. Emphasis will be on scale-up and optimization rules.
Downstream bioprocessing is critical to commercial scale biotechnology.
Production-scale displacement chromatography may prove to be a workhorse of the
emerging industry. This work will help assure an adequate engineering knowledge
base is developed in a timely manner so that US industries will be able to take
a lead in international commercialization of biotechnology.
