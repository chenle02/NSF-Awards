The Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History will construct a new 9,000
square foot Bird Hall utilizing interactive exhibitry in a unique combination
with original mounted specimens. The exhibition will cover avian biology in a
comprehensive fashion, including the physiology of flight, adaptation, behavior,
ecology and species diversity as well as traditional systematics. The exhibition
will be directed at all levels of visitors, from small children to well informed
adults; birds represent a familiar and powerful vehicle through which modern
biology can be presented. A broad range of educational techniques will be used,
including specimens, interactive exhibit stations, electronic media, and modern
walk through habitat groups. Substantial formative evaluation and audience
surveys will precede detailed design and construction, and leading
ornithologists will serve as advisors and consultants. More than 80% of the
total $3.2 million cost of exhibition development will come from county and
private sources, and the exhibition will be seen by more than 1,000,000 visitors
a year.
