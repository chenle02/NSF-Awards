The First International Symposium on Particles, Strings, and Cosmology will be
held at Northeastern University during the period March 27-31, 1990. The
Symposium is planned to be interdisciplinary in nature and will cover a wide
range of subjects in particle physics, string theory and cosmology and their
interconnections. There have been important recent developments in these fields,
and the Symposium will serve the important function of exposing researchers in
each of these fields to the developments in the others.
