Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-0313717&lt;br/&gt;Hinch/Rutgers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
detailed spectroscopic characterization of adsorbed cyanide, isocyanide, and
isocyanate molecular species on transition metal surfaces is the focus of this
research project. With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, Professor Hinch and her colleagues in the Chemistry Department at
Rutgers University, are using time of flight inelastic helium atom scattering
methods to probe the low frequency frustrated translational and rotational
motions of these adsorbed species. Using this state of the art instrumentation,
detailed information about the interaction potential energy surface that governs
these adsorbate-surface processes is obtained. Information from this work
provides the fundamental underpinning for the development of catalytically
active surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The very low frequency motions of small
molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces can only be effectively probed by the
scattering of helium atoms in a high resolution inelastic scattering apparatus.
This information is crucial to the understanding of molecular motion on
surfaces, and their subsequent reaction mechanisms and rates. Professor Hinch
and her colleagues at Rutgers are using this unique approach to study the
detailed interactions of small nitrogen and carbon containing molecular species
with platinum and copper surfaces. This work provides fundamental understanding
of catalytic and corrosion processes.&lt;br/&gt;
