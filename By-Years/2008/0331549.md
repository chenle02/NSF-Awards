This project will attempt to develop an interferometric synthetic aperature
sonar system for use on oceanographic research ships. Two technical developments
will be necessary: formation of a synthetic aperature sonar image, and
differencing the phase of the reference and repeat images to form a sonar
interferogram. The simrad EM120 multibeam system on the R/V Roger Revelle will
be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
