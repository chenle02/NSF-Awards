This research will concentrate on an investigation of integral representations
of Dirichlet series, L-functions, automorphic forms and related objects. The
kernels of interest for the integral representations are Eisenstein series on
reductive algebraic groups or some suitable "fragments" of such Eisenstein
series. Results on the nature of special values, analytic continuations and
functional equations would follow from the existence of such integral
representations. This research will focus on various analytic functions that
encode important number theoretic information. This technique allows one to
apply the deep results of analysis to obtain number theoretic information. A
basic analytic tool is to represent these functions as integrals of functions
which are better understood. That is precisely what the P.I. intends to do and
has done so successfully in the past.
