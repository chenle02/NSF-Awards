This project aims to advance stereo vision and optical flow algorithms to work
in challenging real-world conditions. It contributes novel algorithmic
approaches, new high-resolution datasets with ground truth, and an update to the
Middlebury benchmarks.

The algorithmic advances include fast matching algorithms that employ
radiometric and geometric self-calibration, including smart data terms that
establish noise and color models during the matching process, and novel layer-
based surface reconstruction algorithms with explicit reasoning about half-
occluded regions, reflections, and transparency. The new datasets reflect
current challenges, including high-resolution images of real-world scenes with
complex occlusions, specular surfaces and reflections under different
illuminations and taken with different cameras. Undergraduate students are
actively involved in all components of this research.

The project has strong potential impact along several fronts. The new datasets
and benchmarks challenge the community and serve as catalysts for new research.
The algorithmic advances allow harnessing the explosion of images available
online, and enable real-world applications such as automated driving,
geolocation, and automatic 3D reconstruction of whole cities. Finally, the
project exposes undergraduates at a liberal-arts college in rural Vermont to the
world of research, experimentation, and discovery.
