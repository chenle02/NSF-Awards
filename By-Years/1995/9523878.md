Receptor modeling is a cross-disciplinary research area that finds chemical
fingerprints of pollution sources. Receptor models use methods from
chemometrics, chemistry, statistics, and image analysis, as well as many other
fields. These models commonly use principal component analysis, and factor
methods as their main ingredients. Receptor modeling requires good scientific
knowledge to reasonably model observed data. For example, knowing that acetylene
is a tracer for motor vehicle emissions is essential to successful receptor
modeling. The methods that this research develops will be used to provide
fingerprint identification of pollution sources. The research will also provide
a firm mathematical basis for the methods. This research provides a firm
chemometric and statistical basis for receptor modeling and is an important
contribution to the Federal Strategic Area of the Environment. Receptor models
will serve as unbiased scientific evidence for identifying pollution sources.
Receptor models should be able to stand untarnished in legislative and court
proceedings.
