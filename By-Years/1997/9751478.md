To promote manufacturing education and prepare engineering students to face the
challenges of manufacturing in the future, this project provides a flexible
assembly line and a rapid modeling machine for use in an innovative new
manufacturing practicum. The 3-credit-hour manufacturing practicum, available to
all engineering students, provides practical instruction in manufacturing
process engineering, hands-on experience with basic production equipment in a
supervised laboratory, and visits to manufacturing firms to see the current
state of the art. The manufacturing practicum demonstrates through case study
and hands-on experience the importance of efficiency in a production system one
that provides cost-effective, high-quality products that are produced with a
minimal cycle time in a flexible manufacturing environment. The manufacturing
practicum can be taught using the multimedia lecture room and the manufacturing
laboratory and employs tours of manufacturing plants within central North
Carolina. *
