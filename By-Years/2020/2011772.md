This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics and it
addresses the priority areas of NSF's "Windows on the Universe" Big Idea.
Gravitational waves provide a new way of observing the Universe and promise to
revolutionize our understanding of many topics in physics and astronomy. Pulsar
timing arrays (PTAs) use millisecond pulsars to detect low-frequency
gravitational waves, and promising sources in this frequency band include
supermassive binary black holes. Gravitational wave observations of these
sources will help us understand their growth and evolution, as well as the
properties of the galaxies in which they reside. PTAs can also perform
fundamental tests of gravity by determining whether the gravitational waves
emitted by these sources have the properties predicted by general
relativity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research in this proposal focuses on
developing data analysis techniques for PTAs. The PI will use simulations to
study how the significance of the gravitational wave signal evolves over time,
and use these results to design robust pipelines for detecting and
characterizing gravitational waves. The PI will also study ways of optimizing
pulsar timing arrays, such as identifying sky locations to search for new
millisecond pulsars. Finally, the PI will improve methods for combining data
from different telescopes to enhance the sensitivity of PTAs by leveraging the
next-generation radio telescopes currently under construction around the
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
