This award supports a study to develop an optimal telescope design for a new
all-sky survey at 2.2 micrometers. The major scientific goals of the survey are
to study the large scale distribution of galaxies and the large scale
distribution of stars within our Galaxy, without the interference of galactic
dust obscuration. The survey would cover the entire sky at least twice, with
sensitivity sufficient to detect point sources with K magnitude brighter than
14; the data would begin to become publicly available within 1 year after survey
operations end. The baseline system calls for a special-purpose 1-m telescope
and 256 X 256 array detectors. The enormous increase in sensitivity of the
proposed survey compared to previous surveys makes its outcome broadly relevant
to many disciplines. This study will lead to a preferred approach for a
telescope design, as well as realistic estimate of the cost and schedule
required to build it.
