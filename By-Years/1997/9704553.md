9704553 Cava This award provides partial support for a new float zone crystal
growth furnace which will provide suprior samples for materials research. This
furnace employs high intensity light from halogen lamps, focused on a vertically
oriented polycrystalline feed rod, to melt a small zone of material in the rod.
The molten zone is held in place on the rod by surface tension. The rod is
slowly translated with respect to the position of the focused light, moving the
hot zone along the length of the rod. This prevents contamination of the
material from contact with a crucible or container, which is important for
studying intrinsic electronic and magnetic properties. This versatile furnace
will grow crystals for a wide range of materials with different chemistries.
%%%% This equipment will provide superior materials for fundamental materials
properties studies. This will increase our understanding of complex transition
metal oxides, both magnetic and superconducting, and will contribute to the
superconducting and magnetic device technology. ***
