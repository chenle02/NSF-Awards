This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop the so-called Continuous Batch (CB) technology for the massive
production of high quality semiconductor nanocrystals inexpensively. The CB
technology has the following advantages over the most closely competitive
technology, continuous flow production (CFP: It uses much less toxic and less
expensive chemicals as reactants).

To date, production of high quality semiconductor nanocrystals can only be
performed in well-equipped labs and in very small (dozens of milligram)
quantities. The CB's potential for cost savings, improved qualities (i.e. size
distribution, optical absorption, and photoluminescence emission)and the high
productivity (thousand kilograms/year) makes it superior in comparison to the
existing CFP technology.
