Abstract LANGE, A. E. AST-9618798 Funds will be used to upgrade the detector
for the Sunyaev- Zel'dovich Infrared Experiment (SuZIE) to SuZIE II which
includes a larger format detector array and an additional frequency channel.
These modifications are expected to enable SuZIE II to reach scientific goals
which include (1) measurement of the peculiar velocity field at z&gt; 0.1 with a
precision of ~ 250 km/sec; (2) measurement of the arcminute scale anisotropy of
the cosmic microwave background with a precision of delta T/T of &lt; 2 x 10
exp(-6); (3) determination of a value for the Hubble Constant based on a sample
of clusters chosen to minimize selection bias; (4) determination of the number
density of high redshift clusters; and (5) characterization of the confusion due
to unresolved sources in degree-scale cosmic microwave background anisotropy
measurements.
