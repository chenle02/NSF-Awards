The investigator and her colleagues collaborate in a group project at the
Center for BioDynamics (CBD) to provide interdisciplinary education and training
for graduate students and postdoctoral-level investigators in the context of a
vigorous interdisciplinary research program that focuses on areas of mutual
interest in mathematics (especially dynamical systems), biology, and
engineering. Disciplines include mathematics, biomedical engineering,
aerospace/mechanical engineering, biology, psychology, and physics. Training
extends beyond the usual classroom activities by engaging participants in a
variety of research projects as well. One of the major topics is dynamics of the
nervous system. The projects, which involve experiments, modeling, and analysis,
all deal with the variety of rhythms in the nervous system and the potential
functions of these rhythms in key cognitive states and processes such as
attention, awareness, learning, and recall. A second major topic is dynamics of
gene expression. Progress in genomic research is leading to maps of the building
blocks of biology and fueling the study of gene regulation, where proteins often
regulate their own production or that of other proteins in a complex web of
interactions. CBD projects focus on using techniques from nonlinear dynamics,
statistical physics, control theory, and molecular biology to model, design, and
construct synthetic gene regulatory networks, and to probe naturally occurring
gene regulatory networks. The third major topic is the dynamics of patterns and
waves. Training activities include two weekly working seminars, extra journal
clubs and reading groups, seminars to educate the CBD members in the research
going on within the Center, and a CBD-initiated team-taught course. The Center
for BioDynamics (CBD) helps to advance understanding of difficult
interdisciplinary problems at the intersection of mathematics, biology, and
engineering, and it trains mathematicians, scientists, and engineers for the
21st century workforce. It does this by combining traditional classroom
education with significant engagement of students and postdocs in
interdisciplinary teams working on current problems. The disciplines involved
are mathematics, biomedical engineering, aerospace/mechanical engineering,
biology, psychology, and physics. One of the major topics is dynamics of the
nervous system. The projects in this topic seek to shed light on the origin of
the electrical activity in the brain, and how the brain uses this activity to
process sensory information, to think, and to regulate movement. A second major
topic is dynamics of gene expression. The web of interactions among the proteins
that are produced by genes is complex; the projects associated with this topic
involve the design and construction of artificial gene regulatory networks, and
techniques to better understand naturally occurring gene regulatory networks.
The third major topic is the dynamics of patterns and waves, occuring in a
variety of applications. Training activities include two weekly working
seminars, regular sessions to read scientific journals, seminars to educate the
CBD members in the research going on within the Center, and a CBD-initiated
team-taught course. The project is supported by the Computational Mathematics,
Applied Mathematics, Computational Neuroscience, and Biological Databases and
Informatics programs and by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.
