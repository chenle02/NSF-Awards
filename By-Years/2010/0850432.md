Lawyers in the Pursuit of Basic Legal Rights: &lt;br/&gt;Criminal Defense in
China&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terence C. Halliday and Sida
Liu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of basic legal rights and a
legal profession to defend them is a crucial issue that is heavily debated
within China and across the world. This study asks two key questions: What
capacity do Chinese criminal defense lawyers have to defend individuals
threatened with infringements of fundamental legal rights? And how are Chinese
defense lawyers contributing to the development of a robust legal profession
that protects basic legal freedoms? &lt;br/&gt; The project examines lawyers'
ability to represent criminal defendants from five angles: (1) everyday
lawyering, where practitioners play with and by the rules of criminal practice;
(2) collective action by lawyers through networks, virtual communities and bar
associations to advance basic legal freedoms; (3) cycles of criminal procedure
law reform by the National Peoples Congress where rules of practice are forged;
(4) the national and international media which provide public commentary on
lawyers in criminal practice and influence their role within China; and (5)
international influences on the shape of China's criminal justice system.
&lt;br/&gt; Obtaining data from a variety of complementary perspectives,
Halliday and Liu conduct 210 interviews with lawyers across China, undertake
systematic analysis of Chinese and foreign media reports on criminal practice,
engage in extensive archival research, and interview groups inside and outside
China that seek to foster a strong criminal defense bar. &lt;br/&gt; Answers to
these questions will go a long way towards understanding the achievements and
impediments to rule of law in China. They will also show how domestic advocates
inside China and supporters of the rule of law outside China can provide
assistance to realize the emergence of a legal system in the PRC that is
consistent with the United Nations' global norms.
