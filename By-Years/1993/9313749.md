9313749 Tsui An electron energy filter made of quantum well structures is found
extremely useful in reducing the dark current of a quantum well infrared
photodetector, and thus increasing the detector operating temperature. However,
the noise characteristics associated with this energy filtering process have not
been investigated in detail. We propose a 2-year research program to conduct an
in-depth investigation of the noise properties of electron energy filters with
different band sturctures. The result will be useful in designing a low noise,
high sensitivity quantum well detector. The program will be carried out in three
stages: In the first stage we will focus on designing and fabricating different
energy filter structures and setting up noise characterization equipment
apropriate for the present devices. The second will concentrate on the noise
measurements and a physical understanding of the results, and based on these
results,and based on these reults, we will in third stage be designing and
demonstrating quantum well detectors with lowest detector noise and highest
sensitivity.***
