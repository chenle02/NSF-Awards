This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial
potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is
in providing a novel, low-cost, scalable, and optimized-for-use-in-space solar
panel technology based on ultrathin silicon solar cells. The developed space
solar panels may have substantially lower cost compared to the state-of-practice
space solar panels and will be compatible with automated high-volume
manufacturing. The panels will meet the requirements of the growing satellite
manufacturing industry. The main customers include manufacturers of satellites
for large scale satellite constellations and manufacturers of large-size
spacecraft, as well as space agencies and private companies developing
infrastructure for space, Moon and Mars exploration. Applications on Earth could
include powering long-endurance drones (airplanes and airships) and remote
facilities that need more compact and lighter weight solar solutions for off-
grid power systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase II project will develop novel space-stable and scalable packaging
technologies for ultrathin silicon solar cells. The project will develop a
prototype solar blanket and demonstrate its integration into ultracompact solar
array deployment systems. Specific objectives of this Phase II project are to:
(1) establish routine production of ultrathin silicon solar cells, (2) develop
low-stress metal interconnects for thin silicon solar cells, (3) develop a cover
glass replacement coating for thin silicon solar cells, (4) demonstrate mini-
blankets with acceptable cell-to-module efficiency loss, (5) electrically and
mechanically integrate silicon solar blanket, and (6) demonstrate deployment of
the relevant size blanket while conducting preliminary stress
testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
