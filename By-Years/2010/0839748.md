This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project aims at developing new
semiconductor device processing technology for SiC electronics. The new method
is based on low-temperature selective epitaxial growth of SiC (LTSEG) of SiC.
The technology promises high values of doping, especially for p-type doping that
is problematic in SiC. Another advantage is the development of a self-aligned
fabrication technique for the emerging market of SiC power integrated circuits.

Self-aligned device fabrication for SiC is in the embryonic stage. Efforts to
develop new fabrication technologies in Japan and Europe are growing, which may
put the U.S. SiC industry significantly behind in developing cost-efficient SiC
electronics. In this respect, the novel device fabrication method offers a
possibility of strong competitive advantage.
