This three year project, sponsored by the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champagne, will provide a four week workshop each year for 25 high school
teachers. The workshops will consist of lectures, demonstrations and hands-on
laboratories on topics in technology, such as solar cells, superconductors and
cement. Both university faculty and industry personnel will conduct the
workshops. The modules will then be tested on high schools, after evaluation,
and modified if necessary. The modules considered to be the most successful will
be punished and disseminated nationally. The matching funds from the schools and
the university constitute about 17% of the NSF award.
