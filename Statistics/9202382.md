Most procedures labeled "Empirical Bayes" that are in use at present are
frequentist rather than Bayesian; although often the motivation for employing
Empirical Bayes procedures is the conceptual or the computational difficulty of
the analogous Bayes procedures. This research broadens the Empirical Bayes
framework and then examines the comparative behaviors of the several
methodologies with respect their performance and their feasibility. Theoretical
results defining conditions of superiority for Empirical Bayes methods will be
sought. Empirical results from simulations and theoretical results for
properties of Empirical Bayes estimators will be applied to reliability theory.
Statistical analyses draw on models or on prior information and expert opinion
to set the framework for analyzing data. In certain circumstances the data
itself can be used to determine the framework as well as be analyzed within the
framework. Procedures of this type are called "Empirical Bayes;" and these can
be viewed in some sense as a hybrid of model-based (frequentist) and prior
information-based (Bayesian) procedures. This research will investigate the
circumstances under which each class of procedures is significantly superior to
the others for applications in reliability testing and estimation.
