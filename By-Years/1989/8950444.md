The application of the principles of the Fourier transform to spectroscopy has
revolutionized spectrophotometric instrumentation. This project incorporates GC-
FTIR into the laboratory experiences at Adrian College. The goals of the project
are to provide student access to modern infrared spectroscopic instrumentation
for the enhance of the laboratory experience and to promote the concepts of
Fourier analysis by providing an example of a Fourier transform spectrometer.
The GC-FTIR is used by the students for analysis and spectral identification and
interpretation of purified organic reaction products, separation of mixtures of
organic compounds and subsequent identification by infrared analysis. In
addition the FTIR provides a powerful example of the benefits of Fourier
transforms and analysis. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal
amount of funds.
