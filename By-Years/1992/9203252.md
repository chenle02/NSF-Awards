Finite element modeling of elasto-plastic rolling and sliding contact will be
extended to the near-surface region so that it can include surface damage due to
repeated loading of individual asperities and surface irregularities. These
irregularities produce intense spikes in the pressure distribution and result in
cyclic plasticity and fatigue damage very close to the contact surface. The
effects are not addressed by conventional Hertzian theory for smooth contact
surfaces and become determining factors in the failure of rolling elements made
from advanced materials. The modeling of the effects of irregularities will be
extended to also study their effects on bodies with shallow modified surface
layers and coatings in order to determine which properties and dimensions of
these layers give optimal rolling element performance.
