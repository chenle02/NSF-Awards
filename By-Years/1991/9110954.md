Existing tools for program development are based on a perceived requirement to
support programming in conventional languages - languages often biased toward
batch translation. Yet integrated development environments can hide many of the
idiosyncrasies of conventional programming languages, provided only that the
emphasis on conventional languages is relaxed. Semantically founded programming
environments emphasize the semantic aspects of computations and descriptions of
computations (programs). A semantically founded environment provides for direct
manipulation of semantically interesting objects and structures without
requiring a user to manipulate a syntax-based representation. The environment is
organized as a collection of interacting components. Each component packages a
well-defined aspect of a language or program with appropriate user-interfaces
and editing models. This approach capitalizes on an environment's ability to
stimulate or hide many idiosyncrasies present in textual representations of
programs. This program is a two year investigation of the principles and
technologies underlying semantically founded development environments. The
research is expected to bring new advances in the fields of environment
architecture, program development paradigms, semantic description methods, and
the use of logic to support programming.
