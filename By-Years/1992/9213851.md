It has long been recognized that the exact timing, location and severity of
local weather events are determined by what is termed by meteorologist as
mesoscale processes. The Principal Investigator's overall objective is to study
mesoscale phenomena embedded in larger cyclonic storms to advance knowledge of
the structure and origin of such systems and to evaluate the prediction
capabilities of present models. Specific phenomena to be investigated include
frontal substructures, mesoscale gravity waves and small vortices in polar air
masses. Research will be primarily accomplished through numerical modeling
studies conducted in conjunction with scientists from the National Center for
Atmospheric Research.
