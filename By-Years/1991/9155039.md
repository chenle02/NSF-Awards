Boston University will initiate a six-week, commuter and residential Young
Scholars project in Physics and Engineering which will provide science
enrichment activities for 30 students entering grades 11 and 12. Students will
participate in research at laboratories affiliated with Boston University and
MIT, where they will be placed for six weeks during the summer after either
their sophomore or junior years. This age group is chosen because of its
maturity and its ability to share the summer experience with fellow high school
students during their senior year. This program for high-ability secondary
school students will be coordinated by Boston University, where the participants
will live for the duration of the project. The object of this program is for the
students to become aware of the realities of a scientific career through
involvement in research and exposure to questions at the frontiers of knowledge
and to the methods and ideas used to answer them. To this purpose, each
participant will be paired with a mentor -- a person actively engaged in
research -- and will work with him or her in ongoing research problems. A series
of weekly seminars will provide a more global view of problems in science.
