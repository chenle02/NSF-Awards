97034927 SHAAR The GYRE is a 182' general purpose research vessel constructed in
1973. The ship is owned and operated by Texas A&amp;M University. The vessel is
scheduled for 137 days in 1997, of which 30 days are in support of NSF-sponsored
programs. The Navy and MMS will use the vessel for 38 days in support of
programs for NRL and Minerals Management programs. In addition the vessel will
provide 43 days in support State programs and 5 days for private research. The
Gyre did not provide support for NSF programs in 1995 or 1996. The GYRE is part
of a fleet of ships used by the National Science Foundation in support of marine
science research. Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized
equipment be permanently installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for
specialized ships. The GYRE will operate in the Gulf of Mexico off the southwest
coast of the U.S. ***
