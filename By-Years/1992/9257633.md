During the period of NYI award, experience in system identification and the
related applications of modeling, control and verification will be employed to
investigate complex multi- degree-of-freedom systems that exhibit nonlinear
behavior. the ultimate goal of the project is to produce viable approaches for
identification and control of such systems, and to demonstrate and evaluate
their performance. Identification performance indicators will be developed as
part of the investigation. Contacts with industries will be used to define
appropriate simulation and laboratory systems.***//
