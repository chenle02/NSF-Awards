The SIAM project, DSWeb, will explore new ways of communication via the web.
DSWeb is an Internet portal with a goal to become the primary site for the
organization and distribution of timely information about all aspects of
dynamical systems and its applications. DSWeb will promote research and the
exchange of ideas across a broad, but focused community. DSWeb will not only
serve the dynamical systems community. It will also serve the purpose of
outreach to other sciences and to a general scientifically literate audience.
Aspects of DSWeb are intended to reach this broad audience. It will be offered
with free access.
