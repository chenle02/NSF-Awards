9315293 Lande The Homestake chlorine solar neutrino detector has monitored the
electron neutrino flux from the Sun for 22 years. The observed flux is 30% of
that predicted by the standard solar model. This result has perplexed solar
astronomers for many years and the explanation is still unknown. The operation
of the Homestake chlorine detector will be continued for another three years so
as to overlap with new detectors being built or planned. ***
