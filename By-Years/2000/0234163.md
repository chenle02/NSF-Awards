This project will complete construction of a high-quality digital bathymetry
database for the Southern Ocean component of the Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics
GLOBEC) program. Existing along-track and swath bathymetry data collected in
Marguerite Bay and in the West Antarctic Peninsula shelf study, have been
assembled and merged with new SeaBeam and along-track data collected during
cruises of the research vessels R/V Palmer and R/V Gould in 2001 and 2002. New
bathymetry data has also been obtained from other US, British, and Russian
sources to extend the program database. Once the final R/V Palmer and R/V Gould
cruises are completed and other data added, the program database will be closed,
edited, documented and made publicly available for use by international GLOBEC
investigators and by the broader geophysics community. These results will be
developed in conjunction with, and will become part of a planned circum-
antarctic high resolution bathymetry database.
