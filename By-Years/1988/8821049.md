Chemical synthesis of sialosides, has proven problematic and the lack of
chemical amounts of sialic acid containing carbohydrate groups has hampered
investigations into their biological roles. This project will exploit the use of
purified mammalian sialyltransferases to develop efficient synthesis of
sialosides at a scale not currently possible by chemical methods alone. There
are numerous examples of sialosides involved in cellular recognition. Sialosides
serve as cellular attachment sites for viruses, mycoplasma, bacteria and
bacterial toxins. Sialylated carbohydrate groups also appear to contain
information important in cell recognition, aspects of cellular differentiation
and development. Investigation of the biological roles of sialic acids will be
greatly aided by the availability of pure sialyloligosaccharides and by
synthetic approaches to synthesize additional compounds as desired.
