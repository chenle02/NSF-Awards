This project is in the area of group-theoretic algorithms, concentrating on
methods for studying a given finitely presented group. Experimental
implementations of the Knuth-Bendix procedure for strings will be developed and
used to explore the behaviour of the Knuth-Bendix procedure with large rewriting
systems. Also versions of the Baumslag-Cannonito-Miller polycyclic quotient
algorithm will be tested. Other areas of research are determining the order of a
permutation group or a matrix group over a finite field described by a set of
generators, and computation within infinite polycyclic groups. This project is
on the interface of computer science and mathematics. It is concerned with
automating processes involved in mathematical problem solving. This is research
promisesto impact algebra and symbolic computation.
