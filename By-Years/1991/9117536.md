The primary objective of this project is to determine the thermal history of
the Newark Basin via fission-track and 40Ar/39Ar analysis of sediment core from
the Newark Basin Scientific Drilling Project and surface samples together with
some geophysical modeling of the basin evolution. The principal investigators
will undertake about 75 fission-track analyses consisting of both surface and
subsurface samples. The vertical sections provided by the wells will provide
geothermal gradient restraints and data from the intermediate age rift sediments
whose outcrop distribution is poor. The surface samples will densify the
regional age distribution and detail the recharge zone for hydrothermal
circulation identified along the border fault by their earlier work. In addition
to the fission-track analyses, approximately a dozen samples will be subjected
to 40Ar/39Ar analysis. These samples will include Newark Basin clastics (surface
and subsurface), granophyres from the Palisades Sill, and basement rocks
adjacent to the Newark Basin. These will provide a higher-temperature framework
with which to evaluate the fission-track data. In order to decipher the fission-
track data, the principal investigators will numerically model the apatite age
and track length distributions to invert for the temperature history of each
sample. These estimates of the cooling history will be combined to determine the
low temperature thermal evolution of the Newark Basin. The zircon and sphene
fission-track ages will help to constrain the higher temperature thermal
history.
