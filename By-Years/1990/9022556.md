This is an experimental research program to investigate fracture processes
associated with crack initiation and stable crack growth and their relationships
to microstructure. Microstructure parameters are systematically varied to
determine the effects of primary particle spacing, primary volume fraction, and
fine scale microstructure independently of one another. The role of primary
particle spacing on fracture initiation toughness, the influence of particle
spacing on ductility in shear, and the effects of toughness on stable crack
growth are under study using steel as a model material. The fracture process,
damage accumulation, void growth, and strain distributions are analyzed. The
research provides important knowledge for the understanding and modeling of
fracture processes in high strength metal alloys.
