9633125 SANTSCHI The various naturally-occurring radioactive isotopes of thorium
(Th) have come to prominence in chemical oceanography because of their utility
in determining the rates of flux of large particulate and colloidal
subparticles. The tendency of Th to preferentially come out of good tracer for
particle dynamics (production, destruction, sinking, mixing). However, the
computations involved are model-based, and the models currently used are rather
simplistic. In this research, the PI and his coworkers at Texas A&amp;M
University will conduct laboratory experiments to determine the sorption-
description kinetic properties of Th in seawater with particles, organic
molecules, and colloids aggregate into larger and larger aggregates, a process
responsible for the formation of new particles in marine and other natural
waters. The results will finally be folded into a more realistic model of Th
behavior that should help marine chemists and geochemists use the Th tracer more
confidently and with a better understanding of its limitations as well as its
utility.
