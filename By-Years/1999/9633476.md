Land-use and land-cover change have been identified by the U.S. Global Change
Research Program as a major integrating scientific issue that need greater
attention if we are to have the necessary understanding of how different
components of the Earth system interact with each other. In addition to the
substantive significance of this topic, research on land-use and land-cover
change also is important because it is a fertile ground for interdisciplinary
collaborations between natural and social scientists. For these reasons, land-
use and land-cover change has been selected as the topic for the fourth in a
series of global change workshops jointly sponsored by the U.S. and Japanese
governments. This workshop will be held in Tsukuba, Japan, during the last week
of February 1996. Participants will include 17 scientists from the U.S., 30 from
Japan, and 8 from other nations of the Pacific Rim. This award will provide
support for three general purposes: (1) to help provide logistical and
operational support for the workshop; (2) to provide travel support to enable
the participation of the principal investigator as a member of the U.S.
delegation, and (3) to provide support for follow-up activities related to the
principal investigator's research on land-use and land-cover change. Through
this award, the work of a bi-lateral workshop bringing together leading
scientists from the U.S., Japan, and other nations will be facilitated. In
addition to new knowledge and awareness of substantive and methodological
problems, the workshop will facilitate the development of interdisciplinary
collaborations among scientists from the U.S., Japan, and other nations. The
award also will enable the participation of a leading U.S. scientist who already
has strong working relationships in this international setting.
