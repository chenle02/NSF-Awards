This project is enhancing the capability of the department to provide laboratory
experiences which illustrate and test theories of animal behavior,
communication, and ecology that are introduced in the lectures of six existing
courses. In addition, it provides advanced undergraduate research opportunities
in the disciplines of animal behavior, communication, and ecology; upgrades the
animal behavior and ecology facilities (radio telemetry) currently existing at
this institution, and adds to existing animal behavior and ecology facilities an
important ability to analyze animal communications. With it, undergraduates have
ready access to state-of-the-art, computer- interfaced sound spectrographic and
video taping equipment for the analysis of animal communication. All this
enhances the undergraduate biology majors' opportunities to become researchers
at the entry level and to increase these skills at the independent research
level. The department is conducting a special program for recruiting talented
minority members into this sequence. The grantee institution is matching the NSF
award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
