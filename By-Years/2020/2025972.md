This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a new
method to distribute “last mile” fiber optic communication lines. Existing fiber
installation methods like trenching require extensive approvals and are labor-
intensive, disruptive, and cost-prohibitive, especially in underserved or remote
areas. “Last mile” fiber is the most expensive part of any installation with a
market valued at over $50 billion. This solution enables a quick, low-cost
deployment of optical fiber directly onto pavement without cutting into the
surface, effectively turning a barrier into a pathway. This new method will
enable ubiquitous fiber optic connectivity and will expand the reach of fiber
optic networks through the “last mile”. By lowering fiber deployment costs and
improving efficiency, this technology will accelerate the rollout of 5G, enable
smart city growth, and deliver broadband access to rural areas. This solution
extends the benefits of fast communications to previously inaccessible
locations, connecting businesses, homes, hospitals, and schools, providing
access to information, knowledge, and opportunity for
everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is to
validate a new fiber installation method leveraging existing road networks.
Using pavement as the base, low-profile fiber cables are bonded to the surface
and protected against traffic and weather by layers of durable coatings. Fiber
links can be installed quickly on-demand with an installation machine that
requires no digging and minimal disruption. The research objectives of this
project are to build and test three prototype machines in the field and to
iterate on design. The research includes using the machines to install fiber,
test pavement transitions, and compare costs and speed against other
installation techniques. The anticipated technical results will expand
understanding of machine utility, improve the user interface, verify the
suitability, and validate economics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
