Field and laboratory studies will be conducted to better understand the role of
particulate phase organic compounds in atmospheric biogeochemical cycles. One
principal objective of the research is the completion of the chemical analysis
of aerosol samples that have already been collected as part of a study on rural
oxidants and to perform multi-variate statistical analysis of the data. By way
of further field studies, another objective is the further elucidation of the
different factors that relate to the chemistry of vapor and particle phase
organic compounds that have already been measured at an urban location in
Boulder, Colorado, and a pristine site at Niwot Ridge, Colorado. A final
objective is the characterization of nitrogen- and sulfur- containing organic
constituents of tropospheric particulate and of the relationships of such
compounds to atmospheric photolytic oxidation cycles. In these studies, hourly
variations in the particulate phase organic composition will be determined using
a low-volume sampling technique followed by chromatographic separation and
sensitive detection. Proposed studies of nitrogen- and sulfur-containting
organic constituents of particles will require the development of new analytical
methods involving supercritical fluid extractions and selective detection by
chemiluminescene techniques and atomic emission.
