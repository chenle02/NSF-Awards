Research in theoretical physics will explore the implications of unification
models of elementary particle physics for astrophysics and cosmology. Empirical
evidence shows that there is considerable non-luminous, or "dark" matter in the
universe. Preliminary work completed on hypothesized self-interacting dark
matter indicates that this new type of dark matter has properties intermediate
between the conventional "hot" and "cold" dark matter categories. Thus it may
represent an improvement over conventional dark matter candidates while still
satisfying the constraints imposed by primordial nucleosynthesis, velocities in
galactic halos, and observations of the diffuse extragalactic background
radiation in the soft x-ray region. This project will perform a more detailed
analysis of this type of dark matter. Since the nature of the dark matter is one
of the outstanding puzzles in astrophysics, investigations of various possible
types of dark matter are very important.
