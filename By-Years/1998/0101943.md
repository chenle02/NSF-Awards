The goal of the North Carolina Middle Mathematics Project (NCM2) is to improve
mathematics education in grades 6-8 across the entire state of North Carolina,
supporting teachers in their professional development and providing academic
renewal and financial recognition to support their retention. The project will
help middle grades mathematics teachers become local and statewide leaders,
secure National Board certification and take the crucial first steps toward
master's degrees. To carry out the project, nine centers of the University of
North Carolina's Mathematics and Science Education Network (MSEN) will combine
their efforts and the talents of faculty, school system administrators and
talented middle school mathematics teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
will form an NCM2 Leadership Network combining teams from each MSEN regional
center including university mathematicians, university mathematics educators,
school district administrators and highly qualified middle school mathematics
teachers (two teachers from each region). The Leadership Network will assist
NCDPI in revision of the North Carolina Standard Course of Study and revision of
the state's tests, including End of Grade Tests and the End of Course Test for
Algebra I.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The NCM2 Leadership Network will also develop
three graduate-level courses for middle school mathematics teachers, one each in
the content areas of statistics and data analysis, geometry and measurement, and
number and algebra. The MSEN centers will provide these courses to teachers
statewide. The teachers will use this course work in obtaining National Board
Certification in Early Adolescence/Mathematics and as the foundation for
obtaining master's degrees in middle school mathematics education. National
certification and master's degrees are both rewarded in North Carolina with
salary supplements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
