The Arctic Natural Sciences Program, Office of Polar Programs, is supporting
travel by U. S. students to an international conference on ecological responses
to recent climate change in the Arctic. The conference will be held at the
University of Aarhus, Denmark, May 5-7, 2008, in celebration of the
International Polar Year. The conference participants will include the world?s
top ecologists working on effects of Arctic climate change. Researchers from all
Arctic countries will report on the responses of individuals, communities, and
ecosystems (terrestrial, aquatic, and marine) to climate change. The only recent
conference focusing solely on ecological effects of recent climate change in the
Arctic, this gathering will be entail an important exchange of scientific
information and help communicate to the public the magnitude and diversity of
ecological responses to Arctic change. Participation by U. S. students will
enhance U. S. capacity in polar research. &lt;br/&gt;
