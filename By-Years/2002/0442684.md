Mathematical Sciences (21). This project is developing a multidisciplinary
undergraduate course, "Wavelets and Applications," accessible to students who
have completed Calculus I, II and linear algebra. Supporting materials in the
form of a text, computer labs, and final projects are being created. The course
is designed to use the many applications of wavelets to data and signal
compression as motivational examples. Thus it begins with an introduction to
discrete wavelet transforms using a filter design approach that builds on
knowledge of linear algebra. Implementations of different discrete wavelet
transforms permit the use of basic scientific computing methodology. This helps
lay the groundwork for the study of elements of classical theory and
construction of more general wavelet transformations in the latter part of the
course.
