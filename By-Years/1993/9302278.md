The exploratory research to be performed on this SGER award will investigate the
fundamental relation between crack growth and background plasticity of ductile
solids. Rigorous and exceptionally accurate finite element calculations based on
an innovative mathematical model will be performed to predict the fracture
resistance curves, the crack growth per cycle under sequential stressing, and
the interface debond length. These results will be compared to available
physical observations for this class of materials. Understanding gained from
this research could lead to the development of advanced high-performance
composites consisting of a multitude of alternating thin layers of ductile and
brittle materials.
