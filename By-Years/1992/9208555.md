The effort explores a novel, relatively inexpensive, sacrificial anode process
approach that can be used with standard plate-and-frame cells and avoids
production of metallic-salt waste. It is based on the electrooxidation of
hydrogen gas using a fuel-cell-type gas diffusion anode in which hydrogen halide
byproduct is evolved; it is necessary for this purpose to produce the hydrogen
halide from the nonsolution (dry) side of the anode. Cathodic processes include
production of a variety of organic compounds with special emphasis on
fluorinated products. The generic technology from this effort should be
inexpensive, reasonably easy to use, have modest labor requirements, and pose
few problems in separation of products or environmentally troublesome
byproducts. Initial applications are expected in high-value-added products in
the pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical areas. This is an award under the
Joint Initiative in Electrochemical Synthesis sponsored by the National Science
Foundation and the Electric Power Research Institute.
