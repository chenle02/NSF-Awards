This RUI project involves a detailed experimental study of the photoionization
dynamics of partially filled f-subshell atoms, the lanthanides, where systematic
and wide ranging studies are extremely sparse. Using the technique of electron
spectrometry coupled with tunable synchrotron radiation, a determination of the
partial cross sections and corresponding angular distributions of the 4f
photoelectrons as a function of photon energy will be carried out in the photon
energy range from about 20 to 200 eV. These studies should spur theorists
towards developing new models and improving existing techniques to handle the
complications associated in dealing with open f subshells. On the broader
impact, the program will involve undergraduate students in all aspects of the
experiment.
