9424324 Ma A laboratory hot press wil be purchased with funds partially
provided by this grant. The main use of the press will be in processing
nanophase powders, including consolidation of nanophase intermetallics and
nanophase ceramics. A systematic study of densification and deformation
behaviors will be carried out. Other powder processing projects will also
benefit from the new equipment. ***
