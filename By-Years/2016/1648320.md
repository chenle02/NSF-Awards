The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to provide a data intelligence layer for
buildings and electric grid operators, and help remove any guesswork from the
implementation of optimized electricity demand response. Better demand response
means that less efficient, and often more expensive, forms of electricity
generation do not need to come online during times of high electricity demand.
Demand response optimization reduces the stress on transmission and distribution
systems, making them less likely to fail. A well implemented demand response
program leads to competitive and efficient wholesale electricity market
operations, and helps in keeping electricity prices in check.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project aims to develop, deploy, and evaluate innovative algorithms and software
for control-oriented predictive modeling for energy systems, with specific
application to electricity demand response. There are four significant technical
hurdles that will be addressed by the proposed effort: (a) modeling complexity
and heterogeneity, (b) limitations of rule-based demand response, (c) control
complexity and scalability, and (d) interpretability of modeling and control.
The goal of the proposed research is to address each of the technological
hurdles, and in doing so develop (i) data-driven control oriented modeling tools
for demand response and for large scale energy systems, and (ii) a methodology
to preserve interpretability of our data-driven control-oriented models for
providing energy analytics to the facilities manager based on real-world data.
The proposed project will include pilot deployments on real buildings to
evaluate the performance of the demand response software.
