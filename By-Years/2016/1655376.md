NSF has made an award to support travel costs and registration fees for 7
workshop speakers and registration fees for 19 trainees and 5 young faculty
members who will attend the three-day Regenerative Medicine Workshop at Hilton
Head being held March 1-4, 2017, on Hilton Head Island, SC. The workshop, part
of a series that began in 1996, brings together national and international
regenerative medicine experts from a variety of engineering and scientific
disciplines in a small conference setting to effectively convey knowledge,
stimulate new ideas critical to advancing the development of regenerative
medicine applications and therapies and promote research collaborations. This
year's workshop will focus on the theme of cellular models in regenerative
medicine. Conference session topics will include: Cellular therapies for liver
disease; Cell-based models for human retinal degenerative diseases; Genome
sequencing and epigenomic regulation; Regeneration of pancreatic cells for
treating diabetes; Nanoscale approaches for cell regeneration; and Combating
muscle degeneration diseases.
