This project investigates two outstanding problems in mathematical physics for
which techniques closely related to methods of non-perturbative renormalization
in quantum field theory are essential. (1) Quantum transport. The study of
electron transport in random media is of key technical importance. Some landmark
mathematical theorems explain insulation at large disorders or extreme energies
(Anderson localization). Conduction at small disorders is expected in dimension
three (extended states), but is unproven, and poses a key mathematical
challenge. This work aims to establish the hydrodynamic limit for a quantum
transport problem in a random medium. (2) Mathematical theory of matter and
radiation. This project also studies problems related to the infrared problem in
non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics, the theory of non-relativistic matter
interacting with the quantized electromagnetic field. We focus on the
translation invariant system consisting of a freely propagating electron that
interacts with the quantized electromagnetic field, and the associated problems
of infrared renormalization. The work aims to refine and further develop the
operator-theoretic renormalization group method that underlies earlier analysis,
focusing on dynamical systems aspects in infinite-dimensional Banach spaces.
This project investigates two outstanding problems in mathematical physics that
underlie fundamental physical processes. The study of electron transport in
random media aims at understanding conduction and insulation properties of
materials such as semiconductors, and is of key technical importance. The study
of quantum electrodynamics aims to solve a longstanding, difficult problem
concerning the interaction between electrons and photons that is critical to
establishing a mathematically sound theory of atomic structure and elementary
particle interaction.
