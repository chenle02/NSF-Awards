Metal Matrix Composites (MMCS) represent an emerging class of structural
materials with potential applications ranging from dimensionally stable space
structured components to high thermal conductivity packages for hybrid
microelectronics. Use of MMCs in commercial applications has been limited to
date because of high material costs and extremely high manufacturing costs (both
material fabrication and finishing). Fabrication of metal matrix composites is
usually accomplished via solid state (diffusion bonding) or liquid infiltration
(e.g. casting) techniques. The objective of the research is to develop a novel
manufacturing method for low cost net shape production of complex components.
The approach involves blending of two alloy powders with a ceramic reinforcement
mixed together using a highly volatile organic binder. During consolidation, the
binder is driven off and the low melting matrix powder turns to liquid and acts
as a wetting agent to improve bonding between the matrix and reinforcement. The
final composite is anticipated to have properties equivalent to conventionally
processed materials at much lower per unit cost.
