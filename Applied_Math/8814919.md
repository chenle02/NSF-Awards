This award is for graduate student support for work on a project in the area of
stochastic processes. Of particular interest is the problem of optimal control
of systems having a large number of random variables. To control such a system
in a manner which will maintain the state of the system within certain
boundaries, it is necessary to use singular rather than continuous controls.
Applications for this research vary from controling the economy to controling
the flight of a missile.
