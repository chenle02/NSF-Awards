The proposed research will address biases in precipitation gauge measurements
from high latitudes. Because of low temperatures and precipitation, coupled with
high winds, bias errors at high latitudes can exceed 100%. The research will
build on an extensive experimental base, especially on the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) Solid Precipitation Measurement Intercomparison Project, to
assess the accuracy of precipitation measurements and implement consistent bias
corrections for arctic regions. The research goal is to develop an unbiased
precipitation database and climatology for the pan-Arctic. Results will improve
our understanding of the spatial and temporal variability in precipitation and
its contribution to the freshwater budget of the arctic regions.
