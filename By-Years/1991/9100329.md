After completion of my degree I will be pursuing postdoctoral in the field of
gene expression. I intend to explore the area of regulation of RNA processing in
viral systems. I have selected the Pasteur Institute in Paris as my first choice
for several reasons. First, the contributions from the Pasteur Institute to
basic science research, especially in the field of virology, have been
outstanding. From a review of the literature, it appears to me that their
scientific community as well as their technical assets provide an excellent
resource of quality research. Second, I perceive that exposure to the scientific
approach of the European community would be an experience of great benefit. I
base this opinion on my previous experience of moving into the mainland USA,
which has been the single most beneficial step for my scientific and cultural
life.
