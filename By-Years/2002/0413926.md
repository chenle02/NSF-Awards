This project creates a scholarship and support program for students in
information assurance at the baccalaureate, Masters, and Ph.D. levels. It has an
advisory board that sets directions, works with the students, and is helpful in
arranging placements. The project includes a number of strong activities for
students: mentoring, research, interaction with governmental agencies, and
outreach, culminating in a degree in the field and appropriate placement in both
internship and fulltime positions.
