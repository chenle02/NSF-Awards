In this project the PI will study the history of galaxy structure formation
through measurements and modeling of the small-scale matter power spectrum from
the Lyman-alpha forest and through quantifying the uncertainties in statistical
measures of galaxy halo occupation distributions. Further the PI will apply
these methods to current and upcoming data. The projects will integrate research
and education through training and developing graduate students through
supervised research on the proposed projects. The project will outreach to high
school students locally near the University of Maryland through contact and
integration with science fair project work, which is under way. A primary new
effort proposed is the development of an interactive question and answer program
for high school teachers at the University of Maryland Center for Fundamental
Physics through a web-based wiki interface. The aspects of this proposal of
cosmological large-scale structure (on small scales) through the Lyman-alpha
forest and galaxy clustering statistics will be taken up by two separate
students or by a single student. In addition, these projects will foster the
further scientific development of a postdoctoral research scholar supported by
this award.
