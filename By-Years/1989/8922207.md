The School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology at the University of Hawaii
will acquire several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a
pool of shared use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in
association with the research vessel MOANA WAVE that the institution operates. A
substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1990 is in support of
NSF-sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also increase the
capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support research and
engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -An air-sea interaction
sensors system. A transportable instrument package will be assembled to make
underway, continuous measurements of air temperature and humidity, wind velocity
and wind stress, incoming solar and long-wave radiation, precipitation rate, and
sea temperature and salinity, -High-speed streamer for improving the data
collection capabilities of a multi-channel acoustic profiling system,
-16-channel asynchronous line multiplexer for increasing shared-use, sea-going
computing capabilities and real-time acquisition and display of large data sets,
-A precision salinometer for determining the salinity of seawater samples,
-Autoanalyzer for making precision measurements of several chemical parameters
simultaneously, and -an event timing controller that will provide a precision
time standard for marking incoming data sets and for coordinating the sequence
of events in seismic profiling. The University of Hawaii is providing
considerable cost sharing for acquiring this equipment. The instrumentation
described above will increase the capability of the Institution to support NSF-
sponsored research and engineering projects.
