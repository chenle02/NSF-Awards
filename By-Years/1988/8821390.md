The rapid solidification of silicon containing impurities will be studied via
molecular dynamics simulations. The melt/solid interface moves at a rate of
meters per second, so that local equilibrium is not attained. Properties such as
the so-called segregation coefficient are no longer constants in these
conditions. An understanding of many aspects of rapid solidification, such as
impurity-host interactions, requires atomic-scale modeling of multicomponent
systems using three- body forces between atoms. The proposed work will use the
Stillinger- Weber potential and similar interparticle interactions. Particular
attention will be given to impurity trapping, solute diffusivity, and trapping
mechanisms. Results of atomic-scale simulations will be important in evaluating
different possible models of solute trapping. They will thereby improve
continuum-scale modeling of solute segregation. Solute segregation during rapid
solidification is central to control formation of meta-stable alloys with novel
corrosion resistance and catalytic properties, as are produced, for example,
with laser annealing.
