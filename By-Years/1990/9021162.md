The purpose of the proposed studies is to further the understanding of how the
brain controls voluntary movements. Voluntary movements are controlled, in part,
by the motor areas of the cerebral cortex. This control is accomplished by
correlated activity of specific groups of brain cells, or neurons. Each group of
neurons is responsible for the control of individual muscles. Therefore, an
understanding of the mechanisms of motor control is contingent upon deciphering
the circuits that link these neurons into functional groups. Furthermore,
knowledge about the interactions among different functional groups is important.
This information can be obtained by identifying the functional properties of
single neurons, and then defining the specific connections that link them into
neuronal groups. These studies require an interdisciplinary approach, combining
electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activity, labeling of neuronal
pathways, and electron-microscopical examination of connections between
identified neurons. The importance of this research is that it contributes to
fundamental knowledge about motor control.
