This Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) project will use two
subprojects to study how chemical agents such as imidazoindole derivatives
influence the synaptic sites of the cholinergic system. One subproject will
focus on the mechanism of how ACh receptors become more sensitve to ACh and/or
agonist. The other subproject will analyze mechanisms whereby potassium ions
regulate calcium ions in the mediated release of ACh from the presynaptic nerve
terminals. Both subprojects will use electrophysiological techniques to gain new
knowledge on cholinergic mechanisms. The clarification of cholinergic mechanisms
will provide opportunities for Meharry Medical College to improve its research
capability. The investigators are well-trained and have published in good
refereed journals. Faculty and students involved in this project will have their
research skills strengthened by their use of electrophysiological procedures.
