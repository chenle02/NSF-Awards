The key to automating activities that are traditionally performed by humans,
such as assembly-line work or organizational tasks, is to break these activities
down into numerous simple steps that can be handled easily. While this approach
has also been used to automate logical reasoning, breaking reasoning tasks into
overly simple steps has two important shortcomings. First, it can prevent
today's methods from solving some seemingly easy problems. Second, a long
sequence of these simple steps is often impossible to understand for humans.
This project explores a novel approach to automated reasoning that deals with
this issue by allowing more elaborate, but also understandable,
steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over half a century, research regarding reasoning
systems has centered on the existence of short arguments that could in theory be
found by computers, without addressing the issue of how to actually find these
arguments in practice. The novel reasoning systems studied in this project aim
at automatically finding arguments that are usually used by mathematicians, in
particular arguments "without loss of generality," which can be automated
efficiently. The main goals of the research are (1) solving problems that are
too hard for existing reasoning techniques, (2) producing short arguments for
problems for which we only have gigantic arguments, and (3) learning from the
results of automated reasoning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
