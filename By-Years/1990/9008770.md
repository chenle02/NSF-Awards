In recent years, noncooperative game theory, and especially Nash equilibrium
analysis, has been used in the study of many economic situations. Along with the
many and varied applications has come persistent criticism: Why or when is
equilibrium analysis appropriate? Where do equilibria come from? How does one
choose among many equilibria in making predictions? This project addresses these
questions using two different approaches. In the first, players are assumed to
follow ad-hoc behavioral rules in the spirit of models of bounded rationality.
In the second, the players' forecasts and behavior are obtained as the solution
to a dynamic optimization problem given their exogenous prior beliefs about the
opponents' strategies. A common theme to both parts is that learning need not
lead to a Nash equilibrium even when players are long-lived, unless they also
engage in a sufficient amount of experimentation. The learning-based
justification of equilibrium analysis developed in this project is a very
significant contribution. It provides a better foundation for widely-used
analytic tools, identifies new and promising lines of research in economic
theory and motivates research in economic theory with the tests of existing
theories in experimental economics.//
