9521220 KITCHELL This proposal will test the hypothesis that the relative
importance of benthic and pelagic primary production in lake food webs is
dependent on lake trophic status and is regulated by fish. Previous results
indicate that benthic and pelagic organisms are strongly linked through trophic
relationships and form important conduits for carbon and nitrogen flow. Fish
structure benthic and pelagic communities and are important vectors of organic
material and nutrients between benthic and pelagic habitats. A stable isotope
method will be used to integrate this research into a comprehensive
understanding of benthic-pelagic trophic links. The stable isotopes will be used
to determine the trophic links between pelagic food webs, benthic
macroinvertebrate communities, and benthic algae.
