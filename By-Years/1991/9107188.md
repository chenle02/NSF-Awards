The focus of statistical graphics is to display dominant relationships among
several variables by taking a few variables at a time and plotting them or
otherwise creating images. This research will develop methods based on
"caricatures" of large samples of high-dimensional data. A perceptual study will
evaluate a variety of these new and other older methods of data visualization.
