9523228 Hoffman This research program is devoted to the synthesis and
characterization of novel conductive and magnetic materials, both crystalline
and polymeric, that are based on metal- organic complexes. It is comprised of
three components. The first project is concerned with Porphyritic Molecular
Metals. Quasi one-dimensional metals based on metallophthalocyanines and related
macrocycles show properties without parallel in other classes of molecular
metals. The new materials will be used to study the fundamental question of
electron localization associated with a lD - 3D crossover transition, and a
novel M-I-M transition seen at low temperatures and high pressure. The second
project deals with Magnetically Ordered Charge- Transfer Salts. The aim is to
explore the mechanism for interstack ferromagnetic exchange and to examine the
detailed character of the magnetically ordered state in molecular magnets. The
third project is connected to Conductors and Magnets From Functionalized
Porphyrazines. Breakthroughs in the synthesis of functionalized porphyrazines
provide the foundation for a long-term program to prepare new classes of
crystalline molecular metals and magnets derived from porphyrazine
(tetraazaporphyrin)-based multi-metallic complexes, and new types of highly
processable metal-linked ribbon polymers. %%% This research program is devoted

Molecular Metals; 2) examinations of Magnetically Ordered Charge-Transfer Salts;
and 3) investigation of Conductors and Magnets From Functionalized
Porphyrazines. The successful completion of this research will eventually result
in the development of new conductors and magnets.
