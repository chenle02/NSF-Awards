The objective of this research is the analysis of mathematical mechanisms that
explain how small actions exerted on dynamical systems can lead to large
effects, and applications of these mechanisms to real-world systems, such as in
astrodynamics, molecular biology and bioengineering, and climate science. In
astrodynamics, small forces resulting from the intertwining of the natural
gravity of Moon, Sun, and planets, can be exploited to design spacecraft
trajectories to distant locations within the Solar System, or to correct the
orbits of artificial satellites near the Earth, with significant fuel savings.
In climate science, small changes in the system parameters, such as in the
concentration of greenhouse gases, can cause sharp transitions of the climate
from one regime to another, and the mathematical analysis of climate data can
detect early warning signs of such transitions. In molecular biology, small
changes in the structure of molecules involved in the process of protein folding
can have significant functional effects; such changes can be detected via
topological data analysis of electron microscopy imaging.

This project seeks to discover explicit mechanisms that produce large effects in
general mathematical models of various real-world systems, as well as to infer
such mechanisms directly from data. Data is often used in the case of complex
systems where explicit models are difficult to conceive from fundamental
principles. The first research direction is devoted to large effects in
mechanical Hamiltonian systems subject to small perturbations, deterministic or
random. The goal is to describe mechanisms that yield trajectories that travel a
large distance in the phase space, as well as trajectories with prescribed
itineraries. Applications of these mechanisms include astrodynamics and
celestial mechanics. The second research direction is devoted to critical
transitions in complex systems. The goal is to develop methods based on
persistent homology that detect critical transitions in noisy dynamical systems
with slowly evolving parameters, and to study topological changes in
macromolecular processes. These methods are applied to paleoclimate data and
GroEL/ES chaperonin systems involved in protein folding.
