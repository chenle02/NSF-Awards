Database-driven dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) is a key enabling technical
paradigm approved by FCC for increasing wireless spectrum access. In such a
system, a geo-location database administrator (DBA) accepts registrations from
primary users and determines spectrum availability, and secondary users are all
required to inquire the DBA about the availability of any interested spectrum
before using it. An effective approach to improve the spectrum-estimation
accuracy in database-driven DSS systems is to deploy a small number of dedicated
spectrum sensors at strategic locations and outsource most spectrum-sensing
tasks to ubiquitous mobile users. This approach is not only highly feasible
given the wide penetration of increasingly powerful mobile devices into everyday
life and the foreseeable prevalence of DSS in future mobile communication
systems, but also expected to be much more cost-effective than deploying a
large-scale network of dedicated distributed spectrum sensors.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to investigate several fundamental
security and privacy challenges associated with database-driven DSS systems
armed with spectrum-sensing outsourcing. Specifically, there are four main
thrusts in this project: (1) secure radio environment map construction in the
presence of false spectrum measurements; (2) incentive-compatible and
differentially-private mechanisms for crowdsourced spectrum sensing; (3)
physical-layer secondary user authentication techniques for spectrum misuse
detection; and (4) performance evaluation through a combination of measurement
campaign, simulation study, prototyping, and experimentation. The project will
actively channel the research results into development of undergraduate and
graduate curricula, engage undergraduate and under-represented students into
research, and include outreach activities to K-12, underrepresented, and oversea
students as well as the local military community.
