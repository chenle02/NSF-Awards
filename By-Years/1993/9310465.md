9310465 van Leer The work proposed here is to develop an efficient explicit,
unstructured Navier-Stokes solver for a parallel-processing environment, based
on these ideas. An implicit solver would be developed as well, so that the
trade-offs between explicit and implicit unstructured Navier-Stokes solvers on
parallel architectures could be studied. The end result of the research would be
an extremely efficient three-dimensional Navier-Stokes for unstructured grids on
a parallel architecture.
