Cryptography provides the basic tools to guarantee confidentiality and integrity
of data. It hence plays a pivotal role in securing our digital infrastructure,
and in enforcing the right for privacy of individuals. The development of secure
cryptographic techniques is however difficult and error-prone, as unknown attack
strategies need to be taken into account. To overcome this, modern cryptography
advocates the paradigm of provable security, where threat models are precisely
formalized using the language of mathematics, and the security of cryptosystems
is proved within these models. This project aims to develop a better
quantitative approach to provable security. The research of this project yields
a better understanding of in-use cryptography, therefore contributing to the
safer deployment of existing cryptographic solutions, as well as the support of
future standardization processes. The educational component of this project
includes the development of a comprehensive program to educate undergraduate
students in the proper use of cryptography, and to use cryptography as a vehicle
for outreach.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project develops better theory to prove
rigorous lower bounds on the combination of time and memory needed by the
attacker. This allows us to better compare cryptographic solutions, and to favor
those which, for equal time resources, require the largest amount of memory in
order to be compromised. Concretely, this project contributes along two
different fronts. The first direction extends the theory of memory-hard
functions, which are functions that are moderately hard to compute with respect
to some combination of time and memory resources. This project introduces better
hardness metrics as well as new security targets for memory-hard functions, and
analyze new constructions. The second direction revisits the security of various
schemes in symmetric cryptography, and provides lower bounds on the complexity
of adversaries breaking them both in terms of time and memory storage, in the
setting where some underlying component of scheme is modeled as ideal.
