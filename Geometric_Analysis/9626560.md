9626560 Pitts The project lies in the area of minimal surface theory. The
investigator plans to utilize the geometric calculus of variations to consider
desingularization and construction of minimal surfaces. In addition, the
investigator proposes to show that any compact Riemannian manifold contains
infinitely many distinct minimal hypersurfaces, again using the variational
approach. Minimal surfaces first arose in a soap film experiment done by the
Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau around 1850, where Plateau observed that a soap
film surface bounded by a closed wire contour has the least surface area amongst
all surfaces spanned by the same wire contour. Minimal surfaces turn out to have
other remarkable mathematical properties (the average curvature at any point
must equal zero); their study involves several branches of modern mathematics.
Additionally, minimal surfaces can be used to model condensed matter, e.g.,
compound polymer systems.
