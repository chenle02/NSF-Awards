This project examines the presence of ideas of universalism and cultural
relativism in the African human rights system. Using ethnographic methods,
including interviews and participant observation, and analysis of the case law
of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, the project addresses
individuals' roles and resources in the African human rights system. It
investigates how individuals' backgrounds and personal attributes impact their
views of the cultural characteristics of the African human rights system, and
examines the extent to which human rights are a part of the formation of an
African collective identity. This project adds to current research on human
rights institutions, the internationalization of legal practice, and the
anthropology of law. The project will have a broader impact by analyzing the
role of human rights law in a changing geopolitical landscape, including the use
of human rights to solve conflicts, the deployment of rights in the articulation
of supranational collective identities, and human rights as an aspect of the
emergence of global constitutionalism. It also contributes to socio-legal
studies on human rights in Africa, and offers the existing African human rights
structure a social scientific assessment of its procedures.
