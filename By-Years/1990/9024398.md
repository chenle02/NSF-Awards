By 1995, Blacks and Hispanics are expected to make up about 28% of college-age
students in the U.S. Considering the role science and technology play in the
world, the percentage of doctoral degrees awarded to minorities in the United
States is alarmingly low. In order to have more minority students participating
in these fields, as well as provide a vital background for those NOT choosing
science careers, it is necessary to interest them in science and math at an
early age. This means that young children who have a natural curiosity about
everything around them must keep that curiosity and learn to see the connection
of science and math with things that interest them. The 1/2 hour film will
address 7 to 12 year-olds and show that science and technology are present in
some form in everything around them, and they have a connection with things
children know and like: sports, TV, water, space, etc.
