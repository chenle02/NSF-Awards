The research objective of this award is to use a laser-based rapid prototyping
process in order to fabricate patient-specific middle ear implants. Middle ear
implants will be fabricated with appropriate design features, including geometry
and weight, for a given patient. In addition, inorganic-organic hybrid materials
that demonstrate acoustic transmission, stability, sound transmission, and
stiffness properties similar to those of natural bone will be prepared for use
in these implants. The approach will involve biological, chemical, and
mechanical characterization of materials created using the laser-based rapid
prototyping process; process-oriented computational geometric analysis for
fabrication of patient-specific middle ear implants; and functional
characterization of patient-specific middle ear implants.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits and broader impacts of this
research will be to provide new techniques for rapid prototyping of middle ear
implants and other patient-specific medical devices. It is anticipated that
patient-specific middle ear implants will provide improved sound transmission
for longer periods of time than conventional implants. In addition, the models
developed in the proposed research program will be useful for examining the
mechanics and geometry of other irregularly shaped objects, including natural
tissues, geophysical features, and other irregular surfaces. From an educational
perspective, the proposed project will be tightly integrated with the training
objectives of both the biomedical engineering program at the University of North
Carolina and the bio-manufacturing program at North Carolina State University.
Both graduate students and undergraduate students from underrepresented
backgrounds will be recruited to participate in the proposed research program,
with undergraduate student support coming from a currently-funded Research
Experiences for Undergraduates program.
