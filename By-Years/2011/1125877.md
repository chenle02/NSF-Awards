Documenting indigenous languages contributes to the understanding of both
linguistic diversity and the human potential to subconsciously organize
knowledge in a variety of ways. This RAPID proposal documents the last fluent
native speaker who has knowledge of the Mojave Bird Song cycle. To date, there
is no permanent, high-quality documentation of these songs or of the cultural
contexts in which they are performed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project entails
community-based training and involvement in the in-depth recording,
transcription, analysis and archiving of the Mojave language as used in the song
and of the song cycle itself. The outcome will be a standing record, carefully
documented, which will benefit members of the community who are interested in
maintaining this tradition in its authentic form and will be of interest to
researchers of Ethnomusicology, Linguistics and Cultural Anthropology.
