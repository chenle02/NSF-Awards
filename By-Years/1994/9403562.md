This award will support creation of a publicly available, easy to use,
centralized directory for molecular biology software and data. Specifically it
will support upgrade of the computers and software supporting the University of
Houston Gene-Server and expansion of its database to include current information
on software and data available for use by molecular biologists. The resulting
database will provide a network-accessible, centralized source for information
on molecular biology software and data. The database will support a variety of
access mechanisms (Mosaic, Gopher, FTP and electronic mail), so that even
researchers with restricted access to the Internet can use its information.
Production of the "yellow pages" of molecular biology software and data will
involve creation of software tools which automatically scan a large number of
potential information sources and retrieve copies of relevant information for
inclusion in the "yellow pages" database.
