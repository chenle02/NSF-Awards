The focus of this work is (1) on principles and applications of manipulating
gaseous Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC's) with laser light under realistic
experimental conditions. The research will also focus (2) on modeling the
loading of optical lattices using a BEC and (3) on studying the characteristics
of a practical atom laser beam. The work will provide new capabilities for the
investigation of practical atom lasers.
