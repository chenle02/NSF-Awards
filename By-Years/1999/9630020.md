Robinson IBN-9630020 Circadian rhythms influence many aspects of the functioning
of an organism, such as sleep cycles, reproduction and cognitive abilities. One
frontier in bimlogy is therefore to elucidate the molecules that comprise
biological clocks in order to gain new insights on how biological clocks are
governed. This research focuses on the expression of the period (per) gene, one
of the most-well studied genes of the biological clock to date. Dr. Robinson is
measuring changes in per gene expression during growth an maturation, especially
as the transition from arrthymical to rhythmical behaviors is being made.
Because the expression of clock genes has never been undertaken in this model
system, the study will generate important new information on how clock genes
regulate specific neurobiological and behavioral functions.
