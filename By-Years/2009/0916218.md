Mathematical programming techniques like linear programming and
semide&amp;#64257;nite programming have &amp;#64257;rmly established themselves
as valuable tools in the approximation algorithm design toolkit. They are often
used as tractable relaxations to hard combinatorial optimization problems and as
design guides to obtain approximation algorithms. This project attempts to
enhance our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of mathematical
programming techniques for several fundamental optimization problems and
proposes to investigate general methods to strengthen our currently known
mathematical programming techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad goals of
this project are the following: (a) Attempt to devise better algorithms for
unique games ? a constraint satisfaction problem that is known to capture the
limitations of current semide&amp;#64257;nite programming methods used in
approximation algorithms. Beating the current best algorithms will necessarily
involve developing new techniques that overcome the limitations of current SDP
approaches. (b) Understand the structure of strengthened relaxations obtained by
lift-and-project procedures and develop techniques to exploit the additional
information provided by these stronger relaxations to obtain better
approximation algorithms. (c) Work towards closing large gaps in our
understanding of the approximability of fundamental optimization
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successfully achieving the project goals will
entail signi&amp;#64257;cant advances in the state of the art for approximation
algorithms. The research could potentially develop tools and techniques with
broad applicability to several optimization problems. Course materials for
graduate and undergraduate courses will be developed distilling research results
of this project, as well as new developments in the &amp;#64257;eld.&lt;br/&gt;
