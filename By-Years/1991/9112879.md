We propose to complete construction and implementation of an Imaging Fabry-
Perot Spectrometer (IFPS) which will be used in long- term studies of emission-
line objects with the 8.1-m Perkins Telescope at Lowell Observatory. A variety
of etalons with spectral resolution from R = 1200 to R = 20,000 will be used to
obtain two-dimensional spectroscopy of active galactic nuclei, starburst
galaxies, irregular galaxies, and galactic emission nebulate (H II regions,
planetaries, and supernova remnants) in order to study the velocity fields and
variations in physical conditions across spatially resolved objects. A custom-
designed optical system enables us to use the IFPS from the near ultraviolet to
the far red region of the optical spectrum. The combination of a high-throughput
system, a stable, high quantum efficiency detector, and significant amounts of
observing time will allow important problems in fundamental astrophysics to be
addressed with a moderate-aperture telescope.
