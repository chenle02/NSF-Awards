Many problems in modern signal processing and data analysis can be cast as
searching for a structured, low-dimensional model for observed data. Images,
audio signals, video sequences, and more, can be modeled as sparse in an
appropriate dictionary. Scientific data, from neural spike sorting to
microscopy, can be modeled as superpositions of characteristic patterns,
translated over space. Learned data representations yield excellent results on a
variety of classical problems in image processing and vision, and are also play
a crucial role in recent breakthroughs in signal classification and
computational scientific discovery. In contrast, much less is known
theoretically about the properties of learned representations, and of algorithms
for learning them. This project develops theory and dedicated optimization
algorithms, which are guaranteed, under appropriate conditions, to provide good
representations for observed signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators
study theoretical and computational aspects of a family of problems, including
sparse dictionary learning, sparse deconvolution, and convolutional dictionary
learning. The natural formulations of these problems are nonconvex. The goal of
the project is to develop geometric insights into these nonconvex problems, and
to use these insights to develop recovery theory and scalable, efficient
algorithms. Key challenges include understanding the properties of local and
global minima, and developing efficient algorithms that avoid stalling near
saddle points. The algorithms are demonstrated on real signal data arising in
image classification and scientific imaging.
