The objective of this project is to apply technology created by engineers -- the
engineering workstation interfaced to an interactive video disk -- for the
improvement of undergraduate engineering education. A first step is to define a
technology baseline consistig of an engineering workstation with peripherals,
software specifications, user interface, and prototype instructional modules.
This technology baseline will permit the consortium of four institutions to
exchange modules and evaluate modules prepared by the other institutions. The
institutions have commited matching funds that are approximately one and one-
half times the funds granted by NSF for this project.
