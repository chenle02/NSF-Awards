The Manufacturing Studies Board of the National Research Council will assist
the National Science Foundation (NSF) in identifying United States participants
and preparation of the U.S. agenda for the second Japan-US Conference on
Manufacturing Research. The conference aims at identifying Japanese
manufacturing research areas that could be of interest to U. S. firms, and vice
versa. Following identification of mutual interests, arrangements can be made
for appropriate technical exchanges. The Manufacturing Studies Board will
establish a committee to examine four broad areas of manufacturing, and add
additional areas if necessary to ensure full coverage of the subject.
