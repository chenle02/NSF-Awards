Thurston-Nielsen theory and Fluid Mixing

Philip Boyland

The Thurston-Nielsen theory provides a powerful collection of tools to analyze
and understand two-dimensional dynamical systems. The theory has potential for
significant advances in the study of two-dimensional systems of physical
interest. Among the most interesting and important come from fluid mechanics.
Dr. Boyland will use Thurston-Nielsen theory in conjunction with other dynamical
tools to obtain a deeper understanding of two-dimensional fluid mixing. Various
mathematical extensions of the Thurston-Nielsen theory will be obtained. These
extensions would enhance the applicability of the theory as well as being of
intrinsic mathematical interest. In addition, numerical and laboratory
experiments are proposed with the goal of designing effective mixers and
understanding many vortices as a model for two-dimensional turbulence.

The mixing of different species of materials is extremely common in natural
systems and industrial applications. The main scientific question is to
understand how the mixing takes place, while in industrial applications the
focus is usually on the development of schemes for effective mixing. In many
applications high viscosity, sensitivity of materials, the need to avoid
foaming, and other constraints make turbulence mixing infeasible and
undesirable. Thus in most instances the design of useful mixing procedures
requires close attention to efficiency. The added mathematical understanding
made possible by this project should help in this design process, providing
novel ideas for efficient mixing procedures and helping to eliminate inefficient
ones prior to expensive experimentation. In addition, this project will make a
powerful body of pure mathematics more accessible for application to problems of
physical and industrial importance.
