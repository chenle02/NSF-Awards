The program "Mathematics of Materials" provides a wide range of
interdisciplinary research and training opportunities for undergraduates,
graduate students, and postdocs in the mathematical sciences. The research
activities are organized around five topics that play a fundamental role in
emerging technologies: multifunctional materials, polymers and composites
including carbon nanotubes, orthopaedic biomaterials, dynamics of thin material
layers, and material behavior of laser welding. Within each topic,
investigations focus on fundamental model development, mathematical solution,
numerical simulation, and control design. Each project involves substantial
collaboration with experimental colleagues that provides interdisciplinary
training opportunities to mathematics students and postdocs. The training
component is designed to prepare students and postdocs for the varied roles of
interdisciplinary research mathematicians. This includes training modules that
introduce participants to research and career topics not typically covered in
coursework, targeted courses on topics pertaining to research areas and national
research agendas, and participation in summer internships and national
conferences.

biomaterials, dynamics of thin material layers, and material behavior of laser
welding. The training component involves a coordinated set of activities
designed to prepare students and postdocs for the varied roles of
interdisciplinary research mathematicians. This includes training modules that
introduce participants to research and career topics not covered in traditional
coursework, new courses pertaining to the five research topics and areas of
national need, and participation in summer internships and national conferences
spanning multiple disciplines. The objective of the program is to attract and
train highly qualified students and postdocs for academic and nonacademic
careers at the interface between applied mathematics, materials science,
engineering, physics, and advanced technology.
