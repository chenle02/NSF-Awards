Abstract - Puri This is an experimental and numerical investigation of transient
effects on the structure and stability of partially premixed hydrocarbon-air
flames. The dominant reaction pathways, and their dependence on the elvel of
premixing, are identified for both steady and unsteady flames in both coflow and
counterflow configurations. The effects of perturbing the inner layer through
acoustic forcing of specified amplitude and frequency on the distributin of
carbon monoxide and hydrogen as well as on the reaction rates of these species
and the heat release rates are examined. Similarly, the effects of perturbing
the outer layer on ignition and heat release are quantified. Parametric
comparisons between sealar profiles and reaction rates in coflow and counterflow
flames are performed. Experimental measurements include velocity, species,
temperature measurements, and high-speed videography of flame unsteadiness.
