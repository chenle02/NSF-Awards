The recent interest in nano-science has catalyzed research in the development of
nano-fabrication techniques. New highly versatile nanolithography techniques
based on scanning probe microscopes have been reported. It is now possible to
pattern a wide variety of organic and inorganic substrates either by inducing
localized chemical modifications of or by forming self-assembled monolayers
(SAMs) on surfaces with resolutions of less than 4 nm. Unfortunately, all these
techniques are very slow. Here we propose to develop a novel stamping method
(nano-contact printing, NCP) based on the reversible self-assembly of patterned
DNA monolayers that, independently from the original fabrication technique, will
be able to quickly reproduce a large number of nano-patterns and nano-devices
thus allowing for their industrial production. The working principle of this
technique will be completely different from any of the present macro and micro-
stamping methods. NCP will be tailor-made to transfer organic and inorganic
patterns reversibly and reliably with an enormous versatility. The main
innovative characteristics of this technique will be the possibility of (i)
transferring organic monolayers, (ii) stamping a large number of different
information all at the same time, and (iii) stamping new molds starting from the
original one. NCP will also be able to replicate flat inorganic, as well as
organic, nanofabricated substrate (not possible with any of the present
techniques). This work aims at providing researchers with a nano-fabrication
tool that meets industrial standards, thus it could impact the whole
nanotechnology field. The students involved with the project will learn about
(1) a great variety of nanolithography techniques, (2) fundamental concepts of
SAM fabrication and characterization, and, finally, (3) the basics of DNA
hybridization. If successful, NCP will become one of the experiments performed
in the laboratory part of the nano-science undergraduate class that the P.I. is
developing for fall '04 ("Nanosize Materials").
