9300675 Liu One graduate student at Northwestern University will be supported to
develop adaptive multiple scale methods for the design and rapid prototyping of
metal forming processes is requested. Computer simulation methods for metal
forming processes based on Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) finite elements,
adaptive mesh deployment techniques, multiple-scale methods, and hydrodynamic
lubrication finite elements will be developed. In particular it is planned to
emphasize the interaction of the tool and mental work piece by including the
effects of lubricant flow, pressure gradient, film entraiment, surface roughness
and sliding. This will provide a more realistic modeling of contact,
lubrication, and frictional stresses. In the research program, these aspects
will be studied in conjuction with computer simulation of metal forming
processes. Simulation results will be compared with available experimental data
to help validate and improve the theoretical models.
