Strong motion records from several reinforced concrete structures were
recovered after the 1987 Whittier, California earthquake. Most of these records
showed significant amplification of the acceleration with height. Some of the
records come from buildings that were either rebuilt or seismically strengthened
following the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. This study will review the available
data from reinforced concrete buildings, to select representative buildings, and
to analyze these buildings using available computer codes for the nonlinear
analysis of reinforced concrete structures. By comparing the results of the
computer analysis to the available data, conclusions will be drawn regarding the
applicability and validity of available analytical models, the amplification of
earthquake motion as related to building type and height, and the effectiveness
of seismic strengthening. This study would provide a valuable evaluation of
current analytical models and seismic strengthening techniques for reinforced
concrete buildings.
