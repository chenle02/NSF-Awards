9531883 Schlosser In this project the PI will participate in the Spring, 1997
hydrographic survey as part of the Atlantic Circulation and Climate Experiment
(ACCE), a U.S. contribution to the International World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE). The survey will cover the central/eastern basin of the sub
polar gyre in the North Atlantic between Greenland and the Azores. Specifically,
the PI will provide support to collect and analyze water samples for their
content of Helium-3, Tritium, and Oxygen- 18 in order to use them to study water
mass formation and circulation. Specific studies include convection of surface
waters to intermediate depth, communication of changes at the sea surface to the
deep waters, and sources of water for convection and surface freshwater balance.
Data will also be used to constrain model-simulated deep water formation rates,
as well as simulated penetration of near-surface signals into the deep ocean.
