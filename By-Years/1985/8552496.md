The purpose of this project is to develop an understanding of the rheology of a
complex fluid via observation of its constituents' microdynamics. The optical
measurements used provide noninvasive probes of the motion of the fluid
constituents. Time-dependent rheooptical studies will be initiated with two
general themes: to compare structures formed during flow as observed on small
and large length scales, and to extend the recently developed linear dichroism
and linear birefringence modulation methods. The research will involve red blood
cells and liquid crystalline polymer aggregation under flow conditions. Studies
of red blood cell aggregation may be of importance in suggesting corrective
measures for treating pathologic venous hypertension. Optical methods provide
the most promising means of investigating the little understood effects of
polymer process conditions on fluid microstructure as well as the final polymer
structural strength.
