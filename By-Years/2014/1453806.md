Applications that run on billions of mobile devices backed by
enormous&lt;br/&gt;datacenters hold the promise of personal, always-on
healthcare; of intelligent&lt;br/&gt;vehicles and homes; and thus of a
healthier, more efficient society. It is&lt;br/&gt;imperative to make such
applications secure by protecting their integrity and&lt;br/&gt;keeping their
data confidential. However, malicious programs (``malware'')&lt;br/&gt;today can
subvert the best software-level defenses by impersonating
benign&lt;br/&gt;processes on mobile devices or by attacking victim processes
through the&lt;br/&gt;hardware on shared datacenter servers. Grappling with such
intelligent malware&lt;br/&gt;requires fundamental advances in the hardware-
software organization of computer&lt;br/&gt;systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
key observation behind the research project here is that, while
seemingly&lt;br/&gt;disparate, intelligent malware relies on hiding its
hardware-level behaviors&lt;br/&gt;from operating system-level monitors. By
exposing instruction-level and&lt;br/&gt;micro-architectural behaviors to
software analysis, the proposed Exo-core&lt;br/&gt;architecture enables a new
class of malware detectors. In addition, Exo-core&lt;br/&gt;introduces
programmable hardware accelerators to synthesize run-time
program&lt;br/&gt;traces into robust models of benign programs. The project will
also&lt;br/&gt;integrate research in hardware-software foundations of computer
security&lt;br/&gt;into a new two-semester research course for undergraduate
students.
