This is a capacity building project for curriculum and faculty development and
in information assurance and security. The four collaborating institutions are
developing, testing, and sharing educational materials on secure network
protocols that can be used in both undergraduate and graduate studies. The
materials are integrated into a cohesive set of educational modules that
collectively address the area of secure network protocols. Modules include the
basic requirements, principles, architecture, building blocks, and
implementation of secure protocols; analysis of protocols to determine how well
they satisfy security requirements; and implementation of existing secure
protocols in representative environments. In addition, faculty development is
supported by having members from these institutions attend the Information
Assurance Education Graduate Certificate (IAEGC) at Purdue University.
