Part 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 20th ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad
Hoc Networking and Computing (MobiHoc 2019) is a premier symposium with a highly
selective single-track technical program dedicated to addressing the challenges
emerging from networked systems that must operate in the face of dynamics
ranging from changing user demands to connectivity and resource availability.
This award supports graduate and undergraduate students who will substantially
benefit from attending this conference but have limited foreign travel funds.
Priority will be given to students from under-represented groups (women,
minorities, and those with disabilities), authors without other funding, and
first time attendees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part

Networking and Computing (MobiHoc 2019) is a premier symposium with a highly

emerging from networked systems that must operate in the face of dynamics
ranging from changing user demands to connectivity and resource availability.
This award supports the travel of graduate and undergraduate students from U.S.
universities to participate in the conference. The selection criteria give
preference to applicants who are women, minorities, have disabilities, or are
from other under-represented groups. The students will be exposed to the state-
of-the-art developments in the field and will have the opportunity to interact
with peers from institutions worldwide, participate in a mentoring event, meet
with leading researchers, and participate in discussions that are likely to
shape their future and that of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
