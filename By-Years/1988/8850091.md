Southern University will conduct two-four week summer residential institutes
focused on orienting high potential U. S. minority high school students toward
careers in engineering and the sciences. Participants will receive intensive
training in mathematics, chemistry, physics, computers, communications, and
engineering science. Students will perform design work which require creative
thinking and innovation in arriving at a novel solution to a design problem.
Participants will also visit area plant sites to experience the real world
practice of engineering and to meet with minority scientists and engineers
employed at those industries. The underlying premise of the program is to impart
to the participants an understanding and an appreciation of the analytical
thought process and activities of the scientist-engineer. Students entering
grades 10-12 are eligible to apply.
