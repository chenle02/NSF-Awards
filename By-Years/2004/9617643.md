9617643 Abstract This project will evaluate the ecological consequences of
climate change in moist and dry arctic tundra with field manipulations of winter
precipitation and summer temperature. Project scientists will investigate
effects on species performance, community structure, and ecosystem C and N
dynamics. They will erect snow fences to increase snowpack and use small
greenhouses to warm air and soil temperatures. Growth rings and annual stem
increments of wood species and physiological plant performance will be compared
with historical temperature and precipitation records. Experimental findings
will also be compared to natural vegetation patterns along snow gradients and
areas where long-term anthropogenic increases in snow cover have occurred.
Simulation modeling will be used to extend their findings with a focus on net
ecosystem carbon budgets. The main effort will be to quantify and understand the
magnitude and direction of the transient response of arctic tundra to a series
of climate change scenarios. The experimental infrastructure will permit more
detailed investigations by other investigators in future years if the response
is, as we anticipate, of sufficient magnitude to be of importance for evaluation
effects of climate change to arctic ecosystems. The project is a U. S.
contribution Of the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX).
