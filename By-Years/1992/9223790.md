This award supports a program to characterize tephras in Alaska and Siberia in
order to better understand the volume, extent, and climatic effects of large
volcanic eruptions in the Arctic. The project will fingerprint tephras by major
and trace element analytical methods and will develop a chronologic record of
tephras that can be used for correlating volcanic ash layers in ice core
acquired through the Greenland Ice Sheet Project-2 (GISP2). Estimates of the
volume of ash erupted in each event will be important input to climate models
because volcanic ash in the atmosphere is known to cause temperature decreases.
