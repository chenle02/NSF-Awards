This is an award to support work on the feasibility of using optical fibers in a
system for monitoring of groundwater pollutants. The work is based on previous
development by the investigator of an optrode that utilized a chemical
intermediary to detect and monitor water solutions of polar organic substances.
In this project, the investigator plans to devise an optrode and spectroscopic
system for both saturated and unsaturated (vapor phase) conditions and to
determine its potential applicability in survey of the movement of groundwater
pollutants. The proposal leading to this project was submitted in response to
NSF 90-121, Research Planning Grants and Career Advancement Awards for Women
Scientists and Engineers. The proposed work involves the conduct of a research
planning grant. It is responsive to the effort NSF is making to assist in
increasing the number of new women investigators participating in NSF's
supported research programs and to facilitate the conduct of preliminary studies
and other activities that are likely to result in the development of competitive
research projects by women who have not previously had independent Federal
research funding.
