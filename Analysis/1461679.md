This award supports participation in a conference on mathematical sciences
challenges in quantum information science, held 12-13 February 2015 in
Arlington, Virginia. The field of quantum information (QI) explores the
theoretical, experimental, and technological areas covering the use and
implications of quantum mechanics for communication and computation purposes.
While conceptually all of the diverse aspects that QI encompasses arise from the
seemingly simple appreciation of information as a physical resource, its
consequences have the potential to revolutionize computation, communication, and
ideas about complexity. In particular, QI promises exponentially more efficient
quantum algorithms for solving hard combinatorial problems and for simulating
the behavior of complex quantum systems, along with unprecedented opportunities
for secure communication and new perspectives to tackle a range of problems in
physics, biology, applied mathematics, engineering, and computer sciences. As a
result, QI is currently a thriving and naturally interdisciplinary research
area, and one of critical strategic relevance to 21st century's science and
technology.

As the QI field is entering a new stage of maturity, further progress is
increasingly relying on the use of diverse advanced mathematical techniques. In
turn, new areas of mathematics are being identified, which offer the potential
for major future advances in the field. This award supports a one-and-a-half-day
conference that brings together leading researchers working across a broad
spectrum of problems in QI theory, with the goals of (i) highlighting the
centrality and importance of mathematical tools; and (ii) assessing outstanding
mathematical challenges and formulating a vision for the future. A distinguished
group of speakers will highlight the latest research developments and open
problems in topics, including quantum channels and quantum error correction
theory, quantum marginals, random quantum states and dynamics, many-body quantum
systems, and quantum control. Panel discussions and breakout sessions are
intended to identify new promising directions for investigations. The expected
broad impacts of the proposed conference are twofold. On the one hand, the
conference facilitates collaborative exploration between academic and federal
agency scientists of the short- to mid-term mathematical challenges in advancing
the field of QI -- with a written report being anticipated as an output of the
conference. On the other hand, the conference serves as a vehicle to enlist
mathematically-oriented scientists to bring their ideas to bear on accessible
fundamental problems in QI, and to educate the next generation of scientists
working in this very important field.
