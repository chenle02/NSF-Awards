9317851 Galambos The Structural Stability Research Council (SSRC) has published
four editions of its "Guide" (1960, 1966, 1976, and 1988) and its Executive
Committee has authorized the preparation of the fifth edition for publication in
1996. The various parts of the new "Guide" are currently (1993) being written by
the Task Groups of the Council. The principal investigator has been appointed by
SSRC to be the editor of the fifth edition. This will involve a) working with
the SSRC Task Groups to assist them in the preparation of the first draft of
each chapter, b) managing the review process for each chapter, c) editing each
chapter to achieve uniformity of coverage and style, d) performing the tasks
involved in assembling and editing a major book and e) performing the editorial
jobs in the interface between author and publishers (proofs, galleys, etc.). No
funds are requested for writing or for publishing the "Guide."
