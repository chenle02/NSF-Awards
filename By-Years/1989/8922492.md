The object of the proposed research is to develop a consistent theory of
lubrication with two-component lubricants in the hydrodynamic and elasto-
hydrodynamic regimes. The lubricants considered are liquids containing either
bubbles, as found in practice in cavitating bearings and squeeze-dampers, or
droplets, as found in many metal forming operations. The theoretical study will
be based on mixture theory for multi-phase continua. The goal is construction
and solution of a number of boundary value problems that characterize the
various technical applications of these multi-component lubricants.
