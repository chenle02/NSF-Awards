Gordon 9729322 The observational data set (hydrographic survey, shipboard
current profiles, satellite altimetry, surface drifters, and subsurface floats)
from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment s (WOCE) Indian Ocean Expedition
will be used to explore the Indian Ocean thermohaline stratification,
circulation and heat/freshwater fluxes. The specific objectives are (1) to track
the meridional spreading of low salinity tropical water within the western
Indian Ocean, including the contribution of Indonesian throughflow water and to
ascertain its role in interocean circulation; (2) to study the exchange of Bay
of Bengal water masses with those of the equatorial belt and Arabian Sea and to
investigate the origin and significance of the unique benthic boundary layer
observed within the Bay of Bengal; and (3) to calculate the horizontal sub-basin
scale fluxes of heat and freshwater across hydrographic sections. Results of
these studies will be compared with model output in order to evaluate the
circulation model and to extend the observations to larger temporal and spatial
scales.
