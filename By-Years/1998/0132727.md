The project will investigate the extent to which variability of the large-scale
atmosphere is controlled by variations at the smaller synoptic scales. The
upscale energy flux from the synoptic waves is reckoned to be an important
contributor in generating variations at the larger scales. It is, of course, by
no means the only contributor since instability of the zonal flow, variations in
tropical diabatic heating, and planetary wave-zonal flow interactions can also
generate significant planetary-scale variability in the troposphere on the
intraseasonal-to seasonal time scales. Modeling and prediction of this
variability component remains challenging. Drs. Orlando and, co-PI, Dr. Tung
(Univ. of Washington, Seattle) will conduct a dynamically oriented analysis of
the interaction of upscale synoptic fluxes and the larger-scale tropospheric
circulation. The focus of the project will be on characterizing the upscale
synoptic fluxes from modeling experiments of varying complexity. The project
will advance understanding and modeling of the tropospheric circulation
variability on intraseasonal-to-seasonal time scales, particularly, during the
Northern winter season.
