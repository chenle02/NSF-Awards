The goal of this research is a systematic computer-aided design system for the
synthesis of mechanical devices that guide spatial movement. Existing design
systems can display and animate a predefined device, but none have the ability
to assist an inventor in finding a new device given a description of its desired
function. This function to form synthesis process has been developed for planar
mechanisms, and our goal is to extend it to spatial mechanisms and robots. The
basic strategy is to evaluate the kinematics equations of an articulated chain
at goal positions that define the desired movement workspace. The solution of
these equations define the physical dimensions of the chain. The architecture of
the design system is structured to provide platform independence and to be
compatible with collaborative use and development via the Internet.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will provide the theory and
an example implementation of a design system that enables mechanical designers
to specify a desired spatial movement and the topology of a device, to
automatically formulate and solve the associated design equations, and then to
interactively survey, evaluate, and modify candidate designs. Preliminary
results show that this has the potential to make available a large number of
devices for inventive applications. The resulting products can provide effective
low-cost automation for the home, office and factory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
