Stem cells are promising for the regeneration of aged, injured and diseased
tissues and organs, but to realize their therapeutic potential growth of
unwanted cell types should be arrested, and improvement in efficiency of
converting them to a specific cell type is necessary. The proposed work will
examine a genome editing approach for eliminating growth of unwanted cell
lineages.

The overall goal of this project is to increase the efficiency and specificity
of stem cell differentiation by reducing off-target cell types through CRISPR.
CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockout of transcription factors involved in the
maturation of serotonergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic phenotypes. Clones will
be DNA sequenced to confirm deletions in the regions involved in serotonin,
glutamate and GABA synthesis pathways, and those lacking these genes will be
treated with FI (forskolin and IBMX) to induce a higher percentage of cells to
express a dopaminergic phenotype. This method will also be applied to increase
the efficiency and specificity of neural stem cell differentiation. The results
are anticipated to easily transfer to induced pluripotent, embryonic, and adult
stem cells. From an educational standpoint, this project will provide
interdisciplinary training to students with an opportunity to integrate
knowledge from different fields to investigate non-traditional engineering
problems. The investigators will recruit and retain female and minority
engineering students into the research project.
