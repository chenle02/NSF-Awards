9419247 Buzsaki The behavior of organisms is controlled by electrical signaling
in large populations of brain cells. One of the great technical challenges for
brain scientists is to describe the electrical activity of neuronal populations
in a way that is related to behavior. With this award, a team comprised of a
neuroscientist, a mathematician and an engineer, and headed by Dr. Gyorgy
Buzsaki, will construct a system for monitoring the signals produced by large
numbers of brain cells recorded from animals while they are engaged in bouts of
behavior. The team will test their methods by recording, analyzing and
displaying the signals of cells within the hippocampus, a structure believed to
be essential for certain types of learning. This work should have broad impact
on the methods used in future research by both experimental and theoretical
neuroscientists in the attempt to understand the neural control of behavior.
