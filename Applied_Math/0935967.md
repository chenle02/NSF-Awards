This award provides support for travel and local expenses for participants in
three meetings during the 2009-2010 academic year at Northwestern University:
(A) Conference/Workshop on Complex Geometry and Partial Differential Equations
(October 24-27, 2009); (B) International Conference on Nonlinear Partial
Differential Equations and Related Analysis and Applications (March 20-24,
2010); (C) Workshop on Local and Global Analysis of Eigenfunctions (June 3-7,
2010).

The meetings are part of an "Emphasis Year in Partial Differential Equations and
Related Analysis and Applications" to be held at the university. The goal of
this program is to develop new connections between analysis of partial
differential equations and their application in other science and engineering
disciplines.

The meetings will provide opportunities for researchers in applied analysis,
including senior investigators, graduate students, and recent Ph.D. recipients,
to develop working relationships with one another, and the emphasis year is
likely to catalyze new interdisciplinary research projects. The meetings
encourage participation by, and provide support for, members of groups
underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. Dissemination of the activities
via web postings and published conference proceedings is planned.
