9724553 Schwarz A time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (TOF-SIMS) will
be acquired by Queens College. The instrument will be a component of the Center
for Polymers at Engineered Interfaces, a Materials Research Science and
Engineering Center encompassing several institutions in the New York City area.
The TOF-SIMS will be used for studying polymer film phenomena, including depth
composition profiles, dewetting and spinodal decomposition of tailored surfaces.
It will also be a part of the Center's undergraduate research and high school
outreach programs. %%% The instrument will significantly enhance the Center's
research capabilities and its education programs. ***
