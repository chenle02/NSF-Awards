This dissertation investigates how immigrants learn ideologies about the U. S.
racial social structure. Focus groups and in-depth interviews will explore how
new immigrants perceive the racial hierarchy and how these perceptions compare
with racial categories in their countries of origin. Questions will focus
especially on personal experiences and media exposure that have conveyed
knowledge of the racial hierarchy. A second set of issues will investigate how
contact with this racial ideology has affected the immigrants' own racial
identity, for instance, whether they have maintained specific national
affiliations or developed more pan-ethnic identities. These processes of
acquiring racial knowledge and adopting new racial identities are bound up with
immigrants' acceptance or rejection of racial ideology and the ideologies'
characterizations of their own position in that hierarchy. A variety of
immigrant groups will be interviewed to investigate how past experiences and
their position in the racial hierarchy influence acquisition and acceptance of
racial ideologies.&lt;br/&gt;
