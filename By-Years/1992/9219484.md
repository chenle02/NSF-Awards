The Llano uplift and of central Texas records a complex history of Grenville
and Pre-Grenville tectonism that has not been overprinted by later orogenic
events. This study will focus on two of the more significant questions regarding
the evolution of this mid-Proterozoic crust: the extent of pre-Grenville crust
and its orogenic history, and the timing of Grenville-age regional metamorphism
and deformation. Results are expected to generate additional understanding of
the nature, extent, and timing of mid- Proterozoic tectonism along the southern
margin of North American.
