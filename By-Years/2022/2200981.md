Dynamical techniques, in which the behavior of repeated iterations of a function
is studied, recently have been employed in understanding number-theoretic
questions. The goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of this
fruitful interplay, now known as "arithmetic dynamics." In particular, the
project will study the connections between the field of Diophantine geometry,
which uses algebraic geometry to study rational solutions of polynomial
equations, and the field of arithmetic dynamics. The PI will also organize
seminars and workshops to inform junior researchers and attract students to the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is inspired by the theme of "unlikely
intersections" in arithmetic geometry, which predicts roughly that, in the
absence of an underlying structural reason, arithmetic objects cannot intersect
more than dimensional considerations suggest. The projects in this research
originate from the Relative Bogomolov Conjecture (RBC) concerning the
distribution of points of small height in subvarieties of abelian families. RBC
is a generalization of the classical Manin-Mumford and Bogomolov conjectures and
remains largely open. The PI and collaborators aim to develop techniques to: (1)
study the distribution of linearly related points in subvarieties of families of
abelian varieties; (2) prove dynamical analogues of RBC and establish uniformity
in the dynamical Bogomolov conjecture; (3) investigate the growth of heights in
families of rational maps along curves and study the relationship between these
estimates and integrality properties of preperiodic points in families; and (4)
prove, from a statistical viewpoint, effective versions of a conjecture on
"uniform boundedness of rational preperiodic points" and
others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
