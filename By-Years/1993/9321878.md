9321878 Alexander This award supports mathematical research on problems arising
in the theory of several complex variables. Four primary areas will be consider
in this project. The first concerns polyharmonic interpolations continuous
functions on C-1 curves in the boundary of the unit ball. The second area
focuses on a unique continuation property and weak Hopf lemma for holomorphic
mappings from the plane to higher dimensional spaces. Also, work will be done on
an extremal problems about hulls and spheres in complex two-dimensional space.
Finally, an investigation of the disc-hull and other properties of hulls which
arise by a linking process will be taken up. Special emphasis will be placed on
studying the ball of the Lagrangian disc of Duval.Several complex variables
arose at the beginning of the century as a natural outgrowth of studies of
functions of one complex variable. It became clear early on that the theory
differed widely from it predecessor. The underlying geometry was far more
difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more affinity with partial
differential operators of first order. It thus grew as a hybrid subject
combining deep characteristics of differential geometry and differential
equations. Many of the fundamental structures were defined in the last three
decades. Current studies still concentrate on understanding these basic
mathematical forms. ***
