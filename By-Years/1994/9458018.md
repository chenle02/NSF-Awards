9458018 Soboyejo The program explores the use of cutting edge materials science
and micromechanics concepts in the microstructural design of high temperature
intermetallic alloys and composites. The research involves the application of
fundamental knowledge derived from basic studies of materials structure,
processing, and failure mechanisms, in the design of inorganic materials for
high temperature structural applications. The systems studied include; in-situ
titanium-matrix composites produced by rapid solidification and ingot metallurgy
techniques; twin-toughened gamma-based titanium aluminide intermetallics
produced by ingot and powder metallurgy techniques; and synergistically
toughened nickel aluminide composites produced by dry phase blending and spray
forming techniques. After processing, very detailed studies of composite
structure and failure mechanisms are carried out on composites with different
microstructural size scales. Systematic experiments and micromechanics analyses
are performed to investigate the effects of crack-tip shielding mechanisms on
composite mechanical properties. %%% The knowledge derived from these studies
will be used to guide the development of practical concepts for the design of
damage tolerant composites with different microstructural size scales. ***
