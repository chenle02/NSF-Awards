This grant will support the computerization of the amphibian reptile collection
at the American Museum of Natural History (292,000 catalogued specimens) using
MUSE, a collection database originally designed with NSF support. The AMNH
herpetological collection ranks third or fourth in the world in number of
specimens, taxonomic breadth (6000 species; over 520 holotypes) and global
geographic coverage. Other holdings include frozen tissues, toxins, chromosome
and histological preparations, and tape recordings of anuran vocalizations. The
collection is heavily used in teaching and research on biodiversity and
environmental biology and is one the most important in the world for systematic
studies on amphibians and reptiles. Computerization will greatly increase the
accessibility of collections and associated research data to research
biologists.
