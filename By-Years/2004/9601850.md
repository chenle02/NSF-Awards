9601850 Karl The PI requests funding to establish a shared-use, deep- ocean
instrumented mooring facility to support both general and specialized time-
series observations that are critical for a complete understanding of less
frequent, episodic events. Current projects which justify this purchase are the
Hawaiian Ocean Time-series (HOT) measurements which include components in both
JGOFS and WOCE. Proposed instrumentation for the mooring include an IMET
meteorology package, an ADCP, an acoustic release to recover the mooring, a
remote water sampler, a bio-optical package, and seacats to measure temperature
and conductivity. The SOEST Deep-Ocean Instrumented Mooring Facility will
initially be established and managed as a standard NSF research project; i.e.,
distributed responsibility among the four listed co- PIs. Ultimately this
facility will be supported by project- specific State and Federal research
grants. UH's costshare of $209, 450 represents 53% of this project's cost. ***
