Since in most applications of control theory there is only limited, imprecise
information of the physical phenomena to formulate the mathematical models, the
control of an unknown system is probably the most basic problem in control
theory. Often in these descriptions there are perturbations, unmodelled dynamics
or inaccuracies that can be effectively modelled as noise so there is the
problem of stochastic adaptive control. It is proposed to have a workshop on
stochastic theory and adaptive control. The assembling of leading researchers on
stochastic control and filtering and stochastic adaptive control is planned. The
communication among these people will expose various methods in adaptive control
and techniques from stochastic analysis that should be important in the solution
of basic problems in adaptive control. In addition, the PI's intend to invite a
number of graduate students to provide them with additional exposure to this
area of research.
