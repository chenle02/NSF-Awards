A long term goal motivating this project is the development of a universal
computational engine to support reasoning across different applications of
intelligent systems (e.g., planning and diagnosis). The project is founded on an
approach that compiles knowledge bases into a taxonomy of tractable forms, which
result from imposing various conditions, such as decomposability and
determinism, on Negation Normal Form (NNF). Certain queries, which are generally
intractable, become tractable on the compiled NNF forms. To implement a task
like planning or diagnosis, all one needs to do is compile their knowledge base
to the most succinct subset of NNF that provides polytime support for the
queries required by the task. The project will focus in particular on algorithms
for imposing various conditions on NNF compilations, using both top-down and
bottom-up compilation techniques, to support a larger set of tractable forms.
This will lead to developing and evaluating a more powerful inference engine
than traditional SAT solvers, supported by a more comprehensive set of queries
and transformations on knowledge bases. It will also lead to extending the
compilation approach to a larger class of AI applications.
