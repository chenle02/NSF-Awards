The roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans is a model organism that senses and
responds to sex pheromones in a gender-specific manner: males are attracted to
female pheromones, but females avoid the pheromones. The goal of this project is
to understand how molecules and nerve cells generate gender-specific behaviors.
This species is very well-suited for studies of behavior since it is the only
organism for which we know the complete wiring diagram of the nervous system. In
this study the pheromones will be purified and their molecular structure
determined. These pheromones bind to receptors on the surface of the olfactory
cells and signal to the brain that females are present. In addition, the brain
circuit required for male response to the pheromones will be determined. One of
the eventual goals of this project is to test models for how brain activity
generates behavior. The C. elegans nervous system is simple enough that it
should be possible to reprogram behavior and thereby confirm models for nerve
cell function and behavior. Part of this project will be carried out by
undergraduates, thus the proposed research will train students in genetics and
neurobiology, and give them a practical basis for understanding fundamental
principles. The results of this proposal will be made available by publication
in scientific journals and presented to the public by the PI in community and
university presentations.
