Massive near-surface deposits of ice have been detected within debris aprons on
Mars. We propose to use a numerical model to investigate the rate at which these
deposits will flow and/or sublime over time, for different models of Martian
climate evolution. In this way the age and evolution of these deposits can be
constrained, and will throw light on the recent history of Martian water and
climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Constraining the recent evolution of the Martian
climate is important for understanding both its longer-term evolution, and also
the potential habitability of Mars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of
this project is that it will expose a graduate student to a new educational
environment (Japan), and will foster future international
collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;
