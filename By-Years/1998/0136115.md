Social measurement entails discovering the nature of knowledge shared by a group
of individuals who possess common backgrounds, cultural knowledge, or social
norms, i.e., knowledge defined by social conventions. Unlike most physical and
psychophysical measurements, social measurements need not have objective
external criteria. Therefore cultural knowledge and social norms must be
inferred from the pattern of responses among respondents to test items posed by
researchers. Previous research has developed a collection of formal models and
methods for social measurement known as cultural consensus theory. The models
bear a close relationship to models in psychometric test theory; however, unlike
most applications of test theory, the researcher does not assume prior knowledge
of the "answer key" for the test items. The theory consists of a family of
knowledge aggregation models for questionnaire data that permits the
simultaneous estimation of the competence or knowledge of each respondent and
the consensus correct answer to each question. Models exist for particular
testing formats such as true-false, multiple-choice, matching, and rank order
for the case of a single homogeneous culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
project will take cultural consensus theory to the next level by developing new
models to deal with more complex response formats, and to extend the models to
the multiculture case where the respondents can be partitioned into subgroups.
The new models will then be applied to a set of empirical studies concerning
reliable differences in the perceptual structure of color, in particular across
different language groups and between different individuals within a group.
State-of-the-art Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimation methods will be developed
for these new models. The advances in theory and method that will emerge from
this research will improve the quality of social measurement, both for research
questions related to the perceptual structure of color and for other measurement
questions that depend upon aggregating the judgements of respondents.&lt;br/&gt;
