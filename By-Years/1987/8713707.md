The past five years have seen a profound escalation in the need for large
numbers of high quality synthetic peptides in the fields of molecular biology,
immunology, pharmacology, biochemistry, biology, and chemistry. A major limiting
factor in these studies has remained the availability, cost and purity of the
desired peptides. Although it is currently possible, using available manual or
automated methods, to produce large numbers of peptides (ie., hundreds), the
effort is so time consuming and costly that to carry out this number of
syntheses is normally impractical even in well equipped laboratories. Small
laboratories and institutions are virtually precluded from carrying out research
requiring large numbers of peptides. We have recently devised a procedure called
simultaneous multiple peptide synthesis (SMPS), which permits the rapid
simultaneous solid phase peptide synthesis of large numbers of peptides. In the
proposed research SMPS will be optimized and in turn used to optimize synthesis
protocols. Upon completion of the proposed research it is expected that
laboratory personnel, even those without specific prior training in peptide
chemistry, will be able to simultaneously synthesize at least 100 totally
different peptide sequences having excellent purity, without the need for
automated equipment, in a time frame (2-4 weeks) and cost at least 10 times less
than currently available manual or automated methods.
