The major objectives of the Talladega College Summer Science Camp (TCSSC)
program are: 1) to improve basic science skills of middle school participants;
2) to determine science interest and aptitude of middle school participants; 3)
to make precollege (middle school) students aware of the course of study, and
the mechanisms and processes necessary to reach and succeed in science; 4) to
reach out to and guide precollege (middle school) students into courses of study
leading to careers in science by, in part, exposing them to role models. In
order to achieve the objectives above, a series of activities have been
designed. If funded they will involve: o field trips to various sites of
scientific interest o involvement in hands on scientific experimentation o
lectures and seminars by role models o short courses in Biology, Chemistry,
Mathematics. Physics & Computer Science
