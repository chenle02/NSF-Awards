Peterson, Ruth AST 96-18502 Dr. Peterson will explore the influence stellar
internal rotation and oxygen abundance have on a star's properties during the
core-He burning phase of evolution (the Horizontal Branch phase). Although
overall metallicity is a primary factor controlling the location of a star on
the Horizontal Branch, it is clear there is a 'second' parameter that also
influences its position. Many physical variables have been proposed for the
second parameter - age, helium, oxygen, and carbon abundances, rotation, and
other parameters that control the amount of mass loss - but no single 'second'
parameter has been clearly identified. Dr. Peterson proposes to continue
investigations into the effects of oxygen abundance and rotation in a larger
sample of stars and globular clusters to map the influence of these parameters.
New observations and the analysis of observations in hand will delineate trends
in stellar rotation and oxygen abundances across a wide range of cluster
metallicity, HB morphology and concentration, as well as provide more extensive
samples within selected clusters. ***
