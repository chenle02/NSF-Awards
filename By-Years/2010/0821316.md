Bonnie&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: MRI:Development of a Time Projection Chamber
and Photo-Multiplier&lt;br/&gt;Array to Measure Neutrino Interactions in the
MicroBooNE Detector&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes the development
of the Liquid Argon time projection chamber (TPC) and Photo-multiplier Tube
(PMT) array as a major part of the MicroBooNE experiment at Fermilab. It is with
the development of the MicroBooNE TPC and PMT array that the nature of the
intriguing low energy events recently observed by the MiniBooNE experiment may
be resolved. In addition, the R&amp;D on the Liquid Argon TPC will provide
important information and experience for developing the larger systems that will
be necessary to fully elucidate the nature of the neutrino sector in future
experiments at Fermilab and DUSEL.&lt;br/&gt;
