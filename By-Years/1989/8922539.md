This research deals with the construction, evaluation, andanalysis of
algorithms to solve large linear and nonlinearsystems of equations arising from
problems in mechanics onemerging parallel architectures. The research deals
particularlywith the hypercube architecture and, to a lesser extent, with
theCray Y.MP. The research focuses on the types of systems thatarise in linear
elasticity, large displacement analysis of platesand shells, and nonlinear
elasticity, as well as the types ofsystems arising in incompressible fluid flow.
