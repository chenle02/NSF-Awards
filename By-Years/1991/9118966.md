Numerical models are key tools for research in atmospheric science. The wide
range of temporal and spatial scales that are involved in atmospheric motions
presents a real challenge in terms of how these different scales are handled in
a numerical model. An essential element of a successful modeling effort, whether
in a research or an operational context, is the availability of computationally
efficient numerical methods. Multigrid methods hold promise for overcoming of
these numerical problems. Under previous NSF support, Professor Fulton
investigated applications of multigrid methodology to a variety of atmospheric
models. He now plans to extend his previous results to other areas and embark on
some new applications. Specifically, he will pursue studies of (1) multigrid
solvers for balanced models, (2) adaptive mesh refinement in models of
hurricanes and fronts, and (3) multigrid methodology for spectral models, both
limited area and global.
