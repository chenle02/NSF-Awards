The mating system of the acorn woodpecker (Melanerpes formicivorus) is among the
most complex of any vertebrate: groups consist of up to seven breeding males, as
many as three reproductive females and a variable number helpers (offspring of
previous years that remain on the natal territory and do not breed). Males
compete to mate and females lay their eggs communally in the same nest. Breeders
of the same sex are almost always close relatives, either siblings or parents
and offspring. Previous work showed that joint-nesting groups of females, unlike
males, share parentage equally. This project will determine the factors that
influence reproductive sharing in acorn woodpecker societies by combining
fieldwork on color-marked birds with modern molecular techniques to identify
individuals that successfully produce young within social groups and to quantify
their behavior. A primary goal of the project is to understand the fitness
consequences of cooperative breeding and to integrate findings into the larger
questions of the evolution and ecology of group living in highly social species,
including humans.
