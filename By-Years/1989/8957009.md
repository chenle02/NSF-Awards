This award provides support to Dr. Andrei Shleifer under the National Science
Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator Awards Program. The objective of
this program is to provide research support to the Nation's most outstanding and
promising young science and engineering faculty. The awards are intended to
improve the capability of U.S. academic institutions to respond to the demand
for highly qualified science and engineering personnel for academic and
industrial research and teaching. This award will allow the investigator to
pursue his research in the areas of microeconomics, financial economics, and
development theory. One of the broad research questions central to his scholarly
interests is how capital markets work. Despite the empirical successes of the
current theory of capital markets, there are many observable phenomena that are
inconsistent with the assumptions of the theory. Were the theory true, corporate
takeovers would not take place or they would be inconsequential, all investors
would hold very similar portfolios, and returns on markets would be less
volatile and changes in asset prices would correspond to changes in economic
fundamentals. Dr. Shleifer's work has helped us to understand how monopolistic
and imperfectly competitive elements can be incorporated into our theories of
capital markets. He has contributed to an explanation of the crucial role of
large shareholders in the market for corporate control and to a model of the
role of noise traders. The research promises to explain a great deal about
speculation, volatility, and the efficiency of capital markets. Dr. Shleifer's
work has been and will continue to be very effective in establishing an
important synergy between fundamental research and related problems of practical
significance to U.S. business and industry.
