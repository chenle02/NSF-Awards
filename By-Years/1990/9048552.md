The proposed Center is a partnership of five universities, two prominent
community organizations, a national laboratory, a statewide business, education,
and government alliance, and the Chicago Public Schools. The universities are
Loyola (the lead institution), Chicago State, Illinois Institute of Technology,
Southwestern University, and University of Illinois/Chicago. Fifteen programs
will be conducted, under subcontracts, by the partner-institutions. One of the
programs to improve undergraduate retention, Teaching Integrated Mathematics and
Science (TIMS), will receive a substantial grant from the Division of Teacher
Preparation and Enhancement (DTPE) and the Division of Mathematics (DMS), which
will jointly support the Center with the Career Access Program. Program
Components, in addition to TIMS, will address their target-areas: Teachers,
Undergraduates, and Pre-College - elementary, middle, and high school program
activities will include institutes, academics, tutorials, apprenticeships, and
workshops for parents and students.
