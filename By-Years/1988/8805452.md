Most chloroplast proteins are encoded in the nucleus, synthesized in the
cytoplasm as higher molecular weight precursors and imported into chloroplasts
posttranslationally. Our long term goal is to understand how this import process
occurs. Protein import will be studied in an in vitro reconstituted assay. In
this assay, radiolabeled precursor proteins are first synthesized by in vitro
transcription and translation of cloned precursor genes and then incubated with
isolated intact chloroplasts. The present studies will focus on two particular
aspects of the import process. The first is the mechanism whereby precursor
proteins get translocated across the two envelope membranes. Efforts will be
made to identify translocation intermediates in order to gain a more complete
description of the stages in the import process. Efforts will also be made to
identify proteins of the chloroplast envelope membranes that are involved in
precursor import. The second aspect of the proposed studies will be to
investigate the pathway and mechanisms whereby cytoplasmically synthesized
proteins are transported to the thylakoid lumen. This process is particularly
interesting because these proteins cross three membranes between their site of
synthesis and their final location.%%% The insights gained from this work will
be important in two respects. First, they will add to basic knowledge regarding
the targeting of cytoplasmically synthesized proteins to their proper locations
in eukaryotic cells. Second, these results will have practical application
during efforts to alter the metabolism of chloroplasts by genetic
engineering.***//
