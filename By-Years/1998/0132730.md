Abstract CTS-0132730 R. Sureshkumar, Washington University

The objectives of this proposed research are: (1) to develop efficient and
robust three-dimensional simulation tools for the design, optimization, and
control of manufacturing processes of polymeric materials, and (2) to use the
simulation tools to investigate thermostatic effects on the stability of
polymeric flows in complex geometric shapes likely to be encounter in industrial
processes. The problem to be considered are flow in concentric cylinders, flow
through arrays of cylinders in a channel, multilayer shear flows, uniaxial
and/or biaxial extension, and fiber spinning. The broader impact of the proposed
research is the development of simulation tools for industrial processes, to
train graduate students in materials research and development, and to enhance
the undergraduate students' design experience.
