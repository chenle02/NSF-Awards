This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) supports simulation studies of
a new architecture for parallel computation. The new architecture, mirror
memory, is a variation on the snoopy cache coherence techniques that are
possible in bus-based multiprocessors. A mirror memory system is a network of
processor-memory pairs, interconnected by high-speed fiberoptic links. The
processor-memory interface at each node of the network keeps track of shared
variables that the node has copies of. Any time the processor writes a new value
for one of these shared variables, the new value is multicast to all other nodes
that have copies of the variable. This is "snooping in reverse". In a normal
snoopy cache, the bus interface makes sure that its own processor has the
correct data; in mirror memory, the interface makes sure that every other
processor has the correct data. Trace simulations based on large-scale
scientific programs are being used to establish the network and interface speeds
required for transmitting new values, and to determine the effects of hot spots
in large networks. Detailed simulations of network and interface operation
determine the effects of proposed mechanisms on program running times.
