This project concerns two topics in numerical linear algebra: the numerical
treatment of Markov chains and regularization of ill-posed linear systems. The
topics share common features: singular or nearly singular matrices; use of
iterative methods for large-scale problems; problems in matrix perturbation; and
connections with infinite dimensional problems. The computation of the steady-
state vector of a Markov chain as well as other important quantities are being
investigated. In particular, algorithms are being developed and analyzed for
calculating mean first passage times and for computing the recurrence matrix of
M/G/1 type queues. In addition aggregation methods with overlapping blocks and
the behavior of chains with sluggish transients are being considered. When ill-
posed problems are discretized they result in ill-conditioned linear systems
which must be regularized to yield accurate solutions. There are three main
goals in this work. The first is to prove the folk theorem that if the
components of the data vector with respect to the singular vectors decay
sufficiently fast then the conjugate gradient iteration will produce a
regularizing set of solutions. The second is to treat problems with errors in
the matrix by a regularized total-least-squares approach. The third is to
further preconditioning strategies for iterative solution methods.
