*** 9522166 Frangopol The main objective of this research is to develop a
framework for considering system reliability in evaluation and design of steel
and concrete highway bridges. The study consists of several major tasks. After a
review of both the current component-oriented methodology and the applications
of system reliability concepts in bridge evaluation and design, an objective and
practical system-oriented reliability-based methodology will be proposed. In
this regard, both serviceability and ultimate limit states will be considered
based on the Load and Resistance Factor Design method. Using the incremental
loading fault-tree strategy, system factor modifiers will be introduced in both
bridge evaluation and design to account for the presence and interaction of
individual components in the bridge system. In this manner, the full potential
of system reliability concepts to the advancement of bridge evaluation and
design processes will be realized. A data base consisting of at least forty-
three highway bridges located in the U.S. in thirteen different states will be
used to demonstrate and validate the applicability of the proposed methodology.
The end result will have a significant impact on improving the management of the
reliability of our highway bridge infrastructure. In fact, the proposed bridge
system reliability methodology will greatly assist engineers in making more
rational decisions with respect to both safety and economy in evaluating and
designing highway bridges.***
