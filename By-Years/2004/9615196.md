Ligrani, Philip M. University of Utah CTS-9615196 ABSTRACT The principal
investigator proposes an experimental study of the effects bulk flow pulsations
have on film cooling. The work is relevant to heat transfer in gas turbine
engines. A low speed wind tunnel will be used to generate a boundary-layer flow
over a flat plate where film cooling could be introduced. Bulk flow pulsations
will be generated by an array of rotating shutters located at the exit of the
test section. Injectant distributions will be determined by flow visualization
using a video camera and smoke or fog introduced into the flow stream. Heat
transfer coefficients at the test surface will be deduced from thermocouple data
and heat flux data. Hot wire anemometers, pressure probes, and temperature
probes are available for obtaining flow information in the boundary layer.
