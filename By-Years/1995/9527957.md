9527957 Crossley Soils contain a large number of microbes, such as bacteria and
fungi, and animals. These animals range from tiny amoebae, microscopic worms,
small spiders and insects, to the more familiar beetles, ants, earthworms, and
mammals. Although many of these animals can be found in agricultural soils, they
often have been ignored. Current agricultural practice, which involves tilling
the soil and adding chemicals, kills many. But agriculture is moving towards
less intensive management, such as reduced tillage and fewer chemical
applications. In sustainable or reduced input agriculture, soil biology assumes
much greater importance. New management techniques need to be developed, and for
these to be effective, a better basic understanding of soil biology is
necessary. This research asks the question, what are the effects of plant root
systems on soil biology? Also, insects feeding on leaves of plants are linked by
root activity to the below-ground system. How does this linkage affect methods
of management? The answer to these questions will help in the design of
sustainable agriculture and in determining linkages between above-ground
herbivory and the rooting zone in agroecosystems.
