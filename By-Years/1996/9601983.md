The core of the proposal consists of two broad projects relating to the
analysis and design of monetary policy. The objective of the first project is to
extend and apply my earlier work on the use of "semi-structural" vector
autoregression (VAR) methods to measure the stance of monetary policy and the
effects of monetary shocks on the economy. Among the planned extensions are 1)
the use of these methods to study monetary policy in countries other than the
United States; 2) empirical analyses of the 3-6 month "impact effect" of
monetary policy on the economy, and of the role of money in general cyclical
dynamics; and 3) a study of the effects of monetary policy on financial and real
decisions in a large panel of manufacturing firms. The second project studies
the increasingly popular strategy of "inflation targeting". One component of
this project will be a set of six case studies, which will document in some
detail the adoptimn, implementation, and results of various forms of inflation
targeting in Germany, Switzerland, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, and
Sweden. The goal of the case studies is to draw practical lessons about
institutional arrangements, political preconditions, etc., that affect the
likelihood of success. The qualitative analysis will be supplemented by a more
formal econometric examination of the effects of adopting inflation targets on
inflation expectations, monetary policy actions, and the behavior of inflation
itself. In separate theoretical papers I will also address 1) the relative
advantages of inflation targeting and money targeting for central banks with
imperfect credibility and 2) the feasibility and desirability of targeting
private-sector inflation forecasts, rather than inflation per se. Two additional
empirical projects will 1) test the implication of the neoclassical growth model
that a country's rate of TFP growth is strictly exogenous and 2) investigate
whether the worldwide monetary contraction of the 1930s can be rationalized as a
switch am ong multiple equilibria
