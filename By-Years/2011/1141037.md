Peer learning can provide students with an engaging learning environment that
nurtures development of higher-order cognitive skills needed by engineers for
innovation. This collaborative project led by the University of Oklahoma Norman
Campus with partners from Tuskegee University and the Pennsylvania State
University, University Park is using mobile smart devices to facilitate peer
learning. Open ended problem solving ability is one key student outcome being
enhanced by this project. In the Teaching to Learn (TeatoL) environment
participants serve as both teacher and learner and will collectively learn from
each other's experiences. The project is developing new understanding in how
students (a) understand their own cognitive processes, (b) respond to peer
teaching and learning, (c) can develop peer critique and reflection, (d) use
mobile devices and social networks to enhance learning. In addition the project
will develop a better understanding of how "flat" classrooms impact learning,
and the impact of peer learning on underrepresented STEM students.
