The conference on Intelligent Systems in Molecular Biology (ISMB) provides a
general forum for disseminating the latest developments in bioinformatics. It is
a multidisciplinary conference that brings together scientists from computer
science, molecular biology, mathematics and statistics. The meeting venue
alternates between North American and non North American sites. ISMB 2002 will
be held in Edmonton, Canada. The goal is to bring together diverse scientists in
a focus on actual biological problems, not simply theoretical calculations. This
makes ISMB a unique important meeting.
