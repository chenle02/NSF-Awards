The Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia, PA requests NSF support
for a three-year model program entitled "Partnerships for Acheiving Careers in
Technology and Science" (PACTS). Building upon a successful pilot project
involving African-American students and mentors, PACTS aims to foster positive
attitudes about science careers and increase students leadership skills and
self-estee. Through bi-weekly hands-on science workshops with African-American
Scientists as mentors, students will strengthen their understanding of science
concepts and enhance their critical thinking skills. On alternate Saturdays,
students will participate in college/career workshops. PACTS students will also
have the opportunity to tutor younger students, visit science laboratories, and
serve as science museum demonstrators. Additional support and encouragment will
be provided through a network of community resources involving partnerships
among scientists, professional associations, community centers, corporations and
a science center. The PACTS model will be disseminated nationally through museum
conferences, the national networks of professional associations and
corporations, and presentations by PACTS staff to interested organizations in
other cities.
