A new algebraic approach to parallel complexity has recently been emerging
through the work of such investigators as Barrington, Razborov, and Smolensky.
In such work use is made of finite permutation groups and also of rings of
polynomials over fields of prime order for which the indeterminants are assumed
to be idempotent. The PIs are investigating the complexity of parallel
computation through the analysis of such associated algebraic structures. They
have also developed a new model of computation that they call the "safe storage
machine" which periodically loses all but a constant amount of its memory. In
progress are characterizations of classes of languages and predicates definable
by means of variations of this new model. There is much interest in the
theoretical computer science community in the exploration of the newly developed
algebraic view of questions in parallel computation. The PIs bring a broad
strong collective background to this study.
