An exploratory study will be carried out to study the efficacy of a high
velocity mixture of a volatile liquid and a non- condensable gas in cooling high
flux electronics applications. Preliminary studies at Cray computer Corporation
suggest that such a system could attain a 5- to 10-fold enhancement of
volumetric heat removal rate. The task will include (1) construction of a high
heat flux narrow channel to simulate high-density electronics packaging; (2)
determination of heat transfer coefficients and pressure drops for a mixed flow
of nitrogen and perfluorinated liquid (FC-72) through the channel; (3)
development of a first order mathematical model suitable for extrapolating the
experimental results to other configurations of interest.
