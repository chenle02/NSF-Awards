9405877 Barron PI will determine the ability of climate models to simulate
terrestrial floral biomes through Earth history and assess the role of
vegetation in paleoclimate predictions, and its contribution to long-term
climate change. Overall objectives are: to clarify the nature of discrepancies
between climate models and observations, to enable data-model comparisons, to
make climate models more useful in geologic applications, to guide use and
interpretation of climate model simulations for past and future simulations, and
to provide insights into differing roles of climate and evolution.
