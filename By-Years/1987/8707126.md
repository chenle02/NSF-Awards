We propose to use a supercomputer facility in order to carry out the following
research projects: 1. Preconditioners and decomposition of large systems of
equations. 2. Improvements of the ADI algorithm in relation to 3- dimensional
turbulant flows. 3. Optimal pursuit problem for satellites in general orbits. 4.
Lie symmetries of differential equations. Requested CPU time: 25 hours.
Duration: 24 months. Centers requested: Cornell or Princeton.
