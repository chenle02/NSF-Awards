Social psychologists argue that individuals create social structures through
interaction with others, and that these structures in turn serve to shape,
constrain, or enable future interaction. However, the nature of the kinds of
group structures and decision-making that emerge depend on the sources of group
legitimation. For example, group legitimacy may come externally from the larger
organization, or it may come internally from its own beliefs systems. This
project examines how different sources of legitimation make groups more or less
hierarchical in their decision-making, and more or less flexible in their
routine interactions. To address these questions, it uses experimental methods
involving subjects brought together to interact in a group project. The
independent variable is authorization by the researcher (i.e., external
legitimation) or endorsement by the group (i.e., internal legitimation). The
dependent variables are the group's adherence to routines over two different
types of tasks it is asked to complete, and the patterns of observable power and
prestige that emerge in the groups' interactions. Along with evaluating theories
of legitimation, the results provide valuable information for organizations
concerned with implementing team or group decision-making structures.
