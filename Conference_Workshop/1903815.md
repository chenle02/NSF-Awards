The Hawai'i Number Theory Conference (HINT 2019) will be held March 18-21, 2019
at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa in Honolulu, HI. HINT will bring together
number theorists at all levels, both from within the US and internationally, for
a four-day conference that includes six plenary talks by a diverse group of
established mathematicians and four breakout sessions with more narrowly focused
talks with ten to twenty speakers each. Immediately preceding the AMS Joint
Western and Central Sectional meeting that will also take place at the
University of Hawai'i at Manoa, HINT will provide opportunities for a diverse
collection of number theorists to discuss recent developments, to interact, and
to form new collaborations. HINT will also be a great opportunity for local
number theorists at all levels to participate in a world class conference.

HINT 2019 will feature six plenary talks spanning a large expanse of number
theory. The special sessions are titled Algebraic number theory and Diophantine
equations, Arithmetic dynamics and geometry, Arithmetic statistics and its
environs, and Modular forms, respectively. They will consist of a mix of shorter
and longer talks and be directed at a more specialized audience. The broader
plenary talks and the mix of topics for the more focused special sessions will
allow for cross-pollination between disparate areas. The conference website is
