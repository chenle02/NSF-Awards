This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Southwest Texas State University
aquire a 300 MHz NMR spectrometer and workstation. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including the following: (1) calixarene, boron and
vanadium chemistry (2) novel polymers containing the
3,3-bis(trifluormethyl)-1,3-dihydro-2,1-benzoxasilole ring (3) polymers
resistant of atomic oxygen ablation (4) siderophore chemistry (5) new sampling
and analysis methods for isocyanates, and (6) bacterial polysaccharide tertiary
structure. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful
tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies are useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
