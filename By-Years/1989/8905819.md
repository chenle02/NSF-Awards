The Fallen Leaf Lake Conferences initiated in 1985 is a yearly event devoted to
the molecular biology and genetics of plant pathogenic bacteria, fastidious
prokaryotes and related areas dealing with these microorganisms. Only the latest
unpublished information is exchanged at this conference and ample opportunity
for scientific interactions is provided during the course of the conference. The
conference is attended by members representing most of the major laboratories
from many different countries (e.g., Europe, Asia, Australia, India), including
the Soviet Union, and therefore provides excellent opportunity for graduate and
postdoctoral students to interact with internationally recognized experts in a
specific field. Support of the on-going Fallen Leaf Lake Conferences is
requested for assistance in providing housing, meal, and transportation costs
for graduate and postdoctoral students, keynote speaker and for session chairs.
Previous support by NSF has been judiciously used for the above.
