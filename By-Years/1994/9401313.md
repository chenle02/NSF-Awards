Gouvea This award funds the investigations of Prof. Fernando Gouvea under the
Research in Undergraduate Institutions Program. Prof. Gouvea will study the
arithmetic of modular forms and the arithmetic of diagonal hypersurfaces over
finite fields. The central topic in the first part of the work is the study of
two operators introduced by Atkin. In the second part the investigator will
study the simplest cases of arithmetic on abelian varieties. This research falls
under the general heading of Number Theory. Number Theory is the study of the
properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of mathematics. From
the beginning problems in number theory have furnished the driving force to
creation of new mathematics in almost all parts of the discipline. One of the
philosophies of modern number theory is that many facts about numbers can be
studied using calculus and geometry. This approach is very evident in the work
of this project since modular forms are studied using calculus and abelian
varieties are studied using geometry. This kind of number theory is very
technical and deep, but it has had astonishing applications in areas like
theoretical computer science and coding theory. ***
