9412501 Hahn Partial support is provided for a workshop on the current issues
and opportunities in mechanics and materials of sliding and rolling contact.
Active researchers from the tribo-materials field and from the contact mechanics
field will bridge the gap between the two approaches to the same general topic,
will define the most promising future areas of research and development, and
will explore joint research topics. ***
