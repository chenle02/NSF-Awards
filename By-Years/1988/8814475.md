This award will support collaborative research between Dr. James Davis of the
U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, California and Dr. T. David Waite of the
Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization, Menai, New South Wales,
Australia. The researchers will use laboratory and field approaches to
investigate the principal processes governing the transport of solutes that
undergo significant chemical reactions in the groundwater environment. Primary
objectives of the research include a better understanding of 1) the rates of
sorption processes and their inclusion in coupled transport models, and 2) the
importance of complexation and oxidation-reduction reactions in the transport of
solutes. Both Drs. Davis and Waite are qualified aquatic chemists. This research
has the potential of making significant contributions in the area of assessing
risks which arise from industrial, nuclear and municipal pollution of
groundwater aquifers.
