ER: Biogeochemical response mechanisms controlling nitrogen export from
defoliated forests in the Eastern U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The excessive
leakage of dissolved nitrogen (N) from forests defoliated by insects has water
quality ramifications for small acid-sensitive streams as well as for downstream
receiving waters such as Chesapeake Bay. Controlled laboratory experiments have
shed some light on these mechanisms, but they are of limited applicability to
actual forest ecosystems. Few field studies have been conducted, primarily due
to the relative unpredictability of defoliation outbreaks. The goal of this
Small Grant for Exploratory Research project is to take advantage of the
recently-forecasted reoccurrence of extensive gypsy moth defoliation in western
Maryland. The investigators will conduct a detailed, process-based study of the
biogeochemical mechanisms controlling N leakage from disturbed forests in this
area by comparing rates of key biogeochemical processes controlling N leakage in
forested plots subjected to gypsy moth defoliation with rates in plots not
defoliated. In addition, the investigators intend to compare concentrations of
dissolved N species in streams draining defoliated and reference watersheds and
use remote sensing imagery to detect, map, and estimate the regional-scale
extent and intensity of gypsy moth defoliation during the 2001 growing season.
