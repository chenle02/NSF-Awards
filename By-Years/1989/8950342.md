Utilizing its thirty-plus professional chapters and eighty-plus university
student chapters, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers will expand its
nine year old Advancing Careers in Engineering (ACE) program. This program was
developed to stimulate interest among Hispanic pre-college students in
engineering careers and to provide continuing guidance on the educational
preparation needed for engineering study. The Hispanic students in the
university chapters, with support from local members of the professional
chapters, will plan and conduct a variety of promotional and informational
activities for students from schools and communities with predominantly Hispanic
populations. These activities will include classroom presentations and other
activities in elementary and secondary schools, field trips to museums and
technical industries, informational events for pre-college students and their
families, individual student mentoring and counseling, and science and
engineering displays for community events. Success will be measured by following
project-impacted students to find how many ultimately enroll and succeed in
university engineering studies. Cost sharing by the partners will total 40% of
the National Science Foundation funding.
