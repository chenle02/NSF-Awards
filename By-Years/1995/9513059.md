9513059 Iwasa This award supports a three-year cooperative research project
between Professor Yuki-Kazu Iwasa, Department of Mechanical Engineering,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Professor Osami Tsukamoto, Faculty of
Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan. The project involves
other U.S. investigators from the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Los Alamos
National Laboratory, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Iowa State
University. The specific issues to be covered in this phase of the collaborative
effort are: (1) AC losses in high-temperature superconductors (HTS),
particularly the impact of conductor design, (2) conductor processing techniques
for "long" HTS, and (3) stability and protection of power transmission cables.
The United States and Japan are the leaders and rivals in superconducting magnet
technology and are the nations most intensely engaged in high-Tc superconductor
research and development. At present, since the R&D effort in Japan on high-Tc
superconductivity, both in university and industry, is substantially greater
than it is in the United States, it is likely that this exchange program will
greatly benefit U.S. researchers. ***
