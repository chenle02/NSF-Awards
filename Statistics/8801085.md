Research is proposed in three related areas. The principal investigator has a
long record of distinguished research in the area of abstract gambling theory.
In this project he will investigate certain fundamental problems of both
discrete and continuous gambling theory such as countably additive theory and
measurability. Specific gambling problem to be considered is of minimizing the
expected time to goal in a Bayesian framework. The second project will explore
the relationship of coherent inference to the theory of admissible inference in
Bayesian statistics and will develop a family of tractable priors with required
properties. The last project deals with optimal stopping and its relation with
abstract gambling theory.
