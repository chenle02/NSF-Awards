An REU site is established to address the problem of inspiring undergraduate
chemical engineering students to pursue careers in research. Junior-level
chemical engineering students from various schools throughout the U.S. and its
possessions will be invited to the site to work in relevant areas of research
within chemical engineering. The focus of the program is on new areas within
chemical engineering and on novel applications in traditional areas. The program
will give each participant a formal introduction to research and a well defined
project with faculty supervision, but the participants will also be encouraged
to be creative and independent as they develop. The students will be paid
stipends of $ 2,000 for the ten week program in addition to being housed and fed
on campus. A travel allowance for each student is also included in the budget.
Although the program is not limited to minorities and women, an effort will be
made to include a significant fraction from these groups. The combination of
extensive facilities and a commitment to undergraduate research provides
important characteristics. The faculty is committed to this program. Research
projects include lipid-water phase behavior and bacterial growth, polymer
properties and productive, solubility vapors in polymers, instrument
interfacing, supercritical fluid technology, and computer simulation of
physisorption phenomena.
