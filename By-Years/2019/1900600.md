This award supports participation in the conference "Southeastern Analysis
Meeting (SEAM 35)" held March 15-17, 2019 at the University of Alabama in
Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The conference focuses on recent developments in analysis,
especially in the fields of harmonic analysis, complex analysis, and operator
theory. One topic discussed will be the relation between operator theoretic
inequalities and isoperimetric type inequalities. Other speakers will discuss
rational functions on the bidisc, a topic with connections to function theory,
control engineering, and electrical engineering. Another subject will be inner
functions and zero sets for spaces of analytic functions. A further topic is
Leibniz type rules and bilinear estimates and their applications in analysis and
partial differential equations. In all, there will be six plenary talks; other
participants have the opportunity to present twenty-minute contributed
talks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several distinguished mathematicians have agreed to
attend and speak at this conference. This award gives early career researchers,
members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of
grant support an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference and to
interact with other researchers. The organizing committee will make this funding
opportunity known through a number of different activities. More information is
available at the conference web page:

reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
