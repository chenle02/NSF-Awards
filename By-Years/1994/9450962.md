9450962 Murnane We propose to develop a new laboratory course within the Physics
Department at Washington State University, titled "Applications of Optics." This
course, which will complement two other upper-division laboratory courses, will
give students a broad background in experimental optics. Its goal will be to
acquaint students with the real-world consequences of fundamental optical
phenomena, and to expose the students to applications of optics in physics,
chemistry, and engineering. The laboratory will be based on a femtosecond laser
facility, which will enable us to translate recent results from our research lab
at WSU into the undergraduate curriculum, where it will be used to better
illustrate concepts of coherence, dispersion, nonlinear optics and fundamentals
of quantum mechanics. For these applications we will develop a completely novel
set of experiments with femtosecond lasers for undergraduate laboratories.
