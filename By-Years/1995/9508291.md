9508291 Bergantz The objectives of the proposed research are to extend recently
developed, sophisticated numerical models for the generation and transport of
melts formed by dehydration melting and to apply the results, in an iterative
fashion, to the well-studied Ivrea-Verbano Zone of Italy. Linking numerical
modeling efforts to a well-studied field area is an essential and key element in
understanding dehydration melting. Partial melts produced during dehydration are
becoming widely appreciated as geologically realistic agents of chemical
transfer. The mobility of such melts is important in the devleopment of
granulite terranes and in the distribution of mantle "metasomatic" fluids.
