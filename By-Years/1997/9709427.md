9709427 Maksimovic/Phillips One of the unexplained puzzles in financial
economics is the periodic increases and decreases or "waves" in asset
reallocations that have occurred over time. This project models and tests the
factors that influence partial-firm asset sales across and within industries in
a industry equilibrium framework. The project begins with a model of how assets
are reallocated under perfect financial markets. It shows how the amount of
asset sales and the types of firms engaged in asset sales and purchases vary
over time both within and across industries. It identifies how the amount of
asset sales and the types of firms engaged in asset sales and purchases vary
over time both within and across industries. The project identifies factors
based on efficiency and industry characteristics that are important to asset
reallocations and then asks if a firm's financial structure and financial
structures of industry firms influence asset reallocations. The project
investigates two potential ways a firm's financial structure might influence the
process by which assets are reallocated to firms: agency costs and cash flow
shortages. It uses plant- and firm-level data from the Bureau of Census.
