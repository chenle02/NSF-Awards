This grant from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports research
of J. Baldeschwieler and W.Kaiser of California Institute of Technology and the
Jet Propulsion Laboratories respectively. The award funds research aimed toward
the realization of examining the atomic motions inside individual molecules on
surfaces. It is proposed to demonstrate the applicability of the scanning
tunneling microscope (STM) to the detection of localized inelastic electron
tunneling. Simple systems which entail the essential physics for inelastic
electron tunneling spectroscopy of adsorbates will be studied. They are
carefully chosen to be stable, easily prepared, and amenable to isotopic
substitution to facilitate unambiguous assignment of spectral features to
inelastic tunneling via excitation of adsorbate vibrational modes. A liquid-
helium immersed scanning tunneling microscope designed specifically for the
proposed work will be constructed; it will be a modification of the STM design
used at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology
for superconductor phonon spectroscopy, the most sensitive low-temperature
spectroscopy measurement published to date. Initial efforts will be directed
toward detecting Si-H and Si-D vibrational stretching modes on hydrogenated and
deuterated degenerate silicon surfaces. Similar measurements are planned for
hydrogen (or deuterium) rich small molecules chemisorbed to gold and silicon
surfaces. These simple systems can be used to optimize experimental and
instrumental parameters for inelastic tunneling spectroscopy with the STM. The
project will establish lower limits for the detectability of inelastic electron
tunneling and may demonstrate the applicability of the STM to the detection of
inelastic electron tunneling due to excitation of adsorbate vibrational modes.
The proposed investigation constitutes a step toward the realization of
spatially resolved vibrational spectroscopy of individual adsorbed molecules
together with three dimensional imaging of their binding environments. This is a
potential application of the STM which would be of profound scientific and
technological importance.
