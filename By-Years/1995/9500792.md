DMS-9500792 Maier The proposed research will apply the tools of singular
perturbation theory to the estimation, in various asymptotic limits, of the
probability of unlikely events associated with drift-diffusion and other
stochastic models. It is often the case that the leading asymptotics of such
probabilities are rigorously specified by large deviations theory. Singular
perturbation theory, in particular Maslov-WKB theory, permits the formal
computation of subdominant asymptotics. Specific stochastic models to be studied
include models arising in teletraffic engineering and chemical physics.
Physical, chemical, or engineering systems often have a random element. As a
consequence, it may be difficult to predict their long-time behavior, or the
rate at which unlikely events (large departures from equilibrium, severe
equipment malfunction, etc.) are likely to occur. It is important to be able to
estimate the frequency of such events. The proposed research will develop and
apply mathematical tools to this end.
