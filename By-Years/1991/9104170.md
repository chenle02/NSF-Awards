This project will examine the capacity of muscle to do work, and will
characterize the physiological factors that determine the capacity for work
output. Particular attention will be given to quantifying the work required to
stretch active muscles, since during normal activities muscles both shorten and
are stretched, and some part of the mechanical work output of muscles in vivo is
done in extending antagonistic muscles after their period of shortening.//
