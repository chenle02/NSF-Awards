Small-scale ionospheric structures, particularly E-region irregularities, are
modeled using linear and non-linear numerical techniques. Thermal feedback from
ions and electrons is studied using standard dispersion relations in a plasma
characterized by ambient temperature and density gradients. Inelastic
collisional electron cooling modeling is compared with more complex cooling
functions. A three-dimensional numerical simulator is used to study to electron
heating events in turbulence, and to model small-scale E-region turbulence in
general.
