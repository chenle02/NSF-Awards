The International Council for Science (ICSU) includes four unions, which focus
on the geosciences. These are the International Unions: of Geodesy and
Geophysics (IUGG); for the Geological Sciences (IUGS); for Quaternary Research
(INQUA); and for Soil Science (IUSS). These unions play an important role in
fostering wide international exchange and dissemination of information,
knowledge, and ideas. They promote strong international cooperation in the
various fields of geosciences covered by these unions and provide, through the
participation of U.S. scientists, an important vehicle for broad dissemination
of research results. They also provide a forum in which U.S. geoscientists can
exercise effective international leadership in areas of the geosciences that are
especially important from the perspective of U.S. science. U.S. participation in
and support for these unions is provided through U.S. National Committees
(USNC's) for each union. These USNC's are comprised of distinguished
geoscientists who are well aware of the state of the science, both nationally
and internationally. The UNSC's plan and implement U.S. participation in the
unions and keep the U.S. geosciences community informed of union activities.
