An Auger electron spectrometer (AES) is added to an existing secondary-ion mass
spectrometer/temperature programmed-desorption (SIMS/TPD) ultrahigh vacuum
system. This augmented system will be used for studies of low-pressure chemical
vapor deposition of tungsten, surface chemistry of planar model cobalt-
molybdenum catalysts on alumina, and characterization of intermetallic
compounds.
