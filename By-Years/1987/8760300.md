This project deals with the development of a process to produce TiB2 whiskers
using the experience gained in the production of SiC whiskers. The TiB2 whiskers
are expected to find applications as reinforcements in aluminum, titanium,
silicon carbide and silicon nitride matrices. These composites are expected to
be used in engines.
