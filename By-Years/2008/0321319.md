0321319 Eckert This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of Alaska
Southeast Juneau Campus provides funds for acquisition of field instrumentation
for research in coastal oceanography and marine ecology. Instruments supported
here include (1) a portable, battery-powered conductivity-temperature-depth
(CTD) instrument with a water sampling carousel and bottles, plus ancillary PAR
(photosynthetic available radiation), fluorometer, dissolved oxygen and
transmissometer sensors and (2) a multiple opening-closing net system for
sampling individual layers of the water column The instruments will be used in a
variety of projects, mostly in Glacier Bay, Alaska, to study planktonic
communities and their relationships to physical, chemical and biological
properties in the coastal and estuarine waters of southeastern Alaska. They will
enable research projects involving young faculty and students at this
predominantly-undergraduate campus, and they will be used to attract students,
especially members of underrepresented groups, into marine science careers via
field courses and the campus' Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
program. The instrumentation award is supported by the Division of Ocean
Sciences at NSF. ***
