This workshop convenes many of the nation's experts on atmospheric measurements
of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) to define the current state of
the science in this area. The emphasis will be on the Southeastern U.S., which
previous field studies and modeling suggest is a "hotspot" for BVOC emissions to
the atmosphere. BVOCs are a globally significant emission to the atmosphere;
they have a major impact on ozone production, with secondary effects on
ecosystems and human health. New techniques and infrastructure will also be
discussed. A major goal of the workshop is to bring together established senior
researchers and early career scientists with new and different perspectives to
provide opportunities for professional interactions in a focused and productive
forum. The discussion outcomes will be reported in a peer-reviewed journal
publication.
