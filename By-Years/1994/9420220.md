It is known that infant rodents and humans are visually less sensitive than
adults of the same species, but the mechanisms for the change in sensitivity are
not known. This Small Grant for Exploratory Research project has a
multidisciplinary approach with a biophysicist and an ophthalmologist
collaborating on this problem. A new technique is developed for measuring the
photopigment, rhodopsin, inside the photoreceptor cells of the eye. A novel kind
of microspectrophotometer is being used to measure the absorption of light from
within an area even smaller than the photoreceptor cell itself. This microscale
measurement allows estimates of the concentration of rhodopsin that is packed on
the cellular membranes, and compare the values for infant and adult eyes. This
approach also allows measuring the lateral diffusion rate of rhodopsin within
the membranes, which is important because it determines the rate of response of
the cell, and so contributes to the sensitivity of the eye. This work will have
impact on visual neuroscience and infant development, and the technology may
well prove useful for other kinds of subcellular measurement techniques in
biology.
