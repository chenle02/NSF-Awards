The end objective of the research is to correlate the structural condition of
portland cement concrete facilities with the test results using electromagnetic
waves, eddy current, and ultrasonic techniques. Electromagnetic and ultrasonic
methods have previously shown promise for achieving this objective. Eddy
currents are used as complementary technique. However, before the end objective
can be addressed, it is important to clearly establish a scientific/engineering
data base from which the electromagnetic, electrical, and ultrasonic properties
of portland cement structures can be obtained. This database will provide
insight and understanding of other problems arising from the interaction of
these electrical/acoustic methods with concrete structures and will be made
available to other researchers considering similar NDE methods. This data base
represents the first attempt to set up and carry out, under controlled
conditions, a comprehensive set of measurements to characterize a select set of
concrete specimens using a basic electrical and ultrasonic techniques that have
only been estimated in previous research.
