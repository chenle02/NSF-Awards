Professors Marcus and Rosen will continue their research on permanental
processes. These are positive real valued processes that include processes that
are the squares of Gaussian processes. However, whereas Gaussian processes are
defined by a positive definite symmetric covariance function, in the definition
of permanental processes, the restrictions to symmetry and positive definiteness
are not required. Permanental process are the missing link that can be used to
extend the Dynkin Isomorphism Theorem to an isomorphism theorem that contains
the local times of Markov processes that do not have symmetric potential
densities. They also plan to extend the study of permanental processes to
permanental fields and to develop new isomorphism theorems that relate them to
continuous additive functionals and intersection local times of general Markov
processes. They expect to be able to use them to obtain sample path properties
of continuous additive functionals and intersection local times.

Important phenomena in our lives, like weather, financial markets, voting
patterns and detection of enemy activity are so complex that they can only be
modeled as random events called stochastic processes. Nevertheless, although
these events are random, they all have certain structures, usually different,
that enables us to make good predictions about how they behave, so that we can
exploit them or defend ourselves against them. Many probabilists study
stochastic processes. Our specialization is local times which is a measure of
what are the outcomes of these processes and which outcomes are more or less
likely. Our motivation is twofold. One is esthetic, because the underlying
mathematics is very beautiful. The other is practical, to provide tools for
engineers and scientists engaged in protecting us from devastating weather,
controlling destructive market fluctuations, analyzing voter patterns,
protecting us from enemy missles...the list of potential applications is
endless. Devices and techniques employing the most advanced mathematics
contribute to the best of the new growth industries and will aid in keeping our
country competitive
