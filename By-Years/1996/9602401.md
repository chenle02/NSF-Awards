Tennessee Exemplary Faculty for Telecommunications Technology To prepare faculty
to create a work-based learning environment that supports the telecommunications
industry, a consortium of six community colleges in Tennessee, together with
industrial, four-year college and secondary school partners, implement a
professional development project. The project creates a network and a process
that encourages faculty from different disciplines to develop and disseminate a
communications technology curriculum framework. The faculty obtain an
understanding of curriculum development techniques and practices. The teams, at
each college, consist of seven to ten members including faculty from different
departments and representatives from industry, four year universities and
secondary schools. The teams encourage the faculty to consider cross
disciplinary needs of the curriculum and provide direct access to industrial and
four year college input. In addition, the faculty members are provided
industrial internships. The outcomes include a system with strong linkages among
secondary schools, colleges, industry, and government within the communications
technology discipline that educates students in the future needs of the
industries served.
