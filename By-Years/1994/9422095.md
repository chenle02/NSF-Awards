9422095 Dutt This award is to purchase equipment for investigating methodologies
for the concurrent design of embedded electronic systems involving both hardware
and software, where teams of designers concurrently refine the initial product
specifications into working prototypes. The research will adapt, evaluate and
extend novel methodologies used in the traditionally distinct domains of
hardware and software, and will attempt to quantify metrics for design cycle
reduction, provide concurrent design process feedback and tune the design
methodologies based on the domain of the application. Another important goal of
the research is to investigate new paradigms for technology transfer between
universities and industry with the objective of increasing the long-term impact
of the technology transferred. Specifically, the research will 1) evaluate the
proposed methodologies on realistic design examples provided by the industry, 2)
increase university-industry interaction through on-site industrial visitors
working closely with university researchers to test the proposed methodologies,
and 3) facilitate better communication between university researchers and
industrial partners through the use of multimedia platforms. ***
