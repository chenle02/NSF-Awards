9310480 Park We propose to conduct an interdisciplinary research program that
will address modeling and computational issues that intervene in the development
of optimization methods for massively actuated structures(MAS) designs. These
issues include: efficient analysis of control-structure interaction on massively
parallel machines by coupled-field partitioning and subdomain decomposition;
concurrent calculation of performance indices and their sensitivity derivatives
for use by the optimizer; and, novel search methods for maximizing performance
indices with respect to actuator location and control gains. The techniques will
be applied to two specific problems: arresting aeroelastic oscillations of a
transonic- hypersonic wing whose shape may be controlled through embedded
piezoelectric devices, and performance optimization of a turbine blade with
embedded with low and high-authority actuators over a range of propulsion
regimes.
