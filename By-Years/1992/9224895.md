This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is made by the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program to support the development of a new
method for determining the symmetry and geometry of gas phase transition metal
carbonyl anions. Dr. Steven W. Buckner of the Chemistry Department, University
of Arizona, will construct a CO laser that will cover wavelengths in the range
1600 to 2000 inverse centimeters. This will enable detailed examination of the
C-O stretching bands of various complexes. The experiment will be a new
application of wavelength dependent infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD)
spectroscopy. In addition to providing a new structural probe of these species,
should the early phases of this work be successful, light-driven bimolecular
reactions of some organometallic ions would be investigated. Detailed mechanisms
of complex gas phase photochemical reactions could thus be determined. %%% Full
understanding of gas phase organometallic chemistry requires investigation of
both structural changes and energetics during the course of reactions. Here a
novel experimental approach to obtaining such important information is proposed.
Because difficulties with sensitivity of the method and rearrangement of the
reactants could limit its utility, the research is supported by a small
exploratory award. If successful, however, the method would be helpful in
understanding photochemical and catalytic processes.
