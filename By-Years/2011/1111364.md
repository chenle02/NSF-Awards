The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. Francesco Paesani of the University
of California at San Diego. Prof. Paesani and his students will develop and
employ new theoretical simulations to model important chemical processes taking
place on atmospheric aerosols. The proposed research project aims to gain
molecular level understanding of the uptake of water and nitrogen on atmospheric
aerosols. These two heterogeneous processes are central for understanding the
impacts that aerosol chemistry has on climate and the environment. To realize
this goal Prof. Paesani and his students will develop a methodology for
molecular-level computer simulations of complex systems which combines a proper
treatment of molecular motions at a quantum-mechanical level with a precise ab
initio-based description of the underlying multidimensional potential energy
surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project is of great importance to
atmospheric sciences. Theoretical methodologies developed during the course of
the study will be incorporated into the widely used AMBER software for molecular
dynamics simulations through an ongoing active involvement of Prof. Paesani in
the AMBER development team. The AMBER software package is currently used by over
500 research groups worldwide and the new methodology developed within this
research project will greatly extend the range of applications of molecular
simulations in the realm of physical chemistry applied to environmental
problems. The study will provide excellent training opportunities to
undergraduate and graduate students in an area of research of great societal
importance.
