Abstract ATM-9632559 Rosen, Richard D. Atmospheric and Environment Research,
Inc. Title: Cycling of Momentum Through the Coupled Climate System This grant is
for three year period to study the exchanges of angular momentum that
dynamically coupled the atmosphere, the ocean and the solid earth, on seasonal
and longer time scales. The reanalysis products from different sources will
comprise the main observational data base in additional to satellite
measurements. Recourse will also be made to momentum balance and to gauge the
stat of art of the GCMs regarding momentum balance. This work is of a
fundamental nature in understanding the general circulation of the coupled earth
system.
