This Leadership Activities project will develop teams of science educators in 20
school districts in central Connecticut which will provide instructional
leadership and inservice activities for teachers in the districts' elementary
and middle schools. The inservice activities will focus on physical science and
address those areas in the science curriculum which are being taught minimally
or not at all. The teams in each district will consist of three elementary or
middle school teachers, a high school physical science teacher and a science
coordinator or curriculum specialist. The members of the team will prepare for
their work in the district in several meetings during the spring of the year
followed by a three-week workshop in the summer. College science and science
education staff, industrial scientists, and a computer specialist will work with
the teams as they prepare curriculum modifications and evolve plans for the
inservice activities to be held during the academic year. Both formal and
informal follow-up sessions will be held in the schools during the academic year
with the college staff continuing to serve as a support for the district teams.
A summer internship program in area scientific businesses for selected secondary
science teachers on the teams is an auxiliary part of the program. Science
Resource Centers will be established in the school districts to assist all
teachers in the implementation of the new curriculum units. The school districts
involved have participated in the planning of the proposal and have made a
commitment to sustain the program once NSF funding ceases.
