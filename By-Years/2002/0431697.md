The project is a regional initiative involving University of California, Los
Angeles (UCLA), California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA) and
Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) Community Colleges. It is
building upon existing programs and establishing new interventions that create
partnerships among educational institutions, research centers, and student
diversity retention programs to increase the number of engineering and physical
science degrees. The project focuses on underrepresented minorities (URM) among
freshmen, community college transfers and upper-level established students. It
will impact 960 students per year and will double the number of engineering and
physical science BS degrees awarded to URM at both CSULA and UCLA from 190 to
380 within the five-year timeline. The driving vision is to connect these
normally disconnected students through supplemental educational programs and
services that actively involve current and potential students in supportive
learning communities, department retention programs, and research centers. The
project's main objectives are to increase: (1) the number of pathways available
to underrepresented community college students in pursuit of engineering and
physical science baccalaureate degrees, (2) the number of URM community college
students who successfully transfer into UCLA and CSULA engineering and physical
science programs, (3) the retention to graduation of URM engineering and
physical science students at both UCLA and CSULA and its feeder community
college partners, and (4) the number of URM engineering and physical science
graduates at both UCLA and CSULA. It includes four initiatives: a community
college recruitment and development program, a transfer bridge and core
retention program, a freshmen bridge and retention program, and campus-wide
learning communities.
