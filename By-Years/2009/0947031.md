With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation program (CRIF:MU), Professors Tadeusz
Malinski, Jennifer V. Hines, Jeffrey J. Rack, Eric Stinaff and Paul G. Van
Patten of Ohio University will acquire a femtosecond transient absorption and
luminescence spectrometer system. It will be employed to investigate colloidal
nanoparticles, RNA structures, photochromic ruthenium and osmium polypyridyl
complexes, solid-state nanostructures and organic supramolecular structures.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Femtosecond spectrometers use ultrafast laser technology
to study molecular phenomena on very short time scales. Arguably, some of the
most fundamental processes in chemistry, biology and materials science (e.g.,
bond breaking and formation, electron transfer, molecular dynamics and others)
occur on ultrafast time scales. This acquisition will exploit the versatility of
the instrument in the growing field of ultrafast spectroscopy. All aspects of
the work will be performed by graduate students, select undergraduates, and
postdocs as part of their academic experience. This will provide a rich training
experience in the growing field of ultrafast methodology with state of the art
instrumentation.
