Elmhurst College is implementing a "Keys to Success Through Year One" (KEYSTONE)
program that is focusing on increasing the number of STEM graduates in biology,
chemistry, computer science, exercise science, mathematics, physics, and
cognitive psychology by 36% by reducing attrition of first-year students. The
project is addressing three principal reasons students switch out of STEM
majors: course work is too demanding, non-STEM disciplines appear more
interesting, and job prospects are perceived to be better elsewhere. Five year-
long programs for first-year students are being implemented to combat attrition.
A student's engagement with KEYSTONE begins with a personalized invitation to
join the project. During the mandatory new student orientations, STEM students
are attending a new session on the special academic experiences designed for
them. During the academic year, STEM students are participating in (i) a STEM-
focused First-Year Seminar class, (ii) project and experiment-based courses in
the January term, (iii) a STEM-specific, one-semester-hour STEMinar in the
spring term to reinforce the developing STEM learning communities, and to
introduce students, in a discussion-based format, to relevant professionals and
career options, (iv) a one-semester-hour spring term class to prepare students
for summer research, and (v) a summer research experience for a subset of the
rising sophomores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The KEYSTONE interventions are anchored
in the research literature and represent current effective practices. They, in
combination with synergistic activities on campus, are contributing to a
transformation of the undergraduate research culture of Elmhurst College. The
project is being evaluated for both formative and summative purposes with data
being collected to guide the project and to determine the efficacy of the
specific interventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The KEYSTONE project is broadening
participation in STEM careers by actively combating attrition, by utilizing
known interventions that are particularly effective for students at-risk or from
underrepresented groups. Several of the interventions are being designed and
implemented to ensure long-term sustainability. The project is increasing the
number of students graduating with STEM degrees through strategic advising,
monitoring, and engagement of first-year students. The project's success is
articulating a model program that could be adopted or adapted by many other
institutions.
