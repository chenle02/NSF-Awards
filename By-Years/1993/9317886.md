9317886 Sanders Partial funding ($391,780) is requested for the acquisition of a
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with an 11.7 Tesla magnet
(1H resonance frequency of 500 MHz) for use by multiple investigators. The
balance of the cost of this instrument ($362,500) will be provided by matching
funds from Case Western Reserve University and from the State of Ohio Regents'
ACTION fund. This machine will be housed in the School of Medicine at Case
Western Reserve University (CWRU) and will be used by a group of five
investigators with research interests as follows: Charles Sanders, Dept. of
Physiology and Biophysics (35% proposed instrument usage): Determination of the
structures of membrane proteins using oriented sample NMR. Michael Zagorski,
Dept. of Chemistry (25%): Structural studies of the amyloid proteins. Thomas
Gerken, Dept. of Pediatrics (20%): Structural studies of O-linked glycopeptides.
Masao Ikeda-Saito, Dept. of Physiology and Biophysics (10%): Studies of the heme
sites of myeloperoxidase and myoglobin. Neocles Leontis, Bowling Green State
University (10%): Structured of novel RNA and DNA motifs. The proposed
instrumentation will dramatically facilitate both the short and long term health
of these projects by providing access to a number of spectroscopic capabilities
not currently available at CWRU.
