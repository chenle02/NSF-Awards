9605062 Davis Pepperdine University will enhance an active program of
undergraduate research in biology by teaching students the common elements of
the research process and increasing their appreciation for the diversity of
biological subdisciplines. Each summer, the program will begin with a research-
orientation workshop during which students will be introduced to the uses and
limitations of specific research tools and techniques and immersed in the
research process (literature review, hypothesis formulation, and hypothesis
testing). Students then will pursue individual research projects under the
direction of faculty in either plant physiological ecology, conservation biology
of amphibians, ecophysiology of marine intertidal animals, or molecular biology
of hemoglobin genes. All research projects will be designed to give students
insight into how scientists formulate research questions, design experiments,
collect and analyze data, and communicate their results to the scientific
community. Students will play a pivotal role in the selection and design of
their research projects and will participate in a retreat to formally present,
evaluate, and refine their summer research proposals. Over the course of the
summer, visiting scientists will hold special research seminars in each research
area and spend time with students, giving students an opportunity to discuss
their own data with other scientists. Each research group will hold weekly
literature seminars to discuss current journal articles pertaining to their
research interests. The program will conclude each summer with a student
research seminar in early August. Follow-through will include student
participation in local and regional research conferences. In cases of special
merit, students will be encouraged to present their research at national
meetings and to prepare their results for publication in a scientific journal.
