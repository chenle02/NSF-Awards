This project supports work on finite and infinite groups and their geometrical
and combinatorial aspects. The principal investigator will also examine lattices
in Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, knots, games and related topics. This
research is concerned with problems in combinatorics and group theory. In
particular, the principal investigator will concentrate on a particularly
remarkable group which is called the Monster. The outcome of this investigation
is likely to impact other areas of mathematics and physics.
