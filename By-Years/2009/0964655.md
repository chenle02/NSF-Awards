Many advanced combinatorial problems have algebraic aspects. Even though the
problem formulation can be entirely discrete, significant insight and efficient
algorithms might be obtained by applying sophisticated algebraic methods. It is
not uncommon that combinatorial problems have simple and elegant formulations,
yet they are computationally hard, meaning that the obvious algorithms are
useless for their solutions except for very small instances. It can also happen
that even though traditional algorithmic approaches are successful, algebraic
methods are still more efficient and provide additional insights into a
combinatorial problem.

The graph isomorphism problem exemplifies a combinatorial problem where
algebraic methods seem to be required for efficient solutions. Interesting for
algebraic and combinatorial approaches is also the monomer dimer problem, the
counting of matchings in grid graphs, which is of much importance in statistical
physics. This proposal studies algorithms based on the scaling method. A
particular goal is doing matrix scaling efficiently in parallel, as a tool for
approximating the permanent.

This project will look at the computation of all coefficients of graph
polynomials for trees and graphs of bounded tree-width. The goal is to compute
all coefficients together almost as fast as a single coefficient.

The other main focus of this project is the exploration of variations of the
recent faster integer multiplication algorithm and the study of its application
to polynomial multiplications and Fourier transforms. One goal is to develop a
new algorithm, based on a more discrete method, improving the asymptotic
complexity as well as leading to a more practical algorithm for computing
products of very long integers.

Integer multiplication is such a fundamental arithmetic task that understanding
and improving it is an obvious basic intellectual challenge. Such theoretical
goals are foremost in this project. But there could be an impact on the search
for Mersenne primes as well as on general purpose computations with high degree
polynomials. Other aspects of this research involve topics with applications in
Physics and Chemistry.
