This research aims to further our understanding of the interplay between
randomness and computation in complexity theory. The investigation concentrates
on aspects of interactive proof systems, probabilistically checkable proofs, the
approximability of problems in combinatorial optimization, and related areas.
One goal is to examine several ways in which construction of probabilistically
checkable proofs may be improved and in so doing strengthen the derived lower
bounds on approximability. In addition, a study is planned of useful structures
that may be suggested by these constructions, such as error-correcting codes
with novel properties. Other goals are to investigate reducibility among
probabilistic constructions and to consider the possibility that there are
objects that are universal for such constructions.
