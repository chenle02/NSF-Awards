This action provides partial support towards the purchase of a workstation. The
workstation with artificial intelligence and graphics capabilities will be used
to investigate ways of implementing existing and new formulations of multibody
dynamics in a multiprocessor environment. The vendors have given the University
a special NSF-discount and the Institution is cost sharing 50% with the
Foundation on the purchasing price of the workstation.
