In a major earthquake, damage to and in buildings can seriously disrupt the
economy while causing losses to their contents, personal injury and death, and
damage to surrounding areas. Liability is one of several mechanisms society
relies upon to stimulate response to hazards such as earthquakes. This project
will build on earlier research conducted by this organization on the liability
of local governments and the private sector for earthquake hazards and losses.
Since the research on local government liability was performed in 1978, much has
occurred that may have clarified or modified conclusions on the probability of
liability being imposed. The first objective of this project is to update the
findings of that legal research using an analysis of statutory law, regulations
and case precedents. A second objective is to determine the impact of increases
of risk management programs and self-insurance on awareness of liability and
earthquake hazard mitigation programs. A final objective is to disseminate the
findings to increase understanding of liability.
