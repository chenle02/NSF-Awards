The overall objective is to hold a high level tutorial ("school") that will
bring together for a 10 day period the leading international experts in the
field of visual developmental neurobiology with young faculty, postdoctorals,
and graduate students who are interested in acquiring knowledge and expertise in
this field. The purpose of the school is two-fold. To provide a relatively
informal forum by which the students can interact with established researchers,
and to provide an opportunity for exchange of information among the
representatives of the leading laboratories.
