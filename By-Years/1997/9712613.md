PI: Scott Creel #9712613 This small grant for exploratory research (SGER)
concerns the development and application of microsatellite DNA methods for
genetic typing of African wild dogs from field samples. The PI's ongoing
research has allowed a rare opportunity to develop a new set of techniques that
may have far-reaching applicability. Previous efforts in this study to obtain
blood and tissue samples have caused injury to the animals, which cannot be
tolerated in an endangered species. Alternative means of analysis of DNA
extracted from wasted material of carnivores has been especially difficult, as
the quality if the DNA material is degraded. However, new techniques recently
developed in this study have shown promise in providing reliable and efficient
means of genetic analysis from samples collected in the field. The project is a
novel, completely non-invasive approach to collection of DNA from field
populations. This advanced could enable the development and application of new
techniques for many animal species, which would be especially valuable in field
research and conservation of endangered species.
