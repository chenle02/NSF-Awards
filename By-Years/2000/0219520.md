The growing popularity of mobile devices with wireless
capabilities&lt;br/&gt;imposes new and fundamental challenges in extending the
capabilities&lt;br/&gt;of wired Internet applications to the wireless domain.
This project will&lt;br/&gt;investigate proxy-based techniques for enabling the
next generation of&lt;br/&gt;mobile multimedia and web applications. The
proposed research will focus on&lt;br/&gt;three characteristics of mobile
environments, namely client mobility,&lt;br/&gt;intermittent connectivity, and
resource-poor nature of mobile devices. &lt;br/&gt;Research issues that will be
addressed in this project include&lt;br/&gt;(i) power-friendly streaming
techniques and real-time handoffs for&lt;br/&gt;mobile multimedia applications,
and (ii) caching and dissemination of&lt;br/&gt;time-varying and location-
dependent data accessed by mobile web&lt;br/&gt;applications. The proposed
techniques will be evaluated using an&lt;br/&gt;eclectic mix of simulation,
analysis and prototype implementation. The&lt;br/&gt;significance of the
proposed research arises from the widespread and&lt;br/&gt;growing use of mobile
devices that provide ubiquitous, wireless access&lt;br/&gt;to data on the
Internet. The likely impact of this research will be&lt;br/&gt;to advance the
state of the art in proxy-based infrastructures for&lt;br/&gt;next-generation
mobile multimedia and web applications.&lt;br/&gt;
