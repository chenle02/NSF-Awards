The Franklin Institute Science Museum will, over a three year period, develop a
regional Girl Scout leader training programthat provides science education
experiences for Girl Scouts. The Girl Scout Council of Greater Philadelphia and
the Washington Rock, NJ Council will be primary partners and the source of
volunteer leaders and the target audience of member girls. Science Education
kits will be developed and tested for Brownies and Juniors, training materials
for staff trainers and volunteer leaders developed, leaders trained, and several
post.training support mechanisms developed. Program materials are designed for
continued use by the Girl Scouts; more than 2,000 leaders will be trained and
20,000 girls will participate in project activities during the three year
period. This project is directed at the substantial under representation of
women in many science and engineering fields by working with girls in informal
settings to overcome patterns of science and mathematics avoidance. Replication
and dissemination will be undertaken both within the Girl Scout Council system
and among museums, youth organizations, and other informal educators. The
proposers are contributing nearly $250,000 in resources to the project; NSF
support will be 55% of the project total.
