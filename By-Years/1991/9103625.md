This project will study boundary value problems for wave equations, spectral
properties of Schrodinger operators, pseudodifferential operators in connection
with nonlinear partial differential equations, and index theories. The
techniques to be used incorporate noncommutative harmonic analysis, spectral
theory, and K-homology. The questions to be analysed have been motivated both by
mathematical and physical problems. Results from this project will in turn help
our understanding of areas such as wave propagation and quantum mechanics.
