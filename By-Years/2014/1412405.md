The addition of one or more specific markers to proteins by enzymes known as
protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) allows cells to adapt to their ever-
changing environments. Biological pathways responsible for development, the
response to hormones and viruses, cancer and cardiovascular disease are all
impacted by exactly how PRMTs carry out their additions to protein targets. The
studies will characterize how the individual members of the PRMT family dictate
very specific product formation, for example, one versus two additions, in order
to direct the result that is required in the cell. The proposed strategy will
integrate both computational modeling and "at-the-bench" biochemical experiments
to reveal just how product formation takes place for two members of the PRMT
family. The results of these studies will provide foundational information that
is required for novel inhibitor development, as well as allow for an
understanding of the sophisticated role PRMTs play in cellular signaling. The
studies will provide cross training for students in both computational and wet
biochemistry experimental strategies, as well as provide the opportunity for
undergraduates to receive on-the-job training in the lab, preparing them for the
STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Chemistry of Life
Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Joan Hevel and Dr.
Orlando Acevedo to characterize the mechanism of protein arginine
monomethylation versus dimethylation using advanced computational and
biophysical techniques. The role of sterics, dynamics, and mode of substrate
binding in determining which of two different methylation products the protein
arginine methyltransferases form will be determined. Information from this study
will provide new insight into the sophisticated control of product formation
that is required to maintain appropriate patterns of signaling in cells.
