9616250 DOUGHERTY PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV. This award is to provide phase-out
funding for the Industry University Cooperative Research Center at the
Pennsylvania State University for Dielectric Studies, and to fund the NSF
Evaluator for the center. The center has been funded for twelve years, and is
now phasing down NSF support preparing to be self sufficient with industry
support. The core research for the center includes synthesis and processing of
dielectric materials, capacitor dielectrics and reliability, microwave
dielectrics, packaging dielectrics, multilayer dielectrics, thin film
dielectrics, high temperature dielectrics, and relaxor dielectrics. The center
has twelve industrial partners and others are anticipating joining. The goal of
the center is to perform research that is highly relevant to the electronic
ceramics industry. ***
