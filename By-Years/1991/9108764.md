The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) in the state
of Kentucky will enhance the research competitiveness of approximately 64
faculty within 19 departments at three universities (University of Kentucky,
University of Louisville, and Western Kentucky University). Research areas
include: (1) Developing a Center for Evolutionary Ecology; (2) Biofunctional
Membranes; (3) Structural Biology of Cellular Regulators; (4) Applications of
Massively Parallel Computers; (5) Radiation, Turbulence, and Chemical Kinetics
Interactions in Flames; (6) Inverse Problems and Quantitative Non-destructive
Evaluation; (7) The Relationship Between Structure and Activity in Chemical
Catalysis; Synthesis, Structure, and Function; (8) Local Approach to Study the
Properties of Complex Systems with Low Symmetry; and (9) Preparation and
Properties of Low- Dimensional Conductors and their Intercalates. The research
clusters will serve over one hundred graduate, undergraduate, and post doctoral
students. In addition, EPSCoR outreach activities are linked with the existing
educational enrichment programs in the state in which cluster members are
actively involved (e.g., the Southeastern Consortium for Minorities in
Engineering at the University of Louisville; SuperQuest; and the Minority High
School Research Apprenticeship Program). The State of Kentucky will contribute
over $11 million in support of the EPSCoR initiative.
