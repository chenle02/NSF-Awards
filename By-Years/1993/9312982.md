9312982 Ohring The interaction between metal films and diamond substrates will
be investigated primarily by Rutherford backscattering (RBS) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) methods. The objective is to determine the nature of
the interacial that lead to bonding between these materials. This investigation
is expected to: 1. yield quantitative kinetics of carbide growth. 2. yield
values for the activation energy carbide formation. 3. identify reaction
products and sequence of reaction. 4. provide high-resolution structural details
of the metal/diamond, metal/carbide and carbide/diamond interfaces. The proposed
complementary chemical and structural studies will be conducted at both the
Electronics Technology and Devices Laboratory (ETDL) of Fort Monmouth, NJ and
Steven Institute of Technology. ***
