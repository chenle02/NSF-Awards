From August 1991 to April 1993, CIRCE (the Center for Instructional Research and
Curriculum Evaluation at the University of Illinois) executed a contract with
the National Science Foundation under the title "Teacher Preparation Archives:
Case studies of NSF-funded Middle School Mathematics and Science Teacher
Preparation Projects." The funding of the nine campuses to develop exemplary
programs for middle school teacher preparation was a singular effort on the part
of the Foundation. This unique program highlighted both middle school education
and teacher preparation in a way never done before. The circumstances of funding
as well as the development and obstacles to campus reprogramming are reported in
detail in the final report. Several interpretive chapters were also included.
That project culminated in a report entitled "Teacher Preparation Archives:
Studies of NSF-Funded Middle School Science and Mathematics Teacher Preparation
Projects" by Robert Stake, James Raths, Mark St. John, Deborah Trumbull, David
Jenness, Michele Foster, Sherry Sullivan, Terry Denny and Jack Easley. Targeted
both for a general and specialist teacher educator audience, the report runs
over 300 pages as a paperback book. An additional 1200 copies are being printed
for distribution to anyone who requests and is advertised through mathematics,
science, and middle school education organizations.
