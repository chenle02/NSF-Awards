This project is associated with the establishment of a new mechanical
engineering laboratory course. The first half of the course is an electronics
laboratory; the second half of the course involves engineering measurements and
data acquisition. The equipment for the electronics laboratory are computers
with appropriate boards allowing the computers to perform as oscilloscopes and
spectrum analyzers. Solderless bread boards are used by the students for the
experiments involving electronics. For the measurements portion of the
laboratory, traversing mechanisms, data acquisition boards, proximity probes,
etc. are required.
