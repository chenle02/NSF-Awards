A major data synthesis effort will bring to a close an eight-year study of the
effects of a major volcanic eruption on the structure and function of several
ecosystems on Mt. St. Helens in the state of Washington. Ecological studies have
been conducted on the rates and patterns of recovery of three ecosystem types on
Mt. St. Helens; coniferous forests, and sub- alpine and alpine meadows. During
the past eight years the ecological research has been focussed in four areas:
soil processes and development, plant physiology, plant population dynamics, and
insect population dynamics. Data derived from these studies will be used to
develop a set of sub-models that will be linked together in a "master" model of
landscape dynamics in these "recovering" ecosystems. The models will be
structured such that they can be applied at a variety scales in space and time.
In addition, the models will be linked to a geographic information system (GIS)
so that they will be geographically specific. The development of geographically-
referenced process models will be an important advance in ecological research
because it will permit field-based validation of these models. Beyond
contribution to advances in ecological modeling, this research will help us to
understand how biological systems respond to and recover from major catastrophic
disturbances such as volcanic eruptions. Such understanding should help us to
devise management strategies for reconstructing natural ecosystems following
various kinds of destructive events associated with human activities. Dr. Bliss
and his colleagues have good records of productivity. The institutional support
available to them is superior.
