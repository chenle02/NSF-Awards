Research is concerned with algorithmic and practical aspects of large- scale
multi-period stochastic programs, motivated by problems in production,
manufacturing, scheduling, finance and energy policies. Approximation and bounds
on the nonlinear functions will be thoroughly investigated. The aim is to
provide insights regarding solution and analysis of multi-period stochastic
programming problems.
