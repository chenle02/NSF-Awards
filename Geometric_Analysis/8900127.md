Professor Cantwell will investigate the structure of codimension one
foliations. The existence of foliations of knot complements, leafwise hyperbolic
structures, smoothability of foliations, and ergodic properties will be studied.
This work expands the Principal Investigator's theory of levels which has made a
profound impact on development of foliation theory and has led to interaction
with the French and Japanese schools of foliations. The mathematical theory of
foliations concerns the filling of space by stacks of surfaces or "leaves".
Cantwell helped to prove that any surface may be a leaf of a foliation. Since
some surfaces wrap upon themselves, this proof was very difficult. Now Cantwell
will further his theory by understanding foliations which fill all of a space
except for a knot. The understanding of knots has recently become very important
to the understanding of thermodynamics and molecular biology.
