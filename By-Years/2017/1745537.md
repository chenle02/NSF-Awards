This project provides funding to partially support travel expenses for U.S.
students to allow them to participate in an international conference in power
engineering, the 2017 edition of the International Conference on Intelligent
Systems Applications to Power Systems (ISAP2017). The conference will take place
in San Antonio, Texas during September 17-21, 2017. The conference is
technically cosponsored by the Power Engineering Society of the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). ISAP conference papers will be
available to subscribers of the IEEE-Explore data base on a permanent basis. The
support provided by this award will provide an opportunity for students to share
their research with one another and with faculty and industry experts. Measures
will be taken to encourage participation in the conference of women and
underrepresented minorities.
