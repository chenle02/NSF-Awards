Professor Gregory D. Gillispie and other members of the Chemistry Department of
North Dakota State University are being supported to continue a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1991-93,
ten undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
a variety of research projects. Projects will be in the areas of organosilicon
chemistry, NMR spectroscopy, laser spectroscopy, theoretical calculations on
main group species, gas phase chemical dynamics, photooscillating systems,
supercritical fluid applications to solvation phenomena, gas phase ion
chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and electrochemistry with
microelectrodes. Students will participate in weekly research group meetings and
present the results of their work at a final symposium and at regional poster
sessions. Students will be from four-year colleges in the upper midwest.
