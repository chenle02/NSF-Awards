This project provides Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) a direct
connection to the Midwest Regional Education Network (MREN) in Chicago, IL where
Internet2 and other research networks peer. The project includes purchases of
routing equipment and PerfSONAR servers to measure the connection speeds to
remote locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new connection offers a 10x speed
increase to Internet2 from current connections that are shared with commodity
Internet traffic, providing researchers, faculty, and students faster access to
remote resources and collaborators. This benefits the ongoing research and
teaching activities, which include: understanding ultra intense laser-cluster
interactions in the X-ray regime, determining the effects of nanoparticle doping
on liquid crystal systems, using the NSF funded BlueWaters facility for
structure-function studies (using the hepatitis C virus as a model system) and
also drug testing for alzhimer's disease, as well as the NIH (NIGMS) funded
ANTON system to understand the detailed behavior of a nanobiomolecular switch.
Informational sessions, faculty awareness, and use surveys will be performed to
document increased use of off-campus computing resources and data transfer
capabilities by additional faculty for research and teaching activities.
