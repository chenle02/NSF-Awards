This grant will support a study of a variety of related naturally-occurring
processes involving the interaction of high- energy electrons with
electromagnetic waves and with plasma waves in the solar-terrestrial
environment. These processes are important for our understanding of solar-flare-
related radiation emitted from the sun's lower corona and from the solar wind,
and for our understanding of the propagation, stability and emission properties
of electron streams, including streams of solar origin, high-energy electrons in
the ambient solar wind, electron beams produced near planetary bowshocks, and
precipitating electrons in Earth's auroral zones. It is intended investigate a
variety of wave instabilities driven by electron velocity anisotropy ("whistler-
beam-modes", whistlers, "Weibel" modes, etc.), and by parallel energy inversion
(electron plasma waves, etc.). The nonlinear evolution of waves and electron
distributions in magnetized plasmas, such as the aurora and the lower solar
corona, will be treated using state-of-the-art supercomputer simulations. It is
expected to produce the first three-dimensional studies of fully-developed
strong plasma wave turbulence excited by electron streams in the solar wind
during Type III events, and by electron beams near Earth's bowshock. The
proposed research emphasizes basic plasma processes which are strongly rooted in
satellite observations of waves and particles.
