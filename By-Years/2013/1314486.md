This EArly Grant for Exploratory Reserach (EAGER) award provides funding for
exploration preparation of novel giant magnetoresistance (GMR) magnetic carbon
nanocomposites by combining the stability of carbon and strong magnetization of
metal nanoparticles, potentially providing promising alternatives to the
traditional metal GMR materials. This project will involve the surface
functionalization of commercial magnetic nanoparticles and will evaluate the
feasibility of the large scale production of carbon nanocomposites. The
stabilization, carbonization and graphitization conditions needed to treat these
polymer nanocomposites will be determined to allow the large scale manufacturing
of GMR magnetic carbon nanocomposites. The feasibility of using graphitic carbon
to protect magnetic nanoparticles against oxidation will be tested and process-
structure-property relationships will be established.

If successful, the research will provide novel magnetic carbon nanocomposites
for magnetic field sensing, and also will unveil the nature of the electron
magneto-transport in these novel GMR materials. This will advance the knowledge
required to manufacture next-generation GMR materials and provide transformative
sensing nanotechnology. As compared to the easy oxidation of conductive metals,
magnetic carbon nanocomposites may potentially be applied in telecoms,
electronics, sensors, anode catalysts and the aerospace industry, due to their
easy manufacturing, better mechanical properties, high stability in acids, and
isotropic properties. They also have potential for device miniaturization and
light weight. The success of this EAGER project will provide initial evaluations
on these GMR magnetic carbon nanocomposites for magnetic field sensing in harsh
environments and make their deployment more attractive to both industrial
researchers and academic scientists.
