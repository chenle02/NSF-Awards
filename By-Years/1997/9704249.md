9704249 Grebogi This U.S.-Brazil award will support a research collaboration
between groups from the U.S. and Brazil to work on chaos theory applied to
communication. The U.S. group consists of Drs. Celso Grebogi, Edward Ott and
James A. Yorke of the University of Maryland; the Brazilian team consists of
Professors Ricardo L. Viana and Epaminondas Rosa, Jr., of the Federal University
of Parana, Brazil. These two groups propose to use fundamental properties of
nonlinear dynamical systems to effectively reduce in-band noise, added to a
message-bearing signal generated by a chaotic oscillator. The idea for this
filtering procedure is based on a contractiveness property inherent in chaotic
systems. The researchers also want to study methods to pace in a precise manner
communication pulses resulting from a chaotic signal generator. This allows
transmission of a signal containing a message, and then synchronization is used
to recover the signal. The noise component is reduced as the chaotic signal
propagates forward and backwards along stable and unstable directions
respectively. ***
