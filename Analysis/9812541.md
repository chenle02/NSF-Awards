Abstract Meir DMS-9812541

This proposal requests support for the Southeastern-Atlantic Regional
Conference on Differential Equations. This conference has a history dating back
to 1981, and has an established record of providing new investigators and
advanced graduate students a forum in which to exchange new ideas and discuss
recent developments. In particular, the conference invites young investigators
to present there work to an expert audience. The primary objective of this
proposal is to secure support for advanced graduate students and recent PhDs to
participate in this meeting.
