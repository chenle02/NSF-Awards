The mathematics department at Mount Holyoke College will operate a mathematics
summer research site for undergraduates each summer from 2004-2008.
Participation in the REU program introduces students to what life is like at a
mathematical research institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will select ten
students drawn from a broad range of U.S. colleges and universities to engage in
mathematical research. The students will work in groups of five or six, each
group carrying out a different project under the supervision of a faculty
member. The projects will be directed at mainstream areas of mathematical
research and often involve extensive computer experimentation and computation.
An important message of our program is the the power of examples to illuminate,
and possibly overcome, current impasses&lt;br/&gt;in purely theoretical
attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The groups will meet separately several times a
day but ample opportunity will be provided for students in different groups to
exchange ideas. Students plan, organize, and speak in their own seminar series,
attend and speak in the program's weekly seminars, and attend and speak at local
and national meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this small group setting,
students learn deep concepts in a very concrete way and this intense exposure
helps them in graduate school in two ways. First, students are better prepared
in their first years of graduate school simply because they have already
mastered these concepts. Second, and more importantly, the
REU&lt;br/&gt;experience teaches students how to take a new concept and flesh it
out, using examples and questions until they gain the essential intuition for
it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, each student in our program writes up a
preprint of his or her work and these preprints are available on our web site.
Publications and honors theses often result from the summer's work.&lt;br/&gt;
