The forces required to separate chromosomes at mitotic anaphase are at the focus
of this proposal. One phase of the work will determine whether or not astral
forces are pulling on the spindle poles in a Basidiomycete, a diatom and
mammalian (PtK) cells. These forces, will be made manifest by severing the
central spindle at anaphase using a laser microbeam. In the other phase of the
work, infrared laser-induced optical force traps will be used to make relative-
quantitative measurements of forces operating during anaphase A and B in an
Ascomycete. Relative contributions of asters and spindles to the total spindle
elongation force will be estimated. The work will go right to the heart of the
question about location of forces acting on chromosomes during their movement at
mitosis. Furthermore, the development of optical force traps as an analytical
tool for studying intracellular motility will be of interest to the entire cell
biology community.
