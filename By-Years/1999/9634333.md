9634333 Wulf, William Knight, John University of Virginia CISE Educational
Innovation: Research Integration and Dissemination for Undergraduate Computer
Science Curriculum. This CISE Educational Innovation award supports the
integration of research into the undergraduate curriculum through the
development of three new upper division courses along with establishment of a
visiting faculty program and other working relationships with institutions to
enhance dissemination of the results of the project. The new courses are in the
areas of computer aided design, usability engineering, and translation systems.
Dissemination will be accomplished through use of the World-Wide Web, through
special relationships with a selected set of diverse schools, and a visiting
faculty program in which individual faculty from other institutions will be in
residence at the University of Virginia campus so as to become directly involved
in the project and to then transport the material back to their home
institutions. Development and dissemination of the new courses has the potential
to impact curricula widely.
