*** 96-60155 Fang This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research Project will
grow large area single crystal diamond films. In this approach, diamond will
grow by a chemical vapor deposition process on a liquid substrate. This is to
replace the conventional growth on solid substrate approach. The utilities of
the liquid substrate are its ideal smoothness, and its amorphosity (and
therefore an absence of grain boundaries). Liquid substrate provides a high
mobility for carbon to facilitate an aggregation on two levels: (i) carbon atoms
migrate on the liquid surface to form diamond crystallites, and, (ii) the
floating diamond crystallites coalesce to form a large single crystal. Thus, the
present approach represents a basic alteration from the conventional solid
substrate and an opportunity to grow large area single crystal diamond is
provided. Successfully grown large area single crystal diamond films will be
essential to a realization of diamond electronic devices and integral circuits.
