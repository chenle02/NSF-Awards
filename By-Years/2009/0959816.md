This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support the development
of a detection system for the recoil mass separator (RMS), St George, which is
being constructed at the University of Notre Dame. The RMS St George will be
used to separate products of (alpha, gamma) reactions in inverse kinematics from
unreacted beam particles. St George is designed to suppress beam particles by a
factor of 10^12. Even with that suppression, comparable numbers of reaction
products and unreacted beam particles will be delivered to the end of the RMS St
George. The proposed detection system will use measurements of both energy and
time-of-flight to distinguish between the various reaction products and beam
particles. A broad program in nuclear astrophysics will be addressed with the
proposed system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of the proposed detector
system and its use will contribute to research training at many levels during
the project duration and even more so through the experimental work by post-
docs, graduate students, and undergraduates.
