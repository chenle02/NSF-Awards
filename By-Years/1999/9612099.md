The objective of this work is the point design study of the Illinois Aggressive
Cache-Only Memory Architecture (I-ACOMA) multiprocessor, a novel distributed
shared-memory, multiprocessor (DSM) that delivers petaflop-scale performance
without surrendering programmability. I-ACOMA is designed to address some of the
most important challenges that architects will face in the next two decades,
namely the widening gap between the speed of multi-Ghz processors and the much
slower cache hierarchy, memory and network subsystems, the increasing under-
utilization of the large number of transistors that can be embedded on a
processor chip, and the disappointingly poor machine utilization in many key
applications like sparse computations and database workloads. To address these
issues, I-ACOMA includes a very aggressive memory hierarchy, multithreaded
superscalar processors, and architectural support for sparse computations and
databases. On the software side, the code running on I-ACOMA is generated by a
compiler that automatically parallelizes Fortran 90 programs. The compiler
exposes both loop- and instruction-level parallelism. In addition, it generates
data forward directives. Finally, on the application side, while I-ACOMA is a
general-purpose machine, it will focus on two sets of grand challenge
applications, namely sparse computations and database applications.
