The theme of this project is to study topological and geometric objects in low-
dimensions. One of the primary ways the project will accomplish this is by using
tools from symplectic geometry, gauge theory, and quantum algebra. Many of these
tools come packaged as algebraic invariants e.g. Floer homology theories or
combinatorial knot invariants. A byproduct of the project will be a deepened
understanding of the invariants themselves, clarifying the relationships between
them and the internal structure of their underlying theories. Specific goals
include understanding the knotted curves in the three-dimensional sphere on
which a surgery procedure produces simple manifolds, a general exploration of
the knots which arise from algebraic curves in projective surfaces, and
understanding the extent of, and method by which, combinatorial invariants
detect geometric objects e.g. whether Khovanov homology detects the unknot.

The study of three- and four-dimensional spaces, and knotted curves and
surfaces within them, is a central task to our understanding of both large and
small scale aspects of the universe. Determining the shape of the universe
depends upon a mathematical understanding of the possible shapes that could
occur and the properties these shapes have. These properties are known as
invariants, and the project furthers our understanding of space by the discovery
of new invariants and the study of existing invariants. In this pursuit it has
been quite fruitful to examine the way in which curves and surfaces can be tied
in knots. This kind of knotting is not only relevant to understanding the shape
of space, but has recently become significant in the study of DNA. Confined to a
small space, long strands of DNA naturally become knotted, and certain processes
depend upon an understanding of the complexity of these knots. Applications of
this project include effective ways of measuring different types of complexity
of knots.
