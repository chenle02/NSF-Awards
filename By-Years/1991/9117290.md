Since 1980, at intervals of 2-3 years in the Spring, a large international
conference on Differential Equations and Mathematical Physics has been held at
The University of Alabama in Birmingham. This conference has been very
successful in bringing together scholars from around the world for fruitful
scientific exchange in an active area in which modern mathematical analysis
comes to grips with problems of scientific importance. The next scheduled
conference in this series will take place at The Georgia Institute of
Technology, 22-28 March 1992.
