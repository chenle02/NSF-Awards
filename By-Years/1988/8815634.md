The purpose of this research is to develop satisfactory techniques to control
culturing of marrow tissue to produce specific hematopoietic cell types in large
amounts. The discovery of cell growth factors and ability to produce them as
purified recombinant molecule, along with the potential use of molecular biology
for the modification of hematopoietic cells, had opened a new era for the design
and manipulation of these cell types. Current technology for culturing stem
cells is slow, intensive and limited to the amount of progeny that can be
obtained from only a few cubic centimeters of cell culture per week. Modern
mammalian cell culture techniques of extended surfaces will be applied to
stimulate stromal growth and stem cell production. The techniques developed
should be applicable to many other cell types that will be important in
conditions related to immune systems.
