ABSTRACT DMS - 0203023. PI: Lei Ni

The principle investigator proposes to study the interplay between the geometry
and the analysis on complete Kaehler manifolds. The focus will be linear and
nonlinear analysis on such manifolds. The main tool is solving the linear
equation, such as the Poisson equation and Poincare-Lelong equation, and the
nonlinear equations such as the Kaehle-Ricci flow. The goal is to understand the
space of holomorphic functions (plurisubharmonic functions), the interplay
between the geometry and the function theory and applying the results to the
uniformization of complete Kaehler manifolds with nonnegative curvature.

The manifold is the space where every physical event happens. The global
analysis on manifolds studies the overall properties of the manifolds by piecing
together the local information. Kaehler manifolds are the basic block in the
universe model according to the string theory. The proposed study has close
connection with the theory of general relativity and string theory. The
nonlinear differential equations studied in the proposal have applications in
the study of the structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundary, and
even the large scale networks.
