Part I - At the same time communities all over the US are struggling to deal
with climate change, resilience, and environmental justice, the nation faces a
shortage of geoscientists who can work on these issues. This shortage is
especially acute for marginalized and underserved communities. Gaps in the
pathways to careers in geoscience begin as early as middle school?the last time
many students encounter Earth science content in the classroom. To address these
challenges, this project will create opportunities for students in three diverse
communities (Atlanta, GA; San Bernardino, CA; and Oklahoma) to develop their
scientific skills and knowledge while working on authentic, local problems as
they progress from middle school to college and beyond, into the workforce.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part II - The project design is informed by research
findings that students are more engaged and invested in learning science when it
is connected to issues of concern to their local community and that use of
authentic, mentored, real world research experiences increase retention and
persistence. Bringing together partners who have led relevant, successful
national efforts with partners in the three regions the project team will design
and begin implementation of inclusive pathways that lead from an early interest
in Earth to careers that require geoscience skills and knowledge. Each pathway
will include multiple opportunities for students to 1) learn geoscience in the
context of compelling local issues, 2) use geoscience to address local
challenges, and 3) explore geoscience career pathways. Experience gained by
initial program partners and regional pilots will be used to create national
support structures for developing integrated geoscience pathways and a
collective action framework for expanded partnerships.
