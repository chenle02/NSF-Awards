This project continues support to maintain and improve standby readiness to
mount rapid and follow?up responses to a mid?ocean eruptive events along the
mid?ocean ridge systems of the northeast Pacific. The project is composed of
several cross?disciplinary components, including the geophysical interpretation
of remotely detected seismic events, physical, geochemical and geomircobial
oceanography, microbial diversity and community dynamics of event plumes, and
geology, geochemistry and biological colonization of new seafloor lava
flows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
