This project will follow two lines of investigation into problems of applied
mathematics. The first is that of understanding certain mathematical models for
phase transition phenomena. The problems have a variational structure and
involve the study of distinguished solutions for elliptic or parabolic equations
with small diffusion coefficients. The second category of work will concentrate
on evolution systems that are not necessarily of variational type and which
preserve order. One main objective is to determine asymptotic properties of all
solutions. A common theme which ties the research together is that the problems
deal with reaction-diffusion mechanisms and that the analysis employs stability
considerations. From the applications point of view, the first project seeks to
model certain observable patterns either as stable equilibria or as unstable
manifolds of equilibria; the second seeks to exclude the possibility of stable
chaos for classes of forced systems and to establish very regular behavior
criteria.
