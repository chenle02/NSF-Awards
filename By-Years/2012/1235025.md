The research objective of this award is to characterize at the single molecule
level the interactions between erythrocyte adhesion receptors and their
corresponding ligands, and to measure the effect of agonist activation signaling
on the strength and the frequency of adhesion events. The findings will be
correlated with ex vivo adhesion of intact erythrocytes to adhesive ligands
under conditions of flow. Traditionally, erythrocytes were considered to be
inert cells containing hemoglobin and functioning only as oxygen carriers.
Recently, it has been found that erythrocytes express an unexpected number of
adhesion receptors on their surfaces and we begin to understand that external
stimuli, such as adrenergic hormones, increase the ability of even mature
erythrocytes to adhere. Atomic force microscopy combined with microfluidics will
be used to carry out the measurements while multiscale numerical simulations
will be employed to correlate single molecule experimental results with overall
RBC adhesion experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will answer
very fundamental questions related to erythrocyte adhesion. It is expected to
identify which of the RBC receptors are related to higher strength and increased
frequency of adhesion events and how external signaling modifies RBC adhesion at
the molecular level and in physiological blood flow conditions. The results are
expected to have a very important positive impact because the identified
adhesion receptors and mechanisms are very likely to provide new pharmacological
targets and therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of
peripheral vascular diseases. The educational plan will result in the
development of a series of interdisciplinary graduate courses on Cell Mechanics
at UConn, Storrs. It will also promote engineering and science in high school
teachers and students. In particular, it will advance the participation of 9th
to 11th grade girls from a local high school in science and technology.
