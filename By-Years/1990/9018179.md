The P.I. has developed a finite difference model that describes the evolution
of stretching and rifting along passive continental margins. Funding has been
granted for the P.I. to reconcile his theoretical studies with observational
data from the margins of the U.S. east cost and Red Sea. An attempt will be made
to account for the asymmetric nature of rifting, the shifting of the locus of
maximum extension with time, and the distribution of uplift and magmatism prior
to and during rifting. This model needs no a apriori assumptions regarding the
character of shearing as either "simple" or "pure", acommon starting point that
limits other modeling techniques in their ability to duplicate the variety of
features that typify rifted margins.
