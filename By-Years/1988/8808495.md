Stimulation of the skin results in muscle activity that causes a withdrawal of
the limb away from the point of stimulation, a "protective" reflex. This
response to gentle skin stimulation is a very widely studied model system used
to investigate neuronal plasticity. This plasticity, a change in activity
resulting from experience, is believed to underlie some of the simplest forms of
learning. By using a combination of neuroanatomical and neurophysiological
techniques, Dr. Durkovic and his colleagues are constructing a detailed map of
the neurons (nerve cells) which mediate this modifiable protective reflex. Dr.
Durkovic's previous studies have shown that this reflex can be produced by
neurons located entirely within the spinal cord. In the present set of
experiments, he first deposits fluorescent dyes in the output regions
(motoneuron pools) of the spinal cord. These dyes undergo retrograde neuronal
transport--they are carried backwards into the cell bodies of neurons that send
axons toward the motoneuron pools. These neurons are then identified by using a
special fluorescence microscope, and the stained cells are then mapped within
specific spinal cord regions. Dr. Durkovic is also stimulating the motoneuron
pool itself, to excite the cells that project into these regions. He records
from the cell bodies of the activated neurons, and then localizes the recording
site(s) within the spinal cord. The electrical activity of these neurons and
muscles are monitored to see if they are related to each other. Those neurons
activated by skin stimulation, and whose activity is related to muscle activity,
are thus identified as being part of the neural circuit of the protective
reflex. This work will help to identify the characteristics of the neural
pathways involved in protective reflexes. It will also identify components of
the neural circuitry directly involved in the production of reflex modifications
analogous to classically conditioned responses.
