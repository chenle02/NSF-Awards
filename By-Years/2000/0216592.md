MRI: Acquisition of a Network of Workstations Serving as a Platform for
Distributed Automated Reasoning

This proposal from an EPCoR state, adapting current parallel and distributed
theorem proving technology to a setting in which different computation servers
become available in an unpredictable fashion, aims at building a network of
workstations that can be used as a computational server for research. A cluster
of high-performance workstations running Linux and the required networking
infrastructure will be acquired. The effort will make available a large
proportion of the computational facilities of the department for theorem proving
efforts. In this setting, the search for the proof of a single theorem will be
spread between all the idle workstations participating in the distributed proof
effort. In extending model checking to infinite state spaces, the research
involves exploring two approaches for protocol verification: Development of, 1.
On-the-fly model checker based on a 3-values logic and, 2. Theorem proving
methods that can reduce a protocol's state space to a finite size.
