We will develop course curricula and associated multimedia course software that
will introduce a diverse group of students, including students of engineering
and science, music, social sciences, and the humanities to the technology of
digital signals, communications and signal processing in the context of "Digital
Signal Technology in Music". There will be two courses developed jointly by the
Investigators, one to be offered within the Electrical Engineering Department
and the other by the Eastman School of Music of the University of Rochester. The
courses are intended to attract and retain students to the study of engineering
and to introduce other non-technical students to the important and widespread
technology of digital signals and systems. The two courses will share a common
core curriculum encompassing about 75% of the course lecture material and both
courses will rely heavily on laboratory and studio experiences for the students.
The difference between the two courses will be that the laboratory of the
engineering course will be designed for the students to manipulate and explore
the technology at a fundamental level, while the practical aspect of the music
course will be oriented toward projects utilizing the technology discussed in
the lectures. The other major activity in this project is the development of
interactive multimedia courseware that will be designed to productively be used
by students at many levels - from high school to advanced undergraduate
engineering students and it will be distributed via computer network to
interested parties.
