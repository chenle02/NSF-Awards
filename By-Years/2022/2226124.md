The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the potential
development of power options and logistics services on the moon and other low-
gravity environments. The innovation could launch capsules containing materials
(like oxygen or water etc.) to potential customers across the lunar surface. At
the same time, the kinetic energy of each capsule could also be converted to
usable electricity to power space operations. By reducing potential launch costs
while using the same infrastructure to transfer material, resources, and energy
the services may be overall less expensive. Ultimately, if the technology can
reduce the energy and resource transfer costs on the moon, this innovation may
support further construction, lunar mining, exploration, travel, and tourism
potentially enabling economic growth in space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
I-Corps project is based on developing logistics services and power options for
cables and lunar rovers on the moon and other space environments. Cabled energy
systems can be heavy making them costly to transport from the Earth to the moon
(potentially over $1 million per kilogram of load carried) whilst energy beaming
solutions to power devices and equipment on the moon such as lasers and
microwaves can be inefficient at powering devices and equipment over long
distances, can have high capital costs, and may have limited network effects.
Furthermore, hybrid solutions combining cables and power beaming may add risk by
increasing mission complexity and potential points of failure. Rover-based
systems for transferring equipment and materials can also be heavy and time-
consuming. By potentially developing an integrated, cable-less energy and
material transfer system that may be lighter, faster, and able to handle more
volume, it may therefore be more efficient than cabled systems or
Rovers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
