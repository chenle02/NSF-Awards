Abstract CTS-9632227 A. Sangani, Syracuse U. The objective is to better describe
the macroscopic behavior of two-phase flow systems by studying phenomena at the
particle, bubble, or other microstructural length scale of the disperse phase,
by using a combination of theoretical and computational methods. The effect of
particle Stokes number and phase concentration in flows where both inertial and
viscous effects are significant will be investigated. Numerical simulations will
be used to evaluate velocity fluctuations in two-phase flow and to analyze the
flow stability. The Reynolds stress, eddy viscosity, and eddy diffusivity will
be numerically simulated and eventually modeled. A computational technique, in
which the Stokes flow interactions are computed by dividing the particles into
groups of varying sizes and combining the fields induced by the particles within
each group by the method of multiple expansion, will be carried out for
suspensionq containing 1-10 thousand particles per cell. The proposed project,
if successful, will provide improved basic understanding and numerical
simulation tools for gas-solid flows, bubbly flows and composite materials
deformation, of relevance in numerous processing industries and natural
phenomena. ***
