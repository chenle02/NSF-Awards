9627030 Krakauer The North Carolina Museum of Life and Science will develop two
areas in a new 70 acre outdoor exhibit "BioQuest Woods: Linking Animals and
Plans with Interactive Exhibits". This concept is to pair live animals and
plants in their natural setting with science center-style interactive exhibits
to communicate key ideas in biology and physics. Support will go to sixteen
interactive stations in two four-acre theme areas "Catch the Wind" and "Down to
Earth". "Catch the Wind" will assist visitors in the exploration air movement
and learning about how plants and animals use air in specialized ways. For
example, visitors will experiment with air thermals while observing the behavior
of birds of prey and will learn how prairie dogs exploit the venturi effect to
ventilate their burrows. In the "Down to Earth" thematic area, visitors,
simulate the activities of field biologists, will track bears equipped with
radio collars, examine living invertebrates, among other activities. Scientific
instruments, including microscopes, in kiosks will aid on-the-scene study of
live animals and plans. "BioQuest Woods" will help visitors, teachers and
students gain the realistic experience of scientific inquiry in a natural
setting. Education programming will highlight curriculum linkages and fulfills
the goals of North Carolina's new science curriculum. It directly addresses the
State's competency-based goals requiring understanding of natural systems and
the interrelations of the basic sciences. Pre and post-visit materials will be
developed along with teacher guides and enhancement activities. This project is
being developed with the cooperation of the Austin Nature Center, the National
Zoo, and the Indianapolis Zoo.
