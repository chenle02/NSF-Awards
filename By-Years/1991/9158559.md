This is a Presidential Young Investigator award to an individual who has begun
an exciting research program on small RNA plant viruses. He has, in addition, a
record that shows great promise as a teacher and research mentor, and has taken
initiatives in establishing interactions between his institution and regional
undergraduate institutions. He thus shows great promise in developing the
interests of young people in science and in serving as a role model for
potential future scientists.//
