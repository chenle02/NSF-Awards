A state-of-the-art system for steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis
(SSITKA) is built from component parts. The system will be used to kinetically
map heterogeneous catalyst surfaces under rigorous reaction conditions of
temperature and pressure, to delineate the role of catalyst promoters and other
elements of multicomponent catalyst systems, and to computational analyze such
issues as reabsorption and diffusion.
