This proposal provides a plan for the establishment of a consortia program of
teacher enhancement and instructional improvement in science. The consortium
involves three Historically Black Colleges and Universities in three regions of
the Commonwealth of Virginia. This consortium effort will establish mechanisms
for school system science education improvement. The institutions will provide
training in science content and pedagogy focused on minority student achievement
with the intent of increasing the pipeline to science careers for minority
students. Instructional and project delivery mechanisms will include Saturday
courses, summer workshops, satellite and teleconferencing facilities, and
electronic news networks. All courses will be credited, if desired by
participants, and structured to meet criteria for Masters' Degree Programs at
Hampton University. Cost sharing is equivalent to 21% of the NSF award.
