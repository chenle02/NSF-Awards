The University of Pennsylvania continues operating a Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU Site is affiliated with the Materials
Research Science and Engineering Center at Penn. Fifteen rising seniors and
juniors are recruited nationwide every year for a ten-week summer research
experience. Undergraduate students participate in a broad variety of materials
research projects under the mentorship of over sixty faculty in nine science and
engineering departments at Penn. In addition, REU participants attend weekly
research seminars and organized social activities.
