This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II Project substantially
furthers the development of a powerful means to simultaneously measure trace
amounts of multiple species vital to environmental control, industrial process
control, and human health and safety. A fast, flexible, accurate, and low power-
consuming technique, prism Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) will measure
trace species to levels as low as parts-per-trillion. The research completed in
Phase I demonstrated that the technology requires prisms fabricated from high-
purity, super polished materials of high optical homogeneity. Phase I served
both to identify appropriate materials to construct a fully functional prism and
to prove that the prism cavity operates from the near UV down to the near IR
range, greatly enhancing the breadth of CRDS
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial market for the prism cavity
lends itself to a wide range of applications: manufacture of compound
semiconductors for telecommunications; continuous emissions monitoring for
environmental compliance and workplace safety; laser weapon development and
performance verification; detection of explosives or chemical warfare agents;
and chemical analysis of breath for medical diagnostics.
