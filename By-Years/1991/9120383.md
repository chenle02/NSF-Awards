Understanding the dynamics of continental extension requires a three-
dimensional perspective of the timing, magnitude, and rate of extension over
broad regions, however many studies have assumed plane strain and considered
processes of extension in only two dimensions. This project will examine across-
strike and along- strike variations in the amount of extension, relations
between extension and magmatism and features adjacent to accommodation zones by
study of Miocene growth-fault basins in the northern Colorado River extensional
corridor. These data are expected to be useful in development of three-
dimensional models for continental extension.
