Salamone 9511247 While changes in neurochemicals typically have effects on
behavior, they may have a very large effect or a minor effect depending upon
behavioral context. Dopamine is one such neurochemical. It is secreted in the
forebrain and is related to an animal's tendency to produce a response in order
to receive a reward. In this project, Dr. Salamone will examine the significance
of brain dopamine to behavioral performance in situations where the context of
performance (costs versus benefits) is manipulated. These studies will provide
new information to distinguish dopamine effects on neural systems controlling
motor performance as distinct from those that influence motivation. ***
