Abstract Wolf

This award is to provide partial support for twenty U.S. mathematicians (four or
five senior principal speakers and the others junior) to participate in the
Sixth Workshop on Lie Theory and Geometry to be held in C'ordoba, Argentina,
November 12-16, 2007. Lie theory and differential geometry play tightly
intertwined central roles in many active parts of mathematics and physics. Over
the last twenty years there has been a high level of mutually beneficial
collaboration in these areas between U.S. and Argentine mathematicians. A series
of workshops on Lie theory and geometry has been instrumental for those
scientific exchanges, and of equal benefit to U.S. and South American
mathematicians. The workshop program will emphasize four main areas and their
interactions: (1) representation theory of Lie groups, (2) inverse spectral
geometry, (3) geometric structures (i.e. homogeneous spaces), and (4)
applications of Lie groups to number theory.

The workshop will address recent advances in the main areas and strengthen
existing efforts as well as forge new collaborations to address major open
problems. The broader impacts of the proposed activity include advances in a
number of current U.S. Argentine research projects, expansion of the
mathematical horizons of many younger U.S. mathematicians, and strengthening of
scientific ties in the western hemisphere. There has been extensive fruitful
collaboration between the U.S. and Argentine mathematical communities, sometimes
involving European researchers, and one of our goals for this workshop is to
open up these collaborative opportunities to more young U. S. mathematicians.
Participation by women and minorities will be actively sought and encouraged.
