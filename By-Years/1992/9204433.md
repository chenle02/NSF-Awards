The research focuses on obtaining a better understanding of the behavior of
waste remediation systems that may be difficult to visualize using traditional
deterministic method. Concepts such as redundancy, weakest link, robustness and
complexity of the system are explicitly addressed. The objective is to improve
the design of those systems coast-effectively to achieve a desired level of the
system performance. The approach requires the formulation of a reliability model
relating the waste remediation system performance and the system parameters.
