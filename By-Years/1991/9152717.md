Liberal arts students and potential chemistry majors in the second semester of
general chemistry laboratory will carry out modern instrument-based analyses of
natural water samples. Results will form an annually updated data base for local
environmental monitoring. Concentrations of ammonia, oxygen, fluoride, chloride,
hydronium, nitrate, nitrite, and hypochlorite ions, and total hardness will be
determined. Students will learn concepts of sample collection and preservation,
the chemical complexity of natural samples, and standard (EPA) analytical
methods. The instruments to be used are spectrophotometers and pH/ISE meters
with ion selective electrodes. A high school chemistry class will also perform
these exercises. The grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
