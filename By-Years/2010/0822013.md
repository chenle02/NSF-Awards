This proposal seeks to evaluate existing knowledge about STEM teachers in
professional learning communities (PLCs), both prospective teachers and
classroom teachers across grades K-12. It will comprehensively synthesize peer-
reviewed research but will also examine additional types of knowledge that
influence the field. The project methods adapt those of Knowledge Management and
Dissemination project, funded by NSF MSP and seeks to further advance the scope
and rigor of knowledge synthesis. The reasons identified for this interest are:
(a) PLCs ameliorate undesirable working conditions leading to dissatisfaction
that drive teachers from the classroom; (b) PLCs are grounded in theory
developed in the literature on how people learn; and (c) PLCs are supported by
initial research on the effectiveness of modes of professional development that
involves sustained collaborative effort over time, with an emphasis on tasks
that are authentic to the participants? work. Researchers systematically find
relevant knowledge and evaluate the methodological integrity and evidentiary
utility of each research study or knowledge claim. Four kinds of knowledge on
this topic are being analyzed and synthesized: (1) empirical and descriptive
studies published in peer-reviewed journals; (2) research published in venues
other than peer-reviewed journals (including online); (3) published expert
knowledge and advice located in periodicals or on websites, and (4) current
practice-based knowledge acquired through an online Expert Practitioner Panel.
