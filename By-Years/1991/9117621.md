Research on fear of failure has indicated that women avoid experiences rather
than risk the possibility of failure or uncertainty. The present study will
examine constructive risk- taking among a group of women who are in
nontraditional occupations and who have chosen to work in the Antarctic. Models
of fear of failure also indicate that what is fearful about failure for women is
the possibility of negative social consequences. A second purpose of the present
study is to examine how women low on fear of failure cope with the social
consequences of constructive risk-taking, and also to examine the existing
social supports for women in the Antarctic. The isolation and environmental
features of the Antarctic have applications for other confined microsocieties
that some women will be experiencing in the near future. A third purpose of the
study is to investigate five factors concerning the Antarctic experience for
women that have previously only been studied with men. Structured interviews
will be conducted with women who have recently returned from the Antarctic. The
results will be used to generate quantitative measures and to formulate theories
of risk-taking and social coping among women in nontraditional roles.
