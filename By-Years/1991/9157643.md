This award funds the first year of a five-year Presidential Young Investigator
Award for research into an understanding of the information requirements of
manipulation tasks. The aim is to develop a high-level representation of tasks
that facilitates the decomposition into subtasks and the translation of high-
level specifications into low-level robot commands. Such translation is
complicated by uncertainties which may propagate through the system. A
manipulation language will be developed to support task decomposition and
abstraction, and several types of manipulation tasks will be studied, including
parts orienting, assembly by implosion, and large-scale mounting operations. The
project will study information flow among the decomposed subtasks. This research
should lead to a better understanding of the fundamentals of manipulation, a
better characterization of the relations among information, speed of assemble,
and task solvability, and a better understanding of how to design robots for
operation in a world with uncertainties.//
