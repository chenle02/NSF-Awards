This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
provides continued support to Dr. Robert R. Holmes of the Chemistry Dearptment,
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, for research on the reactivity of
phosphorus and silicon compounds. During substitution reactions, phosphorus and
silicon accommodate five or six groups around the central atom. Highly reactive
species of this type will be synthesized, characterized using NMR spectroscopy,
and modeled using ab initio methods and the capabilities of the San Diego
supercomputer Center. Cyclic pentaoxyphosphoranes and isoelectronic five-
coordinate anionic silicates will be the focus of the investigation.
Substituents with rings of varying sizes and a variety of donor atoms will be
prepared. The phosphorus work is expected to give information on the mechanism
of hydrolysis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cAMP, while the silicon work
models the initial stages of silanol polymerization. In both cases, the goal is
to explore the formation of six-coordinate intermediates as the source of the
increased reactivity observed for five-coordinate phosphorus and silicon
compounds. The reaction rates for hydrolysis and solvolysis of the higher
coordinate derivatives will be determined and compared to those of the lower
coordinate species. Nitrogen donor atoms will be used in order to mimic the
functions of amino acid residues present at the enzymatic active site and assess
their role in forming higher coordinate intermediates. This research will
determine the role of an alternate reaction pathway in two important cases. The
possibility of six-coordinate intermediates affecting both reactivity and
geometry in the physiologically important reaction of phosphoryl transfer or in
the commercially important polymerization of silanol has not been previously
explored.
