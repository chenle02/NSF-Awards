This award is for support of a project to measure subglacial water pressure,
turbidity, electrical conductivity, and flow velocity beneath a non-surge type
glacier for a continuous period lasting two full years. Measurements will be
made directly at the glacier bed in boreholes having known trajectories. The
data that is collected will be used to test and refine existing theories of
subglacial drainage, and to construct and verify a generalized model of basal
hydrology.
