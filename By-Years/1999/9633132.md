Circulation of seawater through the ocean crust has a major effect on the
chemistry of the oceans. The composition of the water that exits from hot
springs (hydrothermal vents) can tell us what processes occur in the ocean crust
to form the water. Key features of the vent water, including the pH, the
abundance of hydrogen sulfide, and temperature, can tell what types of minerals
form in the ocean crust, and whether biologic activity is occurring there.
Presently, however, pH, H2, and H2S can not be measured because we have no
sensors capable of making the measurements at the high temperatures and
pressures of the sea floor. These investigators have a prototype instrument and
plan to develop, test, and deploy it to make these important measurements.
