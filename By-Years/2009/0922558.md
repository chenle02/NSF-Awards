With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the
Departments of Chemistry and Biology at California Lutheran University will
acquire a multiplexed capillary electrophoresis system and an ultraviolet-
visible spectrophotometer for chemical, environmental and biological research
activities of the faculty and their undergraduate student researchers. A variety
of research needs will be met by the acquisition of this instrument including:
1) the high-throughput separation and quantification of metallothionein
isoforms, 2) the high-efficiency metal speciation and quantification in
agriculturally-relevant samples containing selenium, and 3) the measurement of
viral nucleic acid concentrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capillary
electrophoresis is used to separate the chemical components of a typically
complex sample mixture. This is a widely used analytical technique to identify
and quantify the chemical composition of small quantities of samples. It is
important for undergraduate students to be trained in the technique using modern
instrumentation. In addition to applications in their research projects,
students will use the instrumentation in interdisciplinary undergraduate courses
in chemistry, biology and environmental science.&lt;br/&gt;
