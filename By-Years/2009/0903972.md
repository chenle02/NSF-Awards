This project studies new forms of imaging by exploiting the quantum entanglement
of light. This is done by producing new spatial modes of light that are common
to two beams of light but not to any one individually. Since spatial modes are
the building blocks of images this research promises the development of new
types of images that are common to light photons traveling in different
directions. These images may be of higher resolution than the ones carried by
the individual photons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project
is that it advances our understanding of quantum information and imaging by
involving only undergraduate researchers working with a faculty mentor. The
students will be exposed to a vanguard technology early on in their studies at
the same time that this technology is being developed. This program has been
very successful in involving women and ethnic minorities. Other impacts include
the development of new materials and laboratories for a modern way to teach
quantum mechanics, which prepares students to the rising field of quantum
information.
