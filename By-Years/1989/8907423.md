In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Whaley will study two highly significant and difficult
problems. The study of liquid helium clusters is expected to provide important
new insights regarding the possibility of superfluidity in condensed phases. The
investigation of gas-surface interactions will lead to fundamental understanding
of catalysis. The excited states and dynamics of quantum liquid clusters of He
will be investigated with a quantum liquid drop model, combined with quantum
Monte Carlo calculations. A new technique is proposed for quantum scattering
from continua of coupled channels and will be applied to inelastic atomic and
molecular scattering from solid surfaces and scattering from disordered
surfaces.
