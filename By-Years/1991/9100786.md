In this project the principal investigator and a graduate student will work on
several interesting problems involving partial differential equations that arise
in various applications. Among other things, they will study ill-posed problems,
St. Venant and Phragmen-Lindelof problems, stability questions for nonlinear
systems and overdetermined problems. This work will be characterized by a deft
use of analytical techniques such as a' priori estimates and maximum principles
to derive sharp bounds on physically relevant quantities that are described by
ill-posed problems. Important physical phenomena are described by what are
called "ill-posed" problems, to which the tried and true methods of mathematics
often do not apply. These are problems that can have more than one solution or
no solution at all and whose solutions, if they exist, exhibit strange behavior.
Most problems in partial differential equations are "well-posed", by which
mathematicians mean that there is a unique solution that depends continuously on
the data of the problem. In this project the principal investigator and a
graduate student will apply mathematical methods to study the behavior of
solutions of ill- posed problems that come from physics and engineering.
