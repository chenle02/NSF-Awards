Innovative approaches to developing novel inorganic-organic hybrid semiconductor
nanostructured materials for solar cell applications are proposed. These hybrid
composites are made of inorganic components of semiconductors with a variety of
band gaps and suitable organic spacers. They possess numerous advantages over
conventional semiconductors, including giant band-gap tunability, enhanced
absorption capability, large carrier mobility, lightweight, excellent
processability, flexibility, and structure diversity and tailorability, all of
which are highly desirable for new-generation photovoltaic technologies. This
project will emphasize materials synthesis, structure and property
characterization and modification, and illustrate plausible device fabrication
for this unique class of hybrid materials. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This
research project aims to develop a unique class of hybrid nanostructured
materials that are composed of II-VI and/or III-V semiconductors and suitable
organic spacers. Hybrid materials that combine the superior electronic,
magnetic, optical properties and thermal stability of inorganic frameworks with
the structural diversity, flexibility, high processability, and light-weight of
organic molecules can enhance and strengthen the functionality and performance
of these materials for various applications areas including new-generation
photovoltaic technologies. The research project will provide outstanding
opportunities for postdoc, graduate and undergraduate participants to develop
the complex multidisciplinary skills needed to advance materials
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
