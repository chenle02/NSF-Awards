The goal of this project is to understand molecular diffusion in two types of
complex media - microemulsions and polymer gels. Microemulsions are solutions of
aggregated surfactants in water, and they are used in pharmaceutical drug
delivery to increase solubility, reduce toxicity, and control the rate of drug
release. Polymer gels are water-filled networks of thread-like molecules, and
they are used in gel chromatography and membrane filtration to separate
molecules. Fibrous gels shrink or swell in response to changes in the liquid
between the fibers, which strongly affects their function in ways that are not
understood. The investigators will use an optical technique to measure rates of
molecular movement in microemulsions and polymer gels. Data will be compared
with theory to improve theoretical models for these complex systems.

The diffusion of a hydrophobic solute in the presence of micelles or surfactant
aggregates will be measured. In such systems, localized interactions in the
interior of the aggregates strongly affect diffusion rates of the solute and the
surfactant. Strong solute-matrix interactions also occur in polymer gels, in
which polymer fibers hinder solute motion, and solute molecules may induce gel
swelling or shrinkage. Diffusion rates in microemulsions and shrinking and
swelling in polymer hydrogels will be measured by holographic interferometry, an
optical method for monitoring changes in concentration in transparent solutions
and gels. Taylor diffusiometry, solid phase microextraction, single-photon
counting fluorescence spectroscopy, and osmometry will also be used to measure
physical properties needed to compare data to theoretical descriptions of these
processes.
