9705479 Dorfmeister This project lies in the area of minimal surfaces and
harmonic mappings. Earlier, the investigator has developed a Weierstrass type
formula for harmonic maps from Riemann surfaces into compact symmetric spaces.
The current project is a continuation of that work. In particular, the method is
to be applied to produce constant mean curvature surfaces in 3-space. Minimal
surfaces and constant mean curvature surfaces have certain optimizing
properties; as a consequence, they have important physical applications. For
example, the interface of two homogeneous media often forms a minimal surface as
such a surface tends to be locally energy-minimizing. Constant mean curvature
surfaces arise as closed surfaces that have the least surface area amongst all
closed surfaces enclosing a fixed volume.
