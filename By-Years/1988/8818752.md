This is a Minority Research Initiation (MRI) planning grant proposal. The
proposed research will examine various robot control strategies for the purpose
of developing an effective control strategy capable of accurate error-recovery.
The proposed research was reviewed by NSF program staff and was considered to be
highly meritorious and at the "cutting edge" of the computer science field.
Funds provided by a planning grant will support a well-trained minority
investigator to develop a competitive research proposal for submission to the
MRI research initiation component. During the planning process the principal
investigator will pursue the following activities: participate in a study group
concerned with robotics, attend relevant research conferences, investigate the
feasibility of using alternate hardware and software tools, and establish
consultative relationships with research faculty.
