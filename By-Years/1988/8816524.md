Project makes a seismological investigation of the geometry of the core-mantle
boundary. Project analyzes different waveform phases using data from the
International Seismological Centre. Reflections, refractions from the core will
be used to improve resolution of the CMB surface. Physical mechanisms for the
observed structures, including dynamically supported topography and thermal and
chemical boundary layers, will be examined.
