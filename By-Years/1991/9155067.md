The Central Connecticut State University will initiate a three- week,
residential, multidisciplinary Young Scholars project which will provide science
enrichment activities for 50 students entering grades 9 and 10. This summer
program will emphasize research participation in biology, chemistry, the earth
sciences and physics. The program includes students from groups "at risk" of
underrepresentation in the sciences and uses a combination of laboratory and
field experiences and experiments, a research project, demonstrations, lectures
and discussions to encourage participants to pursue science and engineering
education vocations. It provides intensive interdisciplinary exposure to science
concepts and methods as students design and conduct their own experiments.
