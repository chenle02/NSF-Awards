*** 96-60332 Haynes This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will investigate the capture of three-dimensional data from scratches or
striations made on a bullet when the gun is fired, by which a unique signature
which can be matched with other bullets fired from the same gun. Current
practice of law enforcement agencies uses two-dimensional digitized data, where
the associated matching algorithms have a 10% false match rate. This is enough
to render the concept of a National Database for Ballistics Data unfeasible.
Every query would yield tens of thousands of matches. Phase I will evaluate the
comparison of three-dimensional striation images. Commercial application is
expected in supplying units with the advanced three-dimensional capability to
law enforcement agencies around the world. ***
