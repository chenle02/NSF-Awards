University of Maryland System Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation
Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Program is a collaborative effort between the
National Science Foundation and University of Maryland institutions to increase
the quality and quantity of underrepresented minorities matriculating to
completion of the doctoral degree in science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics fields (STEM) fields. The program at the University of Maryland-
Baltimore County prepares students to meet the challenges of completing doctoral
programs of study and for academic careers in higher education.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BD fellows will be nurtured over two years as a cohort
community that will benefit from a program of academic and personal development
activities as well as social support to sustain their commitment and success to
the terminal Ph.D. STEM degree. Program activities include linkages to the
Maryland Alliances for Graduate Education in the Professoriate (PROMISE) as well
as other NSF-funded research and education projects, including programs that
provide mentoring opportunities for undergraduate students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A total of 12 students from underrepresented minority
populations in STEM fields will participate in the program a University of
Maryland-Baltimore County during the 2009-2011 academic years. Results from this
support will broaden the participation of African-Americans, Hispanics, Native
Americans, and Pacific-Islanders in the STEM pipeline, U. S. workforce and
abroad. Results from rigorous evaluation of the project will add to the body of
literature in the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority
students in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;
