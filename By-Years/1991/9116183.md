Unlike traditional data networks, future broadband-ISDN (BISDN) wide- area
networks will be required to carry a broad range of traffic classes ranging from
bursty, variable-rate sources, such as voice and variable- rate coded video, to
smooth, constant bit rate sources. Moreover, these networks will have to do so
while providing a guaranteed performance or quality-of-service (QOS) to these
traffic classes. The problem of characterizing performance in such networks is
thus particularly important since this must be done not only for traditional
off-line tasks of dimensioning and design (e.g., determining link bandwidths,
buffer capacities and processing capacities at network switchpoints) but also
for on-line, performance-driven traffic control purposes such as session- level
admission control. In this proposal the principal investigators outline research
aimed at providing the analytical tools and techniques for analyzing such
networks and their diverse workloads and for designing and characterizing the
properties of scheduling policies in these networks. The principal investigators
propose to: 1.develop techniques to upper bound a variety of per-session
performance measures such as probability of buffer overflow and the distribution
of packet delay and to do so in a network environment in which sessions may
traverse several hops, 2.develop approximation techniques for estimating the
probability of buffer overflows in a network handling diverse classes of
(potentially bursty) traffic sources, and 3.develop a sample path based on
methodology for characterizing optimal scheduling policies.
