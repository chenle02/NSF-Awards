A robot arm is a dynamically complex system due to the dynamic coupling between
articulating components of the arm and to nonlinearity arising from changing
configuration and payload. These complexities necessarily complicate the control
which has to account for dynamics as the robot performs its assigned tasks with
the required speed and accuracy. If the nonlinearities could be eliminated, then
the dynamics and control would be substantially improved. This project addresses
that concept and determines the feasibiIity of fabricating a three link
dynamically linearized robot.
