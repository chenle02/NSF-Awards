A single investigator and undergraduates will participate in a collaborative
effort at Fermilab (Experiment 687) to study the production of particles
containing heavy quarks (c-quarks and b-quarks) by photons incident on various
targets. A new detector facility, just brought into operation, will be used. The
data obtained will be used to verify the predictions of theoretical models, to
obtain production cross sections, to measure lifetime and branching fractions of
particles containing the c-quark. The grant is awarded under the Research at
Undergraduate Institutions program and involves undergraduates in forefront
research. In particular, there will be substantial undergraduate experience with
of fast computing and mass data storage.
