Allen With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Melinda Allen and Heidi
Lennstrom will expand the archaeobotanical research laboratory located at the
Bernice P. Bishop Museum in Hawaii. They will hire a technician to help to
prepare and process samples and will purchase both a new flotation device and
photographic equipment. Because botanical materials are usually lighter than
their surrounding earthen matrix, it is possible to use water separation to
collect them. A larger device will increase the productivity of the laboratory.
Photographs permit the production of guides or keys which can facilitate
identification at the Bishop and also be used by other laboratories. Botanical
remains are often preserved in archaeological sites in Oceania. Few
archaeologists are qualified to identify such materials however and the
development of a specialized laboratory will further research in a number of
areas. Botanical remains serve two principal goals because they provide insight
into both the nature of prehistoric environments and human use of it.
Archaeological deposits often include both plants used by prehistoric
inhabitants and other remains which are accidently incorporated into the
sediments. With such information, it is possible to reconstruct how different
human populations subsisted and made use of their environments. It is also
possible to understand how people affected these environments and how they
changed over time. Many islands in the Pacific have been occupied for thousands
of years and provide excellent laboratories to study human-environment
interactions. This research is important because it will help to provide an
important archaeological service. It will increase our understanding of human
behavior and how people and environments interact over time.
