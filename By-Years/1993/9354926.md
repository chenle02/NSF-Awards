Two major challenges facing the U.S. construction industry today are (1) the
lack of women educators and practitioners in the field of construction
engineering and management and (2) the decline of productivity in the
construction industry. The proposed research program will address the first
concern by (1) proactive recruitment of women engineering students (at the
graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels) to pursue education, research,
and careers in construction; (2) mentoring of Graduate Research Trainees by
faculty members, industry professionals, and advanced graduate students; and (3)
providing training to Graduate Research Trainees on research, teaching,
technical writing and presentation skills. The second concern will be addressed
by guiding the Graduate Research Trainees to expand upon the ongoing research in
construction automation and robotics at the University. This research will
result in the development of a Computer-Aided Design/Construction (CAD/CAC)
System capable of: (1) evaluating CAD models from the perspective of
constructability; (2) selecting suitable automated construction equipment for a
project; (3) generating efficient process plans for operation of the automated
equipment; and (4) generating equipment-level control instructions. This
interdisciplinary research will facilitate the implementation of flexible
automation technologies in the U.S. construction industry and will thereby
improve its competitiveness in the global marketplace.
