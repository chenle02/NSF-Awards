This "proof-of-concept" project will develop a cognition-based assessment system
(CBAS) to help determine the cognitive underpinnings students reach in
understanding and mastering core mathematical ideas in grades K-8. The project
will identify these ideas in the areas of geometry and whole numbers. The system
is comprised of a) the identification of core mathematical concepts in K-8; b)
research-based cognitive milestones and fluencies for each core concept; and c)
assessment tasks that track different positions of student understanding as
students progress. CBAS will be designed for use by teachers in formative and
summative classroom assessment, and for use by districts, program evaluators and
researchers in evaluating the quality of student learning in various curricular
and instructional programs.
