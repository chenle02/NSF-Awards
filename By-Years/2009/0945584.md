This Small Business Technology Transfer Program Phase I project is to develop
a&lt;br/&gt;manufacturing process for precisely controlled application of layers
with precisely controlled nanostructure leading to a scalable multi-layered,
nanostructured anti-reflective coating for use on commercial photovoltaic
modules. Sol-gel chemistry will be employed as the basis for these coatings
owing to the low materials cost, friendly and scalable chemistry, ease of
solution coating, and durability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of
this project is to produce a durable multi-functional coating that will increase
power output of solar modules by 7% to 15% with an incremental cost of energy of
&lt;$0.17/W (&lt;$0.001/kW-hr) for typical thin film installations. The
fundamental knowledge gained about the chemical and mechanical mechanisms that
determine the long-term mechanical and optical stability of anti-reflective
coatings made with multi-layer nanoporous materials will be a further impact.
