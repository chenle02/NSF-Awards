While some progress has been made in understanding the relationships between
earnings dynamics and the job mobility of workers, a complete analysis has been
hampered by the lack of a framework to distinguish the relative importance of
various theories of mobility. The purpose of this research is to develop and
carry out an extensive set of tests of competing theories of mobility using
information primarily on (1) the pattern of prior mobility, (2) wage and
mobility histories following involuntary job changes, (3) mobility during the
first year on the job, and (4) the relationship between the method of job search
and mobility. Longitudinal data from a varied of sources, starting with the NLS
youth cohort, will be used to implement the model. In addition, to
distinguishing the various theories, important facts will be learned about labor
market dynamics and specific patterns of mobility. This project is important
because it will increase our understanding of job mobility which will begin to
help us explain the patterns of wage growth within and between jobs.
