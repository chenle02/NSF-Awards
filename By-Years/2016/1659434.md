This project supports a two half-day workshop on October 6-7 in Washington, DC,
in which the GENI Project Office (GPO) can lead multiple sessions of focused
planning for the creation of the Future Cyberinfrastructure Consortium (FCIC).
The initial purpose of the FCIC is to provide for the operation, administration,
research vision, and governance of the GENI project after the current
cooperative agreement between NSF and Raytheon/BBN for the GPO expires in 2017.
The intellectual merit of this project is in its goal to coordinate and house a
workshop that is the culmination of a GPO-led, ten month long, community-wide
inquiry into the future administration and governance of GENI. The workshop will
bring together the community of scholars who have committed to participate in
continuing the evolution of GENI past the era of the BBN
GPO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project is in its
activities laying the groundwork not just for the continuation of the GENI
project, but also for the continued evolution of the ecosystem of consortium,
project/administrative office, and physical infrastructure - including network,
storage, and computational assets - to a persistent and sustainable national
cyberinfrastructure for the support of experimental research in distributed
systems, as reflected in the workshop's title: Future Cyberinfrastructure
Consortium. In addition to its research mission, the Consortium intends to
expand the already wide use of GENI as a teaching tool in secondary schools,
colleges, and universities, where it makes the art, science, and technology of
distributed systems more accessible to all students, including under-represented
ethnic groups, women, and the disabled.
