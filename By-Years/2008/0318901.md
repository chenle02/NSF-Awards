This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I will explore new structure
designs for low light level far infrared detection. The aim is to develop multi-
quantum wells made of III-V nitride semiconductors to achieve operational and
cost advantages over existing technologies. During Phase I, the proposed sensor
will be designed and fabricated. Far infrared absorption will be demonstrated at
low temperatures. In Phase II, sensor design and fabrication conditions will be
optimized. The responsivity, uniformity, and dynamic range of detectors will be
measured, and prototype far infrared sensors and focal plane arrays will be
produced for governmental and commercial evaluations. Successful completion of
the project will provide lower-cost sensitive detectors for the far infrared
operating at higher temperatures than prior art. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Far
infrared sensing and imaging market is over $1 Billion in size, and current
technologies rely on cooling and are expensive. The applications of the
technology include but are not limited to infrared imaging space surveillance,
public safety and security, and search and rescue operations. Multiquantum-well
and superlattice infrared detectors are very promising for space surveillance
and imaging applications because of their adjustable band gaps and device
structures. They have the potential to detect targets at long ranges in
cluttered environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
