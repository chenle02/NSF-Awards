In this project the principal investigator will study three conjectures related
to the embedding of CR manifolds in complex Euclidean space. The first
conjecture involves embedding a smooth, compact, pseudoconvex CR manifold. The
second conjecture involves embedding a neighborhood of a point of a smoothly
bounded, integrable, almost complex manifold at which a Levi form has at least
two negative eigenvalues. The third conjecture involves embedding a relatively
compact, open set in a Stein manifold in an affine algebraic variety. The
subject of several complex variables has deep and important ties with the
geometry of n-space. Mathematicians can often exploit these connections in their
study of classical problems in the theory of several complex variables. In this
project the principal investigator will attempt to answer three important
conjectures regarding whether various types of manifolds can be embedded in
complex Euclidean space.
