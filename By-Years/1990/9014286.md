This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research Training Group in
Studies of Urban Poverty, Race and Social Policy through a collaborative effort
of faculty members at the University of Chicago and Northwestern University. The
faculty group is a mixture of outstanding junior and senior investigators who
come from a variety of disciplines. These include sociology, economics and
public policy. The funds provided to the University of Chicago by this award
will provide stipends for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and will
defray part of the cost of the trainees' research. In addition, funds will be
used to purchase specialized research equipment to be used by trainees, and to
bring investigators from other research and academic institutions for symposia
and colloquia. Understanding the structure of modern American society and the
problems it poses for the development and implementation of public policy is one
of the most significant challenges for social scientists. Sophisticated research
in this area now requires that paradigms and techniques from economics,
political science and demography be coupled. This RTG program will produce a new
generation of investigators and teachers with the necessary combination of
intellectual and research skills.
