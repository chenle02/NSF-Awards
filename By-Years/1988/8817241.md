Project invetigates the 3 dimensional structure of the southern Basin and Range
- Colorado Plateau transition zone. Project takes advantage of the pre-existing
seismic data in the region, in particular 110 kilometers of data from the
Safford-San Simon basin in SE Arizona. Project uses this and other data to
carefully reprocess the data to extract structural information about the
transition. Further interpretations are made using finite difference elastic
wave modelling. Benefits will lie in the improved understanding of the structure
of the southern Basin and Range - Colorado Plateau region.
