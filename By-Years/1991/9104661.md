This research is concerned with three projects in algebraic K-theory. The first
is a continuation of previous work on the K-theory of twisted forms of reductive
group schemes, with the goal of computing a part of the K-cohomology of such
schemes. The second project is to use this computation of the K-theory of group
schemes to get a good description of the K-theory of homogeneous spaces for
reductive groups, and their twisted forms. The third project is an investigation
of some constructions in motivic cohomology. This research is concerned with
algebraic K-theory. In a broad sense algebraic K-theory concerns the evolution
of concepts from linear algebra such as basis and vector space. This work has
significant implications for number theory and algebraic geometry, and promises
to make exciting connections between a number of different areas in mathematics.
