This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), funded by the Theory of
Computing (TOC) Program, CCR, by the Theoretical Physics Program, PHY and by the
Informations Technologies Office, DARPA, explores the application of the
consistent history formulation of quantum mechanics to some central problems in
the new field of quantum computation. These applications include improving
algorithms for quantum computation (1) by carrying out measurements at
itermediate times, and (2) by error detection and correction. Quantum
computation has recently attracted a lot of attention, because Peter Shor showed
that certain tasks, including factoring large numbers, could be carried out in
polynomial time on a quantum computer, whereas no polynomial-time algorithm for
factoring on a ``classical'' computer is presently known. Clearly, if it could
be built, such a computer would have many important applications in many areas
of computational science, including in communications and information
processing. Actually constructing such a quantum computer represents a daunting
task, because of severe technical difficulties. One of the goals of this SGER
project is to initiate a collaborative effort between computer scientists,
theoretical physicists, and experimental physicists at Carnegie Mellon
University, in order to explore the applications of the consistent histories
framework to determining the feasibility of such a quantum computing device. The
consistent histories approach make it possible to think about the computational
process in more realistic terms (where atoms, photons, etc. are actually doing
something over time) than is possible in the usual ``textbook'' approach, that
views the quantum system as a ``great smokey dragon'' up until the point in time
at which a final measurement is made, and the wave function of the system
``collapses'' into something which is physically understandable.***
