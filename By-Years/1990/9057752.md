Dr. L. Keith Woo of the Iowa State University is supported as a Presidential
Young Investigator by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program. Dr. Woo's project is concerned with unusual reactions of compounds of
transition metals, such as iron and molybdenum, in which two or even three
electrons are transferred simultaneously. Such processes are poorly understood
and present new experimental and theoretical challenges. The known examples of
such reactions involve metal complexes of porphyrins, which are related to the
iron-binding center in hemoglobin. Multi-electron redox reactions, and the
accompanying nitrogen or oxygen atom transfers, between metalloporphyrins will
be investigated. The specific goals of the project include delineating the scope
and generality of nitrogen and oxygen atom transfer, determining how
thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of these processes vary as a function of
molecular (structural, electronic) changes, and elucidating the relationship of
these processes to other multi-electron processes such as nitrogen fixation and
oxygen activation.
