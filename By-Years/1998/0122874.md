Over the last three years, a 3D nonlinear fluid code has been developed by the
PIs to investigate the generation of small-scale size (1-100 km) irregularities
in the high latitude plasma patches. This intermediate scale size regime, which
is attributed to naturally occurring instabilities on the larger patch size
scales, is of interest to the High Latitude Plasma Structure (HLPS) group of the
NSF-sponsored CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of the Atmospheric
Regions) initiative. The successful completion of the development of the 3D
code, which has the potential for explaining many of the observed features now
leads to a stage where detailed comparison with observations and realistic event
modeling can be readily undertaken. Thus a three-year program is proposed to
investigate the observed variability in the structuring. An important output
from the 3D code is the characteristics of the fluctuations along the field
line. Though unlikely that two satellites at different heights will be located
along the same field line, a sampling of the relative amplitudes of the
irregularities could provide a useful comparison with simulations.
