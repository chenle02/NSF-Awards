This award supports participation of early-career researchers in the annual
conference "The Midwest Numerical Analysis Day" held at the campus of Missouri
University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, on September 25-26, 2020. The
Midwest Numerical Analysis Day has provided a forum since the 1990s for
computational mathematicians in the Midwest area to share their research on
numerical methods and their analysis. Since many engineers will participate in
the Midwest Numerical Analysis Day 2020, this conference will provide an
important platform for computational scientists and engineers to communicate
with each other on recent development, analysis, and applications of various
numerical methods, and find common interests for future collaborations. The
Midwest Numerical Analysis Day has also served as a yearly regional conference
to provide an opportunity for graduate students and postdocs to present their
research on numerical methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics of this
conference focus on the algorithm development, analysis, and applications of
efficient, accurate, and stable numerical methods, especially those for solving
multi-physics and multi-scale problems. In recent years, the inherent multi-
physics and multi-scale features of many sophisticated and challenging real-
world problems accentuate the importance to develop more efficient, accurate,
and stable numerical methods for the relevant partial differential equations. In
order to address these needs, the Midwest Numerical Analysis Day 2020 intends to
create a forum for early-career and senior researchers from different fields,
including computational mathematics, computer science, physics, and various
engineering fields, to discuss recent advances on relevant numerical methods
with the corresponding numerical analysis and
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
