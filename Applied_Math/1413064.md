The overall objective of this research is to develop accurate modeling and
simulation for a series of diverse phenomena of fundamental scientific interest,
at the edge of various technological developments such as hot-electron transport
in semiconductor devices, nano structures for the solar generation of hydrogen,
reacting molecular mixtures, and evolution of plasmas in fusion models. Modeling
and simulation will be based on data obtained by accurate crystallographic
calculations, taking into account atomistic corrections, the presence of rough
media, etc. Many of the techniques to be developed are pertinent also to
exciting new applications in biological and social sciences. They include
modeling of self-organized flows in "particle" swarms like birds or fish,
emerging consensus in population dynamics, multi-agent information transfer, and
social information dynamics in Internet, to name a few.

These research goals comprise a broad program in the development of analytical
and numerical tools associated with statistical transport equations at the core
of applied mathematics in probability, statistics, and physics. They concern the
modeling of complex interactions systems yielding kinetic frameworks associated
to Markovian processes of birth-death dynamics. Such statistical approaches lead
to nonlinear integro-differential systems of equations of collisional Boltzmann
or Smolukowski type. Many of these models appear in the collisional theory of
semi-classical transport for short and long range interactions models that
describe self-consistent phenomena at nano and mesoscales. More recently,
collisional of birth-death processes have been appearing in the modeling of self
organized swarm flows in social interactions and flocking dynamics, formation of
networks, and queuing in supply chains. New tools from non-linear analysis as
well as new computational strategies will be developed to address long time
behavior, stability and decay rates to stationary modes, as well as qualitative
behavior of numerical solutions and optimal computational strategies.
