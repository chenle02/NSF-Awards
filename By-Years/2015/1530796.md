The proposed studies will explore, in depth, heterogeneity in the vulnerability
of black college students to stereotype threat, and the way in which incentives
can mitigate the impact of the threat. Stereotype threat occurs when members of
a social group, in a given situation, feel themselves to be at risk of
confirming a negative stereotype about their group and therefore perform less
well, especially on important or difficult tasks. The study will contribute to
knowledge about stereotype threat by identifying factors that contribute to or
mitigate the threat and the consequences of stereotype threat vulnerability, and
by developing a policy designed to combat its effects on black college students.
It addresses one of the most important questions in the study of human capital
investment today, which is why black students underperform and as a result are
more likely to fail to complete a college degree.

In this proposal the principal investigators plan a series of lab experimental
studies that will explore the interaction between stereotype threat and two
types of incentives: piece rates and prizes. The project will explore the
relationship among a set of key factors that are likely to be responsible for
the differences in vulnerability to stereotype threat, and carefully explore the
impact of incentives and their interaction with stereotype threat. The proposal
has high policy relevance because it can inform the development of interventions
to enhance the performance of black students enrolled at institutions with
varying demographic distributions.
