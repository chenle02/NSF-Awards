The research concerns two phase turbulent flow in complex channel geometries. It
contains both numerical modeling and experiments. A non-isotropic turbulence
model developed for single phase flow will be applied to predict lateral
velocity and phase distributions in a triangular pipe. This severe test of
state-of the-art modeling capability will be evaluated through comparison to
appropriate experimental data to be obtained by the principal investigators.
