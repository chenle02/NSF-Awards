This STTR Phase II project is to develop and commercialize copper nanofluids for
heat transfer enhancement applications. The low cost nanoparticle production
methods developed will produce quality nanoparticles for this
application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success of this STTR project will benefit a
wide range of applications for heat transfer enhancement including: electronics,
HVAC, transportation, textile and paper manufacturing, and energy production
systems. The project will also provide educational impact by offering
opportunities for student recruitment, research and training, and curricula
design at the University of Nevada, Reno.
