This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
demonstrate the feasibility of producing large area stress-free GaN substrates.
This research will focus on the development of defect free GaN wafers by growing
thick GaN films using the high growth- rate HVPE method on to novel
micromachined sacrificial (111) silicon substrates. The low-cost Si(111)
substrates are made compliant by a proprietary photoelectochemical
micromachining method. Availability of such high quality GaN substrates will
make commercialization of GaN- based devices for various applications feasible.
Furthermore, it will be demonstrated that large area (up to 12.) GaN wafers can
be produced by this method, which will reduce the device cost dramatically, by
economy of scales.

Commercial applications of the proposed large area GaN wafers include general
lighting, full color displays, traffic signal lighting, information storage,
full color copying, RF communications, high temperature and power electronics
and chemical/ biological sensors
