The PI will investigate existing DSDP and ODP basalt cores from the Pacific
Plate to update the Cretaceous paleomagnetic data from these cores. Recent
results from basalt cores from the Ontong Java Plateau show them to be
consistent but discrepant from basalt cores from other Pacific locations. This
may be because short basalt cores from many Pacific boreholes have been measured
poorly or not at all, and the PI proposes to make new measurements. In addition,
many older studies are over two decade ago using less detailed and
discriminating methodologies than those available today. The PI will study
basalt cores from ODP/DSDP Sites 1184, 807, 800, 802, 303-304, 289, 462, 164,
166, 167, 169 and 170. If these cores can provide consistent results over a
broad area, then the study will go a long way to clearing up a much of confusion
about various hypotheses about paleomagnetic behavior.
