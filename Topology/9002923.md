Frohman intends to study problems relating to the geometry and topology of
three-dimensional manifolds. His research is developing along two lines. The
first aims to finish the uniqueness part of the topological classification of
minimal surfaces in R3. The second will continue studying representations of the
fundamental groups of knots from a geometric perspective.
