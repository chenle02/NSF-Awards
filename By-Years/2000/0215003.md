This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to establish
metabolic engineering approaches to increase the production of commercially
relevant terpenoids in mint. This program will be directed toward high priority
areas that will allow U.S. mint growers and processors to become more
competitive in the production of existing products such as menthol, as well as
the ability to produce novel high value compounds. The specific objectives
include biochemical profiling of terpenoids in 150 different mint varieties,
production of tissue-specific cDNA libraries and generation of 15,000 Expressed
Sequence Tags (ESTs), development of a mint DNA microarray and the use of this
array to investigate gene expression patterns during trichome development,
determination of protein function for one putative terpenoid biosynthetic
enzyme, and improvement of mint transformation efficiency to the range of 50-100
percent. Completion of these objectives will provide a basis for the development
of a robust system for metabolic engineering in mint that will allow the
creation of improved lines that have enhanced production of commercially
relevant terpenoids. This endeavor will create new products for U.S. mint
producers and enhance their competitiveness in the world market.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of high value, plant
derived compounds.
