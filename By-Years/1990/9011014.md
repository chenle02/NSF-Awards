It is proposed that an Optronics C-4100SP microdensitometer, and a Silicon
Graphics Iris 4D/280SX computer be purchased, for use in structural studies of
proteins and nucleic acids by Drs. Stubbs, Anders, Flicker, Robinson, Newcomer
and others. Drs. Flicker and Robinson plan to utilize cryo-electron microscopy
in their structural studies of protein assemblies: Dr. Flicker is studying
actomyosin complexes; Dr. Robinson studies neurotoxins. Dr. Stubbs' studies of
plant virus structure will also benefit from cryo-electron microscopy
facilities. Drs. Anderson, Newcomer, and Stubbs are using protein
crystallographic methods to study a variety of molecules. With a number of new
crystals new available, the present facilities have reached saturation.
Furthermore, several of the crystal forms have unit cells too large to permit
data collection using existing facilities. Dr. Stubbs' fiber diffraction studies
also require equipment capable of resolving diffraction data from very large
unit cells. The major users make heavy use of the existing computer facilities.
Structural refinement, especially by Dr. Anderson and Stubbs and new projects of
Dr. Newcomer and Flicker, will require substantially increased computing
capacity.
