This proposal addresses theoretical and computational questions involving three
particles in the continuum interacting with short-range potentials. The major
issue is to understand the three-body recombination rate of atoms at ultra-low
energies. The rate for these reactions are needed to model the physics of cold-
trapped gases such as occur in the formation of Bose condensates. The issue of
the mechanism for molecule formation is a long standing and unsolved problem in
cold, trapped alkali gases.
