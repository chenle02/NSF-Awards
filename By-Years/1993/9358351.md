9358351 Liu The initial research project is to characterize harmonics in power
systems by developing an integrated probabilistic harmonic flow algorithm that
considers the nonlinear dependency of harmonic voltages and currents, and random
variations of operation modes and switching status of nonlinear loads. An
additional topic is to develop intelligent diagnostic methodologies to detect
incipient failures and assess the remaining life of power equipment using
adaptive pattern recognition techniques and artificial neural networks. Finally
an effort will be made to develop and simulate different out-of-step relaying
algorithms to be implemented at the Florida and Georgia interface for real time
tie-line operation control upon the detection of potentially unstable
conditions. The accurate representation of the different sections of a power
system is a critical issue in achieving such a goal. This study will continue to
look for an optimum equivalence strategy tailored for system out-of-step
identification. ***
