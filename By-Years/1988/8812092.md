A necessary complement to work in the area of molecular biology is
consideration of the intracellular localization and intercellular distribution
of gene products, at both protein and mRNA levels. This request is for
instrumentation that will complement the shared facilities for monoclonal
antibody production and electron microscopy that already exist in our
department. This instrumentation will give molecular biologists access to the
tools needed for immunocytochemical localization of proteins, in situ
hybridization of mRNAs, and identification of fluorescent expression markers in
transformed cells. Investigators will thus be able to localize and quantify gene
expression, both spatially and developmentally. Specific projects involve
characterization of Lea gene expression and the functions(s) of their gene
products, biochemical differentiation during floral development, stress - and
auxin - induced gene expression, phytochrome gene expression, the biogenesis of
multisubunit complexes in the chloroplast, and gene products from the R and Wx
loci of maize.
