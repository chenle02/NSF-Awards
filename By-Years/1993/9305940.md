This work is aimed at understanding the molecular basis for specific recognition
of nucleic acids by proteins, and the factors involved in their regulatory
interactions, both in vivo and in vitro. The work described in this grant
proposal focuses on the trp repressor of E. coli (TrpR), with the following
goals: 1) Determination of the sequence requirements for tandem, cooperative
binding of repressor to DNA; 2) Determination of the binding mode used by the
repressor in vivo on natural operators; 3) Measurement of the bending of tandem
and single operator DNA's in vitro in the presence and absence of repressor; 4)
Measurement of the thermodynamic parameters associated with DNA binding in the
tandem and single modes; 5) Determination of the effect of crystallization
conditions on specific and nonspecific DNA binding affinity; and 6)
Determination of the folding and ligand-binding properties of a fragment of
TrpR. %%% To carry out their regulatory functions, proteins exercise precise
recognition of nucleic acid sequences, correctly identifying their true targets
against a vast background of nonspecific sequences. In the last quarter century,
biochemical and genetic studies have pointed to a high degree of chemical
complementarily between the protein and nucleic acid partners in specific
complexes. The current state of knowledge about the TrpR-DNA interaction
suggests that the distinction between specific and non specific binding is due
to an interplay of factors, including subtle energetic considerations. The
experiments proposed here are aimed at provided a complete picture for TrpR.
