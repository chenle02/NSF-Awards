This dissertation research uses theory, methods and findings from sociology of
professions and science studies to examine academic economics in the U.S. during
the 1970s and 1980s. At this time economics was focusing more and more on
complex mathematical techniques and on models of free markets. This was despite
protests - often coming from high-ranking mathematical economists themselves -
that academic work was becoming increasingly unrealistic. The research claims
that this state of affairs can be understood by considering the changing
relationship between academic economists and economists pursuing careers in more
applied fields. Academics pursued more and more abstract theories because they
saw themselves as a scientific elite providing the correct knowledge behind all
effective work going on in the other fields. Ironically however, they were able
to do this only because the more applied fields in fact were becoming
increasingly separated from academia and were relying more and more on their own
ideas and ways of doing things. Evidence supporting this interpretation will be
looked for in the changing patterns of employment of economists across the
different fields, and in the statements of economists themselves - both academic
and applied - concerning what they do and what they see as being the role of
academic theories. Data for the investigations is of four types: existing
statistics on patterns of employment; accounts of careers including biographies
and listings in handbooks of the American Economic Association; written evidence
of the attitudes of academic economists; and original interviews of economists
in Chicago and Washington, DC, concentrating on those in non-academic career
fields.
