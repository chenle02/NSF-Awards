The objective of this research is to carry out an in-depth analysis of multi-
stage, multi-product production/inventory systems. The research first focuses on
the identification of effective manufacturing strategies and their investigation
over an array of performance measures. The development of exact and approximate
analytical models for these strategies and their incorporation into a queuing
network based decomposition approach constitutes the bulk of the effort in years
two and three. Industrial collaboration is involved in all phases. Models of
production/inventory systems frequently arise in design and performance studies
of manufacturing systems. Despite their potential applicability, their use is
not widespread. This is due mainly to the limited capability of existing tools
for analyzing manufacturing systems. The development of manufacturing strategies
for multi-product, multi-stage production/inventory systems should lay the
groundwork for more comprehensive tools and therefore greater applicability of
analytical approaches to production system environments.
