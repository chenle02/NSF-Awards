ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS9616869 Principle Investigator: Nakato This is a
grant for travel support for US students to participate in the 27th Congress of
the International Association for Hydraulic Research to be held in San Francisco
on August 10-15, 1997. The last time that this congress was held in the US was
in 1967. This grant will provide direct support for the John F. Kennedy Student
Paper Competition. It is the specific aim of this activity to enhance the
capability for fluid mechanics research in the broad area of hydraulic and
environmental engineering by encouraging our best students to remain in the
field. The support of fluid mechanics in these fields is one of the central
themes of the Fluid Dynamics and Hydraulics Program. A small investment in the
best of our students in this field will yield a large payoff in terms of future
capability in a field of engineering that will have a great impact in meeting
societal needs in the future. The University of Iowa has agreed to cost share on
a dollar for dollar basis. *** Roger E.A. Arndt Program Director, 1443
