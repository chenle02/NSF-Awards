This award supports a visit by Professors Michael Stob of Calvin College,
Steffen Lempp of the University of Wisconsin, and Richard Shore of Cornell
University, to Victoria University, New Zealand, to work with Professor Rodney
Downey. All have collaborated successfully in the past and have several on-going
projects in recursion theory, a branch of mathematical logic. All concern the
study of certain algebraic structures which arise naturally from the study of
effective computability. The primary structures they will study are the lattice
of recursively enumerable sets and the uppersemilattices of the Turing degrees
and the recursively enumerable Turing degrees. The principal method they will
employ is the priority method.
