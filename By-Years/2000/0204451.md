This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2002. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Development and
testing of genetic algorithms for inferring maximum-likelihood based phylogenies
from very large, heterogeneous molecular data sets." Likelihood-based
phylogenetic algorithms become very computationally expensive as data sets
become larger. However, genetic algorithms offer an efficient alternative to
existing methods. This project uses a large molecular data set to test the
efficiency and accuracy of a recently developed genetic algorithm under various
models of evolution and search conditions. The data are being used to construct
a phylogeny of frogs.
