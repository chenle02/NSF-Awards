This proposal seeks funds to support a workshop involving the tribological
community's leading scientists and engineers, aimed at exploring and identifying
future areas of fundamental tribological research. The changing landscape of
fundamental research funding, the development of new experimental, simulation,
and modeling tools, and the rapid emergence of new technologies relying upon
advanced tribological performance together provide the impetus for the proposed
workshop. The program will be focused on discussions of central themes, the role
of new materials, and the influence or context of environment. Proposed areas of
discussion include fundamental mechanisms of energy dissipation at moving
interfaces, influence of surface chemistry on tribological performance, wear
mechanisms and resistance, computation and simulation of tribological events,
extreme miniaturization and the influence of nanomechanics, extreme environments
including space environments and high temperatures, design and performance of
biocompatible tribological systems, energy efficiency and energy security,
surface structure modifications for novel tribological behavior, development of
ceramics, biomaterials, self-healing/adaptive materials, nanomaterials, and
ultralow-friction materials for tribological
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will take place over a
two-day time period in early fall, 2004 and will be organized and run by Prof.
Scott S. Perry of the University of Houston and Prof. Wilfred T. Tysoe of the
University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. The proposed workshop will involve
approximately 20 scientists and engineers from a range of disciplines and
possessing experience in a number of different fields. Participation in the
workshop will be by invitation only. The organizers of the workshop propose to
document and publish the outcomes of the workshop discussion and debate in the
form of a position paper, thus insuring the wide dissemination of the major
themes and conclusions reached through the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;
