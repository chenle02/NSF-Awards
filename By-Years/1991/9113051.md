For most newborn mammals the most important sense is that of smell, to guide
critical behavior such as suckling. This project will use anatomical methods to
determine at what age chemical stimuli in the nasal cavity become effective by
reaching nasal nerve cells, and determine when those nerve cells establish
appropriate connections with target cells in the brain. These studies will be
important for producing an atlas of the olfactory part of the brain during
olfactory development, for clarifying how changes in chemosensory surfaces may
relate to functional changes in olfaction, and the RUI component involving
undergraduates in research assures an impact on scientific education.
