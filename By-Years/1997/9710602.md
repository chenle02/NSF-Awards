*** 9710602 Ohara This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project is
for the development of a high precision position measurement system. Such
systems are used to measure and control the highly-precise motion of
manufacturing equipment. The system utilizes Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM)
technology, MEMS (or micro machines), and a high precision holographic grating
together with synchronous signal detection. The simple structure of the device
and ease of the use suggest significant cost savings to the end user. The focus
of the Phase I project has been to investigate the means of providing a reliable
and high speed position measurement system based on the proposed method. During
Phase II, Phase I results will be further developed toward a product level
prototyping. The new prototype design will aim to demonstrate better than 0.1nm
resolution and to detect faster than 10mm/sec motion over 2" range with
increased reliability and stability. An optimization procedure for mechanical
and controller design will be developed and tested along with prototype
development, with the expectation of significant contribution to overall
development time and cost savings. The demand for ultra-precision position
measurement and control systems worldwide has grown rapidly in such key
industries as 1) semiconductor manufacturing equipment; 2) servo-writers for
hard disk writing; 3) optical disk mastering equipment, and 4) high-precision
machining of aspheric lenses and mirrors. ***
