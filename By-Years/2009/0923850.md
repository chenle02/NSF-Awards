This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase II research project seeks to develop a radically new type of mobile
robot. Most of today?s robots rely on wheels to move from one location to
another but the proposed Tri-Sphere robot moves by walking. This form of
locomotion provides distinct advantages when the robot is called upon to
negotiate cluttered terrain. The Tri-Sphere robot interacts with its environment
via a unique six degree-of-freedom parallel manipulator. This manipulator allows
the robot to dig, grasp and carry objects with exceptional dexterity. An
important feature of the robot?s design is that both its manipulator and its
legs are driven by the same suite of six electric motors. This intrinsic
mechanical simplicity results in an extremely robust mechanism well suited for
dirty, difficult jobs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research
is the creation of a new class of robots designed to combat the threat posed by
land mines and other explosive devices. It is estimated that more than 60
million mines are in place throughout the world. The Tri-Sphere robot will
provide a safe, reliable means of locating, unearthing and disposing of this
unexplored ordnance. In addition, the Tri-Sphere design can be scaled to create
versions of the robot tailored to the demands of mining, underwater trenching
and other complex material handling operations that must be conducted in
hazardous environments.
