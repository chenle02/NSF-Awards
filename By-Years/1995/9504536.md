9504536 Jones This project will attempt to refine the use of Sr isotopes in
fossil fish teeth for precise age control of otherwise- undatable sediments. Two
questions will be addressed, one dealing with the best cleaning method for
removal of all coatings and the second examining evidence for alteration
(diagenesis) of the teeth themselves. ***
