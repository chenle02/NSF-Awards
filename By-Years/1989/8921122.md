The main theme of this research is the development of semistate design theories
for microelectronic circuit realization. The theories are oriented toward
applications in areas where the proposers have particular expertise, such as
coordinated arm control circuits for knot tying robots, neural-type hysteretic
microsystems, soliton circuits for noiseless signal processing, and Kemp echo
simulators for noninvasive determination of ear parameters. The semistate
description is ideal for characterizing microelectronic systems, since semistate
equations simultaneously incorporate dynamic and nondynamic descriptions and
microelectronic systems involve dynamics through capacitive effects and
nondynamics through resitive-controlled source effects. There is now a large
literature on the analysis of semistate described systems with particular
reference to solution of the resulting equations. However, very little is
available in the area of design of semistate described systems. This research
deals with the development of design theories, especially in the areas where the
full power of the semistate comes into play, including hysteresis and knot
oscillators. The theories are oriented toward the above mentioned applications.
