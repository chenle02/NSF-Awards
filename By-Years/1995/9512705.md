9512705 Doughty Research will be carried out in high energy electron scattering
and photonuclear reactions at CEBAF to study the structure of the nucleon and
excited states. Included is work on the spin structure of the proton and test of
the Gerasimov-Drell- Hearn sum rule. The structure of excited baryons will be
carried out at high momentum transfers, where there is significant model
dependence at the quark level. Research in these areas will advance our
understanding of the quark structure of the nucleon and of the nucleon's complex
spin structure in terms of constituent and sea quarks and gluons. These topics
are high priority activities in contemporary nuclear physics. Technical
development of the CEBAF CLAS detector will also be carried out, with specific
responsibility for development of the event-trigger subsystem and other hardware
and software subsystems of the overall CLAS detector data acquisition system.
Education of undergraduates and masters-level graduate students is a central
component of this grant.***
