A three year pilot project will be implemented that will focus on increasing
the presence of minorities in computer science. This will be done by developing
and testing an information system to enhance both the recruitment of minorities
for computer science graduate programs and the interaction among minorities
already in computer science as graduate students or as professionals. The
information system will be on-line and accessible to other universities via
networks. It will contain data such as students' personal data, financial
support mechanisms, contact persons, description of graduate program in computer
science, personal data will be obtained from a select group of
colleges/universities, including CIC (Committee on Institutional Cooperation
plus the University of Chicago), along with 10 institutions with predominantly
minority students. Faculty, counselors, administrators, and students from
Michigan State University will serve as a pilot group for the proposed system on
a vax computer system and use the database, INGRESS. Also, workshops are planned
in order to obtain feedback from the project participants, including outside
evaluators.
