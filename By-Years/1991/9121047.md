This proposal represents the first specific task definitions and associated
funding increments under the general scope of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
between the National Science Foundation Division of Polar Programs (NSF/DPP) and
the Naval Underwater Systems Center (NUSC), New London Laboratory, New London,
CT. The purpose of the MOA is to provide a framework for NUSC to provide
analytical and experimental investigations into the applicability of burst mode
communications techniques via meteor trails and ionospheric mechanisms and via
high frequency (HF) radio using state-of-the-art link management technology
(automatic link establishment, or ALE). NUSC will utilize its resources and
research into similar issues in the Arctic to the benefit of both agencies. The
work will characterize the performance of the significant HF propagation
channels used for communications in the United States Antarctic Program (USAP),
rigorously evaluate the performance of ALE technology in the souther polar
region over USAP channels, make recommendations to the USAP suitable for use in
medium range communications planning for HF systems modernization, and
rigorously evaluate the absolute performance of burst mode communications and
provide a relative comparison of the performance of competing burst mode
technologies to assist the USAP in long range communications planning for the
improvement of field party and inter-base communications for the USAP within
Antarctica. The MOA outlines a broad definition of the problem areas that NUSC
will investigate for NSF/DPP, and it does not define specific tasks or task
funding levels. The specific tasks and associated funding are to be identified
by the NSF/DPP as the need arises, and these tasks shall be managed under the
framework of the MOA. This proposal represents the first explicit tasking to
NUSC under the MOA.
