9409676 Lesieutre The project aims to develop a systematic, mathematically
rigorous method for the construction of physically-based dynamic load models.
These models will increase the accuracy of power systems studies and improve
power system operations by enabling more accurate calculation of steady-state
and dynamic response. A model capturing the physical characteristics of an
induction motor will be constructed and then used to identify which load model,
among the widely varying models that appear in the literature, is most suitable
for voltage stability studies. Steady-state and transient stability studies will
be performed to examine the effect of the load. Following this example and using
knowledge of significant load components, the researchers will construct a
general model taking into account the composition of the load. The aggregation
of dissimilar components and the representation of the model in terms of
meaningful power system variables will be accomplished through a series of
nonlinear transformations. The resulting model will retain the critical dynamic
characteristics of the individual load components. ***
