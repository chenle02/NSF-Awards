This project involves an integrated petrographic and stable isotopic study of
samples selected from core obtained during drilling in the Creede Formation of
southwestern Colorado for the purpose of documenting progressive changes in the
oxygen, sulfur and carbon isotopic compositions of secondary minerals which
precipitated from pore fluids during the course of diagenesis and hydrothermal
activity in the Creede hydrothermal system. The textural relationships and
mineral compositions of pore-filling, fracture-filling, and wall rock alteration
minerals will be examined in order to establish the relative timing of secondary
mineral precipitation. Laser-based in situ extraction techniques will be
employed whenever possible to measure oxygen and sulfur isotopes in fine-grained
minerals and test for isotopic variation within minerals. Oxygen (and to a
lesser extent sulfur and carbon) isotopic partitioning between appropriate
minerals will be measured and combined with experimentally and theoretically
derived fractionation factors in order to constrain temperatures of
precipitation. The measured isotopic compositions of oxygen, sulfur, and carbon
in secondary mineral minerals will be combined with temperature constraints and
mineral-fluid fractionation factors to calculate the stable isotopic
compositions of the solutions from which the minerals precipitated. The sequence
of stable isotopoic variation reconstructed from data for the secondary minerals
will be used to assess the relative importance of closed-system processes (e.g.
local fluid-rock reaction) and open-system processes (e.g. groundwater or
hydrothermal fluid influx) in controlling the isotopic compositions of oxygen,
sulfur, and carbon in the pore fluids.
