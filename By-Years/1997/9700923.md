ABSTRACT, DONG The principal investigator will investigate vertex operator
algebras and the monstrous moonshine. Relations among vertex operator algebras,
orbifold theory, modular functions and elliptic cohomology will be studied. The
principal investigator will determine various module categories and construct
induction functor for vertex operator algebras. The Conway-Norton's generalized
moonshine conjecture is expected to be established. Vertex operator algebras are
symmetry algebras in conformal field theory which is an important physical
theory describing both two-dimensional critical phenomena in condensed matter
physics and classical motions of strings in string theory. This is a research
that starts out in the field of algebra but moves beyond that to touch knot
invariants, quantum groups, integrable systems, modular forms, and conformal and
topological field theories. A successful study of this project will lead to new
mathematical discoveries which will be important both in mathematics and
physics.
