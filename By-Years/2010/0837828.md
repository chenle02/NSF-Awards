Engineering - Chemical (54)&lt;br/&gt;One of the fundamental courses in chemical
engineering programs across the nation focuses on understanding material and
energy balances. In this course, students typically struggle to make the
transition between written materials, process flow diagrams, and finally
mathematical formulations. Through this project, a software tool is being
developed that scaffolds the translation of written energy balance problems to
visual form and the subsequent translation of visual chemical process diagrams
to sets of written equations to be solved. While several tools for solving
energy balance problems exist, these are primarily aimed at a professional
audience and are not always suitable for inclusion in an introductory
undergraduate course. Commercial tools typically have a steep learning curve and
are not appropriate for enhancing student learning and understanding. The
software is being rigorously evaluated in terms of improved student learning as
well as usability factors.&lt;br/&gt;
