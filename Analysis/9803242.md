This project involves a exploration of all aspects of low dimensional dynamics:
combinatorial and geometric issues of holomorphic dynamics, its interplay with
one-dimensional real dynamics (particularly in the rigidity and renormalization
theories), interaction with three dimensional hyperbolic geometry, and analytic
and geometric aspects of two dimensional complex and real dynamics. Particular
emphasis is given to the key problems of describing the typical asymptotical
behavior of a typical system and understanding of the mechanisms behind the
universality phenomenon.

The theory of dynamical systems was founded in the works of Poincare' about 100
years ago. It began as a branch of celestial mechanics and the study of
differential equations, but then developed into an important field in its own
right. It has developed in a collaboration between mathematicians and workers in
many other sciences, and has preserved strong mutually beneficial connections
with natural science including celestial mechanics, statistical physics, fluid
dynamics, meteorology, engineering, chemistry and many other fields. Since its
founding in 1989, IMS has carried on an active program of research and education
in dynamical systems, and related areas of geometry, ergodic theory, and complex
analysis, with particular emphasis on low dimensional dynamics over the real and
complex numbers. It has supported a number of junior and senior visitors,
organised research and learning seminars, mini-courses and conferences, worked
with graduate and undergraduate students, incorporated computers into research
and education, and helped promote communication in the field by production of
the preprint series and maintaining a dynamics web site.
