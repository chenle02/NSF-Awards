The investigators will culture benthic foraminifera under controlled conditions
of temperature, organic carbon concentration, and isotopic composition in order
to determine the controls on carbon isotope fractionation and burrowing
behavior. They will collect live specimens from the upper continental slope,
selecting taxa used by paleoceanographers, culture them in mixed and
monospecific populations with in situ measurement of pore-waters, manipulate
ambient temperature and pore-water chemistry, observe burrowing behavior, and
analyze isotopic composition and morphology.
