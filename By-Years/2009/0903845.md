The Appalachian Set Theory (AST) workshop series was created by the PI and co-PI
under NSF Award 0631446. We propose to continue this innovative workshop series
as it was originally conceived. We hold three workshops per year, each devoted
to a single topic such as a broadly applicable method, a complex seminal paper
or a significant unpublished theorem. Faculty and students who are not experts
are immersed in the subject for one or two intensive days and get the tools they
need to continue on their own. The location and topic is announced several
months in advance. Each workshop is led by one or two experts in the topic. This
could mean doing all the lecturing themselves, or delegating parts to others.
Typically, there are three hours of lectures in the morning (with short breaks),
two hours for lunch, and three hours of lectures in the afternoon (with short
breaks). Those wishing to attend a workshop may apply to have some of their
travel expenses reimbursed. We hire one or two student participants to prepare
typed notes based on the lectures with help from the workshop leader or leaders.
These lecture notes are disseminated online. At least one publisher has
expressed interest in publishing a collection of these lecture notes as part of
a mathematics book series. In planning these workshops, special emphasis is
given to encouraging participation by young mathematicians and mathematicians
from underrepresented groups, efforts that have been reasonably successful.
