This award will fund the upgrade of a used, 5-spectrometer Cameca Instruments
SX-100 that was decommissioned by Sandia National Laboratory and which the
principal investigators claimed from surplus through DOE's Laboratory Equipment
Donation Program. Along with other essential lab components, this award will
bring this instrument to fully operational status, which will ensure that this
regional facility remains open and ready for use well into the future. Equipment
to be funded includes a new operational personal computer (PC), a PC-based
automation package, associated firmware, a silicon-drifted solid-state energy-
dispersive x-ray analyzer with Peltier cooler, and upgrades to the evaporative
coater. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regular users of the facility come mostly from
geology, but faculty members and students of anthropology, other natural
sciences, and engineering are frequent and sometimes lengthy users. Examples of
research to be enabled by the upgraded instrument include: experimental studies
of isotope chemistry H and F among garnet, tourmaline, and silicate melts,
experiments to define a stability field for kimzeyite, a Zr-rich garnet, and
studies of crystal nucleation and fabric in silicate liquids.
