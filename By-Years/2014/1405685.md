This research project aims to advance the development of statistical methodology
and theory for analyzing nonstationary time series. A nonstationary time series
is a sequence of data points collected at successive time points with certain
aspects changing over time or being nonstationary. Nonstationary time series
appear very frequently in various scientific fields including economics,
engineering, environmental science, finance, and medical science among others.
Ignoring nonstationarity and dependence, two important features of nonstationary
time series, can lead to erroneous conclusions. Therefore, the research project
is expected to promote scientific research in not only statistics but also other
disciplines that involve the analysis of nonstationary time series.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;In order to capture the temporal dynamics resulting from the
nonstationarity, the parameters are allowed to change over time and modeled as
deterministic but unknown functions of time, which are intrinsically infinite
dimensional. To avoid potential misspecifications of parametric models,
nonparametric methods are used to estimate and make inference about the
underlying parameter functions. The research to be performed involves parameter
estimation, hypothesis testing, and variable selection for regression models
with time-varying parameters. By allowing a general class of nonstationary and
dependent processes, the methods to be developed and the asymptotic results to
be established can be widely applicable, and we are able to understand and
quantify the effect of nonstationarity and dependence on the asymptotic behavior
of parameter estimators and test statistics of interest.
