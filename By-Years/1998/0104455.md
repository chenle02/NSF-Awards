Dr. Hurley-Keller is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at Case Western
Reserve University (CWRU). She will carry out a photometric survey of dwarf
galaxy satellite systems around isolated spiral galaxies, which will provide
constraints both on the evolution of disk galaxy stellar populations and their
dark matter halos. The survey will be conducted with the CWRU Burrell Schmidt
telescope and will reach fainter than other studies of isolated systems and will
sample dwarf spheroidal populations throughout the dark halos of these galaxies.
With this survey, she will be able to investigate two primary issues: 1) the
relationship between the properties of a galaxy's disk/halo/bulge and of its
satellite system, and 2) the constraints that numbers of dwarf galaxies place on
various cold dark matter models and their predictions. Dr. Hurley-Keller will
also design and offer an undergraduate course for non-majors in which students
explore the process of science by focusing less on the material content and more
on 'thinking like a scientist' in the context of both historical and current
astronomical problems. ***
