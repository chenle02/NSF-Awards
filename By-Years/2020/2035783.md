faculty to attend and present at the symposium on Two-Dimensional Quantum
Materials out of Equilibrium at the 2020 MRS Spring and Fall Virtual
Meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
