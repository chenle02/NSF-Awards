The project will provide for the operation and management of the Geospace
Environment Modeling (GEM) summer workshops and the fall GEM mini-workshop that
takes place annually in conjunction with the fall meeting of the American
Geophysical Union. The GEM workshops are a critical part of the GEM program. A
major portion of the funding goes to support the travel and subsistence costs of
approximately 60 students each year (both graduate and undergraduates). The
educational impacts of the student participation in GEM is one of the major
goals of the GEM program.
