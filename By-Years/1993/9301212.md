As one of the major activities of the Cornelius Lanczos International Centenary
Celebration at North Carolina State University, the University will hold an
international conference (December 12-17, 1993) on computational mathematics,
theoretical physics, and astrophysics. The conference will reflect the wide
scope of interests of Lanczos and will offer a unique opportunity for
interaction among numerical analysts, theoretical physicists and
astrophysicists. The conference will bring together scientists in the
communities of applied and computational mathematic, theoretical physics and
astrophysics for a focused exchange of ideas: to share problems, perspectives
and experiences in an attempt to make progress on some of the central, unsolved
problems in physical science. The conference will also expose students in
mathematics and physics to the interdisciplinary methodologies and tools of
science. The organizing committee will invite participation by students and will
especially encourage recent doctoral recipients, women, minorities and persons
with disabilities to participate. The total funding from the NSF will be used to
provide partial travel support of these participants.
