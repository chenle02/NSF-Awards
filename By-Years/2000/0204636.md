Over the past 40 years, substantial experimental and computational efforts have
revealed the existence and importance of complex coherent structures in shear
turbulence. The nature and role of the coherent structures have remained
subjects of debate at a qualitative level due to a lack of theoretical
understanding and foundation for these structures. However, the gap between
theory and experiments is closing thanks to recent discoveries of three-
dimensional traveling wave solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations that are
best described as exact coherent structures. This research will continue the
study and characterization of these rich solutions in plane shear flows and seek
to elucidate the connections between their instabilities and the disorder that
is characteristic of turbulence. The approach is that of bifurcation and
dynamical systems theory applied to the nonlinear partial differential equations
of hydrodynamics. Extensions of these traveling wave solutions to pipe flow and
mixing layers will be considered.

Shear turbulence is an ubiquitous phenomenon that occurs in the flow of simple
fluids, such as air and water, and the more complex fluids that arise in
biological and industrial processes. Turbulence has an enormous impact on the
properties of fluid flows, such as the transport of momentum and energy and the
mixing of chemicals in combustion, manufacturing and the environment. However,
the complexity of turbulent flows severely limits our ability to predict the
properties of fluid flows. This research promises to provide a fundamental
understanding of the nature of shear turbulence thanks in large part to high-
performance scientific computing. A database of the exact coherent structures
mentioned above will be developed and posted on the Internet.
