The Redshirt model is an alternative pathway for low-income, academically
talented students, who want to pursue degrees and careers in engineering,
computer science, science and mathematics, but need a stronger base of
preparation. The model is based on Redshirt programs in athletics, in which a
first year college student is given a year to prepare to compete at the
university level. With evidence of the success of the Redshirt model in
engineering across a set of research universities, this conference project will
contribute to meeting the national need for engineers, computer scientists, and
scientists by offering an opportunity to examine, implement, and investigate the
implementation of the model at a broader array of institutions of higher
education beyond research-intensive ones. The model also focuses on First-Time
Full-Time students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will engage
participants in the development and planned implementation of the model at their
institutions. Organizers will leverage the experience of the Redshirt project
team in establishing and maintaining the comprehensive model at six research
universities. The conference agenda is driven by best practices and includes
sessions on collaboration; key components of the model; mastery of STEM basics;
intrusive advising; community building; study skills; student personal and
professional development; partnering with industry; fund-raising;
sustainability; and evaluation. A robust mixed-methods evaluation complements
the comprehensive activities that are planned. The selection of participants
will be based on commitment to establishing a Redshirt program at their
institutions and on fostering the Redshirt model at a diverse set of institution
(e.g., types, size, location).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
