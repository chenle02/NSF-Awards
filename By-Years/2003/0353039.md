The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this award to
Tulane University. With this Career award, Professor Sankaran Thayumanavan will
study molecular interactions in macromolecules, and will design parameters for
functional and dynamic dendrimers. Dendrimers with both hydrophobic and
hydrophilic groups will be designed, synthesized and functionalized to provide
hydrophilic outer surfaces in polar solvents and hydrophilic outer surfaces in
apolar solvents. The studies will provide key concepts for the development of
designed second order structure in macromolecules with functional utility. With
these dendrimers, it would be possible to sequester apolar organic substrates
into these dendrimeric interiors in polar media for applications in catalysis,
phase transfer reactions, drug delivery systems and sensors. The proposed
educational outreach program 'Tulane Science Scholars Program is a strong
educational program, and this program will expose local high school students to
science and engineering programs. The PI, the Co-director of the program with
the help of other faculty members, will be provide courses to high school
juniors and seniors in Chemistry, Physics, Cell Biology, Molecular Biology,
Environmental Sciences, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and
Biomedical Engineering during Fall and Spring semesters.

New dendrimeric polymers with functional groups may be used in polar and apolar
solvents with applications in catalysis, phase transfer reactions, drug delivery
systems and sensors. The proposed Tulane Science Scholars Program will expose
high school students in different aspects of science and engineering subjects,
and will prepare them for advanced studies in science and engineering programs
at college level.
