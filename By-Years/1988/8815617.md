A novel fiber optic probe will be developed and then used to investigate: (1)
the movement of solutes through a support matrix and (2) the intrinsic kinetics
of solute binding by immobilized ligands. The probe is an optical fiber
employing an evanescent wave to excite molecules at the fiber surface; the
electromagnetic field which is the wave penetrates only 2000 angstroms into the
surrounding medium, and can be used to study the molecules at the surface of the
optical fiber. In the second part of the project, the waveguide will be coated
with a very thin film of a support matrix and the rate of movement of solutes of
interest through an affinity column will be determined. This will allow
separation of mass transfer and equilibrium effects by direct measurement. Thus,
the influence of the nature of the support matrix and the method of ligand
attachment can be unambiguously determined. This knowledge will be of
considerable importance in affinity, chromatography, a separation technique with
applications in biotechnology. Affinity-based separations are an important
technique for the recovery of biological products. Though extensively studied,
most investigations have been at the macroscopic level; for example, some
studies have used frontal analysis or pulse techniques from chromatography
theory. This project will attempt a study of factors affecting binding constants
and mass transfer rates from a microscopic perspective.
