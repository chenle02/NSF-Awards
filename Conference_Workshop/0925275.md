From Probability to Statistics and Back: High-Dimensional Models and Processes
Conference

The investigator proposes to organize a conference at the interface of
probability, statistics and biostatistics, and machine learning. The meeting
aims to identify the new frontiers that can emerge from the interaction of these
fields. The conference will provide an open forum for discussing strategies for
creating a workforce for the 21s century that will continue to do fundamental
research, which is a key element for the successful development of the society
as a whole.

The themes that will be brought together render uniqueness to this conference:
empirical processes theory, a field of probability theory; fundamental areas in
statistics and biostatistics such as the theory of nonparametric and
semiparametric models and the theory of shape-constrained estimation; and
learning theory. The meeting will promote immediate dissemination of the most
cutting-edge theoretical results in these fields.
