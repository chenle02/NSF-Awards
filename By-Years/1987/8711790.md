The goal of this project is to provide a better understanding of the Lagrangian
residual flow generated in shallow estuaries. Particles and solutes are carried
with the Lagrandain velocity. Therefore, knowledge of the controlling mechanisms
of the Lagrandain velocity is esstenial for the prediction of salinity and
pollutant distributions. Both stratification and topography have strong effects
on the Lagrangian residual flow. Because the two-layer flow in a strongly forced
estuary is in a nearly critical (flood) or partially supercritical (ebb)
internal hydraulic state, local topographic features (e.g., bends, bars and
holes) with wave lengths of less than one tidal excursion have a strong effect
on isopycnal displacement and vertical mixing, and therefore on Lagrangian
drifts. Thus, the salinity and Lagrangian flow distribution, vertical exchange
processes and esturine topography are all closely related. This three-year
research project combines accurate, small-scale field measurements of flow over
typical topographic features with computer modeling to determine the essential
interactions. The models include turbulent mixing effects caused by stratified
boundary layers and free shear layers.
