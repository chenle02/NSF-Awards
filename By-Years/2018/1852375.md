This renewal Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site: Optics and
photonics: Technologies, Systems and Devices, hosted by New Jersey Institute of
Technology (NJIT) focuses on engaging undergraduate students from
underrepresented populations and from institutions with limited research
opportunities, such as community colleges, in research in the key emerging
topics of optics and photonics technologies, systems and devices and inspiring
them to consider continuing graduate education in electrical and computer
engineering and related areas. Optical and photonic technologies, devices and
systems are enablers for modern communication systems, sensors, computing,
healthcare systems, and environmental systems. By focusing on next generation
optical and photonics technologies and systems, this program seeks to increase
the number of students entering the workforce with skills in this area.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site offers opportunities for undergraduate
students to engage in optics and photonics research, with faculty mentors and
their research teams, during an intensive and unique 10-week summer program in
three focus areas: 1) optical communication and networking; 2) optical and
photonic devices; and 3) optical systems. The REU students' laboratory
experience will be enhanced by technical seminars and workshops on non-technical
topics, such as presentation skills and ethics. Each student will prepare a
final report and give a presentation on his or her project at the end of the
program at NJIT's International Undergraduate Summer Research
Symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
