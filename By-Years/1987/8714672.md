Univ. Colorado at Boulder Title: Polar Mesospheric Clouds and Their Atmospheric
Environment The polar mesospheric clouds are created at heights near 85km by
water vapor condensation onto ice particles. They are sometimes visible in
midsummer at high latitudes as "Noctilucent Clouds" NSF has supported since 1983
the analysis of data on these clouds obtained by Dr Thomas and his team from the
Solar Mesosphere Explorer satellite. This continuation proposal is to study the
seasonal, latitudinal and north/south variability of cloud properties, in
comparison with a model which includes the microphysics of nucleation. The
proposed work is important for extending our understanding of the physics
involved in polar mesospheric clouds, and also of the vertical and wave motions
in the summer polar mesospheres, and of the differences between the Antarctic
and Arctic mesospheres. The PI and his associates are well qualified to carry
out the research, and their collaboration with others will enhance the results.
