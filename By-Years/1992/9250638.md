This project dramatically changes the method of instruction of the engineering
mechanics course, Dynamics, which is traditionally taught in a lecture
discussion environment, to sophomore students from several engineering
disciplines. The project's innovative learning climate will consist of a
classroom filled with NeXT computer workstations, ample desktop space, white
boards, screen projection system, and symbolic algebra packages.This highly
advanced classroom makes possible revolutionary teaching of dynamics, and in
doing so will: (1) allow a focus on problem solving rather than mathematical
gymnastics (2) allow the instructor to construct and illustrate, online and in
class, the problem analysis and set- up using symbolic algebra; (3) permit the
instructor and student to check answers to complicated problems using symbolic
algebra; (4) experience "what if" conditions to problem analysis and
instantaneously observe (graphically) the consequences of change; (5) continue
to reinforce the workstation learning approach used in the integrated freshman
curriculum and math department at Rose Hulman; (6) provide an opportunity to
present material and problem solving heretofore omitted because less class time
will be spent solving equations; (7) empower instructors with an opportunity to
expand the complexity, scope, and fidelity of dynamics problems 8) reinforce the
question of "Does the answer make sense?" afforded by faster solutions,
graphical verification, and online animation.
