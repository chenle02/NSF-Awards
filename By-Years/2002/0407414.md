The Space Science Institute (SSI) will design, develop and travel a 3,500 square
foot exhibition about the outer planets of the solar system and their
satellites, whose presence contributes to making Earth habitable. Designed
around the theme "Living With Giants," the exhibition will feature hands-on
interactive visitor experiences that describe the Solar System, engage visitors
in learning about planetary exploration, focus on the planetary science of
Saturn and its moons and provide access to current information from the Cassini-
Huygens mission to Saturn. Special attention will be given to designing "Space
for Kids," an exhibit area targeted specifically for young learners and their
families and caregivers. SSI will collaborate with leading scientists and
educators as well as NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to create education
programs and a virtual exhibit website to extend the science learning of the
exhibition.
