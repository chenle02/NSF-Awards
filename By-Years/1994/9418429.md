Abstract OPP 9418429 This award supports continuous-core and downhole logging of
the four planned Cape Roberts Project scientific drill holes. The goal of the
Project is to study the Early Tertiary and Cretaceous record of climate,
tectonics, and sea level change, and to determine the time of onset of Antarctic
glaciation. Geophysical well logs will be converted into continuous records of
variation which can be interpreted as indicating variations in mineralogy and
porosity. The detailed one-dimensional records at each hole will be integrated
with available high resolution seismic data to produce a two-dimensional
interpretation of the stratigraphy. This geophysical logging program is an
essential component of basic characterization of the drill site and is a
fundamental part of the effort to produce a stratigraphic framework for
interpretation of other scientific work on the core.
