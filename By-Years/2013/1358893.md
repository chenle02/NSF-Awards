When we open our eyes, we seem to effortlessly perceive the external world and
have the impression that our representations of the external world are highly
accurate. Yet the reality is that our perceptions of an identical event can vary
from one moment to the next and this variation is at least in part due to the
timing of stimulus arrival relative to the on-going brain waves, i.e., the
oscillation in the electrical activity of the brain. With support from the
National Science Foundation, Dr. Ro and colleagues of the City University of New
York (CUNY) will conduct a systematic series of experiments to assess the timing
of visual information processing between different regions of the brain and the
joint influence of feedforward and feedback information on visual perception.
Using converging methodological approaches that include structural and
functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), fast
signal optical imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and
psychophysical methods, this project introduces an innovative approach to the
understanding of variations in visual processing.

This research will advance our knowledge of visual perception, which in turn
will provide a solid foundation for developing better visual substitution or
rehabilitation techniques for the nearly 300 million individuals worldwide with
congenital or acquired visual processing deficits. This research will also
provide cutting-edge training opportunities in neuroscience for postdoctoral
fellows and undergraduate and graduate students, including women and
underrepresented minorities. Finally, these studies will yield a large amount of
TMS, MRI, EEG, and optical imaging data that will be available for sharing with
other researchers.
