Traditional radio transceivers are generally not able to receive and transmit on
the same frequency band because of the crosstalk between the transmitter and the
receiver circuits. Given that the received signal over the air is one million
times or more weaker than the transmitted signal, it is very difficult, if not
impossible, to detect the received signal under internal interference from the
transmitter. Thus, to avoid this interference, today's communication systems
rely on half duplex transmission, typically transmitting and receiving at
different times or in different frequency bands. The full duplex technology
developed in this project allows for transceivers to receive and transmit in the
same frequency band, at the same time, potentially doubling data rates. Given
the enormous market size of the wireless industry, combined with the pressing
need for solutions to solve the 'spectrum crunch', full duplex technology thus
offers tremendous societal and commercial impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project addresses the fundamental challenges when incorporating full duplex
radios in a cellular network to unlock the full potential of this technology.
Specifically, the project consists of three inter-related components: (i) a
radio front-end design that allows multiple antenna gains in conjunction with
full duplex operation; (ii) a smart scheduler for full duplex base stations that
coordinates the maximum set of transmissions with least mutual interference,
while maintaining fairness among the mobiles; (iii) a joint routing and
scheduling algorithm that fully utilizes full duplex enabled relay terminals.
The technologies developed span physical, medium access control, and network
layers, and jointly coordinate the air-interface and the backhaul. The theory
and algorithms will be validated by over-the-air and end-to-end experiments.
