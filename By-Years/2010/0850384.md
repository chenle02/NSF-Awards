Physics (13)

To enable students from four Bay Area community colleges to enroll at University
of California-Santa Cruz (UCSC) in physics or astronomy, the UCSC S-STEM project
is providing 21 scholarships to financially needy but academically talented
undergraduates from Cabrillo, De Anze, Foothill, and Hartnell Community
Colleges. A special course has been designed to "smooth" the transition of the
community college students into the physics program. Like the other physics and
astronomy students at UCSC, the S-STEM students are engaging in research with
departmental faculty and participating in off-campus internships at places like
NASA Ames, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and the Stanford Linear
Accelerator. A fall social features speakers from the internship sites, while
the spring social is being directed at third year and younger students to
prepare them for their senior thesis project. Additional program activities
include: 1) quarterly gatherings, 2) tutoring, 3) yearly symposium, 4) alumni
support program, and 5) job-placement program.
