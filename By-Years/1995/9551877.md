While supercomputers are ideal tools for solving computationally intensive
problems, they are usually underutilized because the scientific community has
not been formally trained and exposed to such equipment. Visualization
techniques are an effective tool in encouraging enthusiasm in future scientists
and scientific endeavors. The Departments of Computer Science, Mathematics, and
Physics are collaborating on an interdisciplinary project for high-speed
networking hardware that will integrate the computation power of the
university's two supercomputers with the visualization capabilities of existing
graphics workstations. This equipment provides the necessary means for a project
whose main objective is to give undergraduate science majors a foundation in the
use of supercomputers as a tool for modeling physical phenomena and solving
computationally intensive problems. The unique feature of the project is the
emphasis on high-speed computation combined with visualization. The availability
of both supercomputers and sophisticated graphics equipment enables students not
only to model physical phenomena, but also to visualize the phenomena, which
will lead to a greater understanding of the science involved. The target
audience of the project is the upper-class science major with minimal
programming background. The project is intended to generate interest in, and to
introduce and teach, supercomputer programming to undergraduates in scientific
disciplines. It may encourage joint faculty-student efforts through independent
studies that involve supercomputer programming and use.
