The objective of this research is the investigation of the initiation and
evolution of convection along the Dryline of Northern Texas and Southern
Oklahoma. New observations will be sought during a field experiment (COPS-91)
which will include the use and deployment of an aircraft, doppler radars,
special rawindsondes, profiles, and 15 special surface meteorological stations
supplied by NCAR. The airborne doppler radar, on the NOAA aircraft (P-3), should
provide the first assessment of mesoscale circulations normal to the Dryline.
