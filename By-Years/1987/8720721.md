Late Mesozoic orogeny created the framework of the northern Cascades of
Washington and British Columbia. The Crystalline core of the north Cascades lay
along the axis of a magmatic arc during the late cretaceous and in characterized
by deep-level plutons and schist which formed under high pressure/low
temperature conditions. However, there are several tectonic models proposed for
these rocks. This work will involve finite strain analysis, geochronology and
thermobarometry to deduce the timing, shear sense and depth during metamorphism
in order to test the various models and to develop an overall tectonic model for
the northern; Cascades during the Late Mesozoic.
