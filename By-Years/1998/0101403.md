Bellevue Community College and The Washington State Board for Community and
Technical Colleges provide professional development for secondary, post
secondary and adjunct faculty in information technology (IT) in Washington
State. The workshops build upon the programs of the Northwest Center for
Emerging Technologies (NWCET) to improve the overall level of IT instruction
through out the State. The faculty are provided the skills to effectively use
onsite, online, and distributed instructional delivery systems to make effective
use of media-based instructional resources. The professional development also
provides opportunities in the use and application of industry-identified IT
skill standards and the NWCET curriculum development kits to align curricula
with national standards. They develop the skills needed to evaluate, select and
use media-based components in standards-based courses applicable to IT
certificates and degrees. The website also provides collaborative opportunities
for faculty to update and refresh current Washington State-approved IT related
programs and identify areas for new courses. A special emphasis is on increasing
the number of IT instructors by attracting IT professionals and instructors from
related fields to increase their knowledge about pedagogy and content.
