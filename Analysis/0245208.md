The proposed project is concerned with the use of analytical tools to understand
the qualitative behavior of nonlinear partial differential equations arising in
both differential geometry and mathematical physics. For example, we intend to
study harmonic maps from higher dimensional Riemannian manifolds into general
target manifolds. We also plan to study nonlinear wave equations, using methods
from harmonic analysis as well as vector field methods originating in
differential geometry. In addition, we aim for a general convergence result for
the Yamabe flow in conformal geometry. All known results in this direction
either assume the manifold to be locally conformally flat (such as the work of
R. Ye), or they require a rather restrictive bound on the initial energy (such
as the recent work of M. Struwe and H. Schwetlick). It is known that shortly
before a singularity the solution must look like a superposition of "peak
solutions", whose asymptotic profile is explicitly known. A careful analysis of
the interaction between different peaks suggests that it costs energy to make
the peak higher, i.e. to concentrate the energy on a smaller region. Since the
evolution equation is designed to decrease the energy, this indicates that no
singularities should form. While the result is known for initial energy less
than two peaks, the general case offers a more interesting picture.

The questions to be studied in this project are mainly motivated by differential
geometry. However, it may seem surprising that many of these equations also play
an important role in applied sciences. For example, harmonic maps into the two-
dimensional sphere are closely related to the Landau-Lifschitz equation for a
macroscopic ferromagnetic continuum. Moreover, the Yamabe flow in conformal
geometry can be reduced to the fast diffusion case of the porous medium
equation. In the case of positive scalar curvature, the effect of the reaction
term is opposed to that of the diffusion term, and it is a non-trivial issue to
decide which of these effects will prevail.
