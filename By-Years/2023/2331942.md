More and more, brain injury is studied in unconventional model animals because
of their unique evolutionary adaptations to protect their brain when performing
extreme behaviors. This proposal supports a symposium presented at the
International Congress of Vertebrate Morphology (ICVM), aiming to unite a
majority of underrepresented, early-career scientists in presenting their newest
findings related to brain damage in non-model animal species for the first time.
The proposed presentations showcase state-of-the-art brain injury research on
charismatic species native to the US, including whales, woodpeckers, bighorn
sheep, and mangrove fish. The main goal of this symposium is to increase our
understanding of brain injury occurrence in nature, alongside related chronic
conditions that are found in both human and non-human animals but remain
severely understudied in the basic sciences.

Certain animal species possess unique evolutionary adaptations for brain
protection. This symposium supported by this proposal presents approaches that
include studying the impact of underwater sound on cetacean brains, the
biomechanics of woodpecker drumming, the neurodegenerative effects of
headbutting in bighorn sheep, and the effects of self-inflicted brain injury in
mangrove rivulus fish. Furthering our understanding of naturalistic head impacts
will identify adaptations in animals evolved to mitigate a host of
neurobiological conditions. These conditions include neurodegeneration and
associated behavioral change, which routinely arise from sustaining persistent
blows to the head. The current emerging status of the field surrounding non-
model animal brain trauma lends it to highly interdisciplinary projects
combining biomechanics, vertebrate anatomy, and neuroscience, among others. This
angle of approach is unique, as most research is currently focused on the
medical applications of modeling traumatic brain injury in model species,
without considering the evolutionary implications of neurodegeneration found in
wild animals performing natural behaviors. Providing a venue for the convergence
of these ideas is a unique opportunity to advance the many fields surrounding
brain injury in a generation of enthusiastic, early-career researchers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
