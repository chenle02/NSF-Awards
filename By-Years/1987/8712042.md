The objective of this research is to investigate the mechanisms responsible for
the development of crystallographic texture in iron neodymium boron compounds
when they are processed by low temperature hot pressing. The texture will be
determined experimentally using x-ray diffraction techniques. The mechanism of
crystallographic orientation will be studied by optical microscopy, scanning
electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The pertinent
magnetic properties (e.g. magnetization, remanence, coercive field) will be
measured. The research is important to improvement of understanding of the
thermal processing of technologically important high energy permanent magnets.
The United States has been a world leader in research on permanent magnets, but
the Japanese were the world leaders in manufacturing of these materials. The
U.S. magnet manufacturers are becoming more competitive, and research such as
this is needed to continue our competitive growth. The training of students in
the area of magnetic materials is also a very important aspect of this research,
as only a few universities in the U.S. are actively training students in this
topic.
