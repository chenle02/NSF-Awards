The ability to predict soil losses by erosion is important to water resources
and environmental engineering. The objectives of this research project are to
develop a physically based numerical model of water erosion processes on a
uniform soil, to develop a methodology to incorporate the natural variability of
soil properties on a small plot, to perform a field test to examine the
variability of soil properties on a small plot and to verify the model, and to
use the model to determine whether averaged values of soil properties are
adequate to predict soil losses by erosion.
