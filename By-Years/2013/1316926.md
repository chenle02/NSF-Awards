This action funds Cory James Kleinheksel of Iowa State University to conduct a
research project in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering area
during the summer of 2013 at Seoul National University in Seoul, Korea. The
project title is Bioinformatics Big Data Workflow Processing on Heterogeneous
Computing Resources. The host scientist is Dr. Sun Kim.

Bioinformatics data is exponentially growing and is one of the dominant big data
fields. Many researchers in the field create tools and techniques to process
such data. It is common for one tool or technique to feed results into another
tool forming a workflow. This research focuses on the challenging optimization
problem to target workflow tasks to the optimal available heterogeneous
computing resources. This requires consideration for management of data movement
and computation planning to effectively utilize resources even during
communication. Bioinformatics is just one of many big data problems, but
arguably health is certainly a very important and challenging problem facing
scientists today. Research like this helps bioinformatics computations keep
swimming where they are currently facing the possibility of drowning in data as
DNA big data becomes cheaper to acquire.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
