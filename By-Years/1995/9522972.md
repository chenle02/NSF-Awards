This three-year awards will support U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in
physiology between John Trotter of the University of New Mexico and Karl Kadler
of the Wellcome Trust Cell Matrix Unit at the University of Manchester in the
United Kingdom. Other co-investigators at the University of Manchester are David
Holmes and John Chapman. The objective of the research is to determine the
molecular structure and formation of echinoderm collagen fibrils. The U.S.
investigator, through NSF-supported research, has determined the shape and
molecular structure of echinoderm fibrils. In cooperation with colelagues in the
United Kingdom, he will analyze the mass distribution of whole collagen fibrils
from three different species and determine the molecular mechanism of fibril
growth. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration knowledge and
expertise in biochemistry and in methods for isolating native collagen fibrils
from echinoderms. This is complemented by the British investigators' expertise
in biophysics and in the analysis of molecular mass distributions in collagen
fibrils using scanning transmission electron microscopy with computerized image
analysis. The results will advance our knowledge of fibril structure in
echinoderms and invertebrates. The collaboration may lay the ground work for
synthetic novel biomaterials based on collagen fibrils, which strengthen when
its structure is deformed.
