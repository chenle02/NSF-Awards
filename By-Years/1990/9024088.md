This award supports a two year project to initiate cooperative studies between
the University of Alaska and the Institute of Geology of the Yakut Science
Center, Yakutsk, USSR, on the tectonics of the northeastern USSR. This project
will study the Mesozoic to present-day tectonics of eastern Yakutia and its
implications for the evolution of the Arctic Ocean and lithospheric processes.
This will be done by examining the development of the Kolymian structural loop
and its effects on the present-day North America- Eurasia plate boundary. This
project will initially consist of studies of the paleomagnetism of Mesozoic
rocks from the Cherskii Range (central Kolymian loop) and the seismotectonics of
the northern Cherskii Range and adjacent areas. This award supports
paleomagnetic sample collection and analysis, for the initiation of a seismic
data exchange between the Yakut Science Center and the University of Alaska, and
for cooperative analysis of seismic data.
