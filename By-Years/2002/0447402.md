EAR-0447402&lt;br/&gt;Crossey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Earth &amp;
Planetary Sciences (E&amp;PS) at the University of New Mexico (UNM) has strong
research components in geochemistry, biogeochemistry, climatology,
paleoclimatology, metamorphic petrology, volcanology, mineralogy, materials, and
sedimentary geochemistry. This award will fund an Inductively Coupled Plasma -
Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) that will replace outdated instruments
and expand our capabilities in elemental analysis. The instrument will play a
major role in our graduate and undergraduate teaching and training activities.
The ICP-OES (and proposed attachments) can be used for analyzing pulverized and
digested rocks and analyzing water for a wide range of elemental concentrations.
The necessary personnel are in place and available to operate, maintain,
troubleshoot, train laboratory users, and generate accurate, reliable, and
defensible data to enhance our research programs.&lt;br/&gt; ***&lt;br/&gt;
