The principal investigators will participate with a post-doctoral fellow on the
development of models for corporate bond default. There are two general classes
of such models. In one of these, the models of "structural form," default occurs
when the value of a firm hits a lower barrier. These are intuitively appealing,
but in their pure form they suffer from the fact that default is never a
surprise. The second class of models, those of "reduced form," postulate an
exogenous event which triggers default. These have an intensity of arrival of
the default event, and the difficulty with these models is constructing this
intensity process so that the model conforms to market data. This work will
investigate the behavior of models in which the intensity process is driven by
two factors, one evolving on a fast time scale and the other on a slow time
scale. Such models are amenable to asymptotic analysis as the fast time scale
approaches infinity.

Recent years have shown that default on financial obligations is a genuine
possibility, and as a result, many financial instruments which offer some form
of protection against default have arisen. These instruments are a type of
derivative security. Pricing these instruments and managing the risk associated
with them has become a critical issue for the banks that issue and trade them. A
number of mathematical models have been developed for this purpose, and each of
them has certain drawbacks. Under this grant, the principal investigators and a
post-doctoral fellow will develop a new class of models based on a novel
approach that has proved useful in modeling other types of derivative
securities.
