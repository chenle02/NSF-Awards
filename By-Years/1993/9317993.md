9317993 Dahlquist Partial funding of the hardware needed to perform pulsed field
gradient experiments to enhance the use of nuclear magnetic resonance to study
the solution properties of proteins and nucleic acids has been requested. The
requested capability will greatly aid in 8 projects outlined in this proposal.
These include investigations of the substrate binding site of galactose oxidase,
the solution structure of the SYMBOL 101 \f "Symbol" subunit of the
mitochondrial ATP synthase, the structure of an unusual DNA binding domain found
in the project of the skn-1 gene of C. elegans, the structural basis of the
interaction of two yeast transcription factors a1 and a2, the structural changes
associated with mutations of the prosequence of the yeast carboxypeptidase and
the folding pathway of the heterodimeric bacterial luciferase. s t g ? r
