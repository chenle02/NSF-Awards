The capabilities of Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) to separate and
analyze complex chemical mixtures will be utilized in laboratory experiments for
the Honors General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Polymer Chemistry, Physical
Chemistry, Synthesis and Instrumental Analysis Laboratories. Undergraduate
Independent Study and Honor's Thesis students completing research projects in
the fields of organic, analytical, and inorganic chemistry will make extensive
use of the instrument. This ILI award, jointly supported by the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program and the USEME Division of SEE, will help the Department
of Chemistry at the University of South Dakota to acquire a GC/MS that will be
used to enhance undergraduate laboratory instruction in this RUI Department.
