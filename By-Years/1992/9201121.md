The birth of an industry represents a period of both opportunity and
uncertainty. Frequently, the success of an infant industry depends on how
quickly participants recognize that they are engaged in a common enterprise.
Once businesses become aware of their similarities, they can begin to develop
generally-accepted role structures and consensual normative outlooks. As such
behavioral models spread, the industry comes to look less like a random
collection of unrelated organizations and more like a true community. This
doctoral dissertation will investigate the role of law firms and venture capital
funds in the development of high- technology industries in Silicon Valley from
1975 to 1990. Focusing on how entrepreneurs, lawyers and venture capitalists
formulated solutions to recurrent business problems, and how such guidelines
shaped the Valley's distinctive business style and strategic outlook, a series
of semi-structured interviews with lawyers, entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists who were active in Silicon Valley during these formative years will
be conducted. Also, a set of quantitative analyses examining the effects of
various law firms and venture capitalists on the propagation of organizational
structures and strategies during this period will be performed. This project
integrates theories from the sociology of organizations and the sociology of law
in order to arrive at a better understanding of the role of corporate lawyers in
such emerging organizational communities. Silicon Valley offers a rare
opportunity to examine the mechanics of organizational birth and community
development and to link these to the activities of concrete entities struggling
to survive in a turbulent environment. This project also will provide an
excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop
independent research skills.
