The project involves ten undergraduate students in research activities of the
faculty of civil engineering during the summer of 1988. Nationwide recruitment
is undertaken with particular attention to minority students. In the recruitment
use is made of the National Consortium for Graduate Degrees for Minorities in
Engineering, Inc. which is headquartered at the university. The focus of the
project is a summer activity but continuation of the research can carry on into
the senior year or even at the graudate level.
