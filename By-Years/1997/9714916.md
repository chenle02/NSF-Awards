Continuing to use transportable, broad pass-band, Fabry-Perot spectrometers, the
investigator determines composition, temperature, winds and fluxes in planetary
thermospheres and exosphere, particularly emphasizing those regions in earth's
atmosphere. Expanding upon results obtained from previous research, he is
conducting five related projects: (1) measuring infrared neutral, metastable
helium to determine neutral temperature, neutral helium density, and neutral
winds near the earth's exobase; (2) measuring infrared OI 8446 angstrom emission
to establish a new technique for determining thermospheric at5omic oxygen
density in conjunction with adapted photoelectron models; (3) establishing a new
ground-based technique to determine the abundance of nitric oxide in the lower
thermosphere using infrared emission measurements; (4) measuring the altitude
profile of atomic hydrogen density from 350-10,000 kilometers, the effective
hydrogen temperature, and the hydrogen escape flux; and (5) searching for supra-
thermal sodium atoms and sulfur atoms in Mercury's atmosphere.
