The Denver Museum of Nature and Science is producing "Realm of the Black Hole,"
a one-hour high definition television program for the PBS science series NOVA
and "Black Hole: The Other Side of Infinity," a twenty-minute full motion
program for planetarium theaters. Both of these media products will draw upon a
large-scale visualization effort conducted by leading scientists in
collaboration with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. The
shows will examine the broad revolution now taking place in high-energy
astrophysics by using scientific simulations and data-based animations to
illustrate the life cycle of stars and the birth of galaxies. The two
presentations will be supported by a website designed for use by the general
public and by outreach materials and resources for teachers and informal
educators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The media production will be under the
direction of Thomas Lucas, President of Thomas Lucas Productions, Inc., and co-
produced by Donna Cox, Professor, School of Art &amp; Design, University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Paula Apsell will be the Executive Producer for
the NOVA program and Joslyn Schoemer will be Executive Producer for the
planetarium show. The Science Advisors include Roger Blandford, Professor,
Theoretical Astrophysics, California Institute of Technology; Laura Danly, Space
Science Curator, Denver Museum of Nature and Science; Michael Norman, Professor,
Astrophysics, University of California, San Diego; Harvey Tannanbaum, Director,
Chandra X-Ray Center at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; and David
Thompson, Astrophysicist, Laboratory for High Energy Astrophysics, NASA Goddard
Space Flight Center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
