Nayakkankuppam This project, which lies at the interface of optimization theory,
numerical analysis and parallel scientific computing, focuses on the design,
analysis and implementation of novel algorithms for large-scale semidefinite
programming. A growing number of applications (for example, structural design,
communication networks, combinatorial optimization, quantum chemistry, VLSI
design) give rise to very large-scale problems well beyond the capabilities of
the interior-point algorithms currently in use. The investigator studies (a)
quasi-Newton techniques in first and second order subgradient bundle methods,
and (b) parallel variable distribution in interior-point and subgradient bundle
methods. The goals of the project are three-fold: (i) to develop convergence
theories for these new classes of algorithms, (ii) to develop fast, reliable and
parallel software implementations, and (iii) to apply these algorithms and codes
to specific problems in quantum chemistry and numerical linear algebra. The
educational plan, integrated with the research goals of the project, includes
(i) the development of new graduate curricula in parallel computing, numerical
optimization and convex programming designed to train graduate students to
participate in, and contribute to, the research program; (ii) a revision of
undergraduate curricula in linear and nonlinear programming to include
significant modeling and computational components. Due to the wide-ranging
applicability of semidefinite programming, the tools and techniques developed in
this project can directly benefit society by providing improved, cost-effective
solutions to a variety of engineering design problems. The specific problems
targeted in numerical linear algebra are relevant to aerospace applications,
while the problems in quantum chemistry are of a fundamental nature with
potential technological impact in, for example, semiconductor design, magnetic
storage media, rational drug design, etc. The outreach activities of the project
promote synergistic collaborations with a national lab and industry. The
educational plan enriches special UMBC programs targeted at educating minorities
and historically underrepresented groups.
