This grant supports the acquisition of a Raman spectrometer dedicated to the
analysis of vibrational properties of Earth Materials. It will be used to
investigate the properties of hydrous minerals, melts, and fluids at high
pressures and temperatures relevant for subduction zone
conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Raman spectrometer will be housed in the
Earth Materials Laboratory, Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences
at Florida State University. The instrument will benefit students by
facilitating their training in vibrational spectroscopic methods as applied to
high-pressure mineral physics research. It will therefore support future
scientific workforce needs. The Raman spectrometer will also be open to use by
faculty members and researchers across other departments at FSU as well as
visiting scientists from other universities. The instrument will also be used
for local K-12 outreach. The expected benefits are closely aligned with NSF's
mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national welfare
through student training in analytical techniques in geoscience, mineral
physics, and soild-state physics &amp; chemistry.
