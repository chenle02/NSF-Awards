Seawater circulates through the ocean crust and interacts with minerals there
and leaves chlorine (Cl) and fluorine (F) behind. This is known from minerals
that have been recovered from the ocean floor. The amount of Cl and F that is
taken up by minerals is probably related to the conditions within the sea floor,
yet the relationship between these conditions, such as temperature and the
abundance of Cl and F in the fluid, and the amount of Cl and F deposited in the
minerals is not known. The investigators plan to use laboratory experiments to
determine how temperature and other conditions control Cl and F in minerals.
These data can then be used to interpret the conditions of the formation of the
ocean crust.
