A grant has been awarded to the University of Arizona to develop a computer
program to use a new and novel way of aligning protein sequences, especially
those of whole genomes. The program will focus on two of the most daunting
issues in aligning gene sequences: very specifically aligning small areas of
protein sequences and less specifically but very defensibly aligning many
sequences together. The proposal is to develop a robust and integrated suite of
open-source tools to do both local and multiple alignments using a computer
science technique that is novel in this arena and that yields exact algorithms
guaranteed to find optimal solutions. The resulting algorithms will be carefully
tested using both real data with published benchmarks and simulated data with
known optimal alignments.
