Abstract: 0413214. Alan L. Yuille.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal will
develop a computational framework for parsing images. Image parsing subsumes
many standard computer vision tasks such as object detection and image
segmentation. The approach is based on Bayesian inference using the Data Driven
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DDMCMC) algorithm. It involves modeling the diverse
visual patterns that occur in natural images by hierarchical generative models.
It also requires an algorithm, DDMCMC, that is capable of performing inference
on these models. The design principle of DDMCMC is to use discriminative models
to guide the search through the parameters of the generative models. Specific
applications of image parsing include the development of computer vision systems
to help the visually disabled by detecting and reading text, and detecting other
salient objects such as faces. Hence we except this work to have broad impact in
helping the visually disabled. Other applications include context based image
retrieval and automatic security systems. The work will also help train 2-3
graduate students in Computer Science and Statistics.&lt;br/&gt;
