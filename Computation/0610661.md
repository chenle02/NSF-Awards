The proposed reserch develops and analyzes efficient numerical methods for time-
harmonic acoustic wave propagation problems in fluids and solids. Particularly,
exterior two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems for acoustic scattering
in inhomogenous media and fluid-structure scattering are considered. The
discretization of the governing PDE models is performed using finite elements on
orthogonal rectangular meshes with local adaptation to boundaries and
interfaces. Special phase error reducing low-order finite elements are studied
and employed. The aim is to solve three-dimensional time-harmonic wave
propagation problems in which the diameter of the computational domain is from
tens to hundreds wavelengths. These problems lead to very large systems of
linear equations which can have from millions to several billions unknowns.
Numerical methods for this frequency range are under active research, and no
efficient method still seem to exist. The large scale linear systems are solved
iteratively with a Schwarz-type domain decomposition preconditioner. Very
efficient subdomain preconditioners are constructed using fast direct solvers by
means of domain embedding. This novelty makes the proposed approach very fast.
The conditioning of preconditioned systems are analyzed for suitable model
problems. The resulting methods are constructed in such a way that the
iterations can be carried out on a small sparse subspace related to the
interfaces.

The studied scattering problems arise routinely in many disciplines. Due to
limitations of contemporary methods and computational resources many of these
problems cannot be solved in practice. The aim of this research is to develop
numerical methods which enable the solution of many of these large problems. The
first class of studied model problems are acoustical geological surveys employed
in oil exploration. Currently it is necessary to use crude methods for surveys
which are in many cases inaccurate. The developed methods can eventually lead to
improved yield in the extraction of oil and reduced environmental impact. The
second class of model problems describe scattering by elastic objects like mines
in seabed. Mines have been the single largest cause of fatalities in naval
warfare. This part of the research is conducted in cooperation with researchers
at a Navy research center and it is closely related to a project funded by the
Office of Naval Research. A broader goal of this activity is develop
computational methods which help to enhance the detection and identification
capabilities of mines in seabed.
