Professor Paul W. Bohn and Dr. Carlyle B. Storm are funded through the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry program to help fund the 2001 Gordon Conference
on Analytical Chemistry. This conference is focused on chemical analysis and
materials chemistry. The program aims to draw together leading scientists in
both fields with young scientists and those from underrepresented groups to
discuss how analytical methods can solve problems in materials science. The
meeting is to be held in June 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
