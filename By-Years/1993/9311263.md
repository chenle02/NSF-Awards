9311263 TINDALE Primary production and the vertical flux of particles in the
ocean appear to be linked to changing atmospheric conditions, and in the case of
the Arabian Sea these changing conditions include variations in he flux of dust
from land. As part of the Arabian Sea Process Study this team of investigators
will measure changes in the atmospheric concentrations and flux of dust over the
Arabian Sea during several cruises. While at sea they will also estimate the
solubility of aerosol trace metals, notably iron, in seawater and study of the
effects on primary production. By coupling these field observations with the
data of other investigators (sediment trap studies and satellite reconnaissance)
the investigators expect to extrapolate their results to longer periods of time
and regionally over the Arabian Sea region.
