Proposal: DMS-0072356 PI: Jerzy Dydak

The principal investigator plans to work on a general theory of dimension called
the extension dimension. In this theory, dim(X) is not a natural number.
Instead, dim(X) is a CW complex and dim(X) being at most K means that K is an
absolute extensor of X. In particular, dim(X) being at most the n-sphere is
equivalent to the covering dimension of X being at most n. dim(X)=K means that K
is minimal with respect to all L such that dim(X) is at most L. It turns out
that infinite symmetric products play a crucial role in the whole theory. Their
properties lead to a natural algebra with self-duality. That self-duality is an
algebraic manifestation of the geometric duality between compact spaces and CW
complexes. All infinite symmetric products equivalent to compact or finite-
dimensional CW complexes are classified.

In classical dimension theory one tries to attach a natural number n (or
infinity) to every space. It turns out that the natural number n is simply a
substitute for the n-sphere and saying that dim(X) is at most n reflects a
certain relationship between the space X and the n-sphere. One can generalize
the notion of dimension by considering the same relationship between the space X
and a polyhedron K and that is stated as "dimension of X is at most K". For
example, one can investigate if the dimension of X is at most the projective
plane. It turns out that the dimension theory constructed that way is much
closely connected to the mainstream of topology. In particular, one gets links
to homological algebra and algebraic topology. One of the most interesting
aspects of that theory is duality, a fundamental idea in the whole of
mathematics. At the simplest level it means that not only are we trying to
attach dimension (a polyhedron) to a space, but also we attach a space to a
dimension.
