This award provides support for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers
to participate in the 26th International Conference on Ultra-relativistic
Collisions (Quark Matter 2017), which is designed to bring together theoretical
and experimental physicists from around the world to discuss new developments in
high energy heavy ion physics as well as developments in understanding strongly
interacting matter at extreme conditions. The conference will provide valuable
opportunities for early career scientists to present their own research and to
interact with leaders in the field. This conference will be held in Chicago,
Illinois February 5 - 11, 2017. The organizers of the conference will use
accepted best practices to increase diversity.
