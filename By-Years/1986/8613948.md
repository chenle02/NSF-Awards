All aerobic organisms use oxygen and require respiratory proteins to carry out
its binding, storage and transport. Respiratory proteins may be hemoglobins,
hemerythrins or hemocyanins, each of which have different oxygen binding sites.
A definition of the molecular basis of their activity is highly relevant to many
key biological processes. Dr. Stern's broad objective is to continue the
analysis of the involvement of nonheme iron in various metalloproteins using
X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS). The major thrust of the
research will be to develop the physical and chemical basis of the biological
functions and reactivities of these metal ion containing systems. The work is
both innovative and sound and has the potential of yielding significant new
results.
