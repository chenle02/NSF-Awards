The geometric approach to mechanics serves as the theoretical underpinning of
innovative control methodologies in geometric control theory. These techniques
allow the attitude of satellites to be controlled using changes in shape, as
opposed to chemical propulsion, and are the basis for understanding the ability
of a falling cat to always land on its feet, even when released in an inverted
orientation. Computational geometric mechanics aims to leverage novel discrete
differential geometric tools and discrete analogues of Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian mechanics to systematically discretize the geometric approach to
mechanics, while preserving geometric structure at a discrete level, thereby
providing an efficient method of obtaining qualitatively accurate simulations
over long times. The goal of this project is to continue the development of
computational geometric mechanics and to apply it to geometric control theory,
which will yield numerical implementations of control algorithms that exhibit
good long-time behavior.

This research will provide rational design principles for the construction of
accurate and efficient real-time automatic control of modern engineering
systems, such as robotic arms, spacecraft, and underwater vehicles. This is
particularly important, due to the trend towards autonomous space and underwater
vehicle missions with long deployment times and low energy propulsion systems,
wherein accurate control algorithms are necessary to maximize the operational
lifespan and range of these missions. Such missions will serve as the backbone
of distributed space and underwater sensor networks that will enable us to
continually monitor our oceans, environment, and climate.
