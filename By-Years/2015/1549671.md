This research examines the technology challenges with providing services to pop-
up cities. Pop-up cities are locations where the population expands very rapidly
by an order of magnitude or more in a very short time. One of these examples is
provided by the Kumbh Mela in India. This event is expected to attract 30
million pilgrims to the city of Nashik, India in late summer and early fall
2015. This proposal is a RAPID and is designed to collect data on crowd and
service needs for a pop-up city. The information will relate to crowd dynamics
and infrastructure needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal offers the
opportunity to collect huge amounts of data that can be used for analyzing
infrastructure and services needs due to emergent pop-up cities. The data is
time perishable and can only be collected when the event is in progress. The
data can be mined to enable the understanding of requirements for smart and
connected communities when a rapid community growth occurs over a short but
extended period. The research will provide insights into how much infrastructure
needs to be built-up well in advance (for example supporting Olympic Events or
similar large gatherings) and how much can be created just in time. It will help
identify service needs spanning many of the technologies needed by smart and
connected communities.
