Rallis This award supports the research of Professor S. Rallis to work in
automorphic functions. He intends to work on applications of the trace formula
to special values of L-functions. He also intends to study dual reductive pairs
in exceptional groups. Modular forms arose out of Non-Euclidean geometry in the
middle of the nineteenth century. Both mathematicians and physicists have thus
long realized that many objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in
their basic nature. This field is principally concerned with questions about the
whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to
its historical roots and thus to problems in areas as diverse as gauge theory in
theoretical physics and coding theory in information theory. ***
