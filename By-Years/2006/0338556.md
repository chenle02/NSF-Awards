IBN 0338556 NIH/NSF Human Brain Project PI: Ascoli, Giorgio Generation and
Description of Dendritic Morphology

The overall goal of this project is to provide a framework for the complete and
compact description of dendritic morphology. The central idea is to define
algorithms that extract statistical measures from experimental microscopic
reconstructions and use these distributions to stochastically generate virtual
neurons. If the synthetic neurons ate statistically indistinguishable from the
real counterparts, the algorithms and their parameters constitute ac acceptable
and complete description. If the algorithmic parameters correspond to simple
physical observables (e.g. branch diameter and length) the description is
intuitively accessible and may provide insights as to the mechanistic and
developmental processes that lead to mature dendritic morphology. The goal of
this continuing research proposal is to add system-level and subcellular-level
anatomical and biophysical components to the morphological description, and to
expand, improve, and distribute the experimental data, models, and the
simulation and analysis of software tools.
