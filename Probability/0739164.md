This project will support research on probability problems that arise from a
wide variety of fields. Topics from genetics include regulatory sequence
evolution, gene duplication, and the analysis of data generated by cancer genome
projects. In finance, understanding bubbles in markets, swing options, and
credit risk associated with subprime mortgages require sophisticated
mathematical ideas from control theory, backward stochastic differential
equations, and enlargement of filtration. The study of financial markets,
insurance risk, and communication and computer networks lead to stochastic
models that exhibit long range dependence and heavy tails. The analysis of these
processes and the new phenomena they present, involves techniques much different
from the classical theory of independent random variables, making use of ideas
from a wide variety of sources including ergodic theory. In addition, there is a
fertile interaction between probability and a variety of topics that arise from
algebra, geometry, and analysis, including the use of analytic techniques to
study convergence rates of Markov chains.

Probability theory, born in the analysis of gambling games, now plays an
important role in biology, physics, economics, finance, insurance, communication
networks, and in many topics within mathematics. The main aim of this proposal
is to train more researchers in probability to tackle the many important
problems that arise from its applications. Cornell is an ideal place for these
activities because of the strong traditions of research in probability and
interdisciplinary work in applied mathematics. Support for summer research
projects will show undergraduates that probability is an interesting research
area with many important applications. At the graduate level, increased
fellowship support will enhance the training of our Ph.D. students. Postdoctoral
positions will help new graduates expand their horizons, while hot topics
conferences and annual summer schools will be a national resource for broadening
the education of researchers (young and old). In all of these activities, the
focus will be on developing theory to treat problems that arise from
applications.
