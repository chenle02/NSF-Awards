The CSULA Department of Physics has initiated a new approach to upper-division
laboratory instruction by developing an integrated sequence of four courses. The
key feature of this program is that the students utilize skills learned in
computer interfacing and experimental methods to design and assemble the
apparatus they will use for a final independent experiment on the optical
properties of thin film semiconductors. Our goal is that each undergraduate
develops laboratory literacy in the skills that they will need in order to be
able to work independently on research projects in either industry or graduate
school. This project provides equipment for a major experiment in this program.
Interfacing equipment such as stepper motor controllers, IEEE and A/D converters
allow students in the first two courses to determine experimental parameters and
design control and acquisition programs. The spectrometer, power supplies, lock-
in amplifiers and deposition rate monitor allow students in the following two
courses optically to analyze thin film semiconductor samples using the data
control and analysis systems determined in the first courses. A previous pilot
project has indicated the potential success of this method.
