9628693 Banerjee This grant provides $824,994 as continued support for the
Institute for Rock Magnetism (IRM) at the University of Minnesota. Current
facility support through the EAR/IF program (EAR-9304363) will expire in early
FY 97 and this grant will provide an additional three years of support at an
annual level of approximately $275,000, which will primarily be used as salary
support for IRM personnel including 5 senior personnel, support of a post
doctoral researcher and modest equipment upgrades including upgrade of their
superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM), Mossbauer spectrometer, Kappa
susceptibility bridge and a magnetic force microscope (MFM). Funds will also
cover travel expenses associated with their visiting fellows program and their
advisory committee and materials and supplies associated with the production and
distribution of their quarterly newsletter and basic operations of this
facility. The IRM has, over the last six years under support from the EAR/IF
program, established a facility of state-of-the-art equipment used to advance
our knowledge of basic and applied rock magnetism, for paleomagnetic research
aimed at unraveling earth system history and climatic variability, and to gain
further insight into plate tectonic motions and the geodynamo. Specific research
has included studies of the rock magnetic properties of Chinese Loess, the rock
magnetic characterization of remagnitized Paleozoic strata in the Appalachians
and the craton interior, studies of biogenic magnetite and examination of the
fidelity of magnetic remanence. With support for EAR/IF, the IRM makes available
these instruments at no charge to the earth science community both with the U.S.
and abroad. ***
