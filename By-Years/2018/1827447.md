This award provides support for the travel and conference registration fees of
students and young investigators as participants in the 2018 Gordon Research
Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Fundamental Biotic and
Abiotic Mechanisms of Biomineralization being held in New London, New Hampshire,
July 29 - August 3, 2018. The meeting will allow young investigators to network
with establish researchers to discuss cutting edge research about new ideas and
future concepts of how to harness or mimic designs and the methods used in
nature to achieve them. This GRC in Biomineralization will focus on discussions
of a the fundamental and applied aspects of biomineralization, bringing together
chemists, physicists, biologists, geologists, medical doctors, and engineers who
would otherwise not overlap on the conference circuit, in a setting that allows
new ideas and insights to be shared and applied across interdisciplinary
boundaries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will include a broad range of
researchers, from graduate students and post-doctoral trainees to world leaders
in this area, to disseminate the latest advances and develop connections to
advance this key field of research moving forward. Award funds will be used to
support students and trainees so that they can present their research and
develop the research network necessary to advance both science and their
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
