This project concerns the geometry of infinite dimensional normed spaces. This
is a highly connected area of mathematics with, among others, connections to
physics via quantum mechanics, for example, signal processing, combinatorics and
even fundamental logical systems. In three dimensional spaces we measure
distance with a tape measure but how do you determine the distance between
various signals which are long sequences of 0's and 1's? Here different notions
enter depending upon the application and different geometries ensue. While we
mathematically model problems continuously we can only discretely approximate
things in the real world. Among other problems, this project will investigate
discrete approximation in various systems including frame theory, a recent
invention that has shown great promise in signal processing (such as how to
separate different voices in a crowd). Different geometries will be studied
through certain logical games. Combinatorial theory will be used to identify
certain nice substructures within seemingly random structures.
