9319332 ANDERSON This award supports a workshop on shallow stratigraphic
drilling on the continental margin of the Antarctic Peninsula. The workshop will
focus on identification of drilling targets for pre- Pleistocene climate and
glacial records, particularly in areas of the Weddell Sea which might yield
early Tertiary cores that would record the transition of the region from mid to
high latitudes. It will also address technical problems associated with
penetrating the cohesive Pleistocene till so that shallow drilling on the
continental margin can reach older stratigraphic records. This is a major
technical problem that limits or prevents recovery of stratigraphic records by
pistons cores. Resolution of this technical problem is very important to the
acquisition of better and more complete records of the climatic and glacial
history of the Antarctic. ***
