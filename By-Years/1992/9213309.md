There is no doubt that the pace of species extinction caused by human activity
is brisk and alarming. While this process cannot reasonably be expected to stop
completely, one can still have the goal to at least preserve the most valuable
species. In order to do this, there must be some idea in the minds of citizens
about the determinants of a specie's value. For example, to what extent are the
attributes of a specie such as location, uniqueness, and intelligence important?
Can people make tradeoffs among different species that vary on a number of
important attributes? Are they willing to do so? Can people's preferences for
species be translated into dollar values that can be used to inform public
policy? The purpose of this research is to address these questions. Since the
perceived importance of biodiversity and species preservation is substantially
driven by non-use values, observation of market behavior is precluded and survey
research methods are required. The first phase of the study uses in-depth
interviews and laboratory experiments to thoroughly study people's mental models
of the species domain. The survey instrument will be refined in the second phase
and the survey will be administered to a national sample in the third and final
phase of the research. Whereas the first phase will provide valuable insights
into the cognitive processes underlying the construction of preferences in an
important and unfamiliar domain, the survey results will provide policy makers
with quantitative and defensible estimates of the public's values for ecosystems
and species preservation.
