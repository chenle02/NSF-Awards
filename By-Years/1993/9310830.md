Funded under an Engineering Research Equipment Grant, a CCD (Charged-Coupled
Devices) camera will be added to the instrumentation capability of the
Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at the PI's institution. It will
be used for several research projects, including in particular research on the
turbulent structure of high Mach number shear and mixing layers. The projects
have relevance to propulsion of high speed vehicles, with impact on both
efficiency and pollutant emission through improved understanding of turbulent
mixing.
