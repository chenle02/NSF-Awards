Salicylic acid (SA) is a signaling molecule in the plant immune system. SA
accumulates following pathogen invasion, triggering activation of the
transcription regulator NPR1, which in turn induces resistance to a broad
spectrum of pathogens. SA and its analogues have been used in agriculture to
protect crop plants from pathogen infection. However, continuous spraying of
plants with SA or an analogue, or constitutive accumulation of elevated levels
of SA in plants, leads to growth retardation and reduced seed yield, suggesting
that high levels of SA stress plants. The focus of this project is to understand
the nature of SA stress by identifying components of the SA-stress signaling
pathway using a combination of genetic, molecular biological, and biochemical
approaches. The project is expected to provide a better understanding of SA
stress, which will help minimize the detrimental effect of SA on crops when
utilized to activate resistance in agriculture. It is expected that results from
the project will further promote the usage of SA in agriculture for increasing
plant resistance to pathogens, reducing the use of pesticides for controlling
plant disease. This project will support the development of next generation of
scientists by training postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate researchers in
the areas of plant genetics, plant pathology, molecular biology, and
biochemistry. The project will also support workshops to train middle school and
high school science teachers from schools with large numbers of underrepresented
minority students.
