9700387 Dargush The main objective of this work is to develop an active
aerodynamic control system to mitigate vibrations in both the along and the
across wind directions for tall, slender structures subjected to strong wind
loads. The control system will use the energy of wind flows to supplement its
power requirements. Five tasks will be undertaken: experimental wind tunnel
studies on cross section models; modeling using single degree of freedom and
coupled wake-body formulations; continuum modeling based on boundary element
formulations; development of a control algorithm for parametrically excited
systems; and assessment of full -scale performance potential. The results from
this work will help improving, among others, the performance of tall structures
located in sites where wind hazards are common, will enhance the understanding
of controlling bluff body vortex shedding, as well as noise and vibration. ***
