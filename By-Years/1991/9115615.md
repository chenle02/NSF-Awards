In this project funded by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of
the Chemistry Division, Singer will perform mixed quantum/classical theoretical
calculations on three systems of fundamental scientific interest and
technological relevance: (1) the hydrated proton, (2) the catalytic site of
zeolite, and (3) metal/rare gas clusters. He will also explore new theoretical
methods for a simulated annealing treatment of many-electron solutes and
electron- solvent pseudopotentials. %%% Many chemical processes, including those
of living organisms, occur in water solution. Singer's work on the hydrated
proton will pave the way for treating proton exchange reactions of such systems.
His work on zeolites deals with the active site of a class of catalysts of vital
importance in the petroleum industry. The new theoretical methods he seeks will
be of value in future studies of chemical processes in solution.
