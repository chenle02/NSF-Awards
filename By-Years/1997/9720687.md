9720687 Edelson The WorldWatcher curriculum consists of two semester-long
units; each unit includes learning activities, teacher support materials,
science content materials, software and libraries of data. The materials are
inquiry-based science learning curricula based on the themes of global change
and biodiversity that make integrated and extensive use of scientific
visualization and data analysis. The curriculum takes advantage of WorldWatcher,
a scientific visualization and analysis environment for geographic data
developed specifically for educational use. The standards-based materials are
designed for use in a variety of 8-12 grade courses including earth science,
environmental science, biology, physics and chemistry. The materials contain
explicit support for teachers on developing new approaches to pedagogy and
respect teachers' roles as local designers of curriculum, with guidance for
adapting the curriculum to local objectives and constraints.
