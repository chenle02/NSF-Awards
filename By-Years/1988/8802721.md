The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for the determination
of the molecular structure of compounds as diverse as small polypeptides and
complex metal clusters. When combined with the latest computer software, the
technique is becoming remarkably fast and easy to put into practice. The
acquisition of X-ray crystallographic instrumentation markedly improves the
ability of chemists to carry out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry
of the University of California, Davis will use this award from the Chemistry
Shared Instrumentation Program to help acquire instrumentation for X-ray crystal
structure determination. The areas of chemistry that will be enhanced by the
acquisition include the following: 1) Studies of transition metal complexes 2)
Development of crystallographic methods 3) Synthetic chemistry, immunochemistry
and plant biosynthesis 4) Synthesis, structure and coordination properties of
bidentate mesocycles 5) Synthesis and structural characterization of sigma-
bonded transition metal compounds with low oxidation states or coordination
numbers 6) Synthetic organic chemistry, mechanistic and synthetic organometallic
chemistry
