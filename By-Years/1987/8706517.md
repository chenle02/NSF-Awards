The collisions between energetic atoms or atomic particles can disrupt the
atoms involved, removing their orbital electrons. The details of such
interactions will be studied in the present work, using the simplest of diatomic
atoms and projectiles. The results can be used as a guide for attempts to
calculate these interactions from first principles. The studies will then be
extended to more complex molecules. This work will aid in extending our
understanding of the basic reactions involved in atomic collisions.
