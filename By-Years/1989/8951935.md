A biochemistry laboratory will be developed as a result of a new degree program
in biochemistry. A refrigerated centrifuge and rapid electrophoresis system will
be used in a set of carefully selected experiments which will provide students
with experience in the isolation, purification, and handling of biological
macromolecules, characterization of membranes and membrane components,
applications of spectroscopy to the study of biomolecules, and the special role
of radioisotopes in biochemical experimentation. The focus of the experiments is
on physical biochemical methods useful in solving problems. The students will
receive hands-on experience with instrumentation considered essential in the
modern biochemistry research laboratory, and will be involved in original and
novel applications of instruments in the instructional laboratory. The
university will provide 50% matching funds.
