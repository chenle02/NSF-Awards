The Biometrics Unit at Cornell University will purchase a dual processor
Sparcstation20, 4 Sparcstation5's and 5 Xterminals with supporting peripherals
and software to equip a research computing facility to support research in the
mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several research projects,
including in particular: 1. Semiparametric Longitudinal Data Analysis, by Naomi
S. Altman 2. Implementing Accurate Approximations, by George Casella 3.
Statistical Problems in Molecular Biology, by Gary A. Churchill 4. Estimation in
Generalized Linear Mixed Models, by Charles E. McCulloch 5. Local Regression
Methods, by David Ruppert. All 5 projects require the use of a powerful computer
and software for computational work, simulation and symbolic algebra.
