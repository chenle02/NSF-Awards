This project uses Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) to investigate how genes
interact with one another. Flies will be selectively bred to change specific
aspects of the shape of their wings then studied to reveal how the genes
responsible for wing shape interact. First, selection to change some wing
aspects while constraining others will be conducted. Comparing the constrained
and non-constrained populations will allow estimation of genetic pleiotropy
(when single genes influence several traits). Second, experiments will
transplant genes between fly populations with different wing shapes. Comparing
the effects of these transplants will allow us to estimate the genetic epistasis
(how the effects of a particular gene depend on other genes present). Finally,
the project tests and investigates a new mathematical model of epistasis and
it's implications for evolutionary biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While
pleiotropy and epistasis are known to be common, their properties are poorly
understood. These experiments will be among the first to carefully investigate
the nature and magnitude of these genetic factors. Understanding these factors
has the potential to greatly impact all fields studying genetic interactions,
including medicine and livestock breeding. The data will be gathered largely by
undergraduate students from the ethnically and economically diverse population
of Florida State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
