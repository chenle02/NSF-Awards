Prediction from ungauged basins (PUB) is a classic unsolved problem in river
basin hydrology which has increasingly important implications for making
regional hydrologic predictions due to global climate change. The basic approach
towards a solution of this problem requires a deep understanding of empirical
and theoretical issues surrounding scaling in hydrologic fluxes, the network
geometry and their interretionships, and constitutes the main focus of the
research proposed here. The three broad but specific objectives of the proposed
research are to develop and test scaling theories of spatial variability, (i) in
hydrologic fluxes in river basins, (ii) in link based descriptions of three-
dimensional channel network geometry, and (iii) to establish and employ
appropriate data bases for a few select basins for testing theoretical
hypotheses and predictions. A portion of this total project was funded in part
for three years by NASA beginning July 1991. This is shown in Appendix IV. The
budget for NSF complements the fund provided by NASA.
