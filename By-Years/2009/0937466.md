0937466&lt;br/&gt;Gruner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). This award
from Division of Materials Research supports Cornell University to perform
accelerator and X-ray technology R&amp;D for an ultrahigh spectral brightness,
hard x-ray synchrotron radiation source based on the Energy Recovery Linac (ERL)
principle. The high coherence and temporal properties of the ERL would have
broad impact across the sciences and engineering by enabling numerous
experiments that are not feasible using current storage ring based synchrotron
sources. ERL will have transformative impact in imaging of materials and
biological structures, macromolecular structure determination of crystal
structure without crystals, and effective nano scale probes for matter at high
pressures, in glasses and disordered materials, and polycrystalline materials.
The research program addresses five critically important technology areas: (1)
Superconducting linac development; (2) High brightness photoinjector
development; (3) High brigthness electron beam physics and diagnostics; (4) Beam
dynamic effects; and (5) X-ray beamline components necessary to exploit ERL
capabilities will be developed. Technological research and development will be
preformed in collaboration with other laboratories, both in the U.S. and abroad.
A major product of this work includes the training of student and postdoctoral
fellows to meet the growing world-wide demand for accelerator physics and
beamline scientists familiar with the machines and front end challenges of new
high brightness synchrotron beams. The work includes an effective, diversity-
based, broad outreach program to the K-12 and undergraduate
communities.&lt;br/&gt;
