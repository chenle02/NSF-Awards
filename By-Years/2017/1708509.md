The automotive radar market is already a multi-billion dollar industry and is
growing rapidly. Due to its capabilities for all weather and day-and-night
operations, automotive radar can be used to provide multiple safety functions
for a vehicle. It is also a key enabling technology for autonomous driving. With
many vehicles equipped with automotive radars, however, this technology can
become the victim of its own success, due to the inevitable mutual interferences
among nearby radars. Moreover, the direct blast from the transmitter of one
radar to the receiver of another radar is much stronger than the reflected
signal from a pedestrian. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address mutual
interference problems before too many vehicles and other automobiles are
equipped with automotive radars. The goal of this project is to provide
transformative solutions that are affordable, technically feasible, easy to
apply, and consistent with the technological trends via exploiting the full
potential of spectrum sharing in the automotive radar frequency bands.

This project involves advancing fundamental knowledge in new technologies for
spectrum access in the automotive radar industry and applies engineering
principles to address the needs of future automotive radar systems, while
advancing engineering knowledge in multiple fronts. Specifically, this project
involves investigating practically feasible and flexible probing waveforms for
improved mutual interference suppression, devising advanced signal processing
algorithms for enhanced automotive radar coexistence and improved resolution,
enhancing spatial resolution and coexistence while reducing cost and power
consumption through developing one-bit automotive radar receivers, and
developing mutual cooperation strategies and signal processing algorithms by
taking advantage of vehicle-to-vehicle communications so that automotive radar
systems in close proximities can share sufficient information to form a multi-
static multiple-input multiple-output radar network.
