Two theoretical studies in equatorial dynamics are proposed here. One is to
study the inertial, friction, and beta effects on the separation and
retroflection of the North Brazil Current, the other is to show the Amazon
discharge will turn to the NW under internal dynamics. The first study is
specially important since the separation and retroflection of the NBC is
seasonal and affects substantially the heat transport into the North Atlantic.
