Investigation of the dynamics and thermodynamics of the upper atmosphere
including the mesosphere and thermosphere must be done on a global scale because
of the central importance of horizontal transport and coupling. Most of the
studies to date have focused on the Northern Hemisphere, those in the Southern
Hemisphere have been limited to Antarctica. This award is for studies of wind
circulation in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. An optical high-resolution
spectrometer will be placed and operated at the University of Canterbury's Mount
John Astronomical Observatory (in New Zealand). This international collaboration
between the University of Canterbury, Washington, and Alaska will study upper
atmospheric dynamics of the transition region between mid and high latitudes in
the Southern Hemisphere. Observations obtained will be interpreted with the aid
of simulation from NCAR time dependent coupled thermosphere and ionosphere
global circulation model (TIGCM). *** //
