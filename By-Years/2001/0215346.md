The Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system is needed to further ongoing funded
projects on dynamics and transport in unsteady flows, sedimentation processes,
and complex interfaces. The aim of these studies is to understand the
fundamental mechanisms of mixing, fate, transport, and sedimentation. This is of
importance not only from the viewpoint of basic research but also to develop
predictive tools (for example, for environmental processes) for practical
applications.

The PIV system is capable of tracking both phases (particles or passive tracers
and fluid) in real time by the use of non-intrusive optical methods to generate
2D or 3D mappings. Data analysis and quantification of the processes can be
easily performed using MATLAB software linked to the instrumentation software.
This feature makes the interface use friendly for undergraduate students.
Furthermore, the PIV system will also be able to track the motion of particles
in externally driven fluids as function of the driving frequencies. With this
unique feature it will be possible to investigate chaotic advection of particles
in real time.

The instrumentation will provide a unique opportunity to advance the ongoing
research of multiphase flow at both the experimental and theoretical levels. In
addition, as Xavier University, an historically black university, prides itself
of being the number one producer in the nation of excellent African-American
graduates in physics and physical sciences, more students will be directly
involved in research in a very important area and will have the opportunity of
using state-of-the art equipment, that will better prepare them for graduate
school and research careers.

This equipment will also have a direct educational impact as it will be used in
connection with laboratory classes and research results will be used in
curricula materials in upper level courses. Furthermore, in the future this
system can also expand the horizon of the research embraced by faculty in areas
of technological relevance for multiphase flows. Other researchers and
collaborators in the New Orleans area will benefit from this system as well.
