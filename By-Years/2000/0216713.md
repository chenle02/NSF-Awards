This IMR award provides Northwestern University with funds for the acquisition
of a cluster of SMTP servers, having a 64-bit operating system, with a large
memory subsystem and with Myrinet (medium speed) interconnects. This cluster
will be used for computational chemistry and materials science research at
Northwestern University, particularly applications in electronic structure, in
computational electromagnetics, and in Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics
calculations where large memory capabilities are essential. Distributed parallel
applications will also be emphasized. The cluster will also be used in graduate
and undergraduate courses in engineering and sciences, and in REU, REST, MRSEC
and other initiatives which use software that require large memory
capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This IMR award provides Northwestern
University with funds for the acquisition of a cluster of computers that will be
used for computational materials research in chemistry and engineering, and for
related educational programs. The computers in this cluster will have
specialized performance characteristics which make it possible to run programs
that require an exceptionally large amount of computer memory, and which in
addition allow for several computers to run in parallel on the same program.
Research applications to be considered include the modeling of a wide range of
properties of materials, including structures, energies, interaction with light,
motions of atoms, making films and patterns, and thermal properties. The
computer cluster will be used in a wide variety of educational programs,
including computational modeling courses, laboratories and summer research
programs.&lt;br/&gt;
