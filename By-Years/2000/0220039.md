&lt;br/&gt;ITR: Information Representation for Cooperation Across
Networks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We define cooperation among the nodes of a network
to include any activity &lt;br/&gt;where the action of a single individual
relies on information from other &lt;br/&gt;individuals in a shared environment.
Using this broad definition, &lt;br/&gt;information aggregation in sensor
networks, group activities performed by &lt;br/&gt;autonomous robotic devices,
internet exploration and modeling, and &lt;br/&gt;establishment of ad hoc
networks are all examples of tasks involving &lt;br/&gt;cooperation among the
nodes of a network. An essential feature common to &lt;br/&gt;cooperative tasks
is the need to share information across a distributed &lt;br/&gt;system. Thus
cooperation requires the flow of information. In environments &lt;br/&gt;limited
by constraints on power, bandwidth, time, or memory, efficient
&lt;br/&gt;information flow requires efficient data representation. We are
currently &lt;br/&gt;studying strategies for efficient information
representation in network &lt;br/&gt;systems. When we speak of information
representation for a network, &lt;br/&gt;we consider the network as a whole,
asking questions about where information &lt;br/&gt;resides in the network,
where it is needed, and how to most efficiently &lt;br/&gt;represent the
information to make it accessible where it is needed. &lt;br/&gt;Current topics
of investigation include network data compression, functional &lt;br/&gt;source
coding for networks, and joint source-channel coding for networks.
