This award supports the development and testing of a analytical procedures for
small (<1 um) particulate nitrogen samples. These techniques will then be used
to assess the role of bacteria in the nitrogen uptake measured in the euphotic
zone. The field component of this project will be done in the context of an
international oceanographic project with the Norwegians (Pro Mare). The
activities of the various microorganisms in surface ocean waters differ greatly.
This work will help clarify the specific roles of the bacteria in the
utilization of dissolved nitrogen compounds that are nutrients for biological
productivity in the sea.
