Tectonic studies of the eastern United States have revealed that the region has
formed due the collision of large crustal scale fragments in Paleozoic time. An
essential aspect to understanding this global process is the determination of
the time of collision and the conditions under which such an amalgamation took
place. The Bronson Hill Anticlinorium of western New Hampshire is thought to
represent one these crustal-scale fragments. Coupling field studies with
laboratory analysis, this project will determine the pressure-temperature time
history of rocks of the Bronson Hill area. Results will have important
implications for the development of New England as well as establishing
temperature and pressure constraints for continental collision processes.
