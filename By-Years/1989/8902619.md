William Goldman plans to continue his investigation into the deformation theory
of discrete groups and geometric structures. This investigation is currently
divided into five (closely related) topics: 1) the deformation theory of flat
bundles over Kahler manifolds, and relations with symplectic geometry, 2) real
projective structures on surfaces, 3) affinely flat manifolds, including flat
Lorentz manifolds, 4) the deformation space of flat PSL(2,R)-bundles over
surfaces, relations with (possibly singular) geometric structures, and 5)
complex hyperbolic Kleinian groups. Goldman and his students have developed
graphics software particularly suited to their problems to run on a SUN work-
station, and more will be done along these lines also.
