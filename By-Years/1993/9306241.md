This is a ROW Career Advancement Award. The goal of this research is to study
the role of cyclic AMP (CAMP) in regulating intracellular communication during
growth, differentiation and regression of corpora lutea. The immediate
objectives are to study (1) ontogeny of contact-dependent intercellular
communication among luteal cell types, and (2) effects of regulators of CAMP
(e.g. luteinizing hormone, forskolin) on intracellular concentrations of CAMP
and contact-dependent intercellular communication in selected luteal cells
during luteal growth, differentiation and regression. %%% This is a Career
Advancement Award which is one of the Research Opportunities for Women
activities of the National Science Foundation. The main research interest of the
awardee is the regulation of the function the corpus luteum of domestic animals,
with emphasis on interactions among luteal cells during luteal growth,
development, and regression. This is an important problem in reproductive
physiology. This award will contribute to the advancement of the awardee's
scientific career as well as to basic knowledge of the reproductive biology of
domestic animals.
