9451880 Dawley Computer will be used in creating introductory biology
laboratories that foster scientific thinking among students by encouraging
creativity, communication, and teamwork. As important as it is to give
introductory students an experimental, instrument-rich laboratory experience,
this experience will be empty if it emphasizes cookbook technique at the expense
of scientific creativity. Here we propose using computers specifically to
nurture scientific creativity in our students by giving them flexibility in
experimental design, encouraging teamwork, and making it possible for them to
communicate with a wide circle of their peers. These laboratories will foster
creativity by requiring student teams of four to design experiments in multi-
week, open-ended exercises. Each team will have its own laboratory bench
equipped with a Macintosh computer linked to a local area network and to the
Internet. Computers will be used to give students a wider range of options in
creating their experimental designs and to increase their flexibility in asking
the question "What if we try it this way?" The software we propose using is
sufficiently versatile and general that it encourages students to explore
different experimental approaches without dictating a particular design. Ideas,
initially developed within student teams, will be exchanged among teams using
the local network and computer-based oral presentations.
