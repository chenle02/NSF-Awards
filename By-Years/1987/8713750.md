This grant will provide funds toward a major upgrade of the CN electrostatic
accelerator at the University of Kentucky. Two- thirds of the cost of the
project will be borne by the state of Kentucky. The upgrade will significantly
improve the capability for nuclear physics research with pulsed neutron beams.
In addition, it will provide a reliable, modern facility for the new, applied
research programs such as the EPSCOR-funded project, "Nuclear Methods in
Chemical and Biological Sciences", being started at the laboratory. This two-
year grant is being funded jointly by the NSF Nuclear Physics and EPSCOR
Programs.
