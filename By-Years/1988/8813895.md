In a one year planning grant, Iowa State University mathematicians will revise
the engineering calculus sequence by incorporating modelling and
symbolic/graphical/numerical software into the curriculum. The planning will be
done by a committee of faculty from engineering, physical and mathematical
sciences. A calculus network of high school community college and
college/university will be established. Iowa State is similar to many
mathematics departments at large state universities in that over 90% of the
calculus students are from the client disciplines. The project will initiate
change in a deliberate and timely manner with concurrence by the client
departments. In the spring of 1989, one fourth of the first semester calculus
courses will be taught under the revised curriculum. This course will require a
small amount of programming, and will stress algorithms and sharply focused real
applications. During the summer of 1989, the second and third semesters of
calculus will be revised within the same mathematical framework. Iowa State
University is cost sharing with funding of in-kind services and indirect cost
reduction worth $52,535.
