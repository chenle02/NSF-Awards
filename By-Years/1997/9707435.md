Professor Jean Chmielewski, Department of Chemistry, Purdue University is
supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Program of the Chemistry Division
under a Career Advancement Award to enhance her research expertise in the area
structural elucidation using heteronuclear NMR techniques. The interactions
leading to the aggregation of five amphiphilic alpha helical peptides, rather
the expected four monomeric units, and the unexpected formation of a 1:1 complex
between synthetic helical peptide monomers in solution are accessible by
heteronuclear NMR. Professor Chmielewski is a highly competent PI, and a
sabbatical year spent in the laboratories of investigators at the forefront of
protein structure elucidation by heteronuclear NMR will maintain her position at
the cutting edge of the protein assembly field. Proteins and peptides are large,
flexible molecules whose properties in fluid solution are determined by the
molecular structure and aggregation of the monomeric subunits. Heteronuclear NMR
offers a means to elucidate the structure of these molecules, and to probe the
interactions resulting in aggregation of the monomeric subunits in fluid
solution. Professor Chmielewski has embarked on a successful academic career,
and expertise in heteronuclear NMR will allow her to continue a very promising
research program.
