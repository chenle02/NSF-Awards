Abstract 9316750 Engebretson This project will provide search coil
magnetometers to be installed in Antarctica in four Automatic Geophysical
Observatories (AGOs) which are being built by the British Antarctic Survey
(BAS). They will be used to study ultra low frequency (ULF) waves of
magnetospheric and ionospheric origin. In combination with manned Antarctic
stations and the AGOs being deployed by the US Antarctic Program, this new set
of magnetometers will complete a network from deep in the polar cap to
subauroral latitudes and will also provide nearly complete coverage under the
fields of view of the auroral radar at the BAS station at Halley Bay and the
soon to be installed radars at Sanae and Syowa Stations. The Halley and Sanae
radars are collaborative efforts between Johns Hopkins University, BAS and the
South African National Antarctic Expedition. The final array of AGOs will
comprise a network covering a much larger range of magnetic latitude and local
time than can ever be built on a solid surface in the Northern Hemisphere.
Augsburg College is an entirely undergraduate institution and this grant is a
Research at an Undergraduate Institution (RUI) award. ***
