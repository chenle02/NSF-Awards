This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of a modern dynamic
light-scattering spectrometer. This new instrument will be used to investigate
viscoelastic phenomena in a variety of polymeric materials in solution, in the
bulk, and in the liquid-crystalline state. The apparatus will replace old,
outdated equipment in the large center of polymer research at Case Western
University.
