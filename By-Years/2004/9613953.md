The PIs will use extensive measurements and numerical modeling to study the
generation and evolution of spread-F irregularity and scintillation phenomena,
and obtain a global semi-empirical equatorial electrodynamic and spread-F model
with predictive capabilities. Using Jicamarca incoherent radar, global ionosonde
and satellite measurements the investigators will determine the initial
electrodynamic conditions for spread-F. Their radar data set will determine the
height dependent ambient electrodynamic conditions immediately prior to the
occurrence of spread-F, the location of the initial unstable layer, and its
temporal and spatial evolution for different seasons and flux conditions. Height
gradients in the vertical and zonal plasma drifts in the bottomside and topside
of the F layer may play important roles in the generation and evolution of
equatorial spread-F. Additionally, the PIs will use extensive ionosonde and
satellite data to determine the role of meridional neutral winds and magnetic
declination effects, and extend the model to different longitudinal sectors.
Finally, they will combine the Jicamarca radar drift model, the AE-E satellite
model and ionosonde observations with the storm time electric field model at
Utah State and the GTIM to obtain the first global equatorial electrodynamic and
spread-F model.
