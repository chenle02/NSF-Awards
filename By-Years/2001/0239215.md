Protein transport across hydrophobic membranes is an essential cellular process
in all organisms. However, the way in which this process occurs remains largely
uncharacterized. Understanding the mechanism of this transport in the archaea,
organisms which comprise one of the three domains of life and are proposed to be
the closest ancestors of the eukaryotes (animals and plants, among others), may
be key in resolving some of the pertinent issues, such as the identification of
1) the mechanisms by which proteins are directed to the membrane, and 2) the
energy sources required for protein translocation. Thus, using biochemical and
molecular biological tools, researchers seek a better understanding of the
protein translocation mechanism of an archaeon that is amenable to these
studies.

An exploration of the biology of protein transport in the archaea, organisms in
which this process is still poorly understood, will shed light on novel
processes by which proteins cross archaeal membranes. However, it will also
provide new insights into previously-identified bacterial and eukaryotic protein
translocation mechanisms. For example, in eukaryotes, secreted antibodies are
essential for the defense against pathogens, while some prokaryotes secrete
toxins, which are central to their pathogenicity. Thus, the understanding gained
through these studies may allow us to modulate the secretion of pathogenic
compounds, as well as optimize defense mechanisms against them. Additionally,
this research has implications for advancements in biotechnology. Many
microorganisms secrete enzymes to scavenge extracellular molecules. A
significant number of these enzymes are extremely useful in many industrial
settings, including chemical, pharmaceutical, and agricultural industries. Thus,
understanding protein export mechanisms will help in the large-scale production
of recombinant secreted proteins of interest in the industrial sector.
