c15 23This project will create an undergraduate research effort in the colorado
Plateau and Transition Zone of Arizona that will involve students from Northern
Arizona U., Washington U., U. of Massachusetts, Colgate U and Vanderbilt U.
Students will make, compile, and interpret geologic maps within the context of a
network of ongoing collaborative research projects funded by the NSF and U. S.
Geological Survey. They will start as juniors and continue through the following
summer as seniors, with graduate students working with them as field
supervisors. It is planned that their maps will be published by the USGS or
Geological Society of America.
