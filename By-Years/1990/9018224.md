Three CAD design tools, produced in research projects at the University of
Washington, are being developed and enhanced so as to bring them into a state
for distribution to general users. These tools are: (1) MacTester, an
interactive testing and debugging environment built around the Mackintosh
computer; (2) WireC, a mixed graphical and procedural language for describing
hardware systems; and (3) Gemini, a VLSI layout verification program that
compares the circuit specification with the circuit layout. This grant is made
under the Software Capitalization Program.
