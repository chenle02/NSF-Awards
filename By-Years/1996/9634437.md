The successful federal HPCC program is in its last phase, establishing the basis
for Teraflops scale computing systems and applications. An important finding of
this historical collaborative program is that many mission critical objectives
of key Federal agencies require computing capability well beyond even that
provided by the Teraflops systems of the near future. Furthermore, the
challenges to programming and resource management of the largest contemporary
MPPs has revealed the need for alternative system structures and methodologies
if very high performance computing is to become an important and wide spread
enabler of industrial, commercial, government and science objectives. In
preparation to establishing future policy and planning directions for next
generation research programs in advanced computing, a number of Federal agencies
with compute critical requirements have joined to initiate a set of preliminary
inquires in the form of workshops, panels, and studies. This grant, made in
cooperation with ARPA, DOE, DOD, and NASA, will provide funding for two
workshops on Petaflop-scale computing. The first workshop will focus on
architectures, the second on system software issues. Both will be held in
California in summer 1996.
