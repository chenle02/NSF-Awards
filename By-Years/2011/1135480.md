In spite of the urgent need for better tools, automated, in situ methods for the
determination of the presence, abundance and activity of marine microbes are
still in the development stages. The Capillary Waveguide Biosensor (CWB) will
potentially make possible long-term, in situ, unattended detection of
microorganisms and monitoring of microbial processes. This is a renewal of the
PI?s EAGER proposal. They were able to complete two of the three tasks
originally proposed. With this addition funding they will complete the third
task, which was to optimize hybridization protocols and achieve a dynamic range
satisfactory for use in real-world studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential for training students at graduate,
undergraduate and high school levels in this project is particularly interesting
and exciting, because it will offer students the opportunities to cross-train in
microbial ecology and engineering. Also, education and training of minorities
and exposure of the general public to science are two other likely benefits of
this project. Participation of C-MORE students is great. If molecular techniques
are going to be used more frequently in the future, students are going to have
to get used to the technology.&lt;br/&gt;
