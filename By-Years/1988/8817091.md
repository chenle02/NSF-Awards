The object of the proposed research is to elucidate the mechanism responsible
for the activation of transcription at the nitrogen-regulated promoter glnAp2 of
the structural gene for glutamine synthetase in Escherichia coli. We have shown
that core RNA polymerase with sigma54, the specific o factor for nitrogen
regulated promoters, combines with glnAp2 in a closed complex. The activator
NRI, after phosphorylation by the modulator NRII stimulates the isomerization to
the open complex. We plan to separate the open complexes from other proteins and
small molecules and to probe the interaction of NRI- phosphate with the DNA of
the promoter and with sigma54. We shall also attempt to discover the mechanism
responsible for the ability of NRI to activate in intact cells the transcription
of glnAp2 in the absence of NRII by the isolation and study of mutants altered
in this ability. We shall attempt to identify the DNA sites in the vicinity of
glnAp2 that are responsible for the dampening of glnAp2 transcription by an
increased intracellular concentration of NRI.
