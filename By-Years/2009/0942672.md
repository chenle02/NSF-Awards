Microfabrication, the process of fabrication of miniature structures with
dimensions of 1micrometer or less, is a critical area to many branches of
science and engineering. Because of the growing importance of this area, there
is a need for engineers and scientists educated in microfabrication. This
technology is fundamental to modern engineering and science, and it is important
to educate students in this area from the beginning of their undergraduate
career. A substantial investment in the physical facilities was made and now the
challenge is to integrate this topic into the curriculum. This project
introduces microfabrication technology through lectures, demonstrations and even
experiments in freshman classes across several disciplines (Engineering,
Chemistry and Physics). Junior level courses from several departments integrate
a microfabrication module into the curriculum. In the students' senior year
there is an opportunity to take a multidisciplinary microfabrication capstone
course, including a complete introduction to clean room theory and practice.
Assessment is done for each level of the project, and assessment results are
used to continuously improve the course over time and gauge success in
attracting students into this area. This multidisciplinary approach demonstrates
that microfabrication is based on many disciplines and vital to most modern
technologies, including many electrical, mechanical, and chemical devices, and
others. Ultimately, this will result in graduating engineers and scientists who
know about microfabrication and understand how it fits in with modern science,
engineering and technology.
