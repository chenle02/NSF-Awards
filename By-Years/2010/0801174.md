The objective of this proposal is develop a systematic theory of commutative
algebraic invariants in operator theory, centering around the dimension
invariant and the Samuel multiplicity of a tuple of commuting operators acting
on a Hilbert space. These algebraic invariants have found applications to purely
analytic problems in operator theory including the study of Hilbert spaces of
analytic functions, and Fredholm theory. Further connection with Nevanllina-Pick
kernels will be explored in the proposed research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hilbert
space operators can be viewed as quantization of classical objects such as
holomorphic functions. Operator theory provides an infinite dimensional approach
to problems in a finite dimensional space. The subject originates from providing
a mathematical foundation to Quantum Mechanics, and has found applications in
quality control in Electrical Engineering. The proposed research will introduce
new techniques from commutative algebra, another area of mathematics, into
operator theory, hence not only enriching the subject, but also enhancing the
ties between two subjects in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;
