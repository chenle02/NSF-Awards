9313944 Hossenlopp In this project of the Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. J.M. Hossenlopp of Marquette University will
investigate the energy disposal patterns in the products of molecular
elimination reactions which occur via an asynchronous mechanism. Experiments
will be performed on a series of moderate-to-large size organic carbonyl
compounds which undergo photochemical eliminations initiated via an
intramolecular hydrogen abstraction by the carbonyl oxygen. Polyatomic
eliminiation products will be probed by high resolution spectroscopy to provide
a detailed view of the dynamics of the carbonyl photodissociation process. The
primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive framework for
interpretation of the photodissociation dynamics of the class of carbonyl
photochemical reactions known as the Norrish Type II split. %%% Unimolecular and
bimolecular reaction dynamics stand at the forefront of contemporary resarch in
physical chemistry. Among the problems considered are how do reactions proceed
along different possible and competing pathways. This research project deals
with the exploration of the reaction dynamics of polyatomic molecules and their
dissociation products produced by photochemical processes. ***
