The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project is to ultimately reduce the cost of manufacturing of high-performance
optical filters, a key component in many emerging technologies. The cost can be
reduced by over 10x at high volumes. This will enable widespread use of many
devices, such as medical diagnostic tools, sensors for robotic systems, and
other applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project eliminates the
capital-intensive vacuum coating process from high-performance optical filter
production and replaces it with the more scalable process of thermal drawing
(resembling optical fiber drawing) for the filters supported by the thermal
drawing process. To this end, the proposed project will: design and build
precision equipment; improve the precision of a prototype process; and
demonstrate industry-standard filter quality. The thermo-fluidic aspects of the
process will be optimized for production quality at relevant
sizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
