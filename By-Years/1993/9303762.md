One technique for achieving exceptional selectivity in the membrane gas
separation of small molecules such as N2, H2, O2, CH4, and CO is to tailor the
pore size of the membrane so that only the desired molecules can fit through the
pores. Since molecules such as N2, H2, and CO have diameters in the range of
from 3-to-6 A, it is necessary to make membranes with pore sizes, which can be
adjusted to a desired value within this range. To achieve this goal, this
research suggests a unique approach to making and tailoring the pore size of
microporous inorganic membranes. The starting material for the membrane is
inexpensive Vycor glass, whose pores are approximately 40 A or larger in
diameter. The pore surfaces of this glass contain silanol groups (Si-OH). The PI
Proposes reacting these groups (via a CVD process) with SiCl4 to form -Si-O-
SiCl3. This reaction coats the surface with an atomic layer, which reduces the
pore diameter. The chlorinated surface can then be hydroxylated by the reaction
with H2O to form Si-O-SiCl2-OH, which further reduces the pore diameter. By
successive reactions one can achieve atomic layer control of the pore size.
Microporous membranes with particular pore sizes will be made, and will be
tested for their selectivity in various binary separations.
