The focus of this research is to examine poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)co- and
terpolymers as supports in catalysis and synthesis. Theses studies will probe
the reactivity of soluble polymer-bound species to enzymatic reagents and the
feasibility of multistep `Merrifield-like` syntheses on supports that are
recovered by thermal precipitation. If successful, this chemistry will lead to
alternatives to conventional crosslinked supports. Various catalytic systems
that use biphasic polymers will also be developed. These include fluorous phase
polymers and polymers with controllable hydrocarbon/water solubility. With this
renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.
David E. Bergbreiter of the Department of Chemistry at Texas A &amp; M
University. Professor Bergbreiter will focus his work on new approaches to the
use of soluble polymers as supports for catalysis. The polymers described can,
by design, be readily prepared by people with little or no polymer chemistry
experience.
