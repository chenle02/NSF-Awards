This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the Pareto
method of design optimization, developed by the PI's group, into a cloud-based
service that can be accessed by designers without the expense of special
hardware or software. The Pareto design method is important, and particularly
relevant in a cloud-based service, because it offers unprecedented speed at low
computational cost. This increases accessibility of design optimization tools
across a number of industries, allowing smaller firms to engage in design
optimization. The project will result in CloudTopopt, a design optimization
cloud service with the following unique features: (a) it can be accessed by
anyone, at any time, from any browser such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari or
Internet Explorer, (b) it will offer the latest technology and design
optimization features, and (c) it will help designers reduce the cost of their
end-products through real-time optimization. These features provide the
following advantages: (1) it will level the playing field in product design by
providing equal access to high quality design software, to large corporations,
small firms and individual consultants, (2) it will result in significant cost
savings since users will not have to purchase expensive design software and
associated hardware, and (3) software and technology updates will be carried out
with little or no interference in the product design process. This is in
contrast to leading design software modules that require expensive
software/hardware installation and maintenance that only large corporations can
afford. This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates
from research discovery toward commercial application: (1) sustaining the speed
of the Pareto method in a cloud service by minimizing the overhead of network
communication and browser computation, (2) ensuring cloud security by relying on
secure https URLs (Uniform Resource Locator), and data encryption based on
industry standard 256 bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), and (3) providing
a robust user experience by relying on modern WebGL (Web Graphics Library)
technology. The personnel involved in this project include an engineering
graduate student and a management graduate student. The two students will
receive technology translation and entrepreneurship experiences by addressing
the technological gaps, and studying the market potential for CloudTopopt,
respectively.

The project engages Design Concepts, LLC (Madison) to guide the technological
development and commercialization in this technology translation effort from
research discovery toward commercial reality.
