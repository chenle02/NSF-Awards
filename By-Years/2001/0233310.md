0233310&lt;br/&gt;Gunner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-year award for
U.S.-France cooperative research in photosynthesis involves Marilyn Gunner and
graduate students at City College of the City University of New York and Pierre
Sebban and his students at the Center for Molecular Genetics of the French
National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). The objective is to determine
protein structure and electron transfer in the photosynthetic reaction centers
of purple bacteria. These bacteria allow light-activated, single turn-over
measurements. The investigators propose to determine barriers to specific
molecular changes in the protein. The French team will construct reaction center
mutants for study of the molecular basis for determining in electron transfer
between quinone A and quinone B. The US team will be in charge of low
temperature experiments and other measurements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
represents the U.S. side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National
Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). NSF will cover travel funds and living
expenses for the U.S. investigator and research visits for two U.S. graduate
students. The CNRS will support the visits of the French researchers to the
United States. &lt;br/&gt;
