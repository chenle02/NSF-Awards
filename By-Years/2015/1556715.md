Sri Lanka is renowned for its diverse and unique flora, with nearly 30% of
flowering plant species found nowhere else. Most of this plant diversity is
concentrated in the highlands in the south of the island. The flora of Sri Lanka
is assumed to have a close affinity to the flora of the Western Ghats, and
together these two regions comprise a recognized global biodiversity hotspot.
This project will investigate species diversity within the plant genus Polyspora
(Theaceae), a relative of tea, and use the group as a model to examine plant
diversification within the Sri Lanka-Western Ghats region. This study will
clarify the number of recognized species of Polyspora in Sri Lanka and map their
patterns of distribution within the region. Comparative methods will be used to
estimate when Sri Lankan Polyspora species diversified in the past, how their
patterns of distribution have changed through time, and how their patterns of
distribution are predicted to change in the future. This project will strengthen
international collaborations among researchers from the US, Sri Lanka and India,
and will increase participation in science of students from underrepresented
groups in the USA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A species level phylogeny of the genus
Polyspora using plastid and nuclear DNA sequences will be reconstructed and used
to examine biogeographic relationships between both Sri Lanka and the Western
Ghats, and within South Asia in general. Identification of the sister group and
divergence time of the Sri Lankan Polyspora lineage will provide a context for
diversification within Sri Lanka and address longstanding questions on the
number, delimitation, and geographic distribution of genera in Thecae that will
provide a framework for future floristic and taxonomic work in the family. A
Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis of 120 Polyspora accessions will
be used to provide a fine-scale test of geographic structure within Sri Lanka.
This phylogeographic analysis will then be used to clarify species limits within
the genus and provide a context for future studies on speciation.
