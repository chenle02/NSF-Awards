This award supports the development of an array of millennium- long tree-ring
chronologies for the southeastern USA. These long chronologies are sensitive to
precipitation, and reflect anomalies in large-scale atmospheric circulation over
eastern North American and the western North Atlantic. This work will also
develop centuries-long chronologies in the southern Great Plains and Mexico
which are sensitive to anomalies in the EL Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the
most important known cause of interannual to decadal variation in global
climate. The network of ENSO- sensitive tree-ring chronologies will be expanded
in Mexico and the Southeast in order to develop longer ENSO reconstructions, to
explore possible changes in the ENSO phenomenon during the Little Ice Age, and
to estimate the frequency of ENSO extremes such as the 1982-83 warm event. The
potential for dendroclimatology will also be explored in East Africa, where and
ENSO influence on climate has been detected, but where long, annual climate
proxies are not presently available. The proposed research will provide unique
paleoclimatic data that will help define the natural variability of climate, and
may help evaluate GCM-simulations of climate during global warm and cool
episodes of the late Holocene.
