This award has base support from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of
the Division of Chemistry and equipment support from the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities. Prof. M. Bonner Denton of the University of
Arizona will investigate the use of infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV)approaches
to qualitative and quantitative measurements of analytes separated using high
performance techniques on thin layer plates. State-of-the-art near-infrared
imaging camera technology will be used along with silicon charge-coupled devices
for the UV region. Compounds to be studied include a number of antibiotics which
will demonstrate the utility of the instrumentation in the area of
pharmaceuticals, an industry which is a potential major user of the technology
to be developed. State-of-the-art imaging technology will be used to detect and
measure quantitatively the compounds separated chromatographically on thin-layer
plates. Many samples can be done in parallel. The technology to be developed has
the potential to impact very positively on analysis in the pharmaceutical and
clinical areas of the health industries and on other manufacturers of chemicals.
