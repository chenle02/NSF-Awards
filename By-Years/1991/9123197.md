Adsorption microcalorimetry is used to study the surface thermodynamics of
supported platinum and platinum/tin catalysts for reactions of importance to the
reformulation of gasoline, specifically dehydrogenation and isomerization of
light paraffins. Probe molecules are selected to study the chemical bonding
properties of the surface for adsorbates relevant to the catalytic reactions of
interest. The enthalpic and entropic changes associated with the interactions of
these probe molecules with surfaces are measured. The surface thermodynamic data
are compared with reaction kinetic data from steady-state studies, isotopic
tracing, and temperature-programed desorption to explore correlations between
surface thermodynamics and surface kinetics. Relationships between surface
thermodynamics and catalyst structure are also examined. This project is a major
contribution to the data base on surface thermodynamics. It also provides a good
test of the utility of such data in catalyst design. The test system employed
has immediate implications in meeting the new standards under the Clean Air Act.
