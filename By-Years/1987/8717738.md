This project explores the developmental differences in dental maturation
between monkeys, great apes and humans. Through the study of dental radiographs
housed in several research institutions, Dr. Smith will trace the pattern of
eruption between these three groups, note the range of variation within each and
then derive standards against which early human fossil materials may be
evaluated. This research should greatly further our understanding of how early
hominids matured. One group of anthropologists argues that early humans had an
extremely delayed maturation pattern, such as our own, and this implies a long
period of juvenile dependency during which complex culturally determined
behaviors could be learned from parents. Another group believes that the early
hominid pattern was more apelike and that therefore a lower level of cultural
complexity was attained. Presently it is difficult to decide between
alternatives because satisfactory modern growth standards are not avaiable. Dr.
Smith's research will help to remedy this situation.
