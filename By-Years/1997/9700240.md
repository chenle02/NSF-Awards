This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
funds research in the laboratory of Kenneth J. Balkus at the Univesity of Texas
at Dallas. The objective is to prepare new zeolite host-guest materials that
would offer clear advantages in catalytic and adsorption processes. Work will
contintue to exploit occluding guest molecules into zeolites and other porous
materials through adsorption, ion exchange, complexation and templated
intrazeolite assembly. Emphasis will be on the synthesis of the host matrix
around the guest molecule, which occludes as a well-defined species. This
approach has already resulted in the discovery of the largest pore zeolite
known. The focus will now turn to multidentate chelate complexes such as
phthalocyanines, polyamines, polyethers and Schiff base ligands. Chiral
functional groups will also be introduced in order to prepare chiral host
materials and to induce asymmetric catalysis. New host-guest materials will be
evaluated for binding and activating small molecules, such as molecular oxygen,
hydrogen, nitric oxide, and olefins in catalysis, separations and gas-sensing
applications. New materials will be prepared with spaces designed to hold
catalytically important molecules. These materials hold the prospect of
functioning as asymmetric catalysts, chemical separators and sensors.
