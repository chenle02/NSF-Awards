*** 9761158 Nardi This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will address the design and development of tools for the integrated diagnostics
and service of installed electromechanical systems. The project combines
technologies from signal processing and classification with time and usage based
maintenance to produce an integrated maintenance service technology based on
condition, elapsed calendar time, and equipment utilization. The integrated
system is general and addresses the needs of several different categories of
business that install and maintain electromechanical equipment. The technical
methodologies include pattern classification in measured signals and constraint-
directed operations management and allocation of maintenance resources.
Potential commercial applications are expected in computer based tools for
operation and management of service maintenance systems. ***
