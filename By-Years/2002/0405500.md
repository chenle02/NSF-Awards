Low-dimensional conducting materials continue to provide one of the richest
arenas for research in condensed matter physics. Of these materials, the MX(2)
and MX(3) compounds, where M=Nb, Ta . . . and X=S, Se . . ., provide unique
opportunities for fundamental studies of low-d physics in general and of charge-
density waves and flux-line-lattices in particular. This individual investigator
award will support a diverse program of experiments on MX(2) and MX(3) compounds
that will build on vigorous efforts in crystal growth and characterization and
in nanostructure fabrication. Experiments will study local pinning and single
particle-collective mode interactions in CDW conductors at low temperatures;
dynamics of single phase-coherent CDW domains, velocity-dependent spatio-
temporal correlations in CDW dynamics; phase slip in fully gapped CDW materials;
field-effect charge modulation in MX(2) and MX(3) dots using ferroelectric
gates; and flux-line lattice dynamics in microfabricated NbSe(2) single
crystals. This program of research and graduate training will be complemented by
the PI's longstanding and vigorous efforts in undergraduate education and
outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel electronic materials including high-
temperature superconductors, conducting polymers, carbon nanotubes, and charge-
density-wave conductors illuminate the fundamental physical processes that
underlie how solid state electronic devices work and provide opportunities for
creating the electronics of tomorrow. This individual individual investigator
project includes a wide range of experiments to probe the fundamental physics of
charge-density wave conductors and their potential for applications. It will
provide excellent training to graduate and undergraduate students in the
techniques of modern materials science, solid-state physics, and nanotechnology.
This project will be complemented by vigorous efforts in undergraduate education
and outreach, including development of a web-based tutorial/evaluation system in
elementary scientific mathematics and development of a new program to increase
the number of high school physics teachers trained at Cornell and to improve the
quality of their training.&lt;br/&gt;
