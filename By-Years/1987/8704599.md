Professor Alan Goodman is the leading practitioner in the USA of research
regarding the properties of nuclei at high excitation energy. He has been and is
at the forefront of the use of the finite-temperature Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov
cranking theory in nuclear physics. He proposes to use this theory to calculate
the properties of rare- earth and actinide nuclei as functions of the
temperature or excitation energy of the nucleus. Statistical fluctuations of the
shape around the equilibrium deformation will also be calculated, and phase
transitions induced by heating and rotation will be studied. Professor Goodman
is at the forefront of research regarding the properties of nuclei which are
simultaneously rotating and being heated. He is a pioneer theorist in this area
and is virtually the only U.S. researcher engaged in questions of nuclear
structure at high excitation energies. Goodman's research will provide
information about the role of fluctuations around the equilibrium deformation in
nuclei and about phase transitions induced by heating and rotation. This is
important work, since nuclear behavior at finite temperatures will be an area of
great interest in nuclear physics in the coming years.
