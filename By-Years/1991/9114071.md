The Advanced Study Institute on Techniques and Concepts of High Energy Physics
will be held at St. Croix from July 15 to July 26, 1992. Approximately 60
advanced graduate students and research associates will attend lectures by nine
leaders in experimental and particle physics. This action will provide funds for
lecturers to travel to the Institute. The course material for the Institute can
be divided into three general areas. The first is concerned with the
experimental tools of the field; the second involves the confrontation between
the latest experimental results and the phenomenology; and the third will
involve the theoretical underpinnings of the Standard Model. In addition,
selected students, faculty or visitors will present brief seminars on subjects
related to the main lectures.
