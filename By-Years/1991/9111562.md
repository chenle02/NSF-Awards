Research is directed toward the study of few level models in atomic radiation
theory. The ultimate aim is a basic understanding of wave mixing processes on a
microscopic level. The modeling will include two-mode interactions and will
employ higher-order RWA methods and Floquet techniques. It is expected that
experimental tests of our model calculations will be possible.
