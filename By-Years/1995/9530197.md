9530197 Atkinson A series of laboratory experiments will be conducted to examine
the dynamics of buoyant coastal discharges over slopping bootoms within a
rotating frame. A particular focus is on developing a description of the turning
and spreading characteristics of the plume as it moves off-shore and its
possible interaction with the bottom. The driving hypothesis for this work is
that the discharge flow width is controlled by the Rossby radius, at least
initially, and that this may cause the flow to remain attached to the bottom
over greater distances that would be expected in the absence of rotation.
