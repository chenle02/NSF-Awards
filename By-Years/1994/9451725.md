Six neurophysiology workstations, capable of both intracellular and
extracellular neurorecording techniques, will equip a new one-semester upper-
level undergraduate Neurobiology course. Students will design experiments to
elucidate important phenomena in cellular and integrative neurobiology, such as
the ionic bases of the resting and action potentials, coding of sensory
information, synaptic integration, and modulation of synapses. The proposed
equipment will also be used to improve teaching of elementary principles of
neurobiology in the General Biology course, and to expand the range of
opportunities for student research projects. Funding of this proposal will
permit integration into the curriculum of a major field of biological inquiry,
and remedy the only major deficiency that remains after several years of
sustained curricular improvement.
