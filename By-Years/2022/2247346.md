The award supports a March 2023 conference at the Ohio State University
(Columbus campus) on the topics of harmonic analysis and fractal geometry.
Fractals are geometric objects which are highly irregular, exhibiting detail at
arbitrarily small scales. Such sets arise naturally in mathematics, and have
applications to a diverse array of problems in science and engineering. Harmonic
analysis emerged in the late 20th century as a tool for the study of the
geometry of fractal sets, and in return fractal geometry has motivated many
interesting questions in harmonic analysis. This event brings together
researchers to find new synergies between existing methods and to formulate new
approaches to build on recent progress at the intersection of these
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the conference is on geometric
properties of fractal sets using tools from harmonic analysis. A classical
problem in this area is the Falconer distance problem, which asks how large the
Hausdorff dimension of a compact set must be to ensure that it determines a
positive Lebesgue measure set of pairwise distances. More generally, one may
inquire when high dimensional sets determine more complicated patterns, leading
to a host of fascinating questions about finite point configurations. These
problems can be studied via bounds for convolution operators, bringing to bear
tools from harmonic analysis. Another classical example is the Kakeya problem,
which asks when sets containing a line segment in every direction must have full
Hausdorff dimension. The Kakeya problem, in turn, is closely tied to Fourier
restriction theory. A recurring theme throughout the conference is the
relationship between the Fourier transform and notions of structure such as
Hausdorff dimension.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;https://u.osu.edu/hafs2023/&lt;br/&gt;
