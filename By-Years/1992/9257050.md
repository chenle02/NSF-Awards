With this National Science Foundation Young Investigator (NYI) award, the
Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry Division is supporting the research
and teaching activities of Dr. Jeffrey S. Moore of the Department of Chemistry
at the University of Michigan. The focus of Professor Moore's research will be
the design and synthesis of novel organic materials using a modular construction
approach. The resulting monolayers on surfaces, ordered fluid phases and non-
close-packed crystals are materials of much current interest. In the long term,
Dr. Moore will work on the molecular design of materials for regulating
transport phenomena. The focus of Dr. Moore's teaching activities will be the
development of a junior/senior level undergraduate course in materials chemistry
and the inclusion of undergraduates in his research efforts.
