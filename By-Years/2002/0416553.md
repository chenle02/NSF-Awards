Professor Sylvia Daunert of the University of Kentucky is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to continue work on a whole-cell
bacteria-based sensing system. The project goals are two-fold: first, to make
practical whole-cell sensors that are stable enough for storage and field use.
The idea is to use lypohilization and/or spores in a microfluidic format on a
compact-disc. Secondly, the PI will apply whole cells as sensors of signalling
chemicals that cells use to "decide" things like antibiotic production,
virulence and release of bioluminescence in a mode called "quorum sensing (QS)."
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intervention in bacteria signalling has been proposed as
an alternative to traditional antibiotic therapy. &lt;br/&gt;This proposal spans
the areas of chemical signalling, sensing, and complex systems, with an emphasis
on cutting edge technology. Students, including those from Appalachia, are
trained in this highly interdisciplinary approach to sensing, an area of
national need in combatting terrorism.
