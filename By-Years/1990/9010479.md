An experimental investigation of atomization in a liquid spray is to be carried
out under a Research Initiation Award. The research is relevant to fuel systems
in internal combustion engines. A transparent, two-dimensional model atomizing
orifice will be utilized, and turbulent fluctuations will be measured with
laser-Doppler anemometry. The information to be developed may lead to systems
with better and more complete fuel evaporation, and hence lower emission levels
in internal combustion engines.
