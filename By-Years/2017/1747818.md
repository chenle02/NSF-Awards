The rapid growth of user generated content in online social networks forms an
abundant source of big graph data. This project will develop efficient
techniques for extracting information from such graph data. Specifically, this
EAGER project will develop efficient algorithms for the following tasks: (1)
machine learning and sentiment analysis, such as large vocabulary conversational
speech recognition, multi-label learning, and multi-polarity sentiment analysis,
and (2) effector detection and related issues, such as business expansion and
rumor blocking. The advanced optimization techniques developed in this project
will significantly improve the performance of the existing data mining
algorithms and the theoretical study of efficient approximation techniques. In
addition, this project will provide an excellent platform for educating students
with hands-on experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To develop the efficient
algorithms described, the project will take advantage of recent development in
nonlinear combinatorial optimization, and will formulate new methodologies using
discrete convex analysis for submodular functions and duality theory for the
discrete DC (different of convex) programming, as well as reverse sampling
techniques for probabilistic objective functions. These new methodologies will
enrich the throughput of machine learning and sentiment analysis. Since
nonlinear combinatorial optimization is still in its early stages, exploratory
and innovative research on efficient approximation algorithm will be performed
based on fresh fundamental theoretical developments. A detailed evaluation will
be conducted based on several real world data sets.
