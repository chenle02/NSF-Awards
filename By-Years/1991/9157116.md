This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award. The rate at which water
infiltrates waste in a landfill has a significant impact on the rate of
decomposition; hence, landfill covers need to be designed to yield controlled
rates of infiltration. The hydraulic behavior of covers, however, is at the
present time only crudely understood. In this research, the hydraulic behavior
of cover systems will be investigated and innovative technologies will be
evaluated. Stochastic models will be developed to simulate the infiltration
process. The stochastic models will be validated by large scale physical models
tested under actual climatological conditions.
