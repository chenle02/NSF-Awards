Mental disorders account for 13% of diseases in middle and low-income countries
and often appear together with poverty. The proposed research project (Escaping
Poverty Project (EP)) will study the link between mental health and efforts to
improve economic productivity for those in extreme poverty through a 7,330
household multi-arm field experimental methods. It also seeks to study the
barriers to escaping poverty through and anti-poverty asset transfer and
training program. EP examines the link between mental disorders and poverty from
two perspectives. First, it investigates the interaction between improvements in
mental health and the ability of households to take advantage of new
opportunities; and second, it measures the effect of sustained coaching on the
return to the asset grant. The results of this research project have the
potential to influence social protection policies for those in extreme poverty.
The results of this study will offer guidance on the importance of mental health
for the success of a strictly "economic" intervention. The results will provide
important inputs into the US's efforts to reduce poverty of its citizens and
around the world. The results will also help improve the effectiveness of US's
aid policies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EP Project's end-line survey funded
through this grant will measure consumption, income, wealth, depression, and
reported mental wellbeing 24 months after asset transfer and training. The main
arms in the study are as follows: a 12-week cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
program; the same CBT program followed by a multi-faceted anti-poverty asset
transfer and training program; the multi-faceted program without CBT; a one-time
cash transfer equivalent to the cost of the asset and training in the multi-
faceted treatment arms; and a control group. Analysis will focus on average
impacts of each treatment arm, as well as focus on heterogeneous impacts on
specific subgroups such as those with preexisting depression and quantiles in
the distribution of key outcomes. In addition to the benefits to practitioners,
the study will offer knowledge about psychological barriers to investment that
could perpetuate poverty traps. The results of this research project will also
provide important inputs into US's aid policies around the
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
