The recent acquisition of a photodiode array ultraviolet-visible
spectrophotometer is being used in the teaching of chemical principles and
laboratory techniques to chemistry majors, other science majors and/or
premedical students, and non-science majors at Davidson College. The speed of
the instrument allows complete spectra to be acquired within seconds, displayed
on a monitor, stored on disk, mathematically manipulated, and printed. The
instrument is being used for kinetic experiments that require absorption values
at more than one wavelength to be measured simultaneously. It also serves as a
detector for high performance liquid chromatography, thus introducing students
to principles of chromatography-spectrophotometry. Chemistry majors study the
principles of operation of this computer-controlled instrument, with emphasis on
concepts of digital electronics, instrument control, data file structures, and
data transfer operations. The instrument is also used in student research
projects involving organic photochemical reactions, the characterization of
transition metal complexes, and investigation of the function of proteins.
