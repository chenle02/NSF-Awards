The project will develop a laboratory for the modular learning of system
integration and control. It takes a unique approach that can be ported to other
schools. A modular laboratory will be created with mix and match high-level
components which be configured in a variety of ways to represent different
systems and the problems that are often encountered in real-world situations.
This modular laboratory has distinct advantages over hard-wired CIM cells and
low-level commercial kits.The equipment requested consists of table-top sensors,
data acquisition components, indexing table, conveyors, robots, CNC mill,
computers, non-contact barcode readers, data communication components, local
area network, and multimedia upgrade tool kits which will supplement existing
equipment to make the modular laboratory possible.This project is an important
step in the department goal of continuous improvement in CIM teaching. A
significant number of students will benefit from the project, including IE
students who are required to take the courses, and students from other
departments who regularly take the courses as electives. There will also be an
impact on junior high and high school students, teachers, women and minority
groups during the summer from workshops to be sponsored by the department.
