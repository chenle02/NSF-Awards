The REU Computer Science Project at Northern Illinois University will consist of
four main parts. Under the direction of Hal Martin and Fred Thulin, students
will work on problems of complexity and convergence which arise in the study of
game trees and heuristic search. Simulations of networks of loosely coupled
simple processors are planned. Students under the direction of Larry Basenpiler
will work in the area of computational graph theory. Under the direction of Neil
Rickert, students will work in the area of distributed processing. In all areas,
algorithms will be developed, analyzed and implemented.
