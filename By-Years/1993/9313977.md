9313977 Castor Reversed micelles hold much promise as a means of carrying out
selective liquid-liquid extraction of proteins from solution mixtures such that
the desired protein is obtained in a purer and more concentrated form than the
original feed. Reversed micellar-organic (RM-ORG) phase separation could have
significant utility in the primary purification or initial fractionation of
biosynthetic protein production processes. The continuous flow RM-ORG process
developed during Phase I was designed to displace conventional low resolution
chromatographic purification processes which cause losses in yield and increased
manufacturing costs. During Phase II, process stream parameters such as
surfactant concentration and aqueous stream pH are to be optimized. These
parameters play key roles in determining protein solubilization in reversed
micelles. A continuous flow RM-ORG prototype is to be designed, constructed, and
tested. Based on this information, an economic analysis of the prototype is to
be performed.
