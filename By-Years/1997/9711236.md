This research pertains to theory and observation of equatorial plasma
irregularities and equatorial aeronomy. The PI (and one student) will make
several sets of short-term observations with the Jicamarca radar, following up
with long-term observations using JULIA. Using the PI's coherent scatter radar
imaging technique at Jicamarca, the PI will assess and evaluate a number of
breaking theories of equatorial F-region plasma irregularities, like why large-
scale plasma depletions bifurcate, what coherent scatter Doppler spectra
signify, and how shear flow affects the evolution of bottomside spread F waves.
The PI will devote another portion of this project to continuing operations of
the JULIA radar for E and F region plasma irregularity studies. JULIA data has
shown: (1) gradient drift waves in the electrojet are sometimes modulated by
tides propagating into the lower thermosphere, (2) evidence of storm-time
effects on equatorial electrodynamics and irregularity generation, and (3)
F-region irregularities frequency emerge in the early morning, contrary to
conventional wisdom. The PI will develop new analytic theories to more precisely
account for these phenomena. Finally, he will develop a new mode for incoherent
scatter measurements, incorporating an alternating phase-coded pulse for making
for sensitive temperature and composition experiment in the topside region.
