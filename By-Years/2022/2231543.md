This aim of this workshop is to identify emerging issues, challenges, basic
research questions, and potential approaches to study and address safety and
trust in AI-enabled systems across application domains. The workshop will bring
together researchers from academia, industry, and government research labs that
are working in the areas of artificial intelligence, and formal methods, and
application domains such as autonomous systems, business and finance, and
education. The main deliverable of the workshop is a report summarizing the
discussions and findings of the workshop, which will be made publicly
available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fostering the development of collaborations and
the exchange of ideas between the formal methods, AI/ML, and broader research
communities and stakeholders is critical and may lead to advances in methods
that improve both AI/ML and formal methods, as well as the broader concerns
about safety and trust of these AI-enabled systems across science, engineering,
and society. The workshop will particularly encourage participation and
perspectives from persons coming from underrepresented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
