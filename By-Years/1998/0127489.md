Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses two
national needs: the quality of Science, Technological, Engineering, and
Mathematics (STEM) education for all students needs improvement; and the
participation of populations currently underrepresented in the STEM pipeline
needs to be increased, thus increasing the pool of professionals available for
the careers in science and engineering. The general goal of the project is
therefore to improve the success rate of undergraduate students in STEM
disciplines, particularly targeting minority populations. The specific
objectives pursued in order to achieve this goal are formulated in order to
enhance student motivation, increase student time on task, strengthen student
problem solving and analytical skills, and enhance the participation of faculty
at minority serving institutions in effecting STEM education improvement. In
order to accomplish these objectives, the Virginia Tech Emporium is adapted and
implemented. Other innovative educational materials that incorporate information
technology and STEM discipline specific applications to enhance content and
motivate students are developed, and a model Lecture-Laboratory Calculus course
is developed and tested which incorporates these materials.
