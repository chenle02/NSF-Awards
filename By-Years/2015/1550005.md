This team has developed a unique and portable instrument that is capable of
studying chemical reactions between solids and gases. This equipment will be
useful to a variety of industries that are looking to reduce air pollution from
their processes, including: automotive, chemical, oil and stationary power. The
portability of the equipment means that one can take the diagnostic to the
source; there is no need to approximate conditions in the laboratory (which is
what is usually done). This device will allow companies, that otherwise do not
have the equipment or staff to make these measurements, to evaluate the efficacy
of third party technologies with their proprietary or developmental devices. For
example, Fiat Chrysler America (FCA) could test a third party automotive
catalyst on exhaust from one of their developmental engines, to see if it will
meet emissions requirements in-house, rather than sending both the highly
proprietary developmental engine and catalyst out to be
tested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team has developed a portable and
versatile characterization microreactor for the fundamental, scientific study of
both catalytic and non-catalytic heterogeneous reactions. It was designed such
that fundamental catalytic activity and selectivity may be examined, providing
key knowledge required to develop new materials and processes for catalysts.
Additionally, due to the larger diameter sample tube and because the system is
capable of measuring performance parameters such as surface area, temperature-
dependent activity, and adsorption capacity, it can be used for coal and biomass
pyrolysis experiments as well. A portable characterization reactor system could
provide these types of functions: assessment of exhaust aftertreatment catalysts
in the test cell of an automotive OEM; evaluation of new remediation
technologies for the flow of processing stream that contains particulates;
variations in waste treatment incineration to find the optimum catalyst for
their ever changing fuels; and evaluate new technologies at intermediate steps
in full-scale molecular epitaxial processes such as solar cell, circuit board
production, etc. A two-pronged approach will be utilized to bring this
technology into wide usage.
