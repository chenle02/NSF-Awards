Lih Min Hsia and two professors of California State University at Los Angeles to
visit Tongji University, China, to establish an
international&lt;br/&gt;education exchange program. Tongji is a good university
in China for establishing educational collaboration. The success of this visit
can provide the needed international experience for U.S. science
students.&lt;br/&gt;
