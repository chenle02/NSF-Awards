The objective of this research is to demonstrate chaotic communications systems
that are secure and enable high data-rate communications at 10 gigabits per
second. The approach is to use semiconductor lasers with optoelectronic time
delays to provide chaotic emitters and receivers that when coupled exhibit
synchronized chaotic dynamics. By concealing a message in the output of the
emitter, it can be transmitted securely and decrypted at the receiver. The work
seeks to multiplex several messages for high data rates. Internal and operation
parameters are explored to conceal the encryption key to ensure high security.

The intellectual merit of this project is to find ways to optimally utilize the
optical bandwidth acknowledging that the chaotic carrier's bandwidth exceeds
that of any individual message. By multiplexing several messages within a single
chaotic carrier, one can achieve bandwidths compatible with deployed optical
communications systems. Preliminary work shows that choosing judicious
parameters, chaotic time-delay systems can mask the encryption key, offering
high security. One aim is to see if this holds for more complex systems for
practical applications.

The broader impacts of this work include increasing security in optical
communications in a manner that is compatible with existing communications
infrastructure and new systems. Chaos encryption is a form of physical layer
security; the only layer rarely used. Chaos encryption can, thus, be combined
with software encryption. The research provides a mechanism for
multidisciplinary training. The work involves an international collaboration
between Georgia Tech in Atlanta and in Metz and Sup√©lec in Metz, France.
