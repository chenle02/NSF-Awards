Proposal to acquire four items of shared-use scientific instrumentation for use
on R/V Seward Johnson and R/V Walton Smith, operated by Harbor Branch and
University of Miami respectively. Both vessels are managed by Richard Findley as
part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research
fleet. The four items requested, as prioritized by the PI, are: &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;1) Upgrade of POS/MV 320 System aboard R/V Walton Smith&lt;br/&gt;2)
Echo Sounder Test Set &lt;br/&gt;3) Integrated Optical Bow Sensor Suite
&lt;br/&gt;4) Hydrographic Display &amp; Processing
Software&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt; In the present
proposal, the items recommended for support provide an important shared-use
infrastructure capability for basic instrumentation that is cost-effective, and
will significantly improve capabilities for users of R/V Seward Johnson and R/V
Walton Smith, which service a diverse group of investigators from around the
U.S. The Miama and Harbor Branch technical support groups have the expertise to
operate and support the recommended systems on the vessels.&lt;br/&gt;
