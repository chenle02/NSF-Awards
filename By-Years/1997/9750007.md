Abstract DBI 9750007 Seung-Chul Kim This action funds an NSF/Alfred P. Sloan
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997. These
fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, comparative,
computational, and/or experimental analyses of biological patterns and processes
at the molecular level within the framework of organismic evolutionary change
and adaptation. These studies also include the use of molecular data to address
broader evolutionary questions. Each fellowship supports a research and training
plan to be carried out in a sponsoring laboratory. The research and training
plan for this fellowship is entitled "The Transfer of Genetic Adaptations
between Wild Sunflower Species." Interspecific transfer of genetic adaptations
through hybridization and backcrossing (introgression) is thought to be common
in plants but has been difficult to prove. The research and training plan
supported here will employ genetic mapping tools to verify experimentally the
introgressive origin of several adaptive morphological features in Helianthus
annus ssp. texanus. This is a new subspecies putatively derived via the
introgression of H. debilis genes into H. annus.
