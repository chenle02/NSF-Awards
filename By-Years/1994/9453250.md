Brown 9453250 The work during the planning year is the preparation of a
comprehensive proposal detailing the establishment and operation of a regional
center for developing, promoting and maintaining excellence in advanced
technological education. The Mid-Atlantic Center for Advanced Technological
Education (MCATE) will include design input from major regional and local
leaders in business, government and education. The plan will delineate a modern
Center where leaders and innovators in technological education assemble to
devote their combined talents to creating new academic models, enhancing
partnerships, testing new prototypes, researching and sharing results to
transform technological education in the Mid-Atlantic region. The senior
personnel, supported by additional College resources, will determine appropriate
MCATE activities to provide the development of new curricula,improvement of
faculty competence, and provision of a clearinghouse for informAtion, methods,
and materials affecting technological education, starting from basic mathematics
and science core courses and addressing student development plus expanded
opportunities and experiences. Activities will build from and develop
partnerships with leaders from public and private schools, colleges and
universities, business, industry, and government agencies. The standard for the
determination of the Center's activities will be the ultimate impact upon the
education of students in the region as they select and prepare for careers in
the science and engineering technologies. Each potential activity listed will be
ranked to develop the final array.
