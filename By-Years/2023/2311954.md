The movement of humans throughout a city or region is critical to economic
activity, social interactions, and infrastructure development. While some
aspects of mobility can and have been studied at the microscopic level, and
regional statistical properties could be gathered, the task of providing a
holistic model for a global scale that adheres consistently with micro-scale
dynamics has remained a challenge. For a full model of the economic and societal
consequences, it is essential to gather socio-demographic data and to track
movements across various modes of transportation and time scales. Pressing
challenges, such as optimizing electric vehicle charging infrastructure and
promoting equitable transportation law enforcement, that directly impact
peopleâ€™s daily lives, will benefit from access to such data and easily-usable
models.

Towards these goals, this project will build a foundational model for human
mobility. This model can incorporate diverse types of movement, temporal, and
socio-demographic data. It can also generate outputs relevant to a micro-scale
event, or a macro-scale property, and consistent with both. At the core of this
model is a simulation engine that can imitate events and movements in a way that
is consistent with all of the data used as input. The learning of this
representation will utilize modern machine learning techniques, and
simultaneously optimize to align with different types of data modalities. The
resulting simulation model leverages innovations in spatio-temporal anomaly
detection to study intervention and prediction tasks. Ultimately these tangible
and accessible models will help facilitate broadening participation in STEM by
developing the next generation of spatial scientists through new joint programs
between computing, data science, and civil engineering.
