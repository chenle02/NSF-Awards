This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial biology for
FY2004. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden their scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Biogeography of symbiotic bacteria
at Deep-sea Hydrothermal Vents." Models of gene flow are being tested in
populations of chemoautotrophic endosymbionts of Riftia tubeworms at deep-sea
hydrothermal vents. Both population genetic and phylogeographic approaches are
being employed in the analyses of DNA sequence data. New insights into bacterial
dispersal in this system as mediated by topology and physical parameters are
likely to result.
