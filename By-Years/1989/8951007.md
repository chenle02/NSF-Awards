As part of a new plant sciences concentration within the Biological Sciences
Department, plant tissue culture and molecular techniques are being integrated
into the introductory course, and a research project is being incorporated into
the Plant Physiology course. Such experiences may be continued in the In Vitro
Cell Biology and Biotechnology option, an integrated 15 credit course, and
through independent research and Honors Program theses. The acquisition of
equipment for culture of cell suspensions, calli, and plants (Gyratory shakers
and environmental chamber) and for the genetic manipulation of plants
(electroporation unit, microplate reader and UV transilluminator) makes it
possible to offer sophisticated research experiences to undergraduate students.
