9409950 Pantazidou The objective of this research is to investigate the
migration potential of dense non aqueous phase liquid (DNAPLs) in the subsurface
by using centrifuge modeling. The conditions under which the centrifuge
simulates satisfactorily the governing processes in multiphase flow transport
will be established first by critically reviewing and reconciling scaling laws
developed by employing dimensional analysis and the method of modeling models.
The appropriateness of the scaling laws will be tested against the results of a
series of centrifuge model experiments, consisting of NADPLs percolating in
saturated sand, silt, and clay. The NADPL migration will be monitored with
visual methods, supplemented by electric conductivity or receptivity
measurements. ***
