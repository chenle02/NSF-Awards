This project for comparative field research on two communities in Mexico will
try to explain the consistent relationship found in demographic studies between
the formal education of women and population-level reproductive rates (of child
survival and fertility) in changing societies. Hypotheses to be tested cover the
skills and attitudes women acquire in school, preschool variations in family
background and parental support for girl's education careers, and cultural
variations in gender roles. Ethnographic and psychosocial methods will be used
by investigators with native language ability in a rural and an urban setting in
Mexico. This research is important because women's schooling is an important
predictor of child survival and fertility in Third World countries, yet we have
no good understanding of how and why female school attendance makes this
apparent impact. This study will use an in-depth anthropological approach to
this problem and promises to significantly advance our knowledge.
