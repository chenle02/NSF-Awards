Often the design of new devices and the optimization of device geometries can
limit the rate of development of a new technology. Computer models for devices
can help speed up this process but these are not well established for gallium
arsenide. The PI will establish a research effort, directed at developing
physically based computer models for GaAs devices. Such models will allow for
the more efficient evaluation and design of new device structures. Our initial
approach will be to refine process modeling software and adapt it to GaAs device
fabrications processes. This work will form the basis for the device modeling
software, initially focussed on MESFETS, which will be used to arrive at
physically based closed form descriptions of the device characteristics which
software such as SPICE might employ.
