The Optoelectronics Industry Development Association (OIDA) seeks NSF support to
increase student and academia participation in "OPTOmism : Powering the Green
Revolution through Photonics." OPTOmism is the first interdisciplinary
conference that addresses the role of photonics in green technology and focuses
on both the technology and policy of green photonics.

Intellectual Merit The Technical Conference consists of plenary sessions and
three parallel technical tracks. The plenary sessions include highly
distinguished speakers addressing broader policy and technology issues. The
selection of the papers for these technical sessions meets rigorous standards.
OIDA will issue a call for papers, from which outside review committees will
select papers for oral presentation. In addition to presented papers, the
conference will host a poster session during a networking reception at the
conclusion of the first day.

Broader Impacts NSF funding will support an innovative new medium of conference
information dissemination: a real-time, moderated blog. OIDA will fund a
professor and students for each of the three technical tracks. The students will
attend each session to document and annotate the material presented. The
professor will moderate the blog to ensure appropriate content which OIDA will
then post on the conference web site. This will provide a learning opportunity
for the students both in exposing them to the latest technology and leaders in
the industry and by improving their technical writing skills. This innovative
concept taps into the younger generation's propensity to rely heavily on the
Internet for communication and as a source of information. OIDA expects that
student-generated material, targeted at students, will broaden the impact of the
conference.
