The rate of decay of aftershocks of earthquakes in several tectonic settings
will be analyzed by determining the parameters in the Modified Omori relation
that fit the data best in the maximum liklihood sense. The important parameter
is p, the exponent of time, t, in the aftershock decay relation, as defined by
Omori (1894) and Utsu (1960). The parameters are determined by fitting the
cumulative number of events up to any selected time, using the approach
developed by Ogata (1983). Analyses of a number of well-documented aftershock
sequences, described in the text of the proposal, yielded p-values from 0.7 to
1.3. From the few cases already studied for which the moment release pattern
during the mainshock has been determined, a connection between the degree of
uniformity of slip over the fault surface and the consequent decay rate of the
aftershocks is suggested.
