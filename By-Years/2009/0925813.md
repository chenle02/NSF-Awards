The objective of this research is to develop extremely low-power wake-up
receivers. The approach is using novel ultrasonic data-communication devices and
electronics. In wireless sensor and tag networks for ambient intelligence,
structural and asset monitoring and personal health monitoring, sensing tags
employ wake-up receivers to monitor requests for information from the central
control node. These always-ON devices need to operate with extremely low power
to save battery life or enable operation from energy scavenged from the
environment.

The proposed ultrasonic data communication technologies offer two orders of
magnitude of power reduction over current radio communication-based solutions. A
novel technology platform combining flexible polymer piezoelectrics and
integrated circuits will enable miniature ultrasonic transducers. These advances
can also enable significant advances in proximity sensing, ranging, and
communications through a variety of media with applications in automation,
ambient intelligence and medical diagnostics and health monitoring, where radio
transmission is poor or interference is not acceptable.

The use of sensor and tagging networks is still in its infancy and the proposed
research and education program will offer new technology and human capital to
apply these technologies for the benefit of society. The graduate and
undergraduate education and outreach activities of this cross-disciplinary
program help train the next generation of researchers in ultra-low power
electronics, device microfabrication and integration, and sensor networks.
Ultrasound communication and localization modules will be developed with the
Harlem Robotics League, a community outreach program for public high school
students from underrepresented minority groups in Harlem.
