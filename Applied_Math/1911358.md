The subject of this research is mathematical problems of physics of open systems
--the systems that exchange energy with the environment. The questions to be
addressed range from general and theoretical to study of specific systems,
designed with applications in mind. An example of a theoretical (and, indeed,
foundational) problem, studied by the PI, is a systematic approach to quantum
mechanics, using quantum stochastic calculus. This project aims at elucidating
well-known problems with interpretation of quantum theory, including state
reduction and the measurement problem. At the same time, the PI will collaborate
with experimental physics groups on design and explanation of laboratory
experiments. One project of this type is concerned with the emergent behavior in
motion of interacting agents. In this project, aggregation and separation of
light-sensitive robots is studied, emphasizing the role of sensorial delay. A
new project, in which sophisticated mathematical methods meet with laboratory
experiments, addresses electrical conductivity of graphene sheets and of active
carbon. The latter topic is important for the design of quantum devices and thus
is immediately aligned with Quantum Leap, one of the NSF's 10 Big Ideas.

Noise and disorder are ubiquitous phenomena, particularly important in the study
of open systems. Their mathematical models use several tools of probability
theory. The most important one is stochastic analysis, studying differential
equations with noise; this is one of the principal topics to be investigated in
this project. Other methods include ergodic theory, functional analysis and
dynamical systems. The PI will continue training graduate students and junior
researchers: a major part of this research will be done in collaboration with
junior researchers mentored by the PI. Collaboration with three physics groups--
experimental as well as theoretical--will be a crucial part of the project,
determining the particular research directions.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
