Earth's magnetotail is the elongated portion of Earth's magnetic field formed on
the night (or anti-sunward) side of the magnetosphere. This region is
characterized by energy release that accompanies the reconfiguration (aka
'reconnection') of oppositely directed magnetic field lines. In the process,
magnetic field energy is converted to plasma kinetic and thermal energy. The
researchers will perform computer simulations to investigate the roles played by
several types of magneto-hydrodynamical instabilities. This work will contribute
to fundamental knowledge of plasma discontinuities and magnetic reconnection.
These processes are pertinent not only to Earth, but also to solar, planetary
and stellar magnetospheres, as well as fusion devices and laboratory
reconnection experiments. Knowledge derived from the work will advance
understanding and modeling of space weather. Educational benefits will be
provided in the form of hands-on research training for student summer
interns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
