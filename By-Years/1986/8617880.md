The major objective of this five-year research project is to further the state-
of-the-art in realistic image synthesis algorithms. Specific tasks to be
accomplished are: 1. to theoretically explore and correctly formulate a
comprehensive light reflection model, 2. to research and develop new algorithms
related to realistic image synthesis, based on experiences with the ray-tracing
and radiosity approaches, 3. to refine color science procedures to correctly
compute and render the simulated images, 4. to experimentally verify the
physical and preceptual aspects of the image synthesis process, 5. to improve
the computational efficiency of graphics rendering algorithms through the use of
parallelism, 6. to increase the complexity bounds for modeling and simulation.
This meritorious research is being joint funded by the Computer Systems
Architecture Program of the Division of Computer and Computation Research and
the Design Theory and Methodology and Computer Integrated Engineering Programs
of the Engineering Directorate.
