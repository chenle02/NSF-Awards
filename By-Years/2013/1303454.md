This proposal seeks support for U.S. participants to attend a four-day Workshop
on "Molecular Interfaces in Fluids and Materials," to be held in Warsaw, Poland,
on June 18-21, 2014, at Warsaw University. The proposed Workshop is a follow-up
to and builds upon four earlier Workshops held in Poznan (2006), Gdansk (2008),
Krakow (2010) and Poznan (2012). The funds will support 18 U.S. participants
with emphasis on participation of junior researchers,in addition to a balance
between mid-career and senior&lt;br/&gt;participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
workshop will cover both experiment and theory. Emerging researchers and their
students from throughout Poland will participate in the meeting, thereby
providing a forum for interactions with US-based scientists. The Workshop is
intended to provide an effective forum for discussion between researchers from
the US and Poland who are working in the area of interfacial phenomena.
