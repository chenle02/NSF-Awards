The purpose of this proposal is to convene scholars at a two-day conference to
closely examine validity-related measurement issues, create a guidelines for the
field of mathematics education research that addresses key ideas (e.g.,
validity, validity arguments, evidence for validity and measurement at-scale),
and set a clear pathway for scholars to discuss quantitative measurement within
mathematics education. Invitees will include a mix of young, older and diverse
scholars in mathematics education research. Products include refereed journal
articles along with a website.

The workshop will engage the Mathematics Education, Policy, Statistical,
Psychometrics and other education research communities in examining and
critiquing measurement validity evidence of mathematics education research with
the long-term goal of increasing the quality of quantitative inference in
mathematics education research (to include improvements in the training of
doctoral students).
