&lt;br/&gt;The recent advances in the development of next generation DNA
sequencing technologies are opening the prospect for tackling large, complex
genomes such as wheat and barley in a reasonable time frame and for tractable
cost. It is timely to discuss the use of these technologies to sequence the
wheat and barley genomes. To this end, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing
Consortium (www.wheatgenome.org) and the International Barley Sequencing
Consortium (www.barleygenome.org) will convene an international workshop on
wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) genome sequencing.
The goals of the workshop are to: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Provide an overview of
the wheat and barley genome structure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Identify the
requirements and challenges of sequencing wheat and
barley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Discuss the strategies, successes, and failures of
completed animal and economically-important plant genome sequencing
projects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Discuss the results of ongoing wheat and barley
pilot studies using new technologies alone or in combination with Sanger
sequencing technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Gain input from the developers of
new sequencing technology platforms on how to apply their technologies to
sequence large, complex genomes, such as those of wheat and
barley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Discern needs and opportunities in bioinformatics
to handle these projects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Discuss national and
international funding opportunities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Determine whether the
new technologies can be used to sequence the genomes in the near future and
which projects should be developed to evaluate this
possibility&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Establish a strategic roadmap for sequencing
the wheat and barley genomes in the next few years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
workshop will bring together international experts in the human and
agriculturally-important genome sequencing projects, developers of genome
sequencing technologies, scientists with extensive knowledge of the structure
and organization of the wheat and barley genomes, representatives of
international genome sequencing centers interested in de novo sequencing of
plant species, as well as representatives of governmental funding agencies. The
workshop will last two days and will result in a summary document that will be
distributed to all participants as well as others interested in advances in
wheat and barley genomics.
