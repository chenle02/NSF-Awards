9353465 Babu This 36-month project supports the efforts of the Connecticut
statewide systemic initiative in Connecticut by providing minicourses and
resources to teachers in the 67 local school districts. The project delivers
short courses ranging from 2 to 14 hours to teachers on topics identified by the
needs assessment. Summer sessions are one or two weeks long and "provide a forum
for additional instruction and acquisition of skills, and for networking and
sharing of problems and ideas." Academic year institutes include topics like
Early Childhood Math, Marine Science Project: For Sea, Music and Science in the
Classroom. Key to this project is that the local community or staff identify
their needs and receive support and help in those area. Partners in this project
include the university, all school districts, and the local community. In this
proposal, 45 schools are connected via the Internet so they can reach mentors,
share resources, and interact with their colleagues in conjunction with and
after the workshops. Cost sharing is estimated at 71%
