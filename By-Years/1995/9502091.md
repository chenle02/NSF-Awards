Advances in computer and telecommunication technologies enable network
communication from any location and mobility that will lead to new collaborative
database applications. This research focuses on data management demanded by
these new mobile applications, that extends beyond the traditional distributed
database management. Specifically, its goal is to develop appropriate protocols
(1) for the management of mobile data replicated on both mobile and stationary
hosts over low-bandwidth and tenuous wireless network connections, and (2) for
the processing of transactions and activities that produce and access these
mobile data. Given the inherent resource limitations on a mobile host and the
fact that disconnections do not necessarily imply the failure of the
disconnected machine, recovery and disconnection management are approached in an
integrated manner. This research combines both theoretical investigation,
building on the ACTA extended transaction framework, and empirical evaluation
that will result in an experimental platform for mobile and wireless distributed
computer systems. By considering t he pragmatic issues in developing protocols
for mobile data management, this investigation will facilitate the development
of such important applications as telemedicine that support remote diagnostics
or surgical interventions. The experimental laboratory to be established will
also provide hands-on experience for undergraduate students exposing them to the
research process itself, thereby encouraging their development of mature
scientific thinking.
