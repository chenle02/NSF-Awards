This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
Program. This study compares the formation and changes in roles and activities
of ethnic organizations serving Jews and Italians in Argentina and Venezuela. It
draws on theories of immigrant and ethnic integration and tests their
applicability to Latin America. Data are based on existing records from 1940 to
the 1990s obtained from newspapers, ethnic organizations, and ethnic schools.
%%% This research will contribute to sociological understanding of how immigrant
ethnic groups form communities that foster (or impede) their integration into
host societies. It will also add generally to understanding Latin American
societies and how they compare to the United States. In addition to the
scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially
assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D.
dissertation. Thus it contributes to the thorough training of the next
generation of social scientists.
