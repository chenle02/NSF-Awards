9453935 Pine This project is designed to promote district-wide change to hands-
on inquiry science teaching in the elementary schools of at least fourteen
school districts. The model to be supported builds on the experience of the
Caltech Precollege Science Initiative (CAPSI), in collaboration with school
districts in Pasadena, California, Maui, Hawaii, and Conejo Valley, California.
The main features of the model are the initial creation of a fully transformed
pilot school, that embodies total teacher support, including science materials,
ongoing professional development, and frequent collegial interaction with a
mentoring resource teacher. Critical to the entire change effort is the
partnership of the school district with practicing scientists and engineers from
a university, college, industry, or the community. During this project CAPSI
would work with fourteen urban school districts in California to bring about
similar change. The total cost sharing of just Caltech and Pasadena will be 10
percent of the NSF portion of the award. ***
