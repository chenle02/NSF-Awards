8902139 Thomas Thomas intends to examine what kinds of stable omega-categorical
pseudoplanes can be constructed via variations on Hrushovski's method. He also
plans to study omega-stable subsets and regular types in stable omega-
categorical structures. He will continue his work on extremal problems in
infinite permutation groups.
