Recent observations of the atmosphere and ocean have suggested that the
atmospheric input of mineral dust is a significant source of iron the the
euphotic zone in much of the ocean. In some regions with high concentrations of
major nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate and silicate, the supply of iron from
the atmosphere is insufficient to allow phytoplankton growth that would
otherwise develop. In this study the effect of atmospheric iron on phytoplankton
growth, the influence of other metals also present in the sea and their
interaction with iron, and the processing of iron by phytoplankton will be
examined. %%% Growth of plants in the sea depends upon the presence and amount
of fertilizer, just as growth of land plants requires fertilizer. In recent
months observations of the atmosphere and the ocean have suggested that iron
concentrations in the sea may be governed by input from atmospheric dust. Iron
is necessary for plant growth, and thus the cycles by which iron is added to the
oceans and its interaction with other metals in the sea and with the plants of
the sea, are potentially major factors governing plant growth and biomass in the
upper layers of the ocean. This study addresses both plant utilization of metals
and metal concentrations and interactions in the sea.
