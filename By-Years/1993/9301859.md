This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at the University of California at Los Angeles in the
purchase of a new console and probes and a new set of field homogeneity shims
for a 500 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. These items will be
used with the existing 11.5 Tesla superconducting magnet, which is still in
excellent condition. The research projects which will be enhanced by the
acquisition of this instrument include: 1) Multidimensional NMR spectral
analysis of DNA-Drug, intramolecular DNA-Peptide, carbohydrate-DNA and RNA-
Protein interactions using synthetically modified biopolymers, 2) Host-Guest
chemistry: Preservation of highly strained molecules by their incarceration, 3)
Study of the synthesis and reactivity of novel boranes, carboranes and
metallacarboranes, and synthetic organic chemistry, 4) Exploratory studies in
dynamic, pericycle, and radical organometallic chemistry. %%% The Department of
Chemistry at UCLA also has an excellent record in the development, use and
maintenance of cutting-edge scientific equipment and a strong, outstanding
record in training their students, both graduate and undergraduate, in the use
of such instrumentation. This proposal will assist in the purchase of a modern
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This instrument is an essential
tool for faculty members at the University of California-Los Angeles engaged in
chemical research. The instrument provides important information which in most
cases can be used to determine the geometric and/or molecular structure of newly
synthesized molecules.
