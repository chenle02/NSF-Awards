This award provides funds to partially support the Fifth North American Meeting
of New Researchers in Statistics and Probability, sponsored by the Institute of
Mathematical Statistics. The primary objective is to provide a venue for
interaction among new researchers in statistics and probability. The conference
will take place from July 31 - August 3, 2001, on the Georgia Institute of
Technology campus in Atlanta, Georgia, just prior to the annual Joint
Statistical Meetings to be held in Atlanta. Participants will include
approximately 50 statisticians and probabilists who have received their Ph.D.
within 5 years of the conference or who expect to receive their Ph.D. within 1
year of the conference. Presentations by 4 senior speakers and roundtable
discussions on the processes of publishing and grant funding (with participants
from NSA, NSF, ONR, and NIH) are also part of the schedule.
