In this project of the Physical Chemistry program in the Chemistry Division,
Profs. M. Keil and G. Parker of the University of Oklahoma will undertake a
joint theoretical-experimental investigation of the dynamics of the rotational
energy transfer occurring in the non-reactive scattering between argon atoms and
hydrogen fluoride molecules, as well as in the fundamental reaction of fluorine
atoms with molecular hydrogen. The principal goal is to measure the rotationally
resolved state-to-state cross sections for reactions that produce HF.
Determining the differential scattering cross sections for atom-molecule pairs,
with molecules in specific excited rotation-vibration states is a new and
difficult undertaking. This research promises to produce important information
on the dynamics of chemical reactions.
