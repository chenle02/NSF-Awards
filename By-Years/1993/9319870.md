9319870 Comaroff This project involves the dissertation research of a student
in cultural anthropology from the University of Chicago. The student will
investigate political conflict in the Maldives. Using ethnographic techniques of
participant observation and in- depth interviews, the student will examine how
the local state legitimates its actions by claims to religious authority, and
how that claim is contested by local religious practitioners of magic and other
informal religions. This research is important because political power in many
states is legitimated by official claims of religious authorization or
legitimacy. Advances in our understanding of how this legitimization comes
about, and how it is defended against counter-claims, can help us deal with like
situations of political-religious conflict in other places. The project will
also advance our scientific capacity by training a student in social science
techniques and in regional studies of the important area of South Asia. ***
