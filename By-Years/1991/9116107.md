The primary objectives of this U.S.-Poland research project between Dr. Ajay K.
Bose of Stevens Institute of Technology, and Dr. Marek Chmielewski of the
Institute of Organic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland, is
to synthesize chiral B-lactams, an important group of heterocycles including
antibiotics. Work will emphasize variously substituted optically active
B-lactams and their stereoselective conversion to versatile synthetic
intermediates as well as to natural products such as sugars, amino acids,
alkaloids, and antibiotics. The researchers' capabilities in X-ray diffraction
and other instrumental methods for structure determination are complimentary;
both groups share a common interest in synthetic techniques involving novel
forms of energy input such as high pressure, ultrasonic, and microwave
radiation. This project in synthetic organic chemistry fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
