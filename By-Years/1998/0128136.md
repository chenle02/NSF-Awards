&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will develop technologies to&lt;br/&gt;automatically generate large
meshes appropriate for finite element and similar analyses.&lt;br/&gt;This will
be done using scalable, parallel algorithms that will enable the generation
of&lt;br/&gt;meshes on distributed parallel computers including workstation
clusters. The result of&lt;br/&gt;this project will be software that is capable
of generating meshes with hundreds of&lt;br/&gt;millions, or billions of
elements in an efficient manner. The generated meshes will&lt;br/&gt;already be
partitioned to be compatible with the needs of parallel analysis
codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications of this research are in
those industries that need to perform&lt;br/&gt;large scale simulations of
complex problems over general domains. The procedures to be&lt;br/&gt;developed
will allow simulation based design technologies to be applied to
applications&lt;br/&gt;that demand massive simulations.&lt;br/&gt;
