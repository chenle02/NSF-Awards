This award supports travel expenses for the Principal Investigator and a Ph.D
candidate to attend and present an invited paper of research results at the
International Scientific conference on Digital Libraries to be held in
Petrozavodsk, Russia in September, 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The presentation
by the Principal Investigator at this event serves multiple purposes. His area
of research, image database security, is a critical one to the development of
generally accessible international Digital Libraries. This conference is an
important one for the active Russian Digital Libraries community and brings
together international experts to discuss international research collaboration
issues involved in building a global information infrastructure. Dr. Wang will
be one of few US speakers and will continue to demonstrate the US digital
libraries community's interest and support for Russian efforts in this area.
Funding is being provided by the Division of International Programs.&lt;br/&gt;
