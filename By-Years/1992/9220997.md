Under this US-Czech Joint Fund research project, Dr. Jiri Niederle, Institute
of Physics, Czech Academy of Sciences, and Dr. Karel V. Kuchar, University of
Utah, will examine three topics in quantum theories of gravity and black hole
astrophysics: 1) Gauge formulation of gravity theories, 2) Fermion- boson
quantum equivalence, 3) Minisuperspace quantization, and 4) Black hole
electrodynamics and the membrane paradigm. In gravity theories, the researchers
expect to clarify the status of gravity or supergravity as a gauge system, to
extend the fermion-boson equivalence from 1+1 to 3+1 dimensions and to provide
the general framework for minisuperspace quantization and apply it to spacetimes
with horizons. In relativistic astrophysics, they intend to clarify the energy
generation close to the horizon of a rotating black hole in simplified dynamo
models of active galactic nuclei. This research in theoretical physics fulfills
the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
experts in the U.S. and Czech Republic to combine complementary talents and pool
research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. Funds for
the project are awarded through the US-Czech Joint Fund, Prague, in accordance
with established guidelines.
