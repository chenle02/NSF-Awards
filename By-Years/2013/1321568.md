This project will improve our knowledge and understanding of the nature and
variability of African easterly wave characteristics and the processes that
determine the predictability of African easterly waves at daily-to-intraseasonal
timescales. The work is planned around two complementary themes: (i) variability
of AEWs and (ii) predictability of AEWs. The variability-work will combine
statistical analysis of observations and NWP analyses supported by idealized
modeling and a case-study approach to determine the extent to which AEW
characteristics vary at daily-to-intraseasonal timescales and why. The
predictability work will be explored using forecast sensitivity analyses and
will interact strongly with and benefit from the variability work.

AEWs provide an opportunity to understand atmospheric predictability for a class
of phenomenon where dry and moist dynamics are of equal importance, unlike
midlatitude systems that are primarily associated with dry dynamics. Increased
knowledge and understanding of the variability and predictability of AEWs is
important for weather forecasters concerned with the West African region as well
as those interested in the potential for tropical cyclogenesis downstream. The
knowledge gained in this project will be used to update the diagnostics on our
webpages used for routine monitoring of AEWs and AEW-activity that are used by
such forecasters. AEWs are responsible for a significant amount of rainfall
during the boreal summer, this work is also applicable to a range of
applications important for society including hydrology (and flood prediction),
agriculture (and crop prediction) and health (including malaria risk
assessments). While such applications will not be dealt with in this project,
efforts will be made to communicate the results of this research to the relevant
communities. One way to do this will be through communication with scientists
working in these areas within the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis
(AMMA) project.
