This project constructs two portable computer laboratories, one in the
Department of Mathematical Sciences, and the other in the College of Business's
Department of Decision Sciences. The laboratories, made of laptop computers, do
not require that a classroom be converted into a computer facility. The
classroom is made more versatile by having network access. The two departments
are collaborating on revitalizing Business Calculus. The traditional course is
being replaced by one that focuses on analyzing real-world business applications
and that makes heavy use of standard business software, e.g., spreadsheets; the
interdisciplinary aspect of the team of investigators ensures that the material
developed is truly applicable to business. Symbolic algebra programs are used
for higher-level symbolic analysis. The students have laboratory projects that
they must analyze and solve and for which they must submit written reports. The
projects are designed to be used in, and thus enhance, both courses.
