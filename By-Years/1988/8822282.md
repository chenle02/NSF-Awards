This project will supply shipboard scientific equipment for the research vessels
COLUMBUS ISELIN and CALANUS, operated by the University of Miami, Rosenstiel
School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, and dedicated to use in support of
ocean science research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program
provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe
conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such items
as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of
scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and
earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites,
communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers
for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as
motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval
sites. The Project Director, Ronald Hutchinson is fully qualified to direct this
project having had considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and
installation of shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution to
develope a ship's motion compensation system for improved winch control, replace
a worn out bow crane, acquire a winch for improved wire handling, outfit a
special van for radioisotope work, improve radar, communications and weather
notification systems, replace two outboard motors and install upgraded fume
hoods.
