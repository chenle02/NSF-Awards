This research focuses on the physics of chemically prepared quantum dots. Four
problems are targeted: controlling the quantum dot size and size distribution,
fabricating arrays of quantum dots, generating samples with quantum dots in a
semiconducting host, and understanding the role of the quantum dot-host
interface.
