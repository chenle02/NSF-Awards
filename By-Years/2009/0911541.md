Peter Pulay of the University of Arkansas and Michel Dupuis of Washington State
University are supported by an award from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry program to develop methods that extend the current limits of
applicability of electronic structure methods in two currently difficult
research areas. They are developing algorithms to reduce the computational cost
of ab initio based QM/MM (quantum/molecular mechanics) Monte Carlo or molecular
dynamics free energy calculations of molecules electronically embedded in a
medium (solvent or protein matrix) by several orders of magnitude. Additionally,
they are working on a method that replaces atom-centered basis functions for the
diffuse part of the electron density by plane waves in accurate quantum
calculations.

Software and algorithms originated by these scientists have become widely
adopted by the community. Pulay and Dupuis are exploiting the educational
possibilities of computer modeling through graphical computer simulations. These
ideas are implemented in a three week course being presented to undergraduates
at several colleges and universities including an Historically Black University.
