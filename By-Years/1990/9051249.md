This college is one of a select group of small, primarily undergraduate
institutions that has been particularly successful in preparing undergraduates
for graduate work in chemistry. Success is attributed to a long tradition of
strong undergraduate research participation and to the department's ability to
expose undergraduates to modern instrumentation. Through this project, new
instrumentation was acquired to enable the faculty to develop innovative
experiments involving temporal dependent measurements in the upper level labs.
The instrumentation, which was a natural extension of previous facilities,
allowed the department to expose students to equipment which can probe time
scales from nanoseconds to seconds and energetic processes from the UV/VIS to
the radiofrequency range. The equipment made a major impact on the Chemical
Instrumentation, Physical Chemistry, Biochemistry and Senior Research courses.
The specific items acquired were a fluorescence lifetime instrument, a variable
temperature probe for the NMR, and components for the addition of an IR laser to
their flash photolysis apparatus. The institution contributed to this project in
an amount equal to the NSF funds.
