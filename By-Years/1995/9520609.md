9520609 BRYANT The proposed research centers on the effects of (1) adaptation to
the captive environment, (2) population size, and (3) founder size on population
fitness, genetic variation, and evolutionary flexibility. By combining life
history, quantitative genetic, and allozyme assays, evidence will be gathered on
the correlation between different types of genetic variation and population
fitness. Preliminary data on adaptation to the captive environment has shown
highly significant changes in a whole suite of life history traits and a
significant loss of fitness. The loss of fitness may be due to an increase in
the frequency of detrimental recessive alleles. The hypothesis that the level of
genetic variation in populations of endangered species correlates strongly with
that population's fitness and evolutionary potential is widely accepted but has
yet to be tested empirically. The proposed research will provide empirical
evidence with application to (1) predicting minimum viable population sizes of
animals needed for reserves and zoological parks, (2) recommending breeding
strategies for captive species of animals, and (3) assessing the likelihood of
successful reintroduction of captive bred animals to the wild.
