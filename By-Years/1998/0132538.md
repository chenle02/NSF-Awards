James Skinner of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, is supported by the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop a general framework
within which to calculate time- and frequency-domain vibrational spectra of
solutes in liquid solvents. This approach builds on the work of others, where
the solute and vibrational degrees of freedom are treated quantum mechanically,
and the solute's rotations and translations and all solvent degrees of freedom
are treated classically. The framework involves renormalization of the solute
vibrations by the average interactions with the solvent, and so is expected to
be able to describe systems with strong solute-solvent interactions. The
theoretical approach will be applied to the following systems for which
experiments have been performed: 1) HOD in liquid D2O (vibrational spectroscopy
of the OH stretch), 2) the azide anion in liquid D2O (phonon vibrational
spectroscopy of the azide anion asymmetric stretch), and 3) supercritical fluid
oxygen and nitrogen (Raman spectroscopy). Finally, some general issues involving
vibrational energy relaxation of solutes in polyatomic liquid solvents will be
investigated.

Many industrially and biologically important chemical reactions take place in
liquid solution. The presence of solvent molecules are around a solute molecule
can greatly affect rates and mechanisms of chemical reactions by changing the
relative energy levels and providing pathways for efficient energy flow into and
out of the solvent. This research project aims to provide a molecular level
interpretation of the influence a solvent has on chemical and biological
processes in condensed phases.
