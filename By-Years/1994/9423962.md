9423962 Michaelson This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the
Promotion of Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. David Michaelson of the
University of California in Los Angeles. This fellowship opportunity will
facilitate a collaborative effort between Dr. Michaelson and the laboratory of
Dr. Yanagida of Kyoto University to explore a possible link between the control
of the yeast cell cycle and intracellular signaling mechanisms. The purpose of
this is to understand how cell division is affected by the external environment.
Dr. Yanagida's laboratory is well established in the field of cell-cycle
regulation. This provides Dr. Michaelson with an ideal opportunity to study both
cell-cycle regulation and fission yeast genetics in one of the leading labs in
the field. Furthermore, this collaboration provides a rare opportunity to study
the interaction between intracellular signaling mechanisms and cell-cycle
regulation. Since such mechanisms also function to control cell proliferation
and differentiation in animals, this collaboration combines Dr. Yanagida's
expertise in yeast cell-cycle regulation with Dr. Michaelson's interest in the
regulation of proliferation and differentiation of animal cells. ***
