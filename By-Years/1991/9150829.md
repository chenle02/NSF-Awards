While at the professional level, the social sciences have a well- defined body
of tools to use in experimentation, at the undergraduate level, the focus
remains primarily on the humanistic roots of the disciplines. The academy has
long wrestled with the problem of integrating theory and methods at appropriate
undergraduate levels with scattered success. Students seldom make the connection
between courses like econometrics and intermediate macroeconomic theory. Indeed,
they tend to see econometrics as just another course, rather than the heart of
economic scientific inquiry. Similar stories are heard in geography, sociology
and political science. By taking the method and theory courses separately,
students do not use method to reinforce theory and vice versa. Beginning with
second semester freshmen and sophomores, an introduction to social science
methods course would allow students to blend these ideas from the start. With
appropriate laboratory exercises, students would also have a broader
understanding of the social sciences as a whole and an appreciation for the
similarities and differences between methods used by each discipline. This
course will weave quantitative method into the fabric of the social sciences.
