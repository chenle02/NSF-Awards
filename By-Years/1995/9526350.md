This project, funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program, will support the continuation of studies by Professor Patricia A.
Shapley, of the University of Illinois, into the organometallic chemistry of the
iron triad. A major area for consideration is the chemistry of alkyl-imido-
cyclopentadienylosmium(VI) and -ruthenium(VI) complexes, which transfer the
imido group to organic substrates. Attempts will be made to synthesis oxo and
sulfido analogs that will also react with organic substrates to transfer these
groups. A secondary objective of this phase of the work is to make these
reactions catalytic and/or chiral. Chiral forms of heteronuclear species formed
from a dialkyl nitridoosmium complex and chromate ion, which was earlier found
to oxidize primary and secondary alcohols, have recently been synthesized.
Attempts will be made to resolve these complexes and study their effectiveness
as reagents for chiral resolution of secondary alcohols. A third area to be
considered is the preparation and study of high oxidation state alkyl iron
(III/IV) complexes, and neutral oxo iron(IV) complexes. The former will be
generated by chemical or electrochemical oxidation of known alkyliron(II)
complexes and the latter from reduction of the ferrate anion. Some examples of
oxoiron(IV) complexes that are soluble in organic solvents are already
available. This project has as its primary objective the acquisition of a
fundamental understanding of the chemical reactivity of several new classes of
organometallic compounds that contain one of the elements from the iron family.
Whereas the specific objectives are to understand the factors that determine the
stability and reactivity of these compounds, there is considerable potential for
the development of reagents that have applications in the synthesis of organic
compounds. This may ultimately provide for better ways to synthesize known
biologically active compounds, or to prepare new ones.
