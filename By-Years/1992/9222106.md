One of the most significant advances in our understanding of development of the
brain during the past two decades is the realization that nerve connections made
during embryonic life undergo substantial rearrangement as the nervous system
matures. Some connections are eliminated, while others become strengthened and
stabilized. Evidence suggests that this rearrangement results from a competitive
interaction between adjacent nerve connections in a manner that depends upon the
pattern of nerve activity, which is in turn triggered by the sensory input from
the environment. This activity-dependent competition between adjacent
connections has been observed in both central and peripheral nervous systems,
but the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is poorly understood. In the
previous granting period of this project, it was discovered that activity-
dependent competition can be observed in isolated synaptic connections in a
simple cell culture. This finding opens the possibility of experimentally
addressing the problem of synaptic competition effectively at cellular and
molecular levels. In the present project, a series of experiments will be
carried out that will result in an insight into the mechanism responsible for
modulating the strength of synaptic connections. This should lead to an
understanding of how adjacent synapses on a single postsynaptic cell compete for
survival and of the physiological and morphological changes at the synapse
during the process of synaptic competition. The results from these studies will
help us to understand how nerve connections are modified during development of
the nervous system.
