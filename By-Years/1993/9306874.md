This Career Advancement Award is providing Dr. Bertani with an introduction to
the genetic and molecular biological techniques necessary to work with the
fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This organism can be easily cultured
and manipulated like a bacterium, yet it resembles higher eukaryotes in the
regulation of cellular processes like cell division and transcription. Gene
amplification is being studied with the intention of describing the initial
events that deregulate normal cellular controls and allow gene amplification to
occur at a relatively high frequency. %%% Gene amplification has been
demonstrated in animal cells, but it has been difficult to determine what
happens in the earliest stages of that process. Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a
fission yeast that has a wealth of already described mutations affecting many
different cellular processes, and studies of gene amplification in this organism
should provide insight into how it occurs in animals.
