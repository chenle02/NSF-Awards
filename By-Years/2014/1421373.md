Open-audit cryptographic voting protocols enable the verification of election
outcomes, independent of whether election officials or polling machines behave
honestly. Many open-audit voting systems have been prototyped and deployed. The
City of Takoma Park, MD held its 2009 and 2011 city elections using voting
system Scantegrity. Systems with similar properties are being proposed for use
in Victoria, Australia (the Pret a Voter system) and Travis County, Texas (the
STAR-Vote system). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project obtains rigorous results
on the properties of in-person voting protocols'-in particular the Scantegrity,
Pret a Voter and STAR-Vote protocols. It further examines the properties of
classes of in-person protocols and the limits to their achievement of desirable
properties. It thus improves our understanding of the security properties of
voting systems that are being used in real governmental
elections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proposes new protocols where voters
and virtual observers use a peer network of untrusted computational assistants
to improve protocol properties. It provides a software library for the
development of open-audit voting systems.
