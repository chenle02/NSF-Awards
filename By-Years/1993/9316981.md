9316981 Aguilera The goal of this research is to further characterize the
molecular and biochemical mechanisms involved in lymphocyte- specific DNA
recombination. We have isolated and partially characterized a nuclease activity,
Endo-S, which we believe is intimately involved in the isotype switch
recombination process. We will continue to biochemically characterize Endo-S,
sequence the native protein derived from it and generate a specific antisera to
it. We will attempt to clone the gene encoding Endo-S and express it. We will
also isolate and characterize any factors associated with it. %%% It is thought
that this endonuclease, Endo-S, is involved in the DNA rearrangements which
account for the large numbers of different antibodies which can be made by
mammals. There is also suggestive evidence that it may also be involved in
somatic DNA rearrangements which could have less desirable consequences, such as
DNA translocations associated with oncogenes. A complete characterization of
this protein could lead to a better understanding of its functional role in
several different cellular processes. ***
