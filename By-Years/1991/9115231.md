Dr. William Porter is the Director of the Adirondack Ecological Center, which
is administered by the State University of New York. The Center supports field
research conducted by resident and visiting investigators in a variety of
habitats, including lakes, streams, and the transition from eastern deciduous
forests to boreal forests. Dr. Porter proposes to acquire new climatic sensors
and automated recording instruments for the Center's meteorological station.
This facility improvement will increase the precision and reliability of the
weather data collected at the Center. These data are used in research projects
that address diverse topics including wildlife management, effects of acid rain,
and population dymanics. The new instruments will confer significant benefits on
a variety of studies.
