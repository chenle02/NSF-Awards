Numerical-valued index theories for G-spaces and G-pairs, when G is a compact
Lie group, play an important role in the Ljusternik-Schnirelmann method and in
theorems of the Bourgin- Yang type. The investigators have begun a study of an
ideal- valued theory which can handle situations where the numerical- valued
indices fail. A striking application is a Borsuk-Ulam theorem for maps on a
Stiefel manifold with orthogonal group action where the numerical index is
inadequate. This ideal- valued theory can be carried over to the case when the
symmetry group G is not compact, within the context of infinitesimal deRham
G-cohomology, and can be applied to obtain Borsuk-Ulam theorems where G is not
compact. A deeper study of the ideal- valued theory as it applies to the
critical point theory of invariant functionals, to Borsuk-Ulam theorems and to
the equivariant J-homomorphism is a primary objective. The investigators also
plan to continue their research in fixed point theory with special emphasis on
the Nielsen fixed point theory of G-maps and local Reidemeister trace theory.
They have made successful application of their prior work along these lines to
establish the existence of equilibria for certain economic models.
