This research project conducts a systematic investigation of the parameters
affecting the efficiency of dynamic compaction in granular soils. The
experimental phase will include large-scale laboratory tests with dynamic
measurements of soil pressures and tamper acceleration during impact, and static
measurements of strains within the soil mass following each tamper drop. These
measurements are essential or the analysis of the dynamic soil-tamper
interaction. The analytical phase will include the development of a dynamic
model for the analysis of soil behavior under impact loads. In addition, a
finite element computer code with dynamic elastic-viscoplastic large strain
constitutive model for soils will be used. Laboratory and field test results
will be compared with the analytical model and the finite element analysis
results. The final goal of this study is the fundamental understanding of the
mechanism of dynamic compaction and the development of rational engineering
guidelines for design.
