This grant will fund an interdisciplinary conference on statistics and
astronomy which will be held at The Pennsylvania State University on August
11-14, 1991. In recent years, astronomers have shown considerable interest in
using advanced statistical techniques, such as survival analysis, sampling
theory and spatial analysis. However, not many statisticians are aware of the
problems in astronomy where statistics plays an important role, such as
luminosity functions and nondetections, galaxy clustering and image analysis.
This conference will bridge the gap between the two communities, exposing
researchers and students of the two communities to the common problems of the
two fields. The sessions will begin with an invited review talk by an astronomer
describing the important data analysis problems in an area. These problems will
be discussed by statisticians. Particular data analysis problems and methods of
solution will then be addressed in contributed presentations.
