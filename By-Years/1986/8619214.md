This research seeks to 1) describe the vegetational history of central Alaska
between 14,000 and 125,000 yr B.P.; 2) reconstruct past climate during this
period based on palynological and geological data; and 3) compare these
paleoclimatic reconstructions with a regional model of Alaska climate based on
computer simulations of global climate. The vegatation history will be described
from new palynological data coupled with results of previous paleoenvironmental
studies. Response surface analyses and autoecological requirements of indicator
species will be used to infer past climate from the pollen records. Global
simulations, run with various combinations of boundary controls, will form the
basis for modeling regional paleoclimates for Alaska. Data-model comparisons
will be done to assess the correspondence between simulations and paleoclimatic
records in Alaska. The results of this project will significantly expand the
understanding of environmental change at high latitudes during the late
Pleistocene and will provide a rare opportunity to examine data- model
comparisons over a long period of time. Such an examination is essential for
evaluating the ability to predict responses of climatic and terrestrial systems
to future variations in boundary controls.
