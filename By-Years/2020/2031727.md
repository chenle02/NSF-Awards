The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will advance a new vaccine delivery technology against new emerging
pathogens such as that causing COVID-19. This project will develop a new process
that can be rapidly manufactured with high affinity and precision-engineered
immune responses. The technology is based on new materials that can be injected
to help support the immune system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance a novel vaccine delivery
technology using flowable hyper-porous and synthetic materials. This new
material technology can be easily injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly to
deliver vaccine antigens. The material itself acts as a long-lasting antigen
delivery vehicle, increasing antibody production and polarizing the immune
system to maximize protective immunity against the delivered antigens. This
project specifically focuses on development of this novel material to create
multifactor immunity against the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to protect
against COVID-19.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
