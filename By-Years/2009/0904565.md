Mean-field spin glass models and, in particular, the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick
model were better understood in the past several years following the discovery
of the replica symmetry breaking interpolation by Francesco Guerra and the proof
of the celebrated Parisi formula for the free energy by Michel Talagrand. The
current proposal consists of several directions of research that will attempt to
build upon recent progress. One project proposes to study whether the Ghirlanda-
Guerra identities for the distribution of the overlaps, which arise from a
certain stochastic stability property of the Gibbs measure, imply the Parisi
ultrametricity conjecture. Another project concerns a number of natural
analogues of the Guerra replica symmetry breaking interpolation for various spin
glass models, such as the perceptron, Hopfield, diluted p-spin and p-sat models.
In all these models such interpolations formally reproduce the solutions
predicted by theoretical physicists, but since the methodology of the proof of
the Parisi formula in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model does not directly apply
to these models, one needs to find new ways to control the error terms in these
interpolations. In addition, the proposal includes several other questions
regarding the joint distribution of the overlaps in the spherical Sherrington-
Kirkpatrick model, properties of the Parisi functional, and characterization of
the replica symmetric region in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model via the
Almeida-Thouless line.

Several models in statistical mechanics, called mean-field spin glass models,
were originally introduced and studied by theoretical physicists who developed
an impressive heuristic theory that gave detailed predictions about the behavior
of these models and that influenced many other areas of research well beyond the
scope of the original problems. Rigorous mathematical proofs of some of the
physicist's predictions required a number of new ideas and approaches that are
likely to be useful in other areas of probability, statistical physics, computer
science and statistics. Current proposal will continue research in several
promising directions.
