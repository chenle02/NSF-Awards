Under this award the PIs will be responsible for the duration of the Woods
Hole&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic Institution Sea Floor Samples laboratory. With
continued funding the repository will be able to keep pace with the expanding
demands for material and data related to their extensive collection, enabling a
wide array of global research programs to begin, continue or be enhanced by the
use of previously acquired marine geological samples. In the most recent grant
period, the repository shared more than 18,000 samples with investigators from
more than forty universities and research institutions located in eight nations
around the world. In addition the repository had added 284 new cores, 202 new
dredge samples and 58 new sample locations from seventeen Alvin dives. The
repository will support and update a map-based search site
www.whoi.edu/corelab/explore that includes thousands of core and dredge
descriptions in PDF format that are available for immediate downloading or
online browsing which makes possible instantaneous broad access to our wealth of
information via this 'open channel' of communication. The repository also
provides access to technical advice on sampling operations and a suite of modern
and well-maintained, custom-built equipment for the gathering of sea floor
samples of all types. Annually, the lab will lead numerous educational and
technical groups through its facilities at the Mclean laboratory to describe the
procedures in the sample acquisition process and display and describe the many
types of sea floor materials that make up the collection. With the award the lab
will continue to sustain all of the sample archiving and acquisition support
activities.&lt;br/&gt;
