This award will provide partial funding toward the purchase of a computer
system to meet the scientific needs of the Caltech Seismology Laboratory. The
system requested consists of a network of workstations, fileservers, and a
vector.parallel superminicomputer connected to each other and to the national
supercomputers by high.speed links. Over 50% matching funds will be provided by
the Institute and private industry. Computers are the main research tools of the
faculty and students of the Seismological Laboratory. They will become
increasingly important as more digital seismic data become available and as more
observational constraints and deeper understanding of the underlying physics
drive increasingly sophisticated modeling efforts in tectonophysics, mineral
physics, and planetary geophysics. The Caltech Seismological Laboratory has been
a leader in all of these areas of research, and the new computer system will
allow them access to parallel and vector architectures and the software tools to
carry it out in a modern computational environment.
