It has been difficult to develop robust, adaptive, goal- directed robotic
behaviors based on sensory inputs, and to reprogramm robotic systems to carry
out new tasks. This study will develop a hybrid control system that merges a
knowledge- based control architecture with trainable neural-network modules. The
control structure will handle task control and data management while the neural-
net modules process sensor data and control actuator servos. Research will
characterize relationships between network parameters and storable function
types, speed of training, accuracy, and time delay effects; define boundaries
between neural processing and more conventional task representation; and define
methods of extracting model descriptions from trained neural nets. Demonstration
tasks employing hardware implementations will be used to validate results. A
prototype of a testbed hybrid control system is planned for Phase II, with Phase
III development of the testbed into a low-cost, trainable, PC-based tool set to
allow fast programming specification of complex sensorimotor tasks.
