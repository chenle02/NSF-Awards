Mathematical Sciences (21) This project is adapting and implementing the WeBWork
homework "delivery" and grading system to help improve the success of students
in College Algebra. The project builds on the successful use of WeBWorK to
increase homework activity of students in calculus classes in several
institutions. This project is now extending the use of the system to a large
service class, College Algebra, with a total enrollment of 720 students each
academic year at the PI's institution. The collection of problem sets created
using the PG (problem generator) programming language developed for WeBWorK is
being shared with other WeBWorK authors for distribution. In addition, training
workshops are being conducted for an average of eight faculty per semester who
are using WeBWorK directly in College Algebra classes. During the final year of
the project, faculty from area high schools, community colleges and other
institutions of higher education are to take part in training sessions with
WeBWorK and to share information about its effectiveness.
