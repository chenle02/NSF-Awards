Emily Carter of UCLA is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
Program and the Materials Theory Program to continue exploring methodologies
that aim to develop systematic first principles improvements to density
functional theory (DFT) predictions of energetics, structure, and forces in a
local region of condensed matter, enabling the investigation of phenomena such
as local many-body excited states on metals by first principles techniques. The
specific project goals are: (1) to extend the current technique to multi-
reference single and double excitation configuration interaction (MRSDCI)
embedding theory, in order that surface reactions involving simultaneous
breaking/forming of multiple covalent bonds can be studied quantitatively, (2)
to implement reduced scaling local pseudo-spectral MRSDCI within the embedding
theory so that medium-sized molecule-surface reactions can be examined, (3) to
implement forces in the embedding theory so that structure optimization and
dynamics can be performed, (4) to continue various aspects of method
benchmarking, (5) to apply the method to ground state adsorbate-surface systems
where DFT has been shown to fail, (6) and to apply the method to many-body
physics problems involving multiple excited states. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
development of accurate techniques for the first principles prediction of
condensed matter energetics, forces, and structure remains a challenging
research goal with practical implications. Applications of such computer
simulation methods can lead to insights that encourage changes in current
technologies to more environmentally friendly industrial processes, more
efficient sources of energy, and the production of more advanced materials.
