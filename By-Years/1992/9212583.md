The importance of genetic factors to the short-term survival of natural
populations is not known. Small populations lose genetic variation due to
genetic drift (random loss) more quickly than large populations, and may
experience inbreeding depression. However, the relationship between inbreeding,
genetic variation, and population survival is unclear. The first part of this
proposal research project will examine the importance of genetic variation on
the immediate survival of small populations. The PIs will test whether
populations founded with greater initial genetic variation are more likely to
persist, as measured by smaller fluctuations in population size and larger mean
size, than populations founded with lower amounts of genetic variation.
Secondly, the PIs propose to examine the effectiveness of migration in reducing
the potentially detrimental effects of inbreeding and genetic drift. The effect
of different levels of migration on population fecundity will be assessed.
Information regarding the minimum rates of migration needed to balance the
detrimental effects of inbreeding and drift is necessary for prescribing
management procedures on isolated, small populations of rare species.
