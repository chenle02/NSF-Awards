The scientific foundation of undergraduate students majoring in Communication
Disorders is being enhanced by providing hands-on laboratory experiences through
the purchase of computer instrumentation. The use of MacSpeech Lab II with
MacAdios II as a computer processing tool for data acquisition, analysis, and
display, is the cornerstone of the project. The system is interfaced with
various transducers, enabling undergraduate students to investigate a wide range
of acoustic and physiologic parameters related to expressive and receptive
communication. The project includes development of two laboratory manuals
(Hearing and Speech Science) to facilitate experimental learning using the
equipment. These manuals, as well as the entire project, will provide directed
hands-on experiences that emphasize the fundamentals of research design, logic
and critical thinking skills. The university will contribute an amount equal to
the award.
