9410068 Bentley Establishment of the appropriate connections between neurons in
the developing nervous system depends upon the ability of neurons to migrate and
to extend processes accurately to distant target cells. Effective guidance
depends upon the ability of the tip of neuronal processes (the nerve growth
cone) to detect guidance information and to respond by appropriate direction
change, or steering. The purpose of this research is to analyze the molecular
mechanisms that underlie growth cone steering. These studies will investigate
the pathfinding of a single neuron in the methathoracic limb bud of an insect to
test the hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in the steering of
neuronal growth cones. Antiphosphotyrosine antibodies will be injected into the
growth cone and their effects on pathfinding will be determined. Tyrosine kinase
and phosphatase genes will then be cloned and used to alter the function of the
system. The results will be of fundamental importance in understanding the
processes that are involved in establishing connections between nerve cells
during development, in vertebrates as well as invertebrates.
