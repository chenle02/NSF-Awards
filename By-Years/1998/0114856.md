The researchers in this project will conduct three field seasons in Egypt with
subsequent studies on recovered fossils to be carried out at Duke and
cooperating laboratories. The objective is to learn more about the earliest
forerunners of monkeys, apes and humans. Previous discoveries have made this the
world's most important location for such research. During the projected seasons,
sites in the Fayum region will yield skulls, jaws, and skeletal parts from many
early primates of both Eocene and Oligocene age. These date between about 36 and
26 million years old. Fossils come from a dozen quarries and are seldom
recovered as associated skeletons, so that great diligence over long periods of
time is required to add knowledge by finding previously unknown and often
unassociated limb bones and skulls of the more than twenty extinct primate
species that occur there. Most of these are represented only by parts of upper
and lower jaws and, hence, much remains to be discovered. Africa appears to be
the continent where the group of monkeys, apes and humans experienced most of
its history and the Fayum holds the only continuous sequence of deposits in
Africa during the early part of the time concerned.
