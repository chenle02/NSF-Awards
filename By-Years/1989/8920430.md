This research is focused on the effects of attitude importance on people's
actions in political contexts. Does attitude importance (1) affect people's
willingness to expose themselves to all sides of an issue (2) influence their
ability to form cognitive organizational structures through which they might
integrate large masses of information (3) affect people's views of the extremity
of other's attitudes. All of these issues have implications for understanding
the manner in which people's beliefs affect their behavior. The research is
focused on political attitudes, and as such, may have some important things to
say about the manner in which cognition influences political behavior. The work
has important theoretical implications, focused as it is on the manner in which
attitude importance affects the processing of information.
