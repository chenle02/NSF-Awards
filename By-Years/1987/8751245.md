The focus of this project is on field investigations in the natural sciences
and the integration of various types of basic field data to better understand
the natural environment. During a four week summer session elementary and junior
high teachers will engage in field investigations supported by laboratory
activities and lectures. These studies will be directed at the management issues
of Idaho's public lands and will include many presentations and field
investigations lead by scientists from both government agencies and private
industry. As a part of the summer class the participants will make teaching
collections and investigate various methods of presenting such science content
in their classrooms. Follow-up activities during the next school year will
emphasize incorporation of material from the project into science teaching. Each
participant will prepare and pilot a teaching unit on a topic related to their
summer experiences and later share it with their fellow teachers. In addition,
the project director and master teachers will visit the classrooms of all
participants, and the participants will exchange classroom visitation in order
to improve their teaching methods.
