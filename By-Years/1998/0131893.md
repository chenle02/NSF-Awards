University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Digital Government: National Large-Scale City
True Orthophoto Mapping and Its Standard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will
support planning for a larger proposal to investigate the development of new 3D
algorighms for use of digital orthophoto maps in urban areas. Current usage of
such maps at high resolution in urban areas has identified problems with
perspective displacements, occlusions by tall buildings, geometric inaccuracies,
and an inability to create a seamless mosaic of large images. The grant will
also allow more complete planning of a partnership with the US Geological
Survey, which runs the NationalDigital Orthophoto Program.
