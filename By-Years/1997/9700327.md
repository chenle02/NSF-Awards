Tong 9700327 The Departments of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering,
and Chemical Engineering at Yale University will purchase a high performance,
low vacuum scanning electron microscope equipped with instrumented thermal and
mechanical loading stages. This system will provide new engineering research
capabilities and education opportunities currently unavailable at Yale and will
be used primarily to support research projects in science and engineering,
including in particular, Thin film coatings and surface roughening of aluminum
alloys-, Thermal fatigue reliability and micro-level constitutive description of
solder joints; Reliable metallizations for high temperature semiconductor
devices; Non-mean-field description of grain growth-, Ferroelectric thin films
for applications in microelectronics; Atomic-scale mechanisms of metal etching
reactions determined by high-speed variable temperature scanning tunneling
microscopy. The equipment will also enhance the quality of engineering teaching
and broaden the scope of many engineering courses at Yale, including Materials
Science, Microstructural Development in Materials, Mechanical Behavior of
Materials, several materials related laboratory sessions, and undergraduate
senior research projects.
