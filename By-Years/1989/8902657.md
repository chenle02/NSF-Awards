This award is for partial support of a symposium on approximately solved
problems. Problems are solved approximately either because we cannot solve them
exactly ir because we choose not to. There are many problems in physical
science, engineering, artificial intelligence, and economics that we cannot
solve exactly because the information (data) is partial and contaminated.
Sometimes, however, it is our own choice to settle for approximation because it
is significantly cheaper. The symposium is defined by the intersection of two
ideas: complexity and approximate solution. A complexity theory for
approximately solved problems is one that studies lower bounds on the intrinsic
difficulty of solving a problem and seeks to obtain optimal information and
optimal algorithms. It studies these questions in worst case, average case, and
probabilistic settings. The symposium includes both theory and applications.
