9416690 Eshlemann This proposal for connection of Western Maryland College to
NSFNET through SURAnet. SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the southern
United States. These connections will provide operations management and
information services and it will give the college a 56 thousand bits per second
connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)
National Backbone network. The benefits of the NSFNET connection include e-mail
between local and remote researchers and educators, file transfer capability and
the ability to use remote computer resources. Also the college will have the
ability to investigate innovation in educational resources and incorporate them
into their curricula.
