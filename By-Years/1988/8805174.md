This proposal requests support for fundamental study of seismic wave excitation
by earthquakes of anomalously long duration. They are particularly interested in
the possibility that low-velocity deformation events occur with characteristic
time scales too long to radiate significant high-frequency seismic energy, but
short enough to excite low-frequency free oscillations. To test this hypothesis,
they have developed a novel method capable of detecting low levels of free-
oscillation excitation superposed on background noise, and they propose to apply
this detector to ten years of GDSN data. Once a low- frequency event is
detected, they will derive its location, total- moment spectrum and source-
mechanism spectrum using methods developed under an expiring NSF grant.
