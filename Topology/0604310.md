The PI will study problems in low-dimensional topology centered around the
impact of the fundamental group on the geometric properties of a low dimensional
manifold. Three general directions of investigation will be taken: an asymptotic
geography problem for symplectic and smooth 4-manifolds with prescribed
fundamental groups, surgery properties of the SU(3) Casson invariant, and the
homotopy properties of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer invariant associated to a
unitary representation of the fundamental group of a manifold.

The subject of topology is the study of properties of space that are unchanged
under deformation or stretching. The fundamental group is a simple to define but
very powerful mathematical object that measured how circles can be deformed in
different spaces. Themost challenging spaces to study are the "low dimensional
manifolds", i.e. those which have dimension 3 or 4, like the universe we live
in. The PI proposes to study these using the fundamental group and its relation
to the geometry and analysis of of a space.
