Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Online advertising accounts for about a quarter of
all advertising spending today. Digital advertising provides two benefits for
consumers. First, companies provide free media goods to consumers such as a
large number and variety of applications provided by technology firms. Second,
digital advertising stimulates price competition. The goal of this research
project is to quantify the value of these free products together with the
increased price competition for consumers, and compute welfare gains. The
research incorporates differences in labor skill and consumer income levels. The
project has broad policy implications for understanding the role of digital
advertising in the economy for consumers with different socioeconomic
backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project explores how digital advertising
affects macroeconomic aggregates. The project builds on a variant of advertising
model. The model allows for both traditional and digital advertising, the
provision of free media goods, and differences in incomes across consumers. The
project incorporates the complementarity between digital goods and leisure and
distinguishes between skilled and unskilled labor. The developed model will be
calibrated and simulated to match stylized facts for the U.S. economy. The
welfare gain arising from digital advertising will be computed. These welfare
gains will be broken down into the gain from free media goods and the gain from
increased price competition. Different income groups will be considered in this
assessment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
