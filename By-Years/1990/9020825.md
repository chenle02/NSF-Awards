Laser chemical vapor deposition (LCVD) is a technique for maskless patterning of
fine surface structures at rapid deposition rates. While gas dynamics control
both deposition rate and deposit stoichiometry, the analysis methods developed
for conventional chemical vapor deposition (CVD) are not applicable at the fast
reaction rates of LCVD. In the present study the primary process parameters in
LCVD and their interaction will be determined by experimental and theoretical
techniques. The results will be used to develop predictive models for
application in more complex or less well known materials systems.
