OISE-0803314 (Wintsch, Indiana University)&lt;br/&gt;U.S.-Taiwan Planning Visit
to Establish Collaborative Research: The Absolute Ages of Metamorphic Fabrics in
a Young Mountain Belt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award supports a two-week planning visit to Taiwan by the PI and two
undergraduate students in early 2008. The focus of the visit will be
establishing quantitatively the time of development of fabrics in the critical
rocks of the backbone slates and the Tananao complex in the Central Range in
Taiwan. This is part of an effort to better understand the absolute ages of many
of the structures in the Taiwan orogenic belt. In the absence of these data,
disagreements within the scientific community have flourished over when and why
the mountains are rising and which structures are consequences of which
processes. The project will be carried out in collaboration with Professor
Ching-Hua Lo of the Department of Geosciences at National Taiwan University and
Professor Chin-Ho Tsai of the Institute of Earth Sciences at National Hualien
University of Education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
