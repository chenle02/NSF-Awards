Work supported by this award will be done by two undergraduate researchers
under the supervision of the principal investigator. They will be engaged in
research on problems of mathematical statistics and related computing
techniques. Students will learn to use statistical tools in descriptive
statistics and inferential statistics as well as multidimensional scaling
techniques. Projects will be selected from the study of speech and communication
disorders, monitoring growing waters for mulluscan shellfish, health care
programs for sickle cell disease and hyteresis in macroeconomic theory. Students
will be encouraged to prepare written reports of their investigations and to
present them at appropriate professional meetings.
