The goal of this Phase II Small Business Innovation Research project is to
further understand and resolve present technological limitations of the
Electroimpact Robot End Effector (EREE). Initially, research will be performed
on the actuator to shorten its cycle time and provide enhanced reliability. A
robot end effector will be designed which incorporates the EREE and performs a
useful industrial function. The further development of appropriate controls and
sensors represent a significant part of this program. Data from operations on
one or more industrial robots will be obtained to evaluate the performance of
this device.
