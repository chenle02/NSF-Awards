Dr. Mullet's long range goal is to elucidate mechanisms which regulate higher
plant chloroplast gene expression. He has three immediate goals; 1) to extend
knowledge of environmental and developmental influences of plastid transcription
activity, 2) to elucidate the molecular basis of light-independent activation of
plastid transcription which occurs during early leaf cell development and the
light-dependent activation which occurs in 8 day old dark grown barley and 3) to
analyze the basis of psbA mRNA stability. The importance of this problem derives
from the fact that the biochemical capacity of the plastid is defined by and
requires coordinated expression of genes located within the plastid and genes
located in the nucleus. In addition to the basic need to coordinate plastid and
nuclear gene expression, the plastid must also respond to a wide variety of
environmental and developmental signals. Information on chloroplast gene
expression and development will be extended to obtain a more detailed knowledge
of the plastids RNA polymerase and its regulation. Dr. Mullet has characterized
stages of chloroplast development in barley primary leaves and identified light
independent and light dependent events in this process. In the present grant a
detailed study of the plastid RNA polymerase and factors which modulate its
level and activity will be studied. In addition, analysis of psbA mRNA stability
and identification of the protein encoded by ORF 1244 will be undertaken. %%%
This is a study of the molecules involved in regulating the turning on and off
of genes in the chloroplast of developing plants. The chloroplast are the site
of photosynthetic activity and contain a genome independent of that found in the
nucleus. The coordination of the expression of the two genomes is clearly
important to the plant.
