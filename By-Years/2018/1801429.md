In the 1960s mathematician Robert Langlands developed a vision connecting two
apparently disparate fields of mathematics, number theory and representation
theory. This work led to what is now known as the Langlands program, which
reveals a web of deep and as yet only partially understood connections between
number theory, representation theory, geometry, and mathematical physics. This
project aims to answer core questions of the Langlands program revolving around
the so-called functoriality conjecture, in a generalized setting known as the
relative Langlands program. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The relative Langlands
program replaces reductive groups by more general homogeneous spaces, aiming to
understand their local and automorphic spectra. A basic tool is the relative
trace formula, a generalization of the Arthur-Selberg trace formula, which has
still not been fully developed. The project aims to establish new types of
comparisons between relative trace formulas that would simultaneously address
the questions of relative functoriality, and of conjectural relations between
periods of automorphic forms and L-functions. The two main goals of the project
are: (1) the development of the technical basis for such comparisons, including
a general relative trace formula, and (2) the development of a local-to-global
strategy for the comparison of trace formulas, as in endoscopy, but with scalar
transfer factors replaced by more general transfer
operators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
