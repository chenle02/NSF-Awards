Economists model the formation of relationships as the outcome of market forces
using matching models. Matching models explain relationships such as marriage,
employment, and business alliances. Most matching models are applied to
relationships at a single point in time. However, relationships change over time
and datasets tracking those changes are increasingly available. This project
develops new methods, called repeated matching game, for studying how
relationships change over time within a market framework. The central idea is
that in forming partnerships, people consider how current relationships affect
their future relationships. In addition to theory, the research project also
develop new tools to analyze data for matching models. The research applies the
method to study marriage, divorce and remarriage, careers of engineers to learn
how job assignment and moving among firms affect promotion to more prestigious
roles. The researchers also apply this model to study how early rounds of
venture capital funding, including accelerator participation, raise the chance
of receiving later rounds of funding and eventual startup success. The results
provide inputs into matching decisions hence improve economic
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project introduces the concept of a
repeated matching game, where each period agents can make new matches. The
forward-looking agents consider how their matches today will affect their
abilities to make productive matches in the future. The repeated matching game
combines a dynamic discrete choice model at the level of an individual agent
with a per-time period, transferable utility matching game of relationship
formation. The repeated matching game has desirable properties that lead to
tractable equilibrium computation. The project extends knowledge about these
matching models, develops computer algorithms for model solutions, and create
new estimators for the model's parameters. The project develops empirical
applications to marriage and remarriage, workers switching firms and venture
capitalists funding startups. The results of this research makes significant
contribution to the matching game models as well provide some insights into
labor market and other relationship policies. The results provide inputs into
matching decisions hence improve economic performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
