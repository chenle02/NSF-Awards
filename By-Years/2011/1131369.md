This research project aims at understanding the nature of calcium-silicate-
hydrate (C-S-H) as the main cement hydration product and its responsibility in
the strength and fracture of cement based composites. The recent fracture of oil
well in the Gulf of Mexico and its associated environmental impact necessitate a
thorough understanding of the significance of cement curing regimes, including
high pressure and temperature on the microstructure of cement hydration products
and the influence of that microstructure on the mechanical, impact and fracture
resistance of cement. The goal of the research is to investigate the fundamental
process for synthesis of C-S-H, to correlate its nano and microstructure
features, and to further understand its mechanical characteristics including
creep, impact strength and fracture toughness. The scope focuses on how the nano
and microstructural features of C-S-H are altered when the calcium-silicate
(C/S) ratio is changed (ratios ranging from 0.6 to 1.5) and when the hydration
process occurs under different combinations of temperatures and pressures. By
testing C-S-H synthesized under varying curing conditions, we will understand
the significance of hydration conditions on silicate polymerization and water
structure of C-S-H and how C-S-H nanostructure affects its creep, fracture and
impact strength.

Funds will be used to support graduate and undergraduate students in University
of New Mexico (UNM): a minority serving institution. This work will fill a major
knowledge gap as most researchers working in the field have focused on the
chemical and microstructural nature of C-S-H and very limited research has
provided information on the mechanical characteristics of C-S-H. If successful,
we will reveal some major mechanical characteristics of C-S-H including creep,
fracture and impact strength. Successful research investigation shall lead to
necessary changes in cement manufacturing to produce impact-tolerant cement-
based composites.
