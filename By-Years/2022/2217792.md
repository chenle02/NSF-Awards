This is an award to help participants attend the NuFACT2022 conference July 31,
2022 â€“ Aug. 6, 2022 in Snowbird, UT. The support will be used to more fully
enable participation by early career members and students. The conference will
allow participants to disseminate results and have discussions surrounding the
latest progress in neutrino physics. Neutrino's play a large role in
understanding the nature of our universe and are studied both with accelerator
and non-accelerator experiments as well as experiments in particle astrophysics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will help fund participation in the conference
by underrepresented groups by selecting: Early Career members who do not have
other funding for the conference; Applicants who are presenting at the
conference (talk or poster); and Members of underrepresented groups (women and
underrepresented minorities)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
