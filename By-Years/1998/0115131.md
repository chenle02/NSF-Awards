Fan&lt;br/&gt;0115131&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a three-year
cooperative proposal between Dr. Haitao Fan of Georgetown University and Dr.
Tong Yang of the City University of Hong Kong. Dr. Fan requests two visits, one
in the summer of 2001 and the other in the summer of 2003 for conducting a joint
research on hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDE) for reactive flow
equations. Both the U.S. and Hong Kong P.I.s are experienced researchers in this
field. The application of the PDE to reactive flow equations is a promising
research area and can continue keep the U.S. at the forefront of an important
mathematical field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
