The investigator proposes the study of back and forth error compensation and
correction methods (BF) and their applications, in particular, to the level set
method (Osher and Sethian, 1988) for interface computation in fluid dynamics and
image processing etc. The level set equation and the associated redistancing
equation (Sussman et al., 1994) are usually solved by high order non-oscillatory
schemes (e.g., ENO, WENO). In addition, special techniques can be used in order
to reduce the diffusion near singular points of the interface, such as the
particle level set method (Enright et al., 2002). BF was initially developed by
Dupont and Liu (2003) as a simple technique for reducing the diffusion in
solving the level set equation. Further improvements are being developed with
more and more promising results. When applied to the Zalesak problem (rigid
rotation of a slotted disk), it approaches the resolution of volume of fluid
methods, e.g., Youngs 1982 etc, and is simple with low computational cost. Some
special properties are being found such as that when applied to some unstable
schemes, it not only stabilizes them but also improves their accuracy. The
investigator plans to collaborate with Todd F. Dupont and other researchers to
further study this algorithm and its variants and applications. The particular
issues examined in this proposal include: (1)further study of the properties of
BF and the error and stability analysis of BF for irregular meshes; (2)the
combination of finite element method and level set method with BF on triangular
meshes; (3)further development of BF for level set method with applications in
fluid dynamics and computer graphics; (4)study of possible applications of BF
for other differential equations such as the Schrodinger equation.

The proposed activity in this project involves new methodologies in
computational mathematics and opens new possibilities. The research approach
will be a combination of theoretical analysis and their applications. An
integrated cross-disciplinary curriculum will be developed suitable for students
majoring in mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. The new
methodologies developed in this project will enlarge the numerical recipes and
can be applied to fluid dynamics, interface computation and their applications
like atmospheric dynamics, ocean flow, ocean floor gas hydrate, crystal growth,
biological fluid dynamics, elastic- plastic solids, astronomy, computer graphic,
image processing, etc. The research results will be disseminated through
conference presentations and publications. Progress in this project will also
enhance the interaction among several subfields including level set method,
finite element and finite difference methods etc.
