9724066 Childs Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is produced mainly by pituitary
gonadotropes or growth hormone cells. All pituitary cell types have receptors
for EGF as well, which suggests that this growth factor is an important
regulator in the pituitary. This study will focus on possible regulator roles
for EGF in the reproductive system, specifically in controlling pituitary
gonadotropes. The first objective will be to test the hypothesis that EGF
regulates cell division in gonadotropes. This will be done with cell growth
assays on cultures of purified gonadotropes (enriched to 90-95% gonadotropes).
Cytochemical assays will also be used to prove that the gonadotropes are
dividing. The second objective will be to learn if EGF affects differentiation
of gonadotropes during diestrus as the cells are being prepared for the enhanced
secretory activity needed for ovulation. Studies for this second objective will
also test EGF effects on the gonadotrope expression of estradiol receptors. EGF
receptors appear on 60% of gonadotropes before the estradiol receptors. The PI
will test the hypothesis that EGF works trough the EGF receptors to stimulate
theh expression of estradiol receptors. Progress in the field has already shown
that EGF is important to the reproductive system as a growth factor. It promotes
the development and function of cells in both the gonads and the hypothalamus.
Little is known about its role in the pituitary, however. This study is one of
the few studies in the world that will define its role in the regulation of
pituitary gonadotropes during the estrous cycle.
