Peninsular California contains a number of separate terranes that were
translated and accreted to the North American plate in Late Cretaceous through
Paleogene time. This study will examine the motion and accretion history of the
Vizcaino terrane, Baja California, Mexico by an integrated sedimentologic,
paleomagnetic, magnetostratigraphic and paleontologic analysis. The results will
help constrain tectonic reconstructions of the Pacific coast of North America.
