This award will partially support the participants cost of a workshop in
molecular studies in evolution. The participants will produce a document that
will give definition to the field of evolution on a molecular scale, discuss its
importance, and give guidance to NSF on how to anticipate developments in this
area in the future. The workshop has identified four areas of emphasis:
molecular systematics, theoretical and computational aspects, molecular
population biology and genetics, genome-molecular evolution. The Sloan
Foundation has agreed to co-support this workshop.
