This project addresses topics at the interface between probability theory and
statistical physics of disordered media. It proposes to build a systematic
understanding of the slowing down or trapping of stochastic dynamics of
disordered systems. The understanding is that for some of these systems the
slowing down is due to localized regions in configuration space where the system
spends most of its time. A general paradigm (the Trap Model) has been introduced
in physics literature and studied recently by the PI and various collaborators.
This project proposes to do three things: sharpen this understanding of this
phenomenological model, show that it is relevant for mean-field Spin Glass
dynamics (and aging) in a wide range of time scale (building on recent work of
the PI and collaborators), and introduce the point of view of trap models in
hard problems of Random Walks on percolation clusters. The PI will investigate
the first topic and second topic with graduate students and an established
international network of collaborators. The Co-PI will investigate one of the
two themes of the third topic (Biased random walks on supercritical clusters)
with the PI for the duration of his appointment at Courant Institute
(approximately two years). The second topic will be investigated by the PI, the
Co-PI and external collaborators.

Many branches of modern science are challenged with the complicated task of
attaining a clear understanding of the time evolution of complex systems, or
more specifically, of large systems comprised of many components and with
complex local rules. In particular, the lessons learned in the last century in
regards to the properties of statistical equilibrium seem of little value for
most of these complex systems as they tend to be, under usual conditions, always
very far from equilibrium and, in a sense, always in a transient regime. They
achieve their equilibrium very slowly and exhibit fascinating properties along
the way; one of them being "aging". These very slow evolutions are the subject
of this proposal for addressing well chosen paradigms which are known to be
complex and "universal", i.e. representative of a wide class of such phenomena.
