Libbrecht has built a telescope designed to measure velocities on the Sun with
very high accuracy. From the spatial and temporal velocity patterns he deduces
the precise frequencies of the solar five-minute oscillations. Analysis yields,
among other parameters, the lifetimes of the various modes and the rotation of
the Sun deep in its interior. Both observations and theory need and will receive
refinement to allow further deductions about solar convection and solar
structure. This award is made under the Presidential Young Investigators Program
to a young physicist who has already excelled in the field of solar seismology.
He explores the solar interior using techniques much like those used in
terrestrial seismology to explore the interior of the Earth. He has built and
brought into operation two telescopes suited to measure very accurately both the
shape and the oscillations of the Sun. He has demonstrated the ability to use
the data for significant interpretations. Solar seismology promises fundamental
new insights into practical problems such as the understanding of convection and
into astrophysical problems such as the emission of neutrinos and the internal
rotation of stars. Libbrecht has shown initiative in teaching by building a
telescope for the use of undergraduate students.
