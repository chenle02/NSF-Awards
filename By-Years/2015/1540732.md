The Mixed Integer Programming Workshop is an annual workshop that highlights the
state of the art in discrete and continuous optimization, with a primary focus
being to showcase more junior researchers. Another goal of the workshop is to
enable collaborations and scientific exchanges between leading researchers and
graduate students, thus promoting the progress of basic science.

Specifically, this project will provide travel support for 10 student poster
presenters, providing them the opportunity to network with the world's top
researchers in a student poster session, as well as during the invited talks,
which are presented in a single track format with plenty of opportunity for
interaction.
