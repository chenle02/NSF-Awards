One important process in atomic collisions is ionization-the removal of one or
more orbital electrons from an atom or ion. The studies supported here will use
a new technique to look in detail at the interactions in which two electrons are
so removed. The product of these reactions will all be detected and their
velocities measured, so that the specific processes involved can be understood.
This will further our understanding of atomic collisions.
