9730596 Iskandarani The project is for numerical and theoretical study of the
role of gravity waves in the long-time evolution of the global oceanic
circulation. The model used is SEOM developed at Rutgers University, and an
multiple-pressure- variable approach will be implemented. It would lead to an
order-of-magnitude enhancement in the efficiency of SEOM, thus allowing extended
high-resolution ocean simulations that include adequate representation of free-
surface phenomena. The model will first be used for two-dimensional simulations
of tidal circulation in the global ocean. After the model is optimized, extended
three-dimensional simulations of the global wind-driven circulation will be
performed.
