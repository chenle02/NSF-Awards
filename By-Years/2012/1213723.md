The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the
National Science Foundation supports the research of Professor Frank N. Keutsch
at the University of Wisconsin- Madison who proposes a novel experimental
approach that will simulate cloud-processing of reactive hydrocarbons, which is
an important pathway for the formation and transformation of ambient fine
particulate matter (aerosol). Cloud processing influences aerosol concentrations
and physicochemical properties, which in turn regulate aerosol optical and
cloud-nucleating properties. Cloud processing thus represents a paradigm for
chemistry-climate coupling. The proposed approach combines optical tweezers with
a suite of analytical instrumentation to transcend existing experimental
limitations, allowing exploration of the critical competition of gas/condensed
phase exchange, chemical reactions and cloud droplet drying/growth cycles. The
research will provide important mechanistic parameters of aerosol formation and
properties, which are currently lacking in models of climate and air quality.
The proposed work is ultimately designed to aid prediction of aerosol
properties, thereby enhancing the mitigation of anthropogenic effects on human
health, the environment and the climate. This project will also provide
education of scientists and develop undergraduate laboratory experiments that
consider not only individual processes, but also the coupled chemical/physical
feedbacks, such as those between the gas and condensed phases. The work will
also expand the scope of analytical experimental methodology available to other
fields of research.
