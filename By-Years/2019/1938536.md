The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-
UP) supports conferences and workshops that seek to increase the research and
education capacity of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
students and faculty at HBCUs. Morgan State University will organize a student
symposium held in conjunction with the 91st National Technical Association (NTA)
Annual Conference to be held on September 26-27, 2019 at Coppin State
University. Undergraduate students from HBCUs will attend this two-day symposium
to present their research and build a network of support by interacting with
faculty and industry representatives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NTA, established
in 1926, promotes the involvement of undergraduate students in scientific and
technical research activities. The symposium sessions will provide a culminating
experience for students to disseminate research results to peers and
professionals attending the NTA conference through oral and poster sessions.
Students will have the ability to attend some of the conference panels and
presentations, the Career Awareness, Educational and Employment STEAM
Opportunities Expo, and the awards presentation. A key objective is to provide
undergraduate students the opportunity to network with scientists and engineers
from academia, industry, government agencies, and the private
sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
