MHC class II gene expression is modulated during differentiation events in B
cells and by cellular factors, such as gamma-interferon in macrophage and
fibroblast. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms by which these genes are
regulated is the next step in understanding how the immune system controls its
activities. Since cell bearing class II molecules can present antigen to the
immune system, the starting point for control of the immune response is at the
level of MHC gene expression. In this proposal a systematic approach to
identifying and characterizing the cis-acting regulatory elements and their
respective trans-acting factors is presented. These experiments will: define the
number and fundamental properties of the cis-acting elements: compare the
elements in alpha and beta chain genes; and compare and characterize class II-
fibroblast, and gamma-interferon-induced fibroblast, that interact with these
cis-acting elements. How the immune system in mammals matures and is regulated
at the gene level is an important fundamental question. The answers, some of
which will be obtained by this study, have also obvious practical importance.
