9354530 Hughes The project will make use of a large aquarium as an aquatic
ecosystem on which to develop concepts and techniques of analytical chemistry.
Chemical monitoring of all aspects of the ecosystem will be the basis for a part
of the laboratory experience. The curriculum, already introduced at the
introductory level, now will be expanded to the third quarter freshman level
chemistry class. This class includes prospective chemistry, engineering,
textile, and biology majors. The course modifications will introduce relevant
problems from the real world into the laboratory curriculum, stimulate increased
interest in chemistry, and possibly increase the number of chemistry majors at
this level. The affect on the junior/senior analytical curriculum will be to
significantly increase the amount of time available for training and independent
work on modern instrumentation. The proposed course modifications will provide a
greater appreciation for the field of chemistry and the role it plays in the
environment and all biological processes. ***y
