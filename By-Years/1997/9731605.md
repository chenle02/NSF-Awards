*** 9731605 Fletcher The Department of Physics, Florida State University will
continue an REU Site. The principal objective is to serve the southeast region
of the United States as a center for summer undergraduate research participation
in physics. Grants of "Summer Junior Fellowships" will be made to applicants
interested in investigating physics research as a career. Special consideration
will be given to applications from women and minorities, and from the many small
schools in the region which have either no graduate programs or limited research
facilities. The program will afford research experience in many areas of physics
with the experimental nuclear physics research group serving as the host with
principal responsibility for the program. The available areas of experimental
research include nuclear physics, particle physics, solid state physics
including materials research, high Tc superconductors, surface and polymer
crystal physics, high field magnetism, and theoretical computational physics.
Summer Junior Fellows will be placed in established research programs according
to their interest, as expressed in their application, and their acceptance by
the research group participating in the REU- Site program. ***
