This award provides funds to the Department of Psychology at the University of
California, Irvine to continue to sponsor an undergraduate research experience
in Neural Plasticity and Brain Function. The highly successful program
originated with a one- week undergraduate Summer Institute that was expanded
last year with NSF funding. The eight-week summer program begins with a one-week
lecture/seminar series designed to introduce the students to the field and to
the research of the various faculty. This is followed by an active research
experience in faculty laboratories on a defined project tailored to the goals of
students and their advisors. Throughout this period, students continue to
interact with faculty in both formal and informal meetings. At the end of the
program, students present their findings to other students in the Department and
to the faculty.
