9700285 Nemhauser This research involves the development of solution methods for
mixed-integer programming problems. The objective of a mixed-integer programming
problem is to maximize a function subject to linear inequality (or equality)
constraints and integrality restrictions on some or all of the variables. The
goals of the research are to develop new methodology, algorithms, and prototype
software for solving this class of programming problems. The research addresses
two specific problem domains, stochastic integer programming and set
partitioning, which have heretofore not received much attention. The researchers
will investigate linear programming-based approximation methods, parallel
integer programming, and decomposition techniques as methodologies for obtaining
robust solutions to these difficult combinatorial problems. The research results
are to be implemented in openly distributed software systems, and will thus be
accessible throughout the research community. Mixed-integer programs have broad
application in solving problems that arise in logistics and distribution,
production planning, aircraft (flight and crew) scheduling, and resource
allocation. It is likely that tremendous progress in the size of problems that
can be solved and in the time it takes to solve them will come from parallel
computing, and thus this research has high potential to improve decision-making
in such large-scale systems.
