WHALES, SHARKS & THINGS IN THE DARK - A 70MM IMAX FILM is the first science
museum and aquarium film in the 70MM large-screen format to present the
diversity of life in the oceans in a science context. Through a unique
collaboration of a national environmental education group, a leading non-profit
science center, and with the co-operation of a federal agency, the project's
main objective is to convey to a general and school- age audience a view of the
richness and range of life in the underwater realm -- from the deep sea
creatures to whales and sharks and other marine life. Narratively, the film will
proceed through the water column and selected food webs, showing the
relationships in the complex skein of life--including human. The audience will
be guided by explorers and role-model scientists, such as Dr. Sylvia Earle, an
enthusiastic and well- known oceanographer, and three other sets of characters
involved in marine science and exploration. The content will highlight a range
of scientific disciplines, including marine biology, engineering, geology,
physics, and oceanography, and it will shed light on the entire study of the
oceans as a career path, and as an area for further investigation. Accompanied
by a educational package delivered and supported by all three groups, this film
will have wide impact, reaching a projected 8 million U.S. viewers within two
years.
