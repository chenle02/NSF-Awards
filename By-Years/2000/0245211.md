&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the CGS/NSF Dean-in-Residence Program is to enhance
the partnership between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the graduate
community by creating a mechanism for ongoing and substantive communications
between senior administrators at our universities providing graduate education
and the NSF. Based on the model of the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) Dean-
in-Residence Program, CGS established the first CGS/NSF Dean in Residence in
2002 under a grant from NSF.
