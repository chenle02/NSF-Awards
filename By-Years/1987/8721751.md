This is a proposal for two items of equipment, a cryostage and a cryotransfer
system to fully equip a low temperature electron microscope system. Cryoelectron
microscopy is a technique for viewing artefact-free biological material. The
technique is to preserve the specimen by freezing in water at low temperatures
and then viewing the specimen with the electron microscope at -140o C. The
equipment will be used by the investigators to view liposome suspensions,
viruses, and cell organelle and membrane vesicles. In additions, thin frozen
sections of chemically unfixed specimens will be used to check the fidelity of
observations made using other techniques.
