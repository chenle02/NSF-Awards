Global properties of the space of harmonic maps from certain compact Riemann
surfaces to compact Lie groups will be investigated. The method uses loop groups
as symmetry groups of the harmonic map equation, to reduce the problem to
consideration of an associated space of holomorphic maps. The topology of spaces
of holomorphic maps from the 2-sphere to various complex manifolds will be
studied by using ideas from configuration space theory, and the space of
harmonic maps from a 2-torus to a compact Lie group will be studied by using
methods of the theory of integrable systems.
