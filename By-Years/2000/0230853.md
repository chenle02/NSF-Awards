Mayo&lt;br/&gt;OIA-0230853&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funds
for the Government University Industry Research Roundtable to support activities
of the Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP), an ongoing cooperative
initiative among university research administrators, faculty and federal agency
representatives. FDP, which currently consists of representatives from 65
academic institutions and approximately 12 federal agencies, offers a forum for
members to improve the national research enterprise by its efforts to streamline
and standardize research administration policies and procedures. During the
current phase, FDP addressed and influenced the research establishment by
providing guidance for several activities such as: developing data standards and
implementing core principles for electronic research administration,
demonstrating the feasibility of electronic data interchange via award
documentation, and revising grant terms and agreements that correspond with the
Office of Management and Budget Circulars. The organization is poised to expand
in October by nearly 50% as it enters Phase IV of its existence, and will
improve the relationship between federal agencies and the research community,
ensuring the efficiency and integrity of STEM administration. &lt;br/&gt;
