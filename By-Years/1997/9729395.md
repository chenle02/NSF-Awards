9729395 JOHNSON This project will provide funds to the University of Minnesota
in partial support of the conversion of the research vessel BLUE HERON. The
University purchased the 86 foot ship to support scientific research on the
Great Lakes for its newly established Large Lakes Observatory located on the
University's Duluth campus. The project is under the direction of Dr. Thomas C.
Johnson who has had extensive experience in overseeing ship operations. The
conversion will include construction of two laboratories, installation of an
A-frame, an articulating crane, anchor windless, power capstan, a new generator
and a sewage/gray water holding tank. The vessel will also be dry docked,
sandblasted and repainted. ***
