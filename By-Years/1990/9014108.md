A high quality Utraviolet-Visible-Near Infrared Spectrometer is a vital piece
of equipment for measuring electronic spectra of complexes and simple compounds.
The spectra provide insight into the nature and extent of the electronic
interactions involved. The spectrometer is used for kinetic studies and studies
of surfaces. This award from the Chemistry Instrumentation Program to the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Wyoming will help acquire an UV-
VIS-NIR Spectrometer with an Integrating Sphere. The acquisition will enhance
the ability of the department to educate undergraduate students and will enhance
chemical research in the following areas: 1. Di-u-oxodimanganese Complexes 2.
Solid-Surface Luminescence and Spectroscopy in Studying Chromatographic
Mechanisms 3. A Laser-Based Kinetic Study into the Nature of the Charge-Transfer
Process Associated with the Photoreduction of Benzophenone and the Physical
Quenching of Singlet Molecular Oxygen by Hydrazines 4. Ultrasensitive Detection
Through Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy 5. "Corked" Vesicles Derived from
Ketal-Based Cleavable Surfactants 6. Intramolecular Association in Redox
Polymers. The "n=3" Rule in Polymer Electrochemistry
