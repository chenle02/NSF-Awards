The main goal of this proposal is to investigate various aspects of transport
phenomena. One type of problems concerns the motion of a particle in a random
force field. We shall prove that the position, velocity, and energy of the
particle, when scaled appropriately, converge, as time tends to infinity, to
certain limiting processes. The limiting processes will be described explicitly
in terms of the distribution of the force field. We shall also study measures
carried by random velocity fields and describe their limiting behavior as time
tends to infinity. Another set of problems concerns random perturbations of
Hamiltonian flows. We shall strive to obtain a description of the effective
behavior of randomly perturbed Hamiltonian flows on compact symplectic
manifolds. A separate part of the proposal is devoted to an inverse problem for
Gibbs fields. We shall prove that there always exist Gibbs fields with
prescribed correlation functions, provided that the correlation functions
satisfy certain consistency conditions.

Most of the proposed problems naturally arise in the study of various phenomena
in physics, oceanography, theory of turbulence, and statistical mechanics.
Consider, for example, a particle moving in a force field, such as a charged
particle in an electro-magnetic field. We intend to describe the behavior of the
particle (such as its position, velocity and energy) based on the probabilistic
properties of the field. The main assumption is that the time at which the
particle is observed is much larger than the typical size of the force field. We
shall also study the transport properties of random flows. One could think of a
pollutant carried by atmospheric currents as a physical model for this type of
problems. Based on the probabilistic properties of the flow, one wishes to
describe the long time behavior of the substance carried by it. Many results in
this direction have been obtained be several groups of researchers under various
simplifying assumptions, such as the periodicity of the flow. We shall study the
problem for a large class of physically relevant flows.
