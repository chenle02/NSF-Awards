Support in the amount of $10,000 for U. S. participation in the Eighth
International Academic Network Workshop at Sydney, Australia Israel is provided
to a group of scientists who have worked with the NSFNET program since its
inception 4 years ago. The group will also include 2 scientists from Latin
America (E. Zorilla and V. Cid) supported by NSF's International Program. The
discussion of building an international network is of high interest to the
NSFNET program and it is important that the program be well represented at the
Workshop. The Academic Network Workshop will bring together key individuals from
countries around the world who are involved in designing, implementing, or
funding networking facilities on a national or international scale for the
academic community. It provides a forum for information exchange concerning
national and international networking projects. Attendees represent over 30
countries in Europe, North America, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and South
America.
