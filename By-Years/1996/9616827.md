9616827 Grove This grant provides $72,800 as partial support of the costs of
upgrading the automation systems on each of two electron microprobes maintained
at MIT's Center for Geochemical Analysis. While one of the EMP's was originally
purchased in 1972 and has since been upgraded with an additional wavelength
dispersive spectrometer (for a total of five), an additional used EMP was
purchased in 1992 (EAR-918402) to alleviate demand on the original instrument.
Both instruments are fully subscribed by a wide variety of regional researchers
from MIT, WHOI, Boston University, Wellesley College and Harvard University to
name a few. The purpose of this upgrade is to replace the antiquated and no
longer supported Tracor Northern, DEC PDP-11 based automation systems which
control both the stage and spectrometer drives on these EMP's and also control
the electronics of the energy dispersive detectors (EDS) and additionally handle
the data reduction and image analysis programs. These upgrades will ensure
continued functionality of these EMP's and provide for state-of-the-art digital
image analysis of backscattered electron images thus aiding these scientists to
tackle fundamental problems in petrology and geochemistry such as studies of the
growth and evolution of continental crust and the lithosphere, studies of
magmatic processes within the crust, studies of the mechanical properties of
partially molten rocks under varying condition of temperature, stress and
lithostatic pressure, petrologic investigations into the formation history of
mantle peridotites, the nature of hydrothermal alteration of oceanic crust and
studies of carbonate diagenesis. ***
