Namson 9416191 This study will produce 11 balanced, restorable, cross sections
across the Santa Susana Mountains anticlinorium and a series of subsurface
structure maps for the same area. The sections will be restored to about 3 Ma,
or the approximate time of initiation of significant convergence in the region.
The sections will permit calculation of the convergence rates across the
anticlinorium, and the amount of slip and slip rates of hidden thrusts. They
will also permit the generation of structure maps on fault surfaces, top of
basement and tops of Tertiary formations, which in turn will permit the building
of a three-dimensional picture of the Northridge region. The results of this
study will greatly assist understanding of the subsurface structures of the Los
Angeles and San Fernando Valleys, and provide much-needed geometrical and
kinematic constraints for seismic hazard interpretations. ***
