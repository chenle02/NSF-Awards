This grant is to provide research and travel support for the principal
investigator and his graduate student Mr. Emmanuel Ramos, a native of the
Philippines, to analyze seismic data related to the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo,
Luzon. The major eruption, beginning in June, 1991, was the largest in
Philippine history and is one of the largest of this century. Mr. Ramos is a
Philippine seismologist, currently on study leave from the Philippine Institute
of Volcanology and Seismology, and has been involved in seismic monitoring of
active volcanoes in the Philippines for approximately ten years. His work will
aid in analysis of the current eruption and in evaluation of other volcanos that
appear to be increasing in activity. This proposal is submitted under the SGER
program for research having a severe urgency with regard to availability of or
access to data. This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program and a contribution to the International Decade for Natural
Disaster Reduction program.
