On the Sun, solar flares release magnetic energy very quickly using a process
called magnetic reconnection. This grant will develop and use a method of
studying the magnetic reconnection driving a solar flare. The investigators will
simulate solar flares powered by magnetic reconnection, and test the reality of
these simulations against measurements made by the Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph (IRIS) spacecraft now studying the Sun. The new method they develop
will be ready to analyze observations of the solar chromosphere made at much
greater resolutions by the new Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) when it
begins operation. This project supports the mission of the NSF by promoting our
understanding of magnetic field structure and activity at the Sun. The research
will contribute to the doctoral thesis of a physics graduate student supervised
directly by the investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will
measure the reconnection characteristics indirectly, using spectroscopic
observations of the solar transition region and chromosphere, where high spatial
resolution and rapid time cadences are possible, using far ultraviolet
measurements made by the IRIS spacecraft. They will develop numerical
simulations of flaring loops energized by reconnection to compute the downward
flows generated in the transition region and chromosphere. They will then test
and calibrate these computations using existing spectroscopic observations of
flare ribbons made by IRIS. Future observations using the DKIST Visible
Spectropolarimeter and the Visible Tunable Filter instruments each measure
different lines of Ca II which, in flare ribbons, will contain information about
the energy release by flare reconnection. The calibrated model will be used with
these data to measure solar flare magnetic reconnection at the smallest scales
yet resolved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
