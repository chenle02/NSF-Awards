This dissertation proposal aims to develop a better understanding of women's
movement into management positions in corporate-government relations. This study
provides a way to study an occupation whose gender composition is in transition
and a basis for understanding a transition in the character and function of
corporate-government relations. The student will investigate the behavior and
organization of corporate political action committees (PACs). The study will
facilitate understanding changes in the character and function of corporate-
government relations and their relationship to the political goals of
corporations. The student will interview in depth PAC officials and men and
women in corporate-government relations. A survey based on the interviews will
be mailed to government relations officers in 309 corporations.
