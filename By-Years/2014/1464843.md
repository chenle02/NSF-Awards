With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A)
Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Simon Garrett of
California State University-Northridge to investigate how amino acids can be
formed from small molecules in extraterrestrial abiotic environments. They are
attempting to synthesize amino acids in the laboratory by the radiolysis of
astrophysical ice analogs containing suitable sources. The work is to proceed
through a series of linked, short-term, experiments suitable for undergraduate
students, providing them with a stimulating experience that will encourage
enrollment in advanced degrees in STEM fields. Research that addresses the
question of how life began on Earth and if it has evolved elsewhere can generate
significant interest from the general public and the broad scientific community.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Garrett and his research group are conducting
experiments on icy mixtures of H2O, acetonitrile and either H2S or OCS deposited
in vacuum, irradiated by electrons and He+, and probed by mass spectrometry,
infrared spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and liquid
chromatography. A central goal of this project is to be the first to produce
sulfur-containing amino acids, notably cysteine and methionine, by adding a
relevant sulfur source to the ices. Although laboratory experiments in
astrophysical ice analogs have successfully generated a variety of amino acid
precursors to date, sulfur containing cysteine and methionine have not been
made, despite their importance in protein function and folding. An additional
goal of this work is to pioneer in situ hydrolysis through the formation of a
strong acid, sulfuric acid, since acid hydrolysis of irradiation residues in the
ice is known to be necessary in producing amino acids.
