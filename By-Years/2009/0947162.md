The goal of this project is to produce a book-length synthesis of findings in
the field of phenotypic evolution. This field is concerned with the evolution of
body size, shape, coloration, behavior and other observable characteristics of
plants and animals. The synthesis will include theoretical results as well as
observational and experimental findings. The observational results that will be
summarized range from evolutionary change over a few generations in contemporary
populations to trends that occur in the fossil record over hundreds of millions
of years. The challenge faced by this book is to explain evolution over such
diverse timescales in terms of natural processes that operate on a timescale of
a few generations (e.g., inheritance, selection, population size). Most
evolutionary biologists agree that such an explanation should be possible, while
disagreeing about the details.

The significance of this synthesis is that it will integrate recently developed
theoretical models with observations of evolution in nature. The synthesis is
based on the premise that processes underlying evolution can be understood using
powerful models that have been developed over the last 30 years. Despite their
power, these models are not widely used - even by evolutionary biologists -
because of their mathematical nature. Consequently, a major aim of this project
is to make these modern models accessible to a wide audience that will include
researchers, college students, and even high school students. Accessibility will
be achieved by using computer animations and simulations to illustrate both
essential concepts and theoretical results.
