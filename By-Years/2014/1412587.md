For over 100 years, the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO;
a cooperative professional-amateur organization) has been a model for citizen
science, allowing amateur astronomers to participate in scientific discovery and
providing material help for hands-on science education. They are creating an
invaluable resource for both the professional and amateur astronomer
communities: a catalog containing accurate positions and brightnesses of over
100,00 bright stars through 5 or more photometric filters. This catalog will
enable a host of astronomical studies ranging from near-earth objects to gamma-
ray bursts. Tools will be provided for amateur astronomers, educators, and
students to discover and categorize new variable stars. Advanced amateurs and
summer students are participating in compiling this unique resource for
observational astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AAVSO Photometric All-Sky
Survey (APASS) will cover the entire sky and provide accurate, absolutely
calibrated magnitudes through 5 bandpasses for all stars in the magnitude 7th to
17th magnitude range. No comparable product exists or is contemplated in the
near future. Using private funds, the AAVSO has purchased off-the-shelf hardware
and has been compiling observations of the entire sky in both hemispheres. NSF
support will enable them to complete the all sky survey, make important
improvements to the data quality and applicability, and create tools to use the
final public release of the database. The proposers present a 2-year plan to
complete 100% sky coverage and improve the quality of the final data products.
Improvements include extending to brighter sources and to include more
photometric bands. This catalog will be of immeasurable value to the
astronomical community by providing accurately-calibrated standard stars in
every field on the sky, without the need to separately observe calibration
fields or establish a magnitude reference scale.
