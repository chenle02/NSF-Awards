This is an award resulting from a submission in response to Program Announcement
NSF 88-28, Research Experience for Undergraduates. Under this award Cornell
University will provide six undergraduate students with training and support
while they participate in ongoing research projects in the University's Computer
Science Department. The award recognizes the importance of hands-on experience
in active research for training undergraduates for careers in mathematics,
science and engineering, and that too few such experiences are now available.
The University recruited most of the students from other institutions, in order
to broaden the base for attracting students to scientific careers.
