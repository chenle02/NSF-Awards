The PI proposes to involve a number of undergraduate students in a summer
internship program. The fields of study are all thrust areas within the
Department of Physics at UAH, and include space plasma physics, optics, and
materials sceince. The related topics are presented under the unified theme of
"Space Physics and Instrumentation"; students will be involved in the study of
materials used in the construction of, and optical characteristics of, space
instrumentation, as well as in the scientific return from such astronomical
instruments. The students, and their advising faculty, will meet regularly as a
group to discuss progress. The proposed topics constitute genuine research
endeavors, yet can realistically be completed in one summer. Recruitment is
primarily targeted at students outside the local area, but within the Southeast
region. The students will have many opportunities to interact with scientists
and facilities both in local industry and at the nearby NASA Marshall Space
Flight Center.
