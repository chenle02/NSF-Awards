This computer numerical control curriculum development project is centered
around the qualitative improvement and expansion of a comprehensive
undergraduate curriculum through the integration of classroom and laboratory
instruction. Essential to this undertaking are state-of-the-art computer
numerical control workstations that are used in conjunction with previously
existing lathe and milling machines. This equipment permits students to
experience the practical application of theories presented in the classroom.
Principles of numerical control are now taken from concept to final product
while exploring the mathematical foundations underlying the control and
machining processes. In this way principles and technological applications are
combined to strengthen the students understanding of automated machining for
improved production methods, parts quality and safety. The award is being
matched with a greater amount (132 percent) by the principal investigator's
institution.
