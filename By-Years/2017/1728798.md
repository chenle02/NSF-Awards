Since the 2008 global economic downturn, debt and credit have emerged globally
as central issues of public concern. The research supported by this award seeks
to understand why, by looking at the effects of these developments at the local
level. The researcher asks: How does public debt become materially connected to
local lives? Do these concerns affect local-level experiences of personal and
household debt and responsibility? How do these concerns translate into debt
politics and public response? Answering these questions will help both policy
makers and social scientists to better understand the local effects of national
and global economic crisis and the remediating potential of local response.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City University of New York (CUNY) anthropology doctoral
student, Sarah Molinari, advised by Dr. Ida Susser, will undertake to answer
these questions through research in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico's current
debt crisis has spurred debate and response at all levels of society, making
this a particularly appropriate research site. Molinari will focus on three San
Juan-based civil society groups. All three are concerned with the debt crisis
but differ in their make-up by age, socio-economic position, politics and ideas
about debt. She will gather data through the extended case method, interviews,
participant observation, documentary analysis, and archival research. Findings
will contribute to understanding diversity in conceptions of "debt" and
debtor/creditor relations; how people experience different scales of debt and
credit relations; and variations in understanding of and responding to recent
events. Research findings will be disseminated by the Center for Latin American,
Caribbean, and Latino Studies at the CUNY Graduate Center and during a public
seminar at the Institute of Interdisciplinary Research at the University of
Puerto Rico, Cayey.
