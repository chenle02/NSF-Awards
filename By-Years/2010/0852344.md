0749783&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bacteriophages, viruses of bacteria, are
the most abundant biological entity on the planet. By exchanging genes and
inserting themselves into the genomes of bacteria, bacteriophages profoundly
influence the ecology and evolution of bacterial communities in open
environments. The relevance of bacteriophages to intracellular communities of
symbiotic bacteria is less considered, but potentially important based on
increasing discoveries of bacteriophages in bacteria that only replicate inside
host cells. However, little is known about whether the environment of a host
cell constrains phage genome evolution and function. This research is the first
comprehensive study of the genome sequences and functions of bacteriophage in
the model intracellular bacterium Wolbachia pipientis. These maternally-
inherited bacteria replicate exclusively inside the cells of at least 20% of all
arthropod species, making them one of the most common intracellular infections
on the planet. This study will test if W. pipientis bacteriophage chromosomes
evolve by the classic exchange of blocks of unrelated DNA with other
bacteriophages or by new kinds of bacteriophage gene transfer between divergent
strains of W. pipientis that coinfect the same host cells and tissues. In
addition to the genomics and transmissibility of phages, this study will test if
bacteriophages contribute directly to killing intracellular bacteria and thereby
cause changes in bacterial functions dependent on titers. Broader impacts
include applications to human health and agriculture through applied symbiosis
strategies, extensions of this research to K-12 curriculum development and
community outreach, and a greater understanding of the symbiotic associations
between three different entities of Life - bacteriophages, bacteria, and
eukaryotes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
