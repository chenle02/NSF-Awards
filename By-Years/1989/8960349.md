This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of sensor
technology. This activity focusses on the development of Fiber Optic Chemical
Sensors (FOCS) as new instrumentation for the in-situ detection and monitoring
of specific classes of chemical compounds. In particular, a new method for the
determination of volatile gem-polyhalogenated hydrocarbons (GPCHC) such as the
trihalogenated methanes (THM), in drinking and ground water, will be developed
and evaluated. Candela Laser Corporation and Oregon State University will work
collaboratively to implement specific chemical reactions in a miniature reactor
secured to the distal end of a fiber optic excitation/collection system. A diode
pumped laser will be employed to excite fluorescence in a reaction product; the
rate of fluorescence increase will be related to the concentration of the
volatile species in the sample. The instrumentation developed in this Phase I
activity can be potentially employed in the over 3,000 facilities in the U.S.
that supply finished drinking water to over 10,000 people per facility. In
addition, ground water as well as specific waste sites could be routinely tested
using this approach to real time in-situ monitoring.
