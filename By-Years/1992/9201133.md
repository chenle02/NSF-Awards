This work is directed toward the design of novel polyamides based on the
incorporation of sequential and mimetic residues, similar to those found in
proteins. The research expects to find new structures which can form
biomaterials. The polymers are mimetic structures related to or different from
those present in standard nylons and proteins. For the characterization of these
polymers, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism (where
applicable), solution and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, electron
microscopy and fiber diffraction techniques will be employed. The researchers
will also utilize computer simulations to determine the preferred conformations
for the polymers and model compounds. The goal is also to design and synthesize
a series of optically active polyoxazolines. These polymers represent a broad
class of novel peptidomimetic structures. The conformations of these
macromolecules and their model compounds will be examined. Both sequence
copolymers and the polyoxazolines should have potential uses as sutures,
biomedical devices, and drug-delivery matrices. Through a study of structure,
conformation and properties, the researchers hope to develop new classes of
peptidomimetic polyamides. This program has as its objective the preparation and
characterization of complex molecular structures that mimic naturally occurring
biopolymers.
