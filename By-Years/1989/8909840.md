The object of this proposal is to develop and optimize a novel experimental
approach, based on scanning microfluorescence, to characterize cellular
physiology as a function of both time and position within immobilized-cell
biocatalysts. The approach will then be used to investigate plasmid stability
within immobilized Escherichia coli cells. The method employs a biocatalyst
configuration which allows visual observation of cells entrapped at various
distances from the nutrient supply, so that well-nourished, as well as starving
cells may be viewed. A recently developed scanning microfluorescence instrument
is also used. This instrument has advanced image- analysis capabilities, and its
excitation laser beam can be focused to a diameter less than one micron. These
features allow fluorescence of individual bacterial cells to be measured.
Plasmid stability will be monitored using fluorescent marker genes attached to
target plasmids. This new analytical approach is both powerful and versatile. A
wide variety of immobilized-cell phenomena can be studied by changing
fluorescent stains. Results of the study will enhance the fundamental
understanding of immobilized-cell physiology and allow refinements in
mathematical models for industrially important immobilized-cell processes.
