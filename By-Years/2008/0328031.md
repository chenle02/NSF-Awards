0328031 Scott The objective of the proposed research is the development of
methods for production and&lt;br/&gt;purification of the lignin-degrading
enzyme, manganese peroxidase (rMnP), using the yeast Pichia pastoris in high
cell density, fed-batch fermentations. The concentrated enzymes will be tested
for their effectiveness in an environmentally benign manufacturing process for
lignin removal during pulp and paper manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;
