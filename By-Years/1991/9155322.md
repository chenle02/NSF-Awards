This three year program will train 60 high school biology teachers (3 groups of
20/year) in Molecular Biology, Gene Cloning, and Recombinant DNA Technology.
This will be accomplished by two week summer institutes, held at Miami
University, Oxford Campus, that include both content and pedagogy, with emphasis
on a hands-on approach. A curriculum consultant and a previous pilot program
participant will work with the participants to facilitate appropriate
implementation of content and laboratory procedures in the participant's
classrooms. The P.I. will also facilitate the implementation of experiments into
the participants' classrooms via academic year support services and by
establishing contacts for participants with other nearby Ohio universities and
biotechnology industries. Cost sharing equals 78.5 % of the NSF award.
