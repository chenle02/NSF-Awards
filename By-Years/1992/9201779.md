Decisions made during the design of a machined part can significantly affect
the product's cost, quality, and lead time. Thus, it is important to evaluate
the machinability of the design, providing feedback so that the designer can
change the design to improve its machinability. For machining purposes, a part
is often considered to be a collection of machinable features. However, often
there can be several different interpretations of the same part as different
collections of machinable features. Each interpretation corresponds to a
different set of machining operations, in a different order, with different
machinability. To determine the machinability of the part, all of these
alternatives should be generated and their machinability evaluated. This
research will develop ways to do this automatically. For generating the
alternative feature interpretations, the investigator's will use an algebraic
approach, in which new interpretations will be produced via algebraic operations
on old interpretations. For evaluating the machinability of each feature, the
researchers will take into account the feature geometry, tolerance requirements,
surface finish requirements, and statistical variations in the process
capabilities. The information provided by such an analysis can be used in
several ways: (1) To provide information to the manufacturing engineer about
alternative ways in which the part might be machined. This information can be
useful in developing process planning alternatives depending on machine tool
availability. (2) To provide feedback to the designer identifying problems that
may arise with the machining. By comparing the best achievable tolerances with
the designer's tolerance requirements, investigator's should be able to suggest
small changes in the design that will significantly improve the machinability.
