Paying attention to the world around us, deciding what to attend to and what to
ignore, is a fundamental human ability. It affects how we perceive ourselves and
our place in the environment. Deciding what to pay attention to is a critical
component of everyday functioning. Two people viewing the same scene, such as a
busy intersection, may have different perceptions and impressions about what is
taking place. One may attend to the traffic cop waving her arms and directing
traffic, while another looking in the same direction may attend to the bicycle
that narrowly misses a racing taxicab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present program
of research will focus on the willful direction of attention (what one chooses
to attend to). The research aims to establish the neural correlates of voluntary
attention in humans, by using simple laboratory tests, advanced methods to
record and analyze human brain activity, and novel signal processing of the
brain's electrical signals. Such information will inform us not only about how
the normal healthy attention system operates, but also how it breaks down in
cases of overload, disease, and brain damage.
