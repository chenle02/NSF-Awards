The generative entrenchment of an entity is a measure of how much of the
generated system depends upon the presence or activity of that entity. It has
been demonstrated that entities with higher degrees of generative entrenchment
tend to be more conservative in evolutionary changes of such systems. Models of
complex structures incorporating the effects of generative entrenchment have
demonstrated their relevance in analyzing and explaining a variety of
developmental and evolutionary phenomena. Dr. Wimsatt and Mr. Jeffrey Shank will
extend prior simulations and analyses of a variety of cases and problems and
investigations of a number of results on the evolution of gene control networks,
extending not only their own work but that of S. A. Kauffman and others to
investigate the influence of different degrees of generative entrenchment on the
behavior of these networks and their evolution. Since virtually any system
exhibits differential degrees of generative entrenchment among its parts and
activities, these studies and results have in addition broad potential
application for theoretical, simulation, and experimental analyses of
developmental programs and their significance for evolution, macroevolutionary
change, the innate-acquired distinction and investigations using it in
linguistics and cognitive psychology, developmental constraints, and constraints
on the evolution of complex adaptations and scientific change.
