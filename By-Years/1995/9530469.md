9530469 Wynblatt This research consists of two main thrusts. The first focuses
on the modeling of surface roughening -faceting and premelting phase transitions
in lead alloys. It extends research from a previous grant in which Monte Carlo
and Molecular Dynamics computational techniques were developed . Surface
compositional and roughening-faceting phase transitions in lead-bismuth-nickel
alloys are emphasized. The second thrust is an experimental approach to wetting
transitions in liquid alloys in the gallium-lead system. A scanning Auger
microprobe technique is used to study wetting transitions in liquid metallic
systems under an ultrahigh vacuum environment. This permits surface composition
monitoring for assurance that surfaces are free of random contaminants. The
study on multicomponent alloy systems introduces composition as a variable
thereby extending past research which emphasized pure solids. %%% Surfaces of
alloy systems containing more than one component are subject to segregation
phenomena. Surface segregation is relevant to many materials problems, including
corrosion, oxidation, wear, and materials processing , such as sintering and
joining. ***
