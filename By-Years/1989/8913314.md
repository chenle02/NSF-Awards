This project is a CBMS Regional Conference in the Mathematical Sciences
entitled "Ergodic Theory and Combinatorial Number Theory". This conference will
be held at North Dakota State University June 18-22, 1990. The proof of
Szemeredi's theorem given by Furstenberg has made it clear that ergodic theory
can be a powerful tool in combinatorial number theory and has stimulated
research leading to some striking results in ergodic theory itself. The lecturer
will be Professor Furstenberg, the originator and an active researcher in the
subject. His lectures are designed to show the interplay between ergodic theory
and combinatorics, and to help participants gain insight into the subject and
hence to stimulate new research in the field.
