The objective of this research is to build a Nonlinear Optical (NLO)
Spectrometer that will allow the spectrum of nonlinear absorption to be measured
over a range of greater than two octaves of bandwidth (&lt;400nm to 1800nm) in
~1 hour, do this using an absolutely calibrated method and yield the dispersion
of the nonlinear refractive index over the same spectral range. This instrument
is transformative to the NLO field as it now takes days for a single material
measurement. The approach is to base the spectrometer on the widely used and
cited (&gt;3000 citations) Z-scan technique. The optical source for the NLO
Spectrometer will be an exceedingly high spectral energy density White-Light
Continuum (WLC) generated in a noble gas at moderate pressure.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The intellectual merit of the proposed activity comes
from the instrument?s capability to drastically increase the speed (and hence
depth) of characterization of NLO materials. This new capability will allow for
more rapid feedback on NLO properties to both theoreticians and synthetic
chemists and other material scientists and in turn lead to the development of
improved NLO materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The broader impacts from this
great increase in data generation rate are the instrument's potential to impact
several fields beyond nonlinear optics, including optical data storage, multi-
photon micro-fabrication, imaging (both biological and chemical sensing),
photodynamic therapy (medical), and telecommunications. Additionally, this
equipment will allow undergraduate, graduate, and research scientists to benefit
from a rapid characterization facility, giving the opportunity to learn more
about optical field-matter interactions.
