This grant to a University of California at Davis faculty member supports
experimental research in relativistic heavy- ion collision physics, focusing on
the development of the thermodynamic variables which describe the heating,
compression, and flow of nuclear matter. The experiments will be carried out
using primarily the AGS synchrotron at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Work on
the preparation of the STAR detector for the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
under construction at Brookhaven is also supported.
