A combined theoretical and experimental study of photoactive polymers covalently
bound or physically adsorbed to surfaces will be undertaken. The objective of
this work is to use the luminescent properties of the polymer to elucidate the
factors that determine the structure of a polymer on a surface. This work will
also provide a basis for utilizing polymers to carry out or sensitize
photochemical reactions at surfaces. Additionally new polymer-bound chromophores
will be prepared and some new methods for covalently binding a polymer to a
surface will be explored.
