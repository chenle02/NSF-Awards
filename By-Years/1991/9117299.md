This grant funds conference on the chemistry plant-herbivore interactions, one
of the Gordon Research Conference. This conference will stress the
interdisciplinary nature of plant- herbivore system in terrestrial and marine
environments, and bring individuals together from academia and industry, from
senior and junior levels, from different countries, and different plant-
herbivore systems. Important timely topics, including those impacting humans
directly, will be addressed in an atmosphere conducive to discussions, with
active leaders in the fields giving presentations, but with an unusual amount of
time for interaction and discussion. New insights can be expected that with many
approaches to theory and mechanisms coalescing in new ways. There is no other
meeting of this nature which attempts to really cross the boundaries of
disciplines and systems in plant-herbivore interactions.
