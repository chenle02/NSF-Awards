The awardees have performed a deep ground-based narrow-band survey for Lyman-
alpha emitters (LAEs, possible progenitors of ordinary galaxies like the Milky
Way) that has produced a sample of 259 galaxies, one of the largest sample of
LAEs yet acquired. The funded work will extend the survey by 1) exploring the
evolution of LAEs by studying a complementary sample at lower redshift; 2)
measuring the 3-D distribution of the LAEs; 3) probing the stellar winds,
dynamics, and HI column densities of LAEs via extensive high-resolution
spectroscopy with the Robert Stobie Spectrograph on the South African Large
Telescope (SALT) and the LDSS3 spectrograph on Magellan, and 4) performing near-
infrared spectroscopy with FLAMINGOS-2 on Gemini-South to measure systemic
redshifts and LAE metallicities. The research promises significant progress
towards a complete picture of the birth and early growth of the precursors of
present-day L* galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this work
include research training for undergraduates, release of data to the
astronomical community, and participation in the "Astrofest" activity of public
lectures at Penn State.
