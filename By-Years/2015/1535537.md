An International High-Performance Computing (HPC) Summer School will be held at
the University of Toronto in Toronto, Canada on June 21-26, 2015. The goals of
HPC Summer School are to: a) expand the knowledge of the attendees about high
performance computing (HPC) and its applications in multiple fields of science
and engineering; b) encourage the participants to continue to pursue advanced
studies and professional careers that contribute to advancing scientific
discovery; and c) foster new collegial friendships, partnerships, and
collaborations (nationally and internationally) among the presenters and
attendees. This Summer School will provide a unique opportunity for about 80
graduate students and postdoctoral researchers from Canada, Europe, Japan, and
the United States to learn from and to engage with leading computational
scientists from numerous disciplines. The participants will talk with scientists
from multiple disciplines about the challenges and opportunities their have
pursued utilizing HPC to advance their research. The participants will be
engaged in hands-on activities to become familiar with HPC tools they may use to
improve their own research practices. The students will participate in five days
of large and small group discussions to address the challenges in advancing HPC
research. The participants will be assigned mentors from among the presenters
and HPC professionals, and they will be provided with numerous opportunities for
informal discussions with mentors. The Summer School is designed to offer a
unique experience for preparing the attendees to be effective, contributing
members of international research and development teams.
