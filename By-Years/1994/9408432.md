9408432 Tannor Univ. of Notre Dame This project in quantum theory of reactive
scattering is supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
Program. Conservative scattering processes in the gas phase will be studied
using Tannor's recent formulation of scattering theory in terms of Gaussian
wavepacket solutions of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation with absorbing
boundary conditions. In this approach, S-matrix elements are calculated by
Fourier analysis of a time correlation function between reactant and product
wavepackets propagating in the transition state region. The theory will be
applied to the calculation of state-to-state reaction probabilities for
elementary gas phase reactions. Dissipative scattering processes in liquids will
be studied using a similar flux-flux correlation function computed from a
quantum density matrix obtained by solution of a quantum Liouville equation
containing relaxational operators corresponding to frictional forces. These
methods will be applied to the analysis of laser experiments, performed by other
investigators, including phase sensitive detection of transient dichroism and
birefringence. It is possible to obtain a very detailed understanding of
chemical reactions of small molecules in the gas phase in which one measures, or
calculates, the rates for molecules in individual quantum states. The first
component of this research project is the development of mathematical methods
leading to faster and more accurate computations of the speeds of these state-
to-state transitions. A chemical reaction in a liquid is the net result of a
vast number of such processes so one seeks a theory in which these molecular
details are averaged out yielding the net chemical reaction rate expressed in
terms of temperature and bulk solvent properties such as viscosity. The second
component of this project is directed toward this type of theoretical
description. In this fundamental research project, the results of lengthy
computer calculatio ns will be compared with results of recent laser experiments
to begin to test the validity of the underlying concepts and methods.
