In his recent book, Explaining Science (1988), Professor Giere argued that
theories in science are to be understood as families of models, which are
abstract, non-linguistic entities. He claimed that the relationship between
models and the world is to be understood in terms of similarity. He also
suggested that further understanding of what models are, and how they are used,
must come not only from logic or mathematics, but also from work in the
cognitive sciences (Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Psychology, Linguistics,
Philosophy, Neuroscience) which is focused on the general nature of
representation. The goal of this project is to explore,in greater detail, recent
work on representation to see to what extent this work might indeed provide both
an empirical and theoretical basis for the exploration of his own account of
representation in science.
