For effective human vision, the brain must integrate the binocular input from
the two eyes, and in turn drive the two eyes to move binocularly in appropriate
directions. The development of sensory binocularity appears to depend on the
ability to align the two eyes to give visual stimulation of corresponding points
on the retina of each eye. This alignment is a precursor to development of cells
in the visual cortex that are sensitive to retinal disparity, and for
stereoscopic vision. This project studies how oculomotor and sensory factors
combine to contribute to the development of binocular visual functions during
infancy in humans. Models are outlined for possible developmental relationships,
and a novel binocular eye-tracking technique will be used to measure human
infant eye movements. Data on developing motor binocularity is compared to data
on developing sensory binocularity measured by a variety of behavioral and non-
invasive tests, to see how sensory and motor factors are combined. Results from
this study will be important to visual science, and also to developmental human
research and to human performance analysis, with further likely importance to
understanding disorders in binocular vision. ***
