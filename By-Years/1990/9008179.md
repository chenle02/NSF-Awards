The manner and mechanisms by which the human brain has developed its enormous
relative size and intricate mode of patterning is one of the most fundamental
questions in physical anthropology. Traditionally, the brain was thought to have
first enlarged in response to, and concomitantly with, earliest human tool
fabrication. It is now known, however, that human tools show up in the fossil
record long before brain enlargement, and other theories have subsequently been
offered to explain this uniquely human characteristic. This investigator
explains brain enlargement as an indirect result of changes in cerebral blood
flow and seeks to test two related hypotheses about the pattern of blood flow in
hominoids. These hypotheses can be tested by examination of the interior of
skulls, because the pattern of meningeal blood vessels provides an indelible
imprint on the interior of the skull. The first hypothesis is that the branching
pattern of middle meningeal blood vessels distinguishes between the two types of
australopithecine fossil. The second is that a "strong" branching pattern
correlates with larger cranial capacity. The latter hypothesis will be tested on
a large number of human and ape skulls to determine the nature of the
correlation between cranial capacity and blood vessel branching pattern in
higher primates including humans. The research will provide further evidence
regarding the "radiator" theory of brain enlargement, whereby bigger brains are
claimed to be characterized by a more complicated network of vessels than
smaller brains.
