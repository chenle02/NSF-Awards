Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CHE-0244068 Date:
1-07-2003&lt;br/&gt;PI: Anderson Institution: Virginia Polytechnic &lt;br/&gt;
Inst. &amp; St. University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chemistry Division award
supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and State University for the summers of 2003-2005. Mark R.
Anderson is the site's program director. Ten students will carry out research
with faculty and research groups in the chemistry department for ten weeks.
Student recruitment will focus on small colleges and underrepresented groups in
Virginia and other Appalachian states. The program will have a research focus on
physical and physical-analytical chemistry. It will emphasize undergraduate
research projects that make extensive use of modern spectroscopic and analytic
methods. The students will participate in a nine-week lecture series. They will
present their results at a mini-symposium at the conclusion of the program.
