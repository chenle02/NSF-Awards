This project aims to address a deficit of orbital-scale speleothem data from
India regarding the Indian Summer Monsson (ISM). The project focusses on cave
deposits from southern India, south of the Himalayas, where the impact of the
monsoon is greatest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific rationale for the
research is designed to address the following hypotheses: 1) orbital variations
force rainfall changes by uniformly affecting the global monsoon; 2) Chinese
stalagmite records reflect upstream source changes related to ISM amplitude; and
3) regional climate dynamics, in addition to variations in local summer
insolation, contributes substantially to ISM variability.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve examining the Indian Monsoon
as a key aspect of the global climate system, international science
collaboration, support of an early career postdoctoral scholar, and outreach in
public lectures through Science Under the Stars in Austin, Texas.
