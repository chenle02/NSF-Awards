&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
of 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robert J. Harrison, Adolfo G Eguiluz and Gregory D
Peterson of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville are developing a new
generation of scalable chemistry and physics codes with an immediate target of
the petascale computers now being deployed by the NSF but with a vision that
incorporates the exascale computers anticipated within a decade. Their immediate
interests are in electronic structure with applications in chemical catalysis
and solid state physics. However, the new computational framework is broadly
applicable and opens up petascale simulation to a much wider audience by
including a range of interfaces suitable for both experts and first-time users.
The software is based upon MADNESS (http://code.google.com/p/m-a-d-n-e-
s-s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational and reference resources are being
developed to span the needs of senior high-school, undergraduate, graduate
students, and expert users, with courses made available at the NSF National
Institute for Computational Science at UT.
