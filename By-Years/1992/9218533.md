Stuart M. Feffer, doctoral candidate; dissertation topic: "Academic Science and
the German Optical Industry." With support from this grant, Mr. Feffer is
undertaking research in the company archives of the German firm Jenoptik GmbH.
His study of technical optics is focusing on several aspects of the rapidly
changing relationship between science and industry during the period of the
"second industrial revolution" -- the time during which industries based on
technologies of the laboratory (such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, optics and
electricity) became important engines of economic growth. Jenoptik is the
successor to the optical firm of Carl Zeiss Jena, one of the first makers of
optical technologies to successfully exploit the possibilities of scientifically
directed research and development, and as such must be part of any study of the
history of modern optical technology. Because of immanent reorganization,
however, the Zeiss company archives will be closed to users by the end of this
year and will remain closed for an indefinite period of time. The next few
months represents a window of opportunity in which these materials, located in
the former East Germany and for so long virtually unavailable to western
researchers, may be consulted.
