Abstract - 9708925 Hsueh-Chia Chang Interfacial waves are known to play a major
role in multi-phase heat and mass transfer. An important example is the
efficiency of a refrigerator evaporator tube that operates in the two phase
regime. Recent tests suggest that its efficiency is due to the presence of
interfacial waves. Much experimental data exist with which to examine the gross
effects of waves on transport rates but little data are available to probe the
coupling between wave statistics and the transport. This work will be a balanced
theoretical, numerical, and experimental study of the enhancing effects of such
waves and will lead to a better understanding of gas/liquid and liquid/liquid
flows.
