Narravtive: This award supports a Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) to study
a variety of Biochemical Engineering problems. Current work focuses on cellular
processes, enzymology, and developing analysis and evaluation frameworks for
plant design. Work that has been completed includes a demonstration that
physiological function (e.g. information transduction) linked pathway properties
trade off with respect to structure (activity/regulatory mechanism organization)
and operating point (metabolite state vector), and fundamental investigations
with single and multiactivity enzyme-membrane reactor systems. Future work
includes experimental and theoretical studies of underlying molecular and
physical processes that play a role in growth kinetics, regulation, and
energetics of cells. Novel bioreactors will be devised to study physical,
chemical and biological phenomena for a better understanding of reactor
operation. Bioprocess design, such as developing frame works whereby the impact
on design of key, manipulable processes (cellular, molecular) can be assessed.
Also, protein transport phenomena will be investigated to determine how
alteration of conformational state and extent of self association influences
mobility into/within porous separation media.
