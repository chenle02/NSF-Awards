The development of reliable, high intensity lasers operating at wavelengths
readily absorbed by most materials has led to their use as directed heat sources
for manufacturing. The focus of the present investigation is the application of
carbon dioxide lasers to three-dimensional cutting and shaping of ultrahard
ceramic materials such as silicon carbide and silicon nitride. An important
drawback to silicon compound ceramics is their extreme hardness, which makes
their processing and shaping an extremely difficult, tedious, and expensive
procedure. Preliminary work has shown that vastly higher removal rates are
possible with a carbon dioxide laser than with conventional diamond grinding.
The research to be performed will provide understanding of laser machining
process, which is essential in order to make it technically and economically
viable. The proposed work is interdisciplinary in nature. It falls in the area
of thermal processing, bridging across the interface between heat transfer and
materials.
