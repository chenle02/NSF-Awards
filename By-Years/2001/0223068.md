This project will conduct an overall evaluation of the GLOBE program. The
evaluation will document the program's progress in achieving its objective of
improving student understanding of science by involving students in real
science. SRI will conduct an implementation evaluation and an outcome
evaluation. The implementation evaluation will analyze the GLOBE educational
materials, teachers' access to technology, the influence of standards and
teaching practice. The outcome evaluation will measure the impact of GLOBE on
student learning.
