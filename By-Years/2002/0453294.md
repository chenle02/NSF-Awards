ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EMBARC Program (Experiences in
Molecular Biology Academic Research Careers) at the University of Maryland,
Baltimore County (UMBC) will provide a comprehensive ten-week residential summer
research program for eligible undergraduates. Participants will conduct
individual research projects focused on the "Structure and Function of
Biological Molecules" with faculty mentors drawn from three departments:
Biological Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Chemical and Biochemical
Engineering. REU Trainees will work closely with their faculty research mentors
and members of their research labs. The Trainees will participate in a weekly
Summer Research Seminar Course in ethics, scientific communication, and career
choices related to the research doctorate. Students will also receive laboratory
safety training and participate in a GRE Preparation Course. Regular group
meetings with the Program Directors will be held to monitor student progress and
to encourage professional interaction and group camaraderie. Trainees will
discuss their research projects at the group meetings and complete portfolio
assignments related to the elements of a scientific poster. The student research
experience will culminate in an end-of-the-summer Undergraduate Research Fest
with other campus programs in which all participants will describe their
projects using posters or platform talks. Recruitment will target community and
four-year colleges with significant student populations of groups that are
under-represented in the sciences. Further information and application materials
are available by contacting Dr. Janice Zengel at Zengel@umbc.edu, 410-455-2876,
