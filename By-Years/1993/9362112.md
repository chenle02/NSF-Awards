Vision for Mobile Robots Using Agent Based Gaze Control An attention mechanism
can influence system behavior and performance only to the extent to which system
resources are allocatable. A key robot visual system resource is acuity, and yet
this is fixed in conventional uniform acuity machine vision; regions with little
or no relevance t o the robot's mission are sampled at the same resolution as
key features, occupying valuable signal bandwidth and computational resources,
and increasing system latencies. Foveal active vision features imaging sensors
and signal processing with graded acuity, and context sensitive sensor gaze
control, analogous to that prevalent throughout vertebrate vision. Foveal
systems operate more efficiently because resolution is treated as a dynamically
allocatable resource. Wide field of view, localized high acuity, and fast frame
rates are achieved while minimizing irrelevant sensor data. This research
project will prototype a mobile robot foveal vision system which relies on an
agent based, grounded, layered architecture with integrated reasoning for gaze
control. This architecture will facilitate the development of successful active
vision behaviors (sensor pointing and platform motion). Learning techniques will
be investigated which accelerate attentive active vision behaviors by evolving
them into preattentive responses. # x \ P C X P#
