It is proposed to investigate term rewriting systems and mechanical
theoremproving strategies. The topics to be studied include: polynomial
timealgorithms for reducing ground term rewriting systems to canonical form,
andtheir application to the rigid E.unification problem; semantics and
confluencetests for conditional term rewriting systems; and the use of rewriting
andunification in programming languages. The research has potential
applicationsin program verification and automated reasoning.
