This project seeks dramatically improved access to, and dissemination of,
scientific information. Working with cooperating scientific users, it exploits
synergies among three important innovations. These are: (1) adaptive and domain
specific automatic derivation of topical representations. These topics describe
both the documents in the collection, and the interests of the users, during
particular searches. The topics support mechanisms for collaborative
recommendation, and for exploring the precise contours of each user,s need. (2)
Recognition that a combination or set of several items, together, is worth much
more (or perhaps much less) than the sum of the values of the items
individually. The arXiv experimental system (arXiv_XS) uses topics, and user
feedback, to model the complexity of the user's need and interests. (3) Based on
these innovations, the system can probe user's interest, selecting items where
the user's feedback greatly improves the system's model of that user and his or
her search. This "exploration" is designed to improve the systems performance,
with minimal degradation of the current search. All these innovations are
studied together with complex experimental design and statistical analysis;
users may also volunteer to be interviewed, by the researchers, to provide
richer information about their experiences with the system. Researchers from
Rutgers, Cornell and Princeton lead the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
exploratory project focuses on the following tasks: (1) develop a richly
instrumented voluntary alternative interface to the arXiv, with suitable IRB
consent materials supporting active user feedback in the research process, as
users search; (2) implement three specific innovative technologies (topics,
sets, probes); (3) study their impact on system effectiveness, using
experimental design and well-defined performance measures; (4) collect rich user
assessments, by telephone and online interviews; (5) assess scalability with
respect to the size of the collection, and the size of the "communities of
interest" that define the topical user models; (6) seek relations at other
domain-specific archives, for potential future studies. If successful, this
research will refute a perception that improvement in access and dissemination
of scientific literature requires massive techniques adapted from the commercial
models for recommender systems and crowd-sourcing. This research will also add
to on experimental design, user modeling, and the study of active learning and
exploratory system designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will accelerate
the production and sharing of scientific information, initially at the arXiv,
and subsequently, wherever these innovations are implemented. The research aims
to enable researchers who never meet each other to form an "invisible college"
by enriching the arXiv systems understanding of all of its users. The project
entails some risks, as users may be unwilling to share information about their
research interests. While malevolent persons might seek to spam the system,
falsely marking information as useful, it is anticipated that scientific
communities will generate far less spam than does the world at large. Results of
the research will be made available to other researchers, and incorporated in
courses at all three universities. The Web site (http://arxiv_xs.rutgers.edu) is
used to disseminate information and results from this project.
