Project examines the effects of near-source bathymetry on earthquake source
parameter determination and initiates a comprehensive study of the source
parameters of tsunami earthquakes. Investigates sensitivity of typical source
parameter inversion techniques to inadequake Green's functions through the
analysis of synthetic test cases. Develops advanced asymptotic and numerical
techniques for calculating accurate Greens functions for source regions with
non-planar bathymetric or structural interfaces. Project has direct application
to the earthquake hazard reduction program.
