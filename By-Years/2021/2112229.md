The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is to improve video streaming for applications ranging from consumer
viewing to remote education. The proposed platform reduces the need for data
centers and Content Distribution Networks (CDNs), leading to cost reductions for
video delivery. By potentially reducing network congestion and increasing
network resilience to failures, the resulting solution can help improve viewersâ€™
experience. Moreover, because video streaming represents 80+% of internet
traffic, the proposed technology will contribute to a reduction in the energy
consumption and carbon footprint of the cloud computing infrastructures
currently used for this service. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project leverages and extend state-of-the-art
research in artificial intelligence, stochastic systems and edge networks,
addressing three key challenges: (1) Design of a decentralized artificial
intelligence optimization algorithm that efficiently manages video traffic; (2)
Design of an advanced simulation environment capable of efficiently mimicking
the behavior of real-world networks of users for system design and assessment;
(3) System optimization for use on a wide range of
devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
