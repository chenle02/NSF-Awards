The terminal nerve is a cranial nerve found in all classes of vertebrates.
Peripherally, this nerve connects to the nasal epithelium. There is very little
hard evidence which tells us the function of the terminal nerve. However, this
nerve has been previously implicated in sensory and motor functions and just
recently it has been implicated in the control of certain reproductive
processes. One hypothesis is that the chemosensory component of this nerve
detects sexual pheromones and facilitates reproductive behavior by releasing
LHRH into brain areas controlling sexual activity, reproductive reflexes and
gonadotropin secretion. Dr. Leo Demski has been studying the terminal nerve and
will continue his work by taking advantage of unique features of the system in
stingrays, its separation from the olfactory tract and its large ganglion which
has characteristics suggesting neurosecretion directly into cerebral vessels.
Sophisticated neuroanatomical and developmental techniques will be employed to
define the precise functions of the terminal nerve.
