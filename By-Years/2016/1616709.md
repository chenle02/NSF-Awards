The goal of this program is to measure the signal of hydrogen (HI) 21cm
wavelength emission originating during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and
redshifted to very low radio frequencies (about 70 MHz). The EoR was a period
when new stars and black holes transformed the universe from being largely
neutral to being largely ionized, and is one of the last frontiers in the
history of the universe yet to be explored. Broader impacts include training of
graduate students and postdocs in astronomical instrumentation. In addition, he
team will develop open-source, online, active-learning tools using the new
technology of Jupyter notebooks served from the Cloud. This will enable
presentation of interactive mixed text and graphical materials that execute in
browser windows. The technology is potentially applicable to all STEM fields.

The investigators will use their own instrument, the Large Aperture Experiment
to Detect the Dark Age (LEDA), to attempt to detect the HI sky-averaged
absorption spectrum from the EoR at redshifts near 20. LEDA is part of a larger
instrument called the Owens Valley Long Wavelength Array, located at the Owens
Valley Radio Observatory in central California.
