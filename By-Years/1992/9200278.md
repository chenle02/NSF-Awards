This award in mathematical physics supports the continued development of the
renormalization groups as a rigorous mathematical tool for the study of quantum
field theory models. In this way one can study the basic properties of theories
which describe the elementary constituents of matter. It is also a tool for
studying critical phenomena in statistical mechanical systems.
