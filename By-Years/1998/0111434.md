The ultimate goal is to build a mathematical model that captures the cross-talk
between cell proliferation and cell death signaling pathways. The focus of the
proposed work is on the Ras/Raf and P13K/Akt pathways. Preliminary data will be
gathered that investigates and illustrates the cross-talk between these
pathways. With an improved understanding and a mathematical description in-hand,
an improved base for optimizing cell culture or developing pharmaceutical
compounds can be envisioned.
