Ubiquity of multicore processors has created a demand to support parallel
processing in all programming languages. However, the dynamic nature of
scripting languages makes supporting correct parallel programming in these
languages especially difficult. Recent research has enabled safe parallel
programming through speculative program parallelization. This project extends
these techniques to support parallel programming in the Ruby language. The work
focuses on three areas: the interpreter, the core language libraries, and the
garbage collector. Through experimentation on Ruby, the research helps to
understand the general synergy and limitations when a dynamic language meets
dynamic parallelization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting parallel Ruby
implementation is a general-purpose parallel language that can be used by non-
programming experts. Because of its ease of use, it is expected to be very
useful for rapid prototyping of parallel programming applications and teaching
parallel programming across all scientific disciplines. Transfer of this
technology is facilitated by open-source distribution of the code on the Web.
Outreach activities associated with the project include work with pre-college
students, recruitment of students from under-represented groups, and
collaboration with industry. Education is integrated with the research through
involvement of students in the language implementation, and by experimentation
with the use of the parallel Ruby language in several courses.
