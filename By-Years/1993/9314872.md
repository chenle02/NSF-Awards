9314872 Sorooshian This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in hydrology between research groups at the University of Arizona, led by
Soroosh Sorooshian, and the Remote Sensing Laboratory in Montpellier under the
direction of Alain Vidal. The objective of their research is to analyze data
from several international field experiments, and integrate the data with
hydrologic models that focus on the transfer of heat and moisture in temperate,
arid and semiarid regions. The experiments include the Monsoon '90 experiment,
sponsored by NASA, USDA-ARS and USGS, the CNES/NASA multi-aircraft campaign and
the hydrologic-atmospheric pilot experiment in the Sahel. Fluxes of moisture and
energy between the land surface and lower atmosphere are key components to
understanding atmospheric processes and climate. The proposed multidisciplinary
data analysis of ground-based measurements and remote sensing observations at
different geological sites could lead to models which are applicable to a range
of conditions and sites. The project takes advantage of the complementary
expertise of the U.S. and French teams in analysis of remotely sensed data and
in hydrologic modeling. ***
