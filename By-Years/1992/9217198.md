9217198 Hollibaugh The autoanalyzer will be used by multiple users in a variety
of estuarine research projects, all of which require fine levels of precision
and accuracy in nutrient analysis. Experiments determining how pools of
nutrients change in response to different biogeochemical variables form the
general basis of these projects. Primarily, research on NSF (OCE 89-14921) and
USDA (91-37102-6859) projects will benefit from acquisition of the autoanalyzer,
through the examination of nutrients in the water column, sediments, and primary
producers of Tomales Bay, California. Additionally, the abilities of the
autoanalyzer will be exploited by other users to measure nutrient status and
flux in sections of San Francisco Bay, in tidal wetlands of coastal California,
and along the reef tract of the Florida Keys. All of these projects address how
nutrients are processed in aquatic environments, ultimately to understand the
connections between human activities and the function of estuaries. The proposed
autoanalyzer will contribute greatly to this goal and will be an integral aspect
of ongoing research and education at Tiburon Center.
