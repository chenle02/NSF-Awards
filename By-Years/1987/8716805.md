Atmospheric tides are maintained by a continual supply of energy from the sun
and moon. This energy is acquired by absorption of solar radiation in the lower
and middle atmosphere, and from solar radiation in the lower and middle
atmosphere, and from gravitational tide forces, which act in the lower
atmosphere. The energy thus supplied is used to overcome internal dissipation.
The energy balance must also account for the exchange of energy between the
atmosphere and the underlying ocean and solid earth. The aim of this research is
to make a quantitative assessment of the sources and sinks of atmospheric tidal
energy. The lunar semidiurnal tide is the simplest case, because it is excited
only by gravitational forces. This makes it possible to infer the dissipation
from the observed distribution of tidal pressure at the earth's surface. The
solar diurnal tide, although purely thermal in origin, is a more difficult case
because the dissipation can be estimated only by numerical modeling. The largest
atmospheric tide--the solar semidiurnal-- is the most complicated from the
standpoint of energy balance, because it has both gravitational and thermal
excitations. It, too, requires numerical modeling. Professor Platzman is a
renowned meteorologist with considerable experience with various problems of
tides, both atmospheric and oceanic; he is an ideal candidate to pursue the
proposed work.
