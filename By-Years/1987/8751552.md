The San Diego Mathematics Academic Enrichment Project is a three-year program
for elementary teachers of underrepresented minority students, undergraduate
students who are majoring in mathematics education, and minority elementary
students. The project will also provide mathematics enrichment activities to 150
2nd, 3rd, and 4th grade students and their families. The instruction will be in
the form of workshops where the children will be taught, in part, by minority
San Diego State University Engineering, Science, Mathematics and Education
students. The instructional activities will take place in a San Diego public
elementary school after school three days each week. University, School
District, Church, and Community Organizations are forming a multi-faceted
partnership to provide the enhancement, preparation and intervention in a
laboratory setting. This consortium will make a 60% match of National Science
Foundation funds.
