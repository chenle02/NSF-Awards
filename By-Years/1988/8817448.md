This project will develop computer software and techniques to extract data taken
over the polar regions by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)
sensors. These sensors include imagers that operate in the visible/infra.red
range, and profilers that operate in the microwave range. These data will extend
the antarctic environmental data base currently produced by the NOAA series of
polar orbiters and captured by ground stations at McMurdo and Palmer. The DMSP
sensors have a greater resolution than the NOAA series sensors, and have
specific advantages, one of which is that the DMSP Optical Line Scanner can use
moonlight to provide visible spectrum images during the polar night. The first
year will be devoted to developing software and techniques for processing the
data; the second year will be devoted to defining, in conjunction with the
antarctic meteorological community, applications of DMSP data to questions
concerning atmospheric dynamics, ocean circulation, and ice dynamics in and
around the antarctic continent.
