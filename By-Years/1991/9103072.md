The Fellow will study the relationship between macroscopic mineral reactivity
and microscopic mechanisms of interfacial reactions. Such studies are now
possible with the availability of techniques of accurately measuring the
kinetics of surface controlled interfacial reactions and the recent development
of in- situ spectroscopic and microscopic technologies. The mineral reactivities
observed in geologic systems, coupled with microscopic surface processes, can
lead to fuller understanding of mineral solution systems in weathering,
pollutant migration and geochemical cycling of the elements. The Fellow will
work at Stanford University during the tenure period.
