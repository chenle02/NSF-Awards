Through this grant the university is developing a six- workstation laboratory to
provide enrichment in computer science courses at the advanced undergraduate
level. The laboratory corrects a lack of integrated instruction involving
networking, client/server database applications, OOP, and computer graphics by
allowing students to conduct projects directed by faculty members. These
projects are significant in that they enhance the real-world skills of students
entering the workforce, increase the number and quality of student
project/presentations, and produce publications of particularly successful
laboratory projects.
