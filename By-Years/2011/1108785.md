This award partially supports a series of three national and international
Frontiers of Engineering (FOE) Symposia organized by the National Academy of
Engineering: Japan-America FOE (June 6-8, 2011, in Tsukuba, Japan), U.S. FOE
(September 19-21, 2011, in Mountain View, CA), and European Union-U.S. FOE
(November 3-5, 2011, in Irvine, CA). Each symposium focuses on four topical
areas. Topics for 2011 include additive manufacturing, engineering sustainable
buildings, neuroprosthetics, semantic processing, robotics, smart grid, bio-
inspired materials, massive data management, future cities/sustainable cities,
advanced manufacturing, and biology and computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between
sixty and one hundred outstanding, early-career scientists and engineers
participate in each symposium. Sessions consist of presentations by speakers on
leading edge research, emerging technologies, and opportunities for
collaboration across science and engineering fields. The symposia foster
interdisciplinary and international collaborations and serve as a reference
point for many of the emerging frontiers in research and innovation in the U.S.
Presentations from the U.S. FOE seminar will be posted on the NAE FOE web site.
