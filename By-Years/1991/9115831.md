This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in experimental
physical chemistry involving William Breckenridge and graduate students at the
University of Utah and Benoit Soep and Christophe Jouvet at the University of
Paris, Orsay. The investigators propose to develop new techniques for probing
the reaction dynamics of half collisions of electronically excited metal atoms.
Dr. Breckenridge brings to this collaboration his expertise in spectroscopy and
chemical dynamics. His laboratory has developed the ability to synthesize
complexes involving metal atoms with pure hydrogen. This is complemented by the
French investigators' expertise and capabilities for conducting experiments
involving a pico-second laser system. These experiments will provide information
about physical and chemical processes that occur on the surfaces of metal atoms.
By extending their work to the pico- second region, the investigators will be
able to characterize some of the slower dynamical processes which occur during
atom/atom collisions.
