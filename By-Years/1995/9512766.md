This award supports a 12 month Japan Society for the Promotion of Science
Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Diane Peapus, Department of Biochemistry, Case
Western Reserve University, at the Department of Chemistry, Kyoto University,
Kyoto, Japan. Dr. Peapus will work with Professor Kunio Miki on a research
project entitled, `Crystallographic Studies of Physiologically Important
Enzymes.` The project aims to identify the structural basis for the biological
function of key enzymes in important metabolic pathways using protein structures
determined by X-ray crystallography. Two enzymes, metapyrocatechase and famesyl
pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase, will be examined. The structure of the native
enzyme along with the structures of bound forms will give information on 1)
protein/substrate and protein/inhibitor binding interactions, 2) the geometry of
the active site iron atom in bound and unbound states, 3) a molecular rationale
for substrate specificity, and 4) mutations and/or conditions which would
possibly relax substrate specificity or enhance detoxification. These studies
will broaden our general understanding of the relationshop between the structure
and function in biological mechanisms and open the way for possible intervention
in regulating these pathways by either genetic, pharmaceutical, or chemical
methods. The proposed research addresses a fundamental concern in the field of
chemistry and the participants are well-matched for a cooperative effort. As
Professor Miki is a recognized expert in the research area and Dr. Peapus has
had considerable experience in the research techniques to be used, it is
expected that both participants will benefit from the exchange. As such, the
research satisfies the objectives of the program in its emphasis on the exchange
and transfer of scientific knowledge through international collaboration.
