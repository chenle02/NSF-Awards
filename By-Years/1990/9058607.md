This research addresses transducers and measurement systems using ultrasound
for applications in bioengineering. The research goal is the development of an
ultrasonic measurement system with a mechanically adjustable focus, achieved by
use of a waveguide. The adjustable focus allows control of spatial resolution
and penetration depth based on the physical profile of the acoustic field. By
controlling these parameters, the measurement system may be used to investigate
biological systems of variable size, shape, and density. After an initial study
of waveguide materials, potential waveguides will be designed, fabricated, and
coupled with transducers. Their beam profiles will be measured and compared with
predictions. Laboratory tests will be developed to demonstrate application of
the system to blood flow measurement and dynamic characterization of soft
tissue.
