The investigators propose a three-day meeting, the Midwest Conference on
Mathematical Methods for Biomedical Images and Biological Surfaces, to be held
in the fall semester of 2008 in Michigan State University. This meeting will
bring together researchers at different career stages and graduate students,
mainly from the Midwestern area who work or are interested in mathematical
methods for biomedical images and biological surfaces. With the explosion of new
ideas and exciting new challenges in this area, this meeting aims to provide a
forum to exchange new ideas and results related to research and equally
importantly, to foster the interaction and collaboration between faculties and
students in mathematics, engineering and life sciences.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested funding will be used principally to support
participants. Additional funding will come from Michigan State University. A
large portion of the NSF funding will be used to support the participation of
graduate students and junior faculty members, particularly those in the under-
represented minority groups.&lt;br/&gt;
