9315913 Van der Voo The Pis will document the mode of occurrence of the magnetic
mineral that carry primary magnetizations as well as the habitat of secondary
magnetic mineral that carry remagnetizations in a variety of rock types. This is
of importance for models of rock-fluid interaction, hypotheses of large-scale
versus local fluid flow and tectonic interpretations of paleomagnetic results.
