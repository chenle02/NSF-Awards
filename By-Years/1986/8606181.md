An instrument system will be purchased to assist in determining relationships
between surface properties of solids suspended in wastewater being treated and
their adsorptive character toward substances in solution. This research is
likely to lead to better characterization of surfaces than is now possible and
new hypotheses concerning the role of electrostatics in sorption and degradation
phenomena. The insturment will be used in studies of changes in surface
properties and adsorption phenomena for metal oxides, of different effects of
surface electrostatics on sorption of certain anions and cations, of sorption of
organics and ionis from natural wastes on clays and other aquatic particulates,
and of degradation of wood waste particulates in anaerobic treatment.
