This project aims to serve the national interest by developing universal
computing curricula of Computing-As-Literacy at three different higher education
institutions. Literacies such as careful reading, cogent writing, and compelling
presentation serve many professional paths. However, Computing-As-Literacy has
not been universally covered in science and engineering curricula. This project
will develop and pilot new computing curricula at three Southern California
colleges and universities. Every student at the three institutions will
experience the new computing curricula, regardless of studentsâ€™ backgrounds and
academic majors These curricula will explore whether and how computing-as-
literacy can benefit all students, institutions, and STEM fields themselves.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In this project, three Computing 1 courses will be
developed, piloted, and assessed for all undergraduates at three institutions.
Similar to Composition1, Computing1 will not be a one-size-fits-all but a
foundation-building-for-all course. Computing1 will be as varied, diverse, and
creative as the three host institutions. The proposed curricula at the three
different institutions will serve as role models for other colleges and
universities nationwide to build their own universal computing curricula of
Computing-As-Literacy, in support of their own distinctive missions and
identities. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects
to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the
Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration,
and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
