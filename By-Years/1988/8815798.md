It is proposed to continue there research on magnetic phase transitions at low
temperatures. Major interest centers on finding new materials which exhibit
interesting physical phenomena. The compounds of chromium(III) are interesting,
for they complement current studies on the Haldane conjecture. The
tetrahaloferrates(III) are a new series of materials with odd stoichiometries
which require complete chemical and structural characterization in order to
understand their magnetic properties. Bimetallic compounds are of importance
because they offer the best way to prepare new ferrimagnets, and also perhaps
new ferromagnets. Heavy-metal compounds have been little studied but offer a
variety of potentially interesting physical phenomena. Extensive collaborations
with others are a major part of the program.
