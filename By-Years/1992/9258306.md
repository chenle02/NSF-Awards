This is a study of magnetic properties of uniform ultrafine particles and their
arrays fabricated by micro-electronics facilities. The objective is to
understand outstanding problems such as, magnetic perpendicular anisotropy,
magnetic internal structures, finite size effects, and macroscopic magnetic
orderings, all are crucial to the potential applications of these novel
structures.
