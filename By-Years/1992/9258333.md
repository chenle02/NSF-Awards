This National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award will support the
development of state-of-the-art mid-infrared instrumentation for use with the
new generation of large ground- based telescopes. The principal investigator,
Dr. Rognvald Garden, will use this instrumentation to study protoplanetary
systems and the winds generated by young stars.
