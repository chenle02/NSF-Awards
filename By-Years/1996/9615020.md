9615020 Design of drilled foundations for urban infrastructure rehabilitation
requires that a significant reduction be taken in the strength of the
geomaterials into which they are installed, which leads to relatively high
construction costs. With increasing budgetary constraints on infrastructure
management, there is an immediate need to develop straightforward and practical
means to restore the strength of geomaterial to reduce the cost of construction.
This research explores a speculative but potentially economically important
method to enhance the capacity and predictability of side shear in drilled
shafts by the use of lime slurry conditioning. In particular, this project
addresses the conditioning of the soil/concrete interface through a coordinated
study involving both laboratory and field tests in natural soil. This study will
involve the joint efforts of both the University of Houston and Bogazici
University in Turkey, and is supported by contributions in kind from both the
International Association of Foundation Drilling and the National Lime
Association. ***
