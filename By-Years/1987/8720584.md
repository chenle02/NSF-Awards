This award provides one-half the funding necessary to acquire an electron
microprobe x.ray analyzer to be installed in the Department of Earth and
Planetary Sciences at Purdue University. The new microprobe system will be
employed for high.spatial resolution element distribution analysis in research
projects on upper mantle mineralogy of kimberlites and diamonds, mineral
separation technology, coal petrology, extraterrestrial materials,
multicomponent diffusion, and will be available as a general analytical tool to
the Purdue Materials Research Group.
