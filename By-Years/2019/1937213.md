The TCU Enterprise Advancement Centers (TEA Centers) strand allows TCUP
institutions to capitalize on their investments in STEM instruction and
research. A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to
increase the intellectual leadership of TCUP institutions so that they can
address scientific or engineering needs or interests, specifically for their
tribes or communities, or broadly for the Nation. This project aligns directly
with that goal, and moreover will impact the economic strength of the Mandan
Arikara Hidatsa (MHA) Nation by fostering new STEM employment opportunities and,
through multiple pathways, providing the high-skilled workforce required for
those opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College (NHSC)
will establish an academic and professional pathway to increase the number of
engineers from and employed by the MHA Nation and local industry. The project
builds upon the success pre-engineering collaborative that developed the pre-
engineering program of study at NHSC, allowing students to transfer to North
Dakota State University for upper division preparation. The Full Circle
Engineering Center of Excellence will prepare and provide students with
internships during their junior and senior years and then facilitate the tribe
or industryâ€™s hiring them as junior engineers, with the ability to rotate among
several departments as they find their preferred niche. The junior engineers
will work with professional engineers to learn non-classroom aspects of
engineering practice, such as safety and communication. The Center will also
conduct community outreach events to demonstrate the role that engineering plays
in the quality of life of the community, and the role of the Center in providing
engineers for that contribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
