Columbia University Theory Day isto be held twice a year at Columbia University,
once in the fall and once in the spring (1992-1994). It attracts 100-150 people
mostly from the New York City metropolitan area. Theory Days have two goals. The
first is to give an opportunity to theoretical computer scientists to meet. The
second is to enable people outside of theory to learn about new developments in
theoretical computer science. The Department of Computer Science at Columbia
University covered the expense of Theory Day during the first five years, and
the department together with the National Science Foundation covered the expense
in the following four years.This award helps to cover the expenses of the next
six theory days.
