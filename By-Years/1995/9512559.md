9512559 Scully This action will provide partial support for a group of minority
undergraduate physics majors to attend a one-week summer school, and then a one-
week workshop, on the foundations and applications of quantum mechanics. This
will help these students participate in the most recent activities in
theoretical physics, and will enable them to be better placed to consider future
careers in science. ***
