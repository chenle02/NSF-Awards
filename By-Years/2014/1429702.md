This award is co-funded by EPSCoR program.&lt;br/&gt;This MRI project is to
acquire a computing resource (35 compute nodes each having 2, 8 core Intel Xeon
processors, with two nodes having GPU accelerators) that will enable a number of
interesting and carefully detailed research efforts at University of Central
Oklahoma. Research includes projects on particle transport, stochastic modeling,
ecological modeling, bio-informatics and spread of disease. A number of well-
developed broadening participation activities in education and research are also
proposed.&lt;br/&gt;This project is leveraging the established network of 2- and
4-year colleges for collaborations and is facilitating integration of research
and education through training opportunities for students and high school
teachers.
