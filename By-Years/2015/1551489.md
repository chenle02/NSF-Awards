Deep learning, first proposed in 1989, still represents the most effective means
for extracting specific information from large datasets. This approach exploits
many nonlinear processing layers to develop representations of data at
increasing levels of abstraction. Deep learning has demonstrated best-in-class
performance in a range of applications, including image and speech recognition,
and demonstrated promising results for tasks based on natural language
understanding and translation. Crudely speaking, deep learning acquires
¡®knowledge¡¯ by tuning large numbers (¡Ý200) of fitting parameters during a
supervised learning phase. These parameters are then used to extract information
from previously ¡®unseen¡¯ data. Ultimately, deep learning is premised on using
a large number of tuning parameters to develop nonlinear feature detectors
capable of efficiently representing the intrinsic structure of the data at an
abstract level.¡±&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will examine two potentially
powerful, but highly speculative alternative approaches to extract information
from data. These approaches exploit the intrinsic properties of the data rather
than an extensive set of tuning parameters. Both approaches are based on
conjectures made by the PIs regarding possible extensions of techniques
successfully applied in very different branches of mathematics. The first
concerns the extraction of specific structural information from random sightings
of objects; the second, forecasting the behavior of dynamical systems [6]. The
ultimate goal of this project is to determine whether the aforementioned
algebraic topological approaches or techniques developed for the forecasting of
high-dimensional time-series or some variations thereof, can be exploited to
create a new class of non-iterative unsupervised learning algorithms. The
broader impact of the project is the training of young scientists at the
hitherto unexplored intersection of abstract mathematics and machine learning,
with possible applications in science,&lt;br/&gt;technology, and commerce.
