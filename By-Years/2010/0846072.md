Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ju, Tao (0846072)&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Reconstructing
Geometrically and Topologically Correct
Models&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bio-medical imaging and 3D scanning are
widely used for acquiring realistic digital models of real-world objects, from
those that are around us, like coffee mugs and statues, to those within us, like
proteins and organs. In many applications, polygonal surfaces need to be
reconstructed from the data captured by scanning or imaging. Besides
visualization, these polygonal models have wide uses in computation and
manufacturing, where geometrically and topologically correct models are
required. However, as the input data is often noisy or incomplete, it is still
difficult in practice to obtain correct polygonal surfaces using existing
reconstruction algorithms. The reconstructed surface may exhibit geometric
inconsistencies including gaps, holes and intersections, and more often,
topological artifacts such as handles and disconnections. Furthermore, most
reconstruction algorithms that promise geometrically correct outputs are
designed for closed surfaces with well-defined inside and outside, and hence not
applicable to surfaces that contain intended open boundaries or interior
membranes. These more general surfaces are commonly used in CAD as well as bio-
medical modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is developing robust
polygonal surface reconstruction algorithms that offer guarantees for geometric
and topological correctness. To achieve this goal, an integrated framework is
developed that combines and extends existing surface reconstruction and model
repair algorithms to produce correct polygonal models that best represent the
input data, in the form of either 3D point clouds or grayscale volumes. The
research is also exploring new reconstruction and repair algorithms for open and
non-manifold surfaces, thereby extending the correctness guarantees to a much
larger class of models than those can be handled by existing methods.&lt;br/&gt;
