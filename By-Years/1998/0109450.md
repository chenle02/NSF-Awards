This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility of using magnetic tensor gradiometry to both locate and
determine the depth of buried underground and/or submerged underwater ferrous
pipes. Detection and location of subsurface pipes is of great importance to the
utility, natural gas, and petroleum industries. Existing techniques such as
Ground Penetrating Radar suffer from a number of limitations, including the
inability to accurately scan through multi-component soil and water. This
technique uses passive magnetic gradiometry to detect underground and underwater
ferrous pipes, and is unaffected by the presence of water. Commercial
magnetometer-based pipe locators do not measure enough component of the magnetic
field and the magnetic gradient to be able to correctly find the depth of the
buried pipe. During Phase I, the feasibility of detecting and locating one
ferrous pipe in the presence of other ferrous pipes in the vicinity will be
studied.

A magnetic tensor gradiometer based pipe locator will first find applications in
the natural gas, petroleum, and the utility industries. In addition, the
gradiometer could be easily adapted to find underground structures, underwater
vehicles, buried current-carrying conductors, buried unexploded ordnance and
mines and concealed weapons.
