This RAPID project explores the impacts of 2009-2010 Tennessee science standards
requiring schools throughout the state to teach elementary school students about
how natural selection drives adaptation and biological evolution. The project
will address the following questions: (1) how and why these standards were
developed and adopted; (2) how the mandate will be implemented (from state to
classroom levels); (3) how these implementations are negotiated on the local
level (parental demand vis-Ã -vis state government and teachers); and (4) how the
resulting curricula inform students' learning of evolution. This project offers
the opportunity to study, in real time, what happens when controversial new
standards are imposed upon local schools from afar. The project mixes a variety
of anthropological and cognitive methodologies, from randomized control
experiments of biological knowledge to the collection of ethnographic, survey,
and interview data of stakeholders. The results promise to shed light on issues
in curricular development, teacher training, and the interplay of social,
organizational, and governmental factors that affect teaching and learning.
