ABSTRACT CTS-9622178 Goodson REG Support was requested for a scanning probe
microscope and a pulsed Nd:YVO4 laser to be used to control temperatures in
manufacturing processes at very small length scales. Applications to electronic
circuits, MicroElectroMechanical Machines and biomedical components are
envisioned.
