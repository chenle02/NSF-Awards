The University of Massachusetts proposes an expansion of the Commonwealth
Alliance for Information Technology Education (CAITE). CAITE ? an alliance of
three campuses of the University of Massachusetts and six community colleges,
that aims to increase participation and retention along the high-school-to-
community-college-to-four-year-to-graduate-school pipeline. Much of the focus is
on community colleges because of the central role they play in reaching out to
underserved populations and in serving as a gateway to careers and further
higher education. CAITE aims to make academic IT pathways attractive and
nurturing, and to ensure that students -- particularly women and
underrepresented minorities -- are adequately prepared to enter them. This
extension brings in a fourth region and new regional partners. In addition, it
strengthens and re-focuses the work of the existing CAITE Alliance, forging
stronger direct ties to other BPC projects, modifying outreach and pathway
strategies based on lessons learned from the original grant, and developing new
interventions designed to increase participation and retention. The extension of
CAITE will be data-driven, informed by best practices developed locally and
nationally, and focused on replication and dissemination.
