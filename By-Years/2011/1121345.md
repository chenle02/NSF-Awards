Many vertebrate and invertebrate organisms, including humans, retain the ability
to make new neurons throughout life and to incorporate these into circuits in
the adult brain. This process of adult neurogenesis occurs in the crayfish brain
via a system that has many features in common with higher vertebrates,
suggesting a common strategy for the generation of new neurons in adult brains.
However, neuronal precursor cells in the crayfish brain are spatially separated,
allowing studies on specific components of the lineage. This organization and
other aspects of the crayfish system provide unique opportunities to explore the
sequence of cellular and molecular events leading to the production of adult-
born neurons. In the crayfish brain, first-generation precursors (neuronal stem
cells) are not self-renewing, but instead are replenished from a source external
to their niche. In vitro experiments suggest the hematopoietic (blood-producing)
system as one source of these cells. This proposal will, (1) explore the
structure and functional regulation of the first-generation neuronal precursor
cells; (2) examine the influence of endogenous and environmental agents on the
precursor lineage; and (3) probe the attraction mechanisms between blood cells
and the niche in real time with time-lapse cell tracking. If a relationship
between blood cells and neuronal stem cells is confirmed by these studies, it is
anticipated that this project will have profound implications on our
understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the development and evolution of
the nervous system. The primary impact of these studies will be to define
further the origins and function of neuronal stem cells, to promote a re-
examination of the relationship between the hematopoietic and nervous systems in
an evolutionary context, and to train numerous undergraduate students as the
next generation of young neuroscientists.
