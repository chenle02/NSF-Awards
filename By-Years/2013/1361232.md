This CAREER engineering education research project will advance our
understanding of the differences in how engineering students and practicing
engineers understand fundamental concepts of civil engineering. By mapping these
differences, the project will help bridge the gap between what is taught in
college and what students need to know to become effective civil engineers.
Using the results of this research, educators understand be able to develop
curricular materials that allow students to more rapidly enter the professional
practice of engineering. A key aspect of this project is sharing the teaching
tools widely among other universities.
