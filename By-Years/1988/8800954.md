Under the guidance of Dr. Natalie Uhl at Cornell University, graduate student
Francesca Grifo will conduct field work in Central America and the West Indies
to collect samples of species of the tropical plant genus Myrcianthes. These
will complement collections already made from Andean South American locales, and
will permit comprehensive study of the morphology and anatomy of these tropical
plants. Research will help describe more accurately the estimated 45 species in
the genus, map their geographical distributions, provide a reliable
identification key, and provide evidence for inferring the evolutionary history
of divergence among the species and related genera. Patterns of diversity in
Myrcianthes can then be compared to those for other tropical plant genera, to
search for common patterns of evolution in the Neotropics.
