AGI will provide cataloging of resources for the DLESE Broad Collection.
Cataloging is performed by GeoRef staff who have degrees in geoscience-related
fields, experience in the classroom and training in cataloging, abstracting
and/or indexing. The DLESE Board Collection should grow between 1500-2000 items
per year through this direct cataloging effort. Resources for cataloging will
come from the following DLESE-based sources: resources identified through the
efforts of the Evaluation Core Services; Community Core Services Exemplars; and
the resources identified through the DWEL project, but not included in DWEL's
reviewed collection. The metadata framework has undergone changes during the
initial development of DLESE. Some fields have been added to the current DLESE
cataloging system and other fields have been changed both in content and
application. Consideration is being given to expanding the application of the
national education standards to resources. Audience fields have been adjusted
during the development of the file. Geospatial parameters will undergo change
with the implementation of the new framework. The Earth System Science (ESS)
vocabulary is currently being reviewed and is expected to be ready for
implementation to begin within the next year. A separate Metadata Workshop will
consider the metadata structure and the backfilling needs across DLESE.
Priorities for backfilling will be identified as a result of that workshop.
Given that the final decision on priorities will not be made until the Metadata
Workshop is complete, reasonable assumptions for backfilling priorities are that
backfilling would be seen as essential for, at least, the Earth System Science
(ESS) vocabulary and the national science standards. By the time the ESS
vocabulary is complete, approximately 4000 catalog records would require
backfilling for the ESS vocabulary.
