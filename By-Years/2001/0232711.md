This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will test the viability
of a desktop computer-based basin simulator that is networked to distribute
database management, simulation, and visualization. The basin simulator has been
in development since the mid-1980's and presently exists as a research tool. The
focus of this project is to bring recent developments in operating systems,
programming languages, desktop computers, and client/server database management
systems into the program to make it accessible to industry and academia. The
software will be a computationally intensive, networked program. Off-the-shelf
technology and hardware will allow the cost of the program development and
maintenance to be competitive in the market.

Success of this project will further advance geological sciences to include more
fundamental physical and chemical concepts, and to promote multi-disciplinary
industry and academic collaborations for developing even more advanced basin
simulators.
