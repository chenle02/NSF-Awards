9360797 Minze This project is to develop an Automatic Tool Trajectory assessment
and Correction System for use during process development and process monitoring
of Computer Numerical Control machine tools. The system will directly measure
the spatial coordinates of the dynamic tool path embodied in a particular part
program for comparison with the desired path coordinates. An off-line processor
will automatically create a modified part-program to correct the path errors and
download it to the machine controller. The instantaneous tool coordinates along
the path are obtained by simultaneous readings of three laser ball bars and
trilateration. Successful development of the system will allow for significant
reductions in the amount of time needed to develop verified part programs from
design data. Other benefits of the system include rapid recovery from machine
"crashes", ability to perform statistical process control in a much more
scientific manner, and rapid diagnostics for machine maintenance purposes.
Implementation of this technology will allow for significant improvements in the
process accuracy of commodity-grade as well as special purpose machine tools.
