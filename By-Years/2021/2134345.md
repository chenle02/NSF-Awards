The NSF Convergence Accelerator program supports use-inspired, team-based,
multidisciplinary efforts that address challenges of national importance and
will produce deliverables of value to society in the near future.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop the hardware that
would be useful in miniaturizing quantum computers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
specific goal for this Photonic Engine Accelerating Atomic Quantum Engineering
(PEAQUE) project is to develop an integrated photonic control engine to power a
NISQ-scale cold atom quantum computer with more than 1000 qubits. The project is
a convergent effort on a system-level integration of optical and atomic
hardware, quantum software, and quantum metrology. The intellectual merit of
this project lies in development of miniaturized Multi-Beam Illumination and
Steering (MBIS) modules that reduce current room-sized, bulk-optics
instrumentation to miniaturized and scalable systems, which is a key scaling
challenge and pain-point in cold atom quantum computing. The MBIS modules will
be multiplexed to perform massively parallelized local gate operations on 1000s
of qubits at high speed. The project will result in development of color codes
for quantum error correction (QEC) designed specifically for cold atom qubits
and enabled by optical control hardware to improve the fidelity of NISQ
processors. The hardware developed under this project will push the boundaries
of precision measurement by advancing the state-of-the-art atomic clocks. This
project will focus on development and implementation of a fully programmable
atomic system aiming to achieve commercial-level demonstration of gate-based
quantum computing and quantum simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact of this project will be from the availability of a new and imperative
optical control technology that is critically needed by quantum computing and
simulation based on atomic qubits. The project aims to disseminate the
technology to a broad&lt;br/&gt;user base by manufacturing the hardware on wafer
scale and developing testing kits to be. The project&lt;br/&gt;also includes
significant effort in quantum workforce training, education and outreach with an
integrated&lt;br/&gt;plan of industry internships in quantum science and
engineering, recruitment and training of students&lt;br/&gt;from
underrepresented groups, course development in quantum
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
