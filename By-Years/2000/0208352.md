This proposal concerns the development of methods to allow a variety of uni-
cast, multicast, geocast and location-based mobile ad-hoc routing protocols to
adapt. It addresses specifically the ad-hoc routing protocol design related to
quantification of the mobility by specific metrics, in particular mobility,
which are used to solve various routing tasks. In this three-year project, the
following research activities will be particularly pursued. The research team
will address the development of local mobility metrics that are specific to
individual nodes. For that purpose, a generic feedback agent that resides on a
mobile node will be developed, which gathers the information required to compute
the value of the mobility metrics, and present the information to an arbitrary
type of protocol. The simulation studies under a wide variety of network
conditions will be con-ducted to determine appropriate trade-offs between active
and passive monitor-ing and optimal sampling times for estimating metrics such
as node speed, link change rate, link duration, etc. The project activities will
also include the devel-opment of example adaptive routing protocols utilizing
the feedback agent. For example, the research team will explore a protocol that
will combine location-based routing with localized flooding in an effort to
enable successful packet delivery in times of extreme network mobility (low link
duration times). Finally, the development of new mobility models that are more
realistic will be consid-ered. For example, the networks in which node speeds
vary among different parts of the network will be studied, e.g. for the case of
regions where the mobil-ity dynamics vary widely throughout the network. In
addition to the above ac-tivities the research team also plans to address a
variety of other metrics such as link change rate and passive and active traffic
monitoring metrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
