Taam 9415423 The Principal Investigator will model numerically the common
envelope evolution of binary stars. It is believed that most, if not all, short-
period binary stars (periods of hours to days) start out as long-period binaries
(periods of years), but then they pass through a common envelope phase during
which friction slows their orbital motions and converts them into short-period
systems. This research is to investigate the effect of transfer of orbital
angular momentum from the stars to a common envelope, which subsequently is
ejected by frictional processes or gravitational interactions. The research
applies to both the common envelope phases of massive stars (precursors to
binary radio pulsars and X-ray binaries) and low-to-intermediate mass stars
(precursors to cataclysmic variable systems). The objective is to determine the
parameters for which long orbital period binary systems are transformed into
short period systems, and the parameters for which two stars merge. The ultimate
goal is to lay the foundation for understanding the nature, origin, and
evolution of close binary star systems. ***
