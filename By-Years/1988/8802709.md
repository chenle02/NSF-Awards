An attempt will be made to elucidate the mechanisms of neurohormonal control of
cell volume regulation in clams. Ventricles will be isolated from the clams and
used to study the effects of two neurosecretory products on the transfer of
amino acids from the ventricle as well as changes in the levels of calcium ion.
One neural peptide under consideration is FMRFamide and the other is a
transmitter substance identified as 5-hydroxytryptamine. Changes in response of
the cells exposed to low salt media will also be measured. It is anticipated
that the information collected will shed light on the physiological role of
these two peptides in cellular volume regulation.
