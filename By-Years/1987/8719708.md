This project will construct and test a new piston- high- pressure system which
will allow routine operation at pressures of 60-100 kilobars. The design is
simple and the apparatus small, requiring one 600 ton and one 200 ton hydraulic
ram for a standard one-half inch diameter piston. The increase in operating
pressure will be achieved by the use of a sintered diamond in conjunction with a
segmented girdle support for the core. There is a critical need for direct
experimental investigation of the melting relations and other phase changes in
the Earth's mantle at pressures in the 60-100 kilobar range. Some of this need
can be satisfied by the new technology of multi-anvil high pressure systems, but
such instrumentation is extremely expensive and this project offers an
attractive alternative.
