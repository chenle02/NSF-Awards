Abstract

Proposal: DMS-9970487 Principal Investigator: Charles Epstein

Let (X,H) denote a compact, odd dimensional manifold with a contact structure,
H. The basic examples are (1) The co-sphere bundle of a compact manifold, (2)
The strictly pseudoconvex boundary of a complex manifold. Any contact manifold
has a distinguished algebra of pseudo-differential operators called the
Heisenberg algebra. Epstein and Melrose, building on work of Boutet de Monvel
and Guillemin, identified a family of order zero projection operators in the
Heisenberg algebra, generalizing the Szego projector defined on the boundary of
a complex manifold. They established that if S, S' are two such projectors then
the projection defined by S from the image of S' to the image of S is a Fredholm
map. Let i(S,S') denote the index of this restriction. We call this the relative
index. By considering Heisenberg operators which act on vector bundles, many
classical index problems can be re-phrased as relative index problems for pairs
of generalized Szego projectors. The main thrust of the proposed research is to
obtain formulae for the relative index in terms of more classical geometric
invariants, such as indices of Dirac operators and holomorphic Euler
characteristics. A general relative index formula of this type will allow
Epstein and Melrose to completely settle the general case of the Atiyah-
Weinstein problem, asking for a geometric formula for the index of an FIO
defined by a contact diffeomorphism between two co-sphere bundles. Beyond this
the investigator plans to search for analytic invariants of contact structures.
Using an approach suggested by Lempert and an extension of the Heisenberg
algebra he hopes to obtain a second formula for i(S,S'), which should be useful
in studying the small embeddable deformations of the CR-structure on a strictly
pseudoconvex, compact CR-manifold.

Partial differential equations are the principal tool for mathematical
descriptions of problems in physics, chemistry, economics, etc., and it is a
fundamental problem to decide how many solutions, if any, such an equation has.
In general this problem is too delicate to solve exactly, but there is a number
called the Fredholm index which can estimate the number of solutions. The main
result in this subject is the "Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem." The research
proposed by Epstein is concerned with extending these ideas to more general
classes of equations which arise in the context of "contact manifolds," a
natural arena for problems in mechanics and control theory. Analytical tools are
being developed which should have many applications beyond the formula for the
Fredholm index.
