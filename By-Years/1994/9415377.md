9415377 Liu This grant will provide support for several U.S. researchers to
participate in the International Symposium on Intelligent System Applications to
Power Systems to be held September 5-9, l994, at Montpellier France. The area of
intelligent system applications to power systems has been growing steadily
during the last decade. Several interesting applications have been
developed;e.g., power system fault location,alarm processing, restoration,
security assessment, and load forecasting. The U.S. leads the world in this area
of intelligent system application to power systems. This conference has active
participation from researchers in the U.S. This grant will also enable some of
the younger faculty members in U.S. universities to present their work to an
international audience. ***
