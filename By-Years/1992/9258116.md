During the NYI award period, methods for multi-disciplinary synthesis of
actively controlled complex dynamic systems will be developed and applied to
design problems in aero-servo-elasticity and intelligent structures. The
methodology will be applicable to synthesis of dynamic systems driven by strong
interactions with active controls. Smart sensors and actuators will be
integrated in the design together with appropriate structure and control laws.
An experimental component will be built and test optimized. The entire
multidisciplinary interaction effort should lead to efficient strategies for
synthesis of structures, aerodynamics, instrumentation and control.*** //
