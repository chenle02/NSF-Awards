Professor Lisa A. Holland of Kent State University is funded by the Analytical
and Surface Chemistry CAREER program to study phospholipid bicelles as
immobilized partitioning media for electrokinetic capillary chromotography. The
work involves the characterization of the bicelle media in detail as a function
of temperature, mixed micelle ratios, concentration and composition. Then the
sieving capabilities of this material will be optimized for separation of
polypeptides, proteins and DNA. The ability of bicelle solutions to incorporate
receptor systems based on biotin-avidin chemistry will be utilized.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of this work focuses on the use
of distance learning to initiate a research program in separations at Haskell
Indian Nations University. The interest is in screening traditional tribal
medicines for receptor affinity. &lt;br/&gt;
