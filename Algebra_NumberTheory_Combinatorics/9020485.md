This award supports the collaboration between Professor J. Hemmeter and
Professor V. Ustimenko of the University of Kiev under the USA/USSR program for
cooperation in the field of basic scientific research. The research is concerned
with the theory of association schemes and cellular rings in algebraic
combinatorics. The research is in the general area of combinatorics.
Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete
collections of objects can be organized. And, so it is extremely important to
modern communications, for example the design of large networks as in telephone
systems and the design of algorithms in computer science.
