This research project aims to explore and understand how geographic information
systems (GIS) can be used to promote and teach spatial thinking and social
science inquiry skills. It addresses the research question: What are effective
teaching practices using GIS to teach spatial thinking and social science
inquiry in middle-school and undergraduate classrooms? This program will study
the effectiveness of teaching practices for social science instruction with GIS
in urban public schools for specific learning objectives.&lt;br/&gt;The research
plans to develop an empirically-grounded framework for studying the ways
teaching practices with GIS interact with four other foci of research: (1)
learning objectives for inquiry skills and spatial reasoning, articulated across
grade levels; (2) learning processes with GIS; (3) GIS curriculum designs; and
(4) the design of GIS tools for learning environments. The project plans to use
the GIS tools within a culturally relevant curriculum unit for diverse students
of African American and Latino backgrounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A range of
research methods will be used to study teaching and learning, focused on a
common topic: American Migrations of African American and Latino populations
over time, using GIS-mapped census data. Research will be conducted in three
phases: (1) design experiments iteratively developing a theoretical framework,
curriculum, and instructional strategies; (2) case studies of effective
instruction at two levels; and (3) curriculum evaluations. Findings on effective
teaching and learning in middle school classrooms, with undergraduate college
students, and pre-service elementary teachers via GIS based-curriculum, will be
presented.
