Proposal Number: ECS-9734829 Principal Investigator: Dennis Deppe Title: GaAs-
based quantum dot vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers for 1.3 micron
wavelength Abstract The proposed research is to develop quantum dot vertical-
cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) and resonant cavity devices, which
operate in the 1.3 micron wavelength region, based on strained layer InGaAs
quantum dot (QD) structures grown on GaAs, and selective oxidation processes.
