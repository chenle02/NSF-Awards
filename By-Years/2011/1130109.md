The project supports graduate student participation in the 28th International
Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2011). Specifically, the project supports
travel to the conference for those who might not otherwise be able to attend for
financial reasons, and organizes a student poster-presentation program that will
facilitate one-on-one discussions and other mentoring with the world's leading
researchers in machine learning. Students are exposed to state-of-the-art work
by other researchers and have the opportunity to attend tutorials on material
that is not taught at their home institutions. Participating students receive
feedback from senior researchers beyond their institutional and national
boundaries. Furthermore, participation in the poster session and conference
helps to integrate these students into the research community and represents a
natural integration of research and education.
