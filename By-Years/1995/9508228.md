This project, funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program, will support studies by Professor Gordon Anderson of the University of
Missouri, St. Louis, on two types of bimetallic complexes of platinum and/or
palladium. The first type are homonuclear diplatinum alkyl complexes that are
bridged by (diarylphosphino)cyclopentadienyl ligands. These complexes will be
used as a platform for the investigation of mechanisms of carbonylation and
alkane elimination reactions within the dinuclear unit. The second type of
dinuclear complexes to be investigated are hydride bridged homo- and
heteronuclear palladium and platinum complexes whose dinuclear structures are
based upon bridging bis(diphenylphosphino)methane and related ligands. Alkyl
derivatives of the heteronuclear complexes will be used to study competitive
reductive elimination (of alkane), and competitive electrophilic M-C bond
cleavage reaction. The homonuclear dipalladium complexes provide a unique
opportunity to study the chemical properties of palladium hydride complexes,
which are normally highly unstable. NMR spectroscopy will be used extensively
for investigating these reactions. Catalysis is necessary to increase the rates
and often the selectivity of many industrial processes. The rational design of
new, or even improved, catalytic systems requires detailed knowledge of the
individual steps that participate in the catalytic cycle. This work is aimed at
developing the fundamental understanding of some reactions of complexes of
metals that are frequently involved in catalysis. The results of these studies
may ultimately be used to develop new catalytic processes of industrial
importance.
