Mean Field Games and Mean Field Type Control Theory have brought major advances
in decision making under uncertainty and control of dynamic systems. A
significant step was taken when P.-L. Lions introduced a new partial
differential equation known as the Master Equation, which conceptually
synthesizes all potential approaches to the field. Unfortunately, this is an
extraordinarily difficult equation. In this project, the investigators will
develop new mathematical techniques to study the Master Equation. Therefore, the
work is a contribution to the conceptual core of mean field theory, the master
equation, focusing on two important applications: energy markets and stochastic
control with partial information. The broader significance of this work is that
it will produce new insights into economics, finance, machine learning, and
other fields. Students at both graduate and undergraduate levels will be trained
in a large variety of issues and concepts, with opportunities for research and
applications.

The first problem of the project requires extended mean field control, where the
extension lies in the fact that not only the probability distribution of the
state, but also the probability distribution of the control enters in the model,
and/or in the cost functional to be minimized. It is a new branch of the general
theory, which the investigators will develop and apply to energy markets and
related problems. The second problem regards nonlocal dependence, which the
investigators will apply to the well-established domain of stochastic control
with partial information, providing new insights from a mean field point of
view. The mathematical techniques involved will include Hamilton-Jacobi
equations on infinite dimensional spaces, backward stochastic partial
differential equations, and forward-backward systems of nonlocal equations.
