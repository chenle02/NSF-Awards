This research in the laboratory of Professor Lisa Kelly at the University of
Maryland Baltimore County Campus is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic,
and Organometallic Chemistry Program under a Research Planning Grant. The
research involves the use of ruthenium complexes tethered to carbohydrates in
order to explore carbohydrates as electron-transfer (ET) mediators. Boronic acid
tied to bipyridine chelating groups will be used to bind the metal centers to
1,2 and 1,3 diol functional groups. Thermodynamic driving force and the length
of the intervening saccharide space will be varied. If reductive dissociation is
competitive with charge recombination, the release of the acceptor may introduce
new strategies for increasing the efficiency of charge separation. A class of
complexes involving the ET the donor/acceptor pair divided between the inside
and outside of cyclodextrin cavities will be investigated. This research will
extend our understanding of electron transfer through biologically important
materials.
