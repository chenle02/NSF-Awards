The Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics and the Department of Physics
at the University of Colorado, Boulder, will conduct a summer program for nine
undergraduates in the fields of atomic and molecular physics, condensed matter
physics, elementary particle physics, gravitational physics, nuclear physics,
optics, astrophysics, and geophysics. Students will be expected to master at
least a part of a large task and at the end of the summer will give short
seminars on their work. Half the students will come from the University of
Colorado and half from other colleges and universities in Colorado and
contiguous states. Special efforts will be made to solicit applications from
minorities. This project is supported under the Program of Research Experiences
for Undergraduates to help ensure an adequate supply of scientists for the
future.
