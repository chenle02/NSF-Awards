This is an award to support a project to study issues in public awareness that
impact on components of the urban infrastructure that are concerned with water
supply and distribution, wastewater collection and treatment, and management of
stormwater. Special emphasis in this project is on those components of the urban
infrastructure that impact directly on environmental and public health in
contrast to a similar project being conducted with support from the Structures
and Building Systems Program in the Engineering Directorate's Division of
Mechanical and Structural Systems that will concentrate on structures such as
roads, bridges and buildings. Results of this project are expected to provide a
basis for determination of research needs that may be utilized for program
planning purposes. The three undergraduate students who will be working on this
project are: James A. Dowd II, James Geiger, and Deborah M. Sana.
