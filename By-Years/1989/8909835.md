The interactions between neurons in the formation of a synaptic contact are
poorly understood. When a potential target is contacted by an axonal growth
cone, it initiates formation of a presynaptic terminal. Dr. Burry will examine
proteins that may be involved in the initiation and maintenance of this
important cell.cell interaction. The working hypothesis of the research project
is that >developmentally regulated proteins> are up regulated during neuritic
outgrowth, and that these proteins are present at the growth cone.target
contact. The experiments to be carried out will study the growth associated
protein, GAP.43, and two synaptic vesicle proteins, p65 and synapsin I, to
determine if their subcellular distribution and their time of appearance is
consistent with classification as developmentally regulated proteins.
Immunocytochemistry will be performed with 10 um section examined in a confocal
scanning laser microscope, with 0.5 um frozen sections examined with
epifluorescence, and silver intensified 1 nm gold for the electron microscope.
One of the main reasons for the slow progress in the understanding of mechanisms
involved in synaptogenesis has been the inability to identify developmentally
regulated proteins. The planned experiments will generate monoclonal antibodies
to developmentally regulated proteins by combining the use of enriched antigen
sources and newly developed immunization protocols.
