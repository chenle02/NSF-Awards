Dr. Jewett and other members of the Chemistry Department at the University of
Vermont are being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1996-98, eight
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry and
biochemistry. In addition to participation in research and seminars, students
receive tutorial instruction in searching the chemical literature and in
computational methods. Tours of industrial laboratories give students a sense of
contemporary industrial facilities and research programs. Participants are
recruited primarily from the Northeastern US.
