IRI-9526703 Chow, Randy University of Florida $50,000 - 12 mos SGER: Inter-
domain Authentication and Authorization for Large Information Systems The
ultimate goal in this exploratory research is to develop models and tools to
facilitate the development of a secure logical network in an untrusted physical
environment. Cooperative users should have the flexibility to define their own
security enforcement mechanisms and implementation, yet they must also conform
to the overall security policy of the system. This research will address the
fundamental issues involved in achieving this goal. This capability is needed to
permit commercial and governmental users to take full advantage of the recent
technological advances in high speed computers, high bandwidth communication,
high capacity storage devices, and Internetwork systems such as the world-wide
web. Both coordination and security across autonomous domains (independent
system administrations) are required for large, distributed information systems,
particularly ones implementing multimedia infoware designs, and increasingly
available CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work) applications.
