9300773 David Sibeck Transient events in the dayside auroral zone will be
studied using data from ground magnetometers, riometers, and radars. Each event
that is identified will be placed with a global context by comparison with any
available satellite measurements. Statistical studies will be used to determine
the characteristics and occurrence rates of each type of event. The study will
provide information on the nature of solar wind-magnetosphere interaction
processes at the magnetopause and the signatures of these processes in the
ionosphere. ***
