Under certain conditions, cells of chemotactic strains of the bacterium
Escherichia coli aggregate in spots or stripes distributed in symmetrical
arrays. Each aggregate contains a large number of cells that have migrated
toward a discrete locus in response to a signal generated by the cells
themselves. This signal is produced when cells are grown on defined media and
exposed to intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle or to hydrogen
peroxide. It is a chemical of low molecular weight sensed by the aspartate
receptor. Dr. Berg proposes 1) to identify this chemical, 2) to characterize its
mode of production, and 3) to develop a mathematical formulation that will help
explain why patterns are formed with such varied geometries. This is a cross
field endeavor that links sensory transduction, responses to stress, and
secretion of signal molecules to problems of biological self organization. It
does so with a model system readily amenable to genetic and biochemical
manipulation.
