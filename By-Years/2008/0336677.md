The grant supports the conference on electron microscopy to be held in Berkeley,
CA from Oct. 5 -10, 2003. This biannual conference has been a regular feature of
the microscopy world since 1986 with focus on the latest techniques,
instrumentation and theories. This particular symposium is timely with emphasis
on the current interest and application of electron microscopy in nano and bio
technologies as well as recent applications for in-situ studies with time-
resolved microscopies. New techniques of sample preparation such as FIB, and
computer control of transmission electron microscopies removed long standing
barriers in extending these techniques for teaching both in-class and with
remote control over the internet, and these new advances will be discussed in
the symposium that should be of interest to young researchers and students.

A large number of international experts in electron microscopy will be
presenting invited talks on the recent advances. Funds from NSF augment the
commitment of several national laboratories and instrumentation companies to
assist the attendance of several speakers and to offer financial aid to young US
researchers in the field.
