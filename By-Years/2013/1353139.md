Changes in one component of an ecological system can sometimes cause major,
relatively rapid, and seemingly permanent changes in the system as a whole. This
project offers a rare opportunity to study the reversibility of such dramatic
ecological changes in a rigorous way. The project will use a long-term
experiment in the Chihuahuan Desert in which selective exclusions of rodents
that are major seed eaters has produced sharp changes in the abundances of plant
and animal species and in levels of soil nutrients. These exclusions will be
reversed, and the effects on plants, animals, and soils measured over five
years.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include the
training of two graduate students and broad outreach to the public through
construction of a website for the communication of scientific research. In
addition, better understanding of how specific factors can cause major shifts in
ecological systems will help land managers and policy makers avoid unintended
consequences of natural resource management.
