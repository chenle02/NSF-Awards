This award will provide funding for some specific activities of the Hunter
College and African School of Economics Program to Expand Representation in
Economics (HASPERE) is to increase the pool of economists from underrepresented
backgrounds in academia and prestigious jobs in the private sector. To improve
participation rates, economics programs need to create a critical mass of
minority students, expand mentorship and financial support, and provide students
exposure and access to experiences and networks that provide them with the
motive and opportunities to pursue further studies and job opportunities in
economics. NSF funding will provide resources for student support and for
workshops that will help participating students enhance their skills in key
methods used in economics research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To ensure that all
incoming students have the mathematics and coding skills that are necessary for
success throughout the program, HASPERE will include a two-week quantitatively-
oriented summer camp to prepare incoming students for the program. During each
semester of study, students in the HASPERE program will participate in workshops
to enhance their technical skills in core areas of economics beyond the levels
of the masters program. Enrolled students will not only benefit from supportive
peers within their cohorts, but will also have personal and group mentors. In
addition, in the second year of the program, students will be provided research
experience opportunities with faculty at Hunter, ASE and a number of nearby
institutions where faculty have pledged to support this
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
