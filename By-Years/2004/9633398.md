9633398 Sinton The East Pacific Rise near 17 S is the fastest mid-ocean
spreading ridge, but the thickness of volcanic rocks appears to be the same as
on slowly spreading ridges. Magma must be supplied from the mantle, therefore,
at a much greater rate than at other ridges. This aspect suggests that there
must be numerous eruptions and a nearly constant source of magma storage. The
frequent eruptions and rapid sedimentation rate in this area make it possible to
determine relative ages of frequent eruptions. The Pis wish to determine the
frequency and size of lava flows, which could help to determine the rate at
which magma is supplied to the surface.
