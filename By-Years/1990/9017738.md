This is an SGER grant to search for particles which might explain the existence
of matter we believe exists from the motion of galaxies but which heretofore has
been invisible to any detection scheme. Such matter is known as "dark matter".
DeRujula, Glashow, et al have hypothesized the existence of dark matter in the
form of X-, a stable, singly-charged particle with mass . 1015>V, velocity .
10-3c, and flux . 1cm- 2-sec. In order to begin an exploratory search for the
hypothesized X-p cosmic rays, investigators at the University of Arizona will
place a mountain altitude three-counter cosmic ray telescope into full operation
during the term of this grant. They will search for a reaction cycle: X-p>X-d,X-
d+12C>13C+p+X-,X->X-p, all within the liquid scintillator of the counters of the
detector. Each 12C(d,p)13C reaction will cause a small (relative to charged
particles, E > 1>eV) scintillation in the detector. They will use coincidence
and anticoincidence techniques to veto large charged-particle pulses and
photomultiplier tube noise pulses in our telescope's counters. These techniques
will allow them to look for a series of small scintillations within each
counter, which might be a signature of a slow massive particle moving through
the apparatus, catalyzing nuclear reactions. At the end of the term of this
grant, they should be able to decide which directions to pursue, such as
deuterium-enriched counters, more counters, more electronics, or long data runs.
