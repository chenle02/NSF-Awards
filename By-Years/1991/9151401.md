An FTIR spectrophotometer will support a number of new experiments in our
courses. It will be a central focus of the laboratory experiments in
instrumental analysis and analytic chemistry, in organic and physical chemistry,
and in our new advanced inorganic laboratory. The instrument will provide for
new techniques in sample handling and data manipulation, as well as library
searching. The grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
