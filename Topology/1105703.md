Abstract

Award: DMS-1105703 Principal Investigator: Thang Le, Jozef H. Przytycki

This proposal supports US participation at the conference Swiss Knots 2011: Knot
Theory and Algebra, to be held in Lake Thun, Switzerland in May 2011. The goal
of the conference is to bring together experts and junior researchers to discuss
recent advances and perspectives for future developments in Knot Theory and its
interaction with Algebra. Specific topics include planar algebras,
categorification and link homology, virtual knots, quantization, and various
invariants of links and 3-manifolds.

The conference Swiss Knots 2011 will create a forum for the exchange of ideas
between the experts in knot theory and algebra. Junior mathematicians will have
a chance to learn about new developments in the fields and will be able to
present their own research accomplishments. The participants will come from all
over the world. The US researchers and graduate students will interact with
mathematicians from other countries. Organizers hope this opportunity will yield
future collaborations. More information about the conference can be found at the
website http://www.math.uzh.ch/swissknots2011/
