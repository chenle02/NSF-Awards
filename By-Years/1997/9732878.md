9732878 Hall This grant provides funding to develop methods for routing pickup
and delivery vehicles in real-time. The project will begin with the development
of statistical models for pickups and deliveries, which will capture how
requests for pickups and deliveries vary over the course of a day. These models
will be derived from data provided by industrial partners. The statistical
models will be the basis for optimization methods that allocate and route
vehicles. The methods will aim to serve the peaks in demand as efficiently as
possible. This entails minimizing the amount of backtracking in vehicle routes,
while simultaneously attempting to serve customers within their specified time
windows. The project will provide benefits to both government sponsored transit
agencies and privately operated motor carriers. In recent years, wireless
communication and on-board computing hardware have become widely available to
enable real-time routing. Yet despite the sophistication in hardware, real- time
routing is still a manual process, driven by human dispatchers. The project can
benefit industry by developing methods that reduce the number of miles driven,
increase driver productivity (measured in stops served per hour), and improve
customer service (serving customers when they want to be served). The project
will also contribute to the theory of vehicle routing through creation of models
to represent random and time-varying arrivals of service requests (i.e., a call
requesting a pickup or delivery).
