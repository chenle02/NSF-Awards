This grant supports the continued operation, and analysis of the data produced
by, induction magnetometers at South Pole and McMurdo Stations in Antarctica and
Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland. These high geomagnetic latitude sites are ideally
suited for the study of plasm physics processes which occur near the boundary of
the Earth's magnetosphere, at the poleward edge of the auroral oval and in the
polar cap. The data from this three station network, plus data from additional
new magnetometers operated by the same group but supported by other programs,
will make possible research which almost certainly will result in new insight
into the various phenomena which produce magnetic micropulsations.
