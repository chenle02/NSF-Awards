This proposed project focuses on (a) bringing together a coalition of
educators, scientists, industrial partners, and curriculum developers to
establish a strategy for the TPAD technician preparation program; (b) developing
a curriculum to provide "hands-on" enhancement opportunity to college
instructors in the area of biotechnology; (c) assessing the strategy on an
annual basis by the coalition together with outside expert advice and input; and
(d) collaborating with industry to develop the required 2-year TPAD reagents and
equipment. At the commencement of the project, the Coalition will meet to
determine the most effective strategy to initiate and address the project' s
specific goals and objectives previously outlined. Undergraduate 2-year college
faculty for the project will be recruited locally for each of the summer
workshops. The emphasis will be on the East and West Coasts, where the
biotechnology industry is concentrated and where the need for technicians is
greatest. At the completion of summer workshops, the faculty participants will
complete a general evaluation and questionnaire. The faculty practical
implementation of experiments in technician TPAD curriculum. There will be a
total of 102 faculty participants, over a four-year period. Other institutions
which will participating in this project include Seattle Central Community
College, Cerritos College, Northern New Mexico Community College, and Prince
George's Community College.
