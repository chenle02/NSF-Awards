This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility of fabricating carbon nanofiber reinforced carbon-carbon (C-C)
composite by integrating catalytic nanofiber &lt;br/&gt;growth and carbon
deposition into a single operation. The main advantage of this process
&lt;br/&gt;is the ability to directly fabricate components on substrates at a
high rate thus it avoids &lt;br/&gt;the conventionally used lengthy C-C
fabrication approach with multiple steps. As a result, &lt;br/&gt;the
manufacturing complexity, the process cycle time, and the cost will be greatly
&lt;br/&gt;reduced. In addition, since high density carbon and high strength
carbon nanofibers are &lt;br/&gt;engineered in an integrated form, the C-C
composite is expected to have unprecedented &lt;br/&gt;mechanical properties
compared with conventional C-C composite. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially
this technology will increase the reliability and reduce manufacturing cost,
thus making the &lt;br/&gt;American C-C composite products more competitive in
the world market. One immediate &lt;br/&gt;application of this composite will be
for aircraft brake components. The technology can &lt;br/&gt;also be applied to
many other applications such as computer hard disc media substrates
&lt;br/&gt;and the next generation medical implants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
