The objective of this proposed research is to investigate fundamental issues
concerning the behavior of transformation toughened zirconia-based ceramics.
This program includes studies of: chemical and environmental factors affecting
the transformation; mechanical behavior -- cyclic loading behavior, life
predictions under complex loading conditions, strength versus toughness
relationships, and transformation-induced plasticity; and, microstructures and
chemistries using x-ray (EXAFS and XRD), NMR, internal friction, and FTIR
techniques. Mechanical property studies will include uniaxial
tension/compression and triaxial flexure testing.
