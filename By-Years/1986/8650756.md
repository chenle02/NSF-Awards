The goal of this project is to update The University of Arkansas-Little Rock's
Cellular Biology course, to initiate a Biological Methods and Instrumentation
course, and to improve undergraduate student research. The instrumentation being
purchased through this award includes a liquid scintillation counter, two high
speed centrifugation units, an ultraviolet visible light spectrophotometer,
three visible light spectrophotometers, two pH meters, a tissue microcentrifuge,
fraction collectors with peristaltic pumps, one refrigerated chromatography
chamber, two water baths and four microprocessor units. This equipment is
providing students with a more thorough understanding of cellular and sub-
cellular biology.
