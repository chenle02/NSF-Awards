This award will support Dr. Rakesh Minocha of USDA Northeast Forest Experiment
Station to work for eight months in the lab of Dr. Atsushi Komamine of Tohoku
University, Sendai, Japan. They will collaborate in studying how polyamines
regulate the cell cycle of plants. The effects of polyamine depletion on DNA
synthesis and cell proliferation, and the subcellular site (cytoplasmic vs
nuclear) of action of polyamines in DNA synthesis, will be investigated.
Polyamine metabolism has an essential role in the growth and development of
plants. Dr. Komamine's expertise with plant systems, together with the
availablity of synchronously dividing cell culturesof the Madagascar periwinkle
which have been developed in his lab, will present Dr. Minocha with an excellent
opportunity to broaden her present experience with polyamines in animal systems.
