This project is in the area of the Materials Chemistry Initiative with a focus
on the study of the magnetic properties of fine particles, as well as
aggregates, powders, films and other bulk materials that can be created from
these particles. This group will also study preparation techniques for fine
particles and the physics of their aggregation and growth to bulk materials.
These two intents, while they may stand alone, are complementary in that as they
gain an understanding of magnetism in fine particles and their aggregates they
also develop a complementary understanding of how these systems may be prepared.
They will alter preparation techniques to achieve systems with unique and useful
magnetic properties. More specifically, the goals are: 1. To determine how
magnetic properties are dependent upon particle size, composition, and
morphology. 2. To develop techniques for fine magnetic particle preparation and
understand the chemistry and physics of their preparation. 3. To study
aggregation and growth of magnetic particles and the resultant morphology. The
results of this work will lead to creation of novel and useful magnetic
materials.
