9709885 Staudigel The Geochemical Earth Reference Model (GERM) initiative is a
grass-roots effort with the goal of establishing a community consensus on a
chemical characterization of the Earth, its major reservoirs and the fluxes
between them. The long term goal of GERM is a chemical reservoir
characterization analogous to the geophysical effort of the Reference Earth
Model (REM). Chemical fluxes between reservoirs are included into GERM to
illuminate the long term chemical evolution of the Earth and to characterize the
Earth as a dynamic chemical system. In turn, these fluxes control geological
processes and influence hydrosphere - atmosphere - climate dynamics. While these
long term goals are clearly the focus of GERM, the process of establishing GERM
itself is just as important as its ultimate goal. GERM is developed as an open
community discussion on the World Wide Web (http://www-ep.es.llnl.gov/germ/germ-
home.html), mediated by editors and at professional meetings. Funding is
provided for development of a preliminary model and for the organization of a
GERM workshop in La Jolla, in March 1998. ***
