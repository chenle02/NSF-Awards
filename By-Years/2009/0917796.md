This workshop which will gather most of the researchers that use vole species in
their research in order to facilitate collaborative research across several
disciplines of biology. Voles have become important animal models for
understanding processes related to behavioral ecology, evolutionary biology,
genetics and behavioral neuroscience. Because of the diversity in mating systems
in voles (e.g. monogamy vs. polygamy), and the diversity of habitats that they
occupy, voles provide a unique opportunity to better understand how behaviors
adapt to different environments, as well as how genes and brain chemicals
produce variation in behavior. Researchers using voles as animal models come
from diverse disciplines and therefore rarely interact at other scientific
meetings. The goal of the workshop is to foster collaborations among vole
researchers from different disciplines, which will have a benefit all research
fields. The meeting will consist of a series of talks from senior investigators
as well as students, post-doctoral fellows and junior scientists. Poster
sessions will allow all participants to present their work and for participants
to interact in a casual setting. Participation by students and post-doctoral
fellows will provide valuable networking opportunities and expose them to the
latest technological advancements in the field, and therefore provide important
training opportunities. The funds provided by NSF will be used mainly to provide
travel awards to students and younger investigators and to offset the cost of
the venue. This workshop is expected to have a significant impact on vole
research by facilitating collaborative research between trainees and faculty
across all disciplines. This will lead to an acceleration in discoveries
relevant to many facets of behavioral ecology, evolution, genetics and
behavioral neuroscience and a substantial broader impact in terms of
interdisciplinary training.
