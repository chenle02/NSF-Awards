9452530 Franz Lycoming College is acquiring capillary electrophoresis (CE) and
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instrumentation for use in upper
level chemistry laboratories. The project has three goals: 1 Expand chemistry
and biology majors opportunities in separation science; 2 Increase the use of
discovery-based experiments in the undergraduate curriculum; 3 Provide state-
of-the-art instrumentation for undergraduate research.
