The technique of small angle scattering is used to analyze the kinetics of
homogeneous nucleation and growth in the aluminum- zinc binary alloy system.
Supersaturation is measured as a function of time for four different average
concentrations and the results compared to the Langer and Schwartz kinetic
theory for nucleation and growth. The technique of neutron resonant scattering
is applied to a study of order-disorder reactions in the silver-gold-cadmium
alloy system. This novel approach measures for the first time partial ordering
in a ternary alloy.
