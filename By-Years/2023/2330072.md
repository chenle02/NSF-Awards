This grant supports the Cornell, Maryland, and MPI pre-doctoral Research School
(CMMRS), a week-long summer school held at the Max Planck Institute for Software
Systems in Saarbrucken, Germany, August 2023. For the third consecutive summer,
the CMMRS will introduce world-class research to students (undergraduate and
masters), and engage them, one-on-one and in small groups, with leading
researchers in the field. The 2023 CMMRS researchers span a wide range of areas,
including computer systems, heterogeneous architectures, machine learning, data
visualization, security and privacy, formal methods, and programming language
design.

The summer school exposes students, early in their careers, to the breadth and
diversity of computer science (in particular computer systems) research,
hopefully making them more likely to pursue doctoral degrees and eventually,
careers in research. The support from this grant funds travel and accommodations
for approximately 25 students from the United States to attend the summer
school. In line with previous editions of CMMRS, special attention is given to
recruit women and minority students to attend the School.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
