This award supports the research in Analytic Number Theory of Professor Michael
Filaseta of the University of South Carolina. His project is concerned with gap
problems for k-free numbers and in particular for squarefree numbers. His main
tool for attacking these problems will be an extension that he has developed to
an elementary method of Halberstam and Roth, and to combine this with
exponential sum techniques. The field of Analytic Number Theory applies to the
discrete realm of the whole numbers the techniques of Analysis, dependent on the
notions of continuity and limit, originating in Calculus. The idea of using
continuous methods to investigate the discrete is two centuries old, but with
the work of the modern analytic number theorists such as Professor Filaseta, the
field has had a new rebirth.
