Ddirect measurements of the volume transport, transport by water mass, and
overall temperature transport during an annual cycle will be made in Vitiaz
Strait between Papua, New Guinea and Umboi Island. An estimate of the warm water
carried by the western boundary current in the South Pacific toward the equator
will result. The cross.equatorial transport of heat the western boundary
currents is an important contribution to the thermal balance of the world. This
project will also contribute to enhanced monitoring for the TOGA COARE Program.
