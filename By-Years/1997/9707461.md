ABSTRACT 97-07461 Heneghan Linking spatial variation of below-ground faunal
assemblages with the structure of herbaceous vegetation Research on the ability
of plant roots to forage for soil nutrients has shown that dominant plants
forage widely and ignore small 'hotspots' of high nutrient availability; rarer
plants forage locally and can locate these hotspots. Arthropods living in
terrestrial detritus are not uniformly distributed. Their feeding (primarily on
the microbes involved in the decomposition of detritus) results in the
liberation of essential nutrients into the soil where growing plants capture
them. Thus the heterogenously distributed arthropods create a highly variable
mosaic of nutrient availability. Combining our knowledge of plants' foraging
strategies with insights into the faunal genesis of nutrient hotspots in the
soil the investigators hypothesize that soil faunal activity contributes to the
maintenance of high plant diversity. This idea will be tested in custom built
"mini-landscapes" into which soil animals will be introduced and nutrients and
plant diversity will be subsequently monitored.
