NSF/CBMS Regional Conference in Mathematical Sciences

Quiver varieties and crystal bases of quantum affine algebras at NCSU, May
25-29, 2010

The interaction between quiver representations and Lie theory has sparkled
several important developments in mathematics, On the one hand Lusztig's
canonical basis or Kashiwara's crystal bases for quantum enveloping algebras
have been a key propeller for the developments in Lie theory. On the other hand,
Nakajima's work on quiver varieties has lead to new connection among
representation theory, geometry and mathematical physics.

In order to make this new area of research accessible to a wide audience we are
organizing a CBMS conference on "Quiver theory and crystal bases of quantum
affine algebras" at North Carolina State University during May 25-29, 2010 with
Hiraku Nakajima as the principal speaker. As the inventor of quiver varieties
and a leading practioner in this field, Prof. Nakajima will give ten lectures on
the subject aiming to introduce graduate students and new comers to the current
research and chart possible future directions. We encourage participation from
women, minorities, and persons with disabilities by giving priority for
financial support.
