Recent models of ocean dynamics have attempted to couple the processes at the
surface or near the side boundaries. It has been difficult to integrate the
physics of both into analytical models. This investigation seeks to use
anlaytical models of the ocean thermocline to consider the near surface and
western boundary layer processes. The models to be used will be either layered
or continuously stratified in the vertical direction.
