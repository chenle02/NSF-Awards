Gas-driven fractures are of practical importance in the stimulation of gas and
oil wells, rock blasting with explosives, and the containment of underground
explosions. The modeling of the problem requires the coupling of two processes;
gas flow and rock fracture. Much work has been done on the formulation of the
problem, however, the numerical solution of the resulting equations are far from
satisfactory. Recent advances in computer graphics have made addressing these
problems much more tractable. It is now possible to modify the computational
mesh describing the instantaneous fracture surface during the computation using
interactive graphics. An efficient approach will be to develope automatic
remeshing schemes for the more common situations and to rely on the user for
unusual cases. Limiting special cases leads to robust remeshing algorithms. The
goal of this Engineering Initiation project will be to couple the rock fracture
finite element code with the gas flow pressure computations and develope an
interactive algorithm to simulate gas well explosions as an example problem. The
institutional support is adequate and the P.I. is well experienced in the
development of computational algorithms. I strongly recommend support.
