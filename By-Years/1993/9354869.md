9354869 Carberry We propose a training program that will produce five new PhD's
in the targeted area of Computer Science: Human-computer interface, with an
emphasis on the development of an intelligent natural language communication
system. Our proposed program will involve 1) cross-disciplinary study among
computer science, linguistics, and psychology, 2) industrial internships to
introduce students to technology transfer and provide them with application-
oriented experience, 3) international research opportunities that will expose
the trainees to international researchers and to the technology being developed
through European Esprit projects, 4) classroom teaching experience to prepare
the trainees for educating future researchers, 5) cost-sharing by the Department
of Computer Science at the University of Delaware and industrial organizations,
and 6) an aggressive recruiting effort and a detailed retention plan. ***
