This is a proposal for a workshop to identify the research needs for
computational and mathematical techniques that have application to electric
power systems. Several workshop objectives are identified including a review of
the current state of the art, identification of those computer intensive
problems of importance to the electric power industry, and identification of
those "unsolved" computational and mathematical problems deserving future
research. This workshop will also be supported by the Electric Power Research
Institute.
