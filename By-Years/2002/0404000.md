0404000&lt;br/&gt;Gower&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in response to
Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 03-043, category
NIRT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work in this application is to prepare a
Biomimetic Intrafibrillar-Mineralized Oriented-Collagen (BIMOC) material, which
will serve as a synthetic model for studying the nanostructured architecture of
natural bone. By eliminating the higher levels of structure, this will enable
individual characterization of the influence of nanoscale structure on
mechanical properties and biological function.
