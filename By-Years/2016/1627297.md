Over the past decade, the prevalence of children diagnosed with autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) has dramatically risen from 1 in 150 to 1 in 68. Such increases
in prevalence foretell greater involvement of these children in the legal
system. Yet science-based interview protocols for obtaining accurate eyewitness
reports, available for typically developing children, do not exist for children
with ASD. This study examines the effectiveness of two current child forensic
interview protocols at eliciting accurate and complete eyewitness statements
from (verbal) youth with and without ASD, and determines individual difference
predictors of eyewitness memory performance.

Children, 9- to 18-years-old, with and without ASD, will participate in a
documented event and will later be questioned with one of two forensic interview
protocols. Analyses will examine components of protocols that aid or impede
accurate reports. This study addresses debates about disability, competence, and
law. Moreover, it will expand theoretical understanding of ASD (e.g., self-
development theory) for scientists and provide needed empirical information for
legal professionals and fact finders to facilitate reaching the truth.
