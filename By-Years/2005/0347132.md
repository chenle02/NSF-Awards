This project will investigate biologically-inspired methodologies and algorithms
for several important problems in machine learning and AI: unsupervised feature
learning, multi-modal integration of sensory data, and learning for real-time
robotic systems with embedded sensors and actuators. The project will pursue
both theoretical investigations of nonlinear properties of neurons and synapses
and their role in processing of perceptual (visual, auditory, olfactory)
stimuli, as well as the applications of such properties to the design of novel
algorithms and architectures for processing of multi-modal perceptual stimuli.
This research will integrate advances in the understanding of biological systems
by building more advanced artificial sensorimotor systems. This project
integrates research and an educational agenda that includes teaching and
participation of students from the broader community in activities related to
the overall goals of this research.
