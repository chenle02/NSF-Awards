The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) Program is a 10-week colloquium at Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution to provide an interdisciplinary research and
graduate training opportunity to a number of students and recent PhD's. The
program stresses a different element of GFD each summer. For 1989 the topic is
General Circulation of the Ocean. Subsequent topics deal with Stellar Fluid
Dynamics, Vortex Dynamics in Turbulence, Dynamics of Planetary Atmospheres, and
Geometrical Methods in Fluid Dynamics.
