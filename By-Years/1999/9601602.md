Academic Research Infrastructure: Laboratory for Advanced Communications Systems
This Academic Research Infrastructure award supports the acquisition of high
speed networking equipment including wireless and wired networking
infrastructure and switches. The research projects supported by this
instrumentation include research on local electromagnetic field
characterization, testing tools for wireless local area data communications
standards, model-based network diagnosis, implementation and evaluation of
algorithms for ATM Quality of Service policies, and the design, implementation
and evaluation of data parallel I/O using high speed networks and heterogeneous
workstations.
