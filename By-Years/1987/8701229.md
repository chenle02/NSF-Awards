Proposal Objectives: The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative
research project between Dr. Gerald Ward and Dr. James Johnson of Colorado State
University and their Hungarian colleague, Dr. Pal Kralovanszky, of the Technical
University of Budapest is to design a model to simulate the transfer of
radionuclides through the animal food- chain to humans. Samples collected in
Hungary will be analyzed for radiocesium originating from the Chernobyl accident
to enable comparison of data from world wide fallout in the 1960's with fallout
from a nuclear reactor accident. Relevance of Proposal to Program Objectives:
This biotic systems project fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe
to combine complementary talents, pool resources, and share research data and
facilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. Access to a new
data set from such a unique event presents many scientific opportunities for
analysis using state-of-the-art methods. Merit: The proposal ranks in the
Excellent/Very Good category. Its technical merit therefore warrants NSF
support. The U.S. and Hungarian researchers are well regarded and the rationale
for international cooperation, in terms of anticipated mutual scientific
benifits, is clearly articulated. This cooperation should yield significant,
more accurate research results, specifically useful in estimating and
characterizing food-chain contamination to be expected from a nuclear reactor
accident. Interrelated Projects: None. Funding: The requested budget covers the
incremental costs to the U.S. of international cooperation associated with the
research, in accordance with program guidelines.
