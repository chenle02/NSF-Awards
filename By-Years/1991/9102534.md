The research addresses two classes of problems for reconfiguring the
interconnection architecture for a multiprocessor computer system to insure its
continued performance, possibly in a degraded mode after the failures of some
parts of the system. Two somewhat distinct aspects of this problem are studied:
1) Automatic identification of faulty units (processors) in such systems have
been extensively studied by this investigator and others, including the design
of a fully distributed algorithm for this purpose. The investigator will use
distributed gossiping in a faulty environment to design an algorithm for the
identification of faulty units. The algorithm is fully distributed and far more
efficient than existing algorithms. 2) There are multiprocessor systems which
require a particular interconnection architecture (network) for their continued
performance. The researcher intends to study further the ways in which some
redundancies in the network can be introduced so that a desired interconnection
architecture is preserved even if certain numbers of units fail.
