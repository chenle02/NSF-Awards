The Carroll University STEP Initiative (CUSI) addresses the shortage of
engineers in Waukesha County, Wisconsin. A partnership between area high
schools, universities, and industry, the project aims to increase student
interest in STEM careers, particularly engineering, with a focus on attracting
female students. CUSI strengthens existing programs involving recruitment,
retention, and transition of graduates to engineering careers. Recruitment is
enhanced by way of partnerships, career guidance and job placement. Retention is
strengthened via learning communities, mentoring, and a program that provides
hands-on learning opportunities and leadership development for pre-engineering
students. Transition involves improved connections with local industry designed
to increase graduates in the local workforce who are equipped with the necessary
skills for continued success. Evaluation of the project is largely based on
successful increase in enrollment and graduates of the engineering program, as
well as alumni activity beyond graduation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit of the project is to serve as a model for other small, private, liberal
arts institutions to partner with area high schools and local industry to expand
and strengthen STEM pathways, to encourage more students to pursue engineering
careers, and to address local workforce shortages and the Nation's need for more
STEM graduates. Broader impacts include: broadening participation of
underrepresented groups in STEM fields, enhancing collaborative infrastructure
for education, and advancing discovery while promoting teaching and
learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination activities include presenting
student projects to the broader community through annual engineering education
exhibitions, and sharing project data and information via journals/publications
and state/national conferences.
