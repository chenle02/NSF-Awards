This three-year program will merge two existing capabilities: (1) an all-sky
imager at Millstone Hill to conduct sub-auroral science and support CEDAR
campaigns at remote sites, and (2) the CEDAR Optical Tomographic Imaging
Facility (COTIF). The central component will be COTIF, used primarily at its
current four sites in Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island to investigate the
altitude-latitude-longitude emission patterns of airglow and auroral structures.
This location takes advantage of coordinated, multi-diagnostic instruments,
including ISR, FPI, LIDAR and ionosonde systems. Modeling efforts include
airglow, diffuse auroral and SAR arc simulation codes to compare with the
observed volume emission profiles from COTIF.
