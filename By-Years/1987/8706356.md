Silylene metal complexes, which are compounds in which a metal atom is attached
by two pairs of electrons to a silicon atom, were not known prior to their
recent synthesis in the Principal Investigator's laboratory. Since such
complexes are believed to be involved as intermediates in a number of important
metal-catalyzed reactions of silicon compounds, the results of this project are
expected to provide a better understanding of these catalytic reactions, and
also to lead to new reaction pathways to silicon-containing materials. For
example, one goal of the project is to use metal silylene complexes to develop
new routes to polysilanes, polymers which are expected to have useful properties
as structural or electronic materials. This research is directed toward the
synthesis and study of silylene complexes of late, or low valent transition
metals. General synthetic procedures will be developed for the synthesis of
silylene complexes of Mn, Cr, Co, Re, Mo, Rh, and Pt, and a detailed examination
of the chemical and physical properties of these substances will be undertaken.
The silylene complexes will be characterized by x-ray crystallography, Si-29 NMR
spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements of redox
potentials.
