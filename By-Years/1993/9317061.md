9317061 Stevenson There are three major components to this effort: continuation
of 3D mantle convection simulations using a viscosity that is only depth
dependent; development of a variety of techniques to relate mantle convection
modeling to seismic tomography; and development of calculations with
temperature-dependent viscosity and compositional variation to carry out 3D
(initially Cartesian) studies of the fates of slabs, the stability of plumes
from the CMB, and the development of regional (non-plume) and island arc
volcanism in a mantle convection context.
