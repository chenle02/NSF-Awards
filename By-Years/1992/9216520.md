This project plans to use Genetic Algorithms for the detection of structural
system disturbances in a dispersed manner and to coordinate their use with
adaptive controllers capable of dealing with these structural uncertainties.
These ideas are to be merged with interval mathematical methods for dealing with
the system uncertainties in a formal and rapid manner without the excessive
conservatism sometimes associated with these methods. When these ideas are
applied to power systems, the objective of the proposed work go well beyond the
scope of present system relaying practices in that permissible actions include
not only line disconnection, but adjustment of many control settings of rapid-
acting components in the system, such as the new FACTS devices being introduced
into power systems. The proposed methodologies should integrate smoothly with
centralized control and dispatch policies based on Optimum Power Flow
technology.
