This study will explore the development of foraging behavior in golden lion
tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia rosalia). These small monkeys are unusual among
primates in that they live in tight-knit family groups and all group members
assist in infant care. Young may learn information concerning what to eat and
where to search for food by sharing the foraging sites of parents and other
group members. In addition, dietary information may be obtained when food is
directly transferred from older individuals to immatures. Using behavioral
observation to be gathered at both the National Zoological Park (Washington, DC)
and in Brazil, the researchers will investigate the degree to which young
tamarins take advantage of opportunities to learn about diet and foraging from
others. The relative importance of various kin and non-kin as role models and
age-changes in food sharing will be investigated. A series of hypotheses
regarding the social benefits of food sharing will be tested. Food sharing among
tamarins is more frequent and more complex than in any other primate aside from
humans. The data gathered will allow for the comparison of these behaviors in
the two species. Additionally, as the golden lion tamarin is a severely
endangered species, the data may well assist in the conservation of the species.
