9303104 Bonnell This scanning tunneling/atomic force microscope will be used in
a variety of materials investigations. Several investigators have carried out
preliminary studies which indicate that significant progress in their research
could be made with regular access to an STM/AFM. The research topics include
relating deformation as manifest in surface roughness to mechanisms of local
plasticity at metal/ceramic interfaces, cleavage fracture in high strength
intermetallic alloys, and structure and formation of self- assembled organic
monolayers. Included are projects on surface interactions on medical implant
materials, reactivity of metal oxide surfaces for catalytic applications,
dynamic embrittlement in metals, and structural studies of biological materials.
The objective of this facility is to provide high spatial resolution imaging for
a wide range of materials in a single multicapability instrument. This
microscope will complement our other UHV surface analytical and electron
microscopy facilities.
