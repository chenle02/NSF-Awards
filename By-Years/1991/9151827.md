Atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics is an important part of the
undergraduate physics laboratory experience. AMO physics has the advantage over
many other fields of current research of being accessible to undergraduates both
theoretically and experimentally. The objective of the program here is to
establish an undergraduate laboratory in this field.To develop a strong
undergraduate laboratory program in AMO physics, several pieces of capital
equipment and ancillary hardware are used. The first major piece of equipment is
a one-meter monochrometer, a device with innumerable uses in classical
spectroscopy. It is used to introduce students to classical spectroscopic
measurements. Second, two laser systems are used, one a pulsed laser system
based on Nd:YAG pumped dye lasers, and the other a continuous wave semiconductor
diode laser for use in modern atomic and molecular spectroscopy. Students can
investigate both pulsed and cw spectroscopy to determine the fundamental
relationship between the time and frequency domains.The spectroscopy equipment
provides students with an opportunity to learn general principles of
experimentation as well as introduce them to specific atomic phenomena.
