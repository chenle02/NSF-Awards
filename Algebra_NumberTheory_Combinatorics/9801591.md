Bogomolov 9801591 The principal investigator intends to continue his work on
the geometry of algebraic varieties, the structure of Galois groups, and related
problems in birational geometry. He plans to work on constructing minimal
dominant classes of algebraic varieties, asymptotic formulas for cohomology of
line bundles, the description of fundamental groups and universal coverings of
algebraic and symplectic manifolds, and the structure of complex symplectic and
hyperkahler manifolds. He also proposes to work on the structure of Sylow
subgroups of the Galois groups and on the effective version of the stabilization
procedure for group cohomology. This is research in the field of algebraic
geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics,
but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In
its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the
simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods
not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding
application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science,
and robotics.
