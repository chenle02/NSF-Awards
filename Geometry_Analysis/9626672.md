9626672 Alber In this project methods of symplectic geometry and geometric
mechanics are to be used to analyze the phase-space geometry of nonlinear wave
systems and to investigate new techniques for soliton perturbation theory. In
particular, the investigator plans to study geometric and Maslov phases of
nonlinear wave systems and a KAM type theory for dynamical systems with phase
spaces foliated by the nonlinear compact invariant varieties. Geometric
mechanics reformulates parts of classical mechanics using the modern language of
symplectic differential geometry. It has potential applications in a variety of
applications including locomotion generation, motion control and nonlinear
optics.
