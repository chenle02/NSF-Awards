This award will continue a project to study temporal Pb isotope variation and to
establish the temporal Nd isotopic variation in the Tertiary basalts of Iceland,
the prototype for ridge-centered hot spots. It should increase understanding of
the Iceland plume, as well as the relationship between hotspots, mantle
heterogeneity and mantle dynamics in general. Three mantle components have been
recognized so far and this study will focus on establishing more precisely the
temporal variation and systematics of the three-component mixing.
