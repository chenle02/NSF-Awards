This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled, "NUE: Nanotechnology EXposure for Undergraduate Students (NUE-NEXUS)",
at Stevens Institute of Technology under the direction of Dr. Eui-Hyeok Yang,
seeks to create a nexus between nanotechnology and undergraduate engineering
education at Stevens to expand understanding of nanotechnology and its
applications to a broad undergraduate engineering student population. In this
program, two new nanotechnology courses, NANO 300: Introduction to Nanoscale
Science and Engineering and NANO 325: Introduction to Nanofabrication and
Characterization, will provide a means to educate a broad student population in
nanotechnology. The new courses are dual-purpose, educating the broader
engineering student population in nanoscience and nanotechnology while serving
as the foundation for those undergraduate students choosing to pursue the
undergraduate nanotechnology research track. Since the research track will serve
to increase the pipeline of students aiming for graduate programs, documented
success will provide a replicable paradigm for others looking to promote
undergraduate research as a foundation for future graduate studies. Integrated
within the proposed program are dissemination of nanotechnology educational
materials to benefit the engineering education community interested in
incorporating nanotechnology into engineering curricula and in bringing
appropriate, engaging nanotechnology materials and modular elements to K-12 and
community college domains. These proposed elements extend the efforts of the
existing interdisciplinary Nanotechnology Graduate Program to the undergraduate
level, and are tightly aligned with Stevens' institutional vision of creating a
world-class research and education thrust in nanotechnology.
