1510039 (Brezinsky)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies the behavior of
some basic fuels under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions (typical in
engines and power plane combustors), such as how fast/slow the fuel molecules
will be fragmenting or contracting. The results have the relevance on how soot
particulates might form under these conditions, and thus help to develop cleaner
combustion technology. Graduate students from under-represented groups will be
involved in the research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the
proposal is to measure the pressure-dependence of cyclization vs. beta scission
branching fraction of midsize alkenyl radicals. Using a shock tube, the PI seeks
to identify the shape and position of pressure-dependent uni-molecular fall-off
curves that extend to the high pressures and also the often overlooked effect of
pressure on the rate constant expressed through the activation volume. These
fuels undergo increasing amounts of ring contraction (due to molecular caging
effects) under the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions instead of
fragmentation into smaller molecules, leading to increased soot and coke
formation. In addition to ring contraction pyrolysis reactions, bimolecular
oxidation reactions will have negative activation volumes which lead to a
significant increase in the rate constant with pressure and, depending on polar
interactions with surrounding molecules such as combustion generated water. The
PI will investigate these mostly overlooked activation volume effects as well as
the extended shape and position of the uni-molecular fall-off curves.
