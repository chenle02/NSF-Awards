9522852 Gantry The use of non-metallic concrete reinforcements made of fiber-
reinforced plastic composites will enhance the long-term durability of
reinforced concrete structures subject to environmental exposure. Though plastic
composite reinforcements do not corrode, they may not be thermally compatible
with concrete. If the two materials prove to be thermally incompatible, the bond
between them may be degraded by long-term exposure to temperature fluctuations.
The transverse isotropy of composite reinforcements exacerbates considerations
of thermal incompatibility. To quantify the influence of this potential thermal
incompatibility and to verify manufacturer's claims regarding the thermal
compatibility, it is planned to experimentally determine the longitudinal and
transverse coefficient of thermal expansion of composite rebar. The potential
for bond degradation due to thermal cycling will then be explored using simple
pull-out tests of concrete/composite rebar specimens that have been thermally
cycled. Finally, the effect of bursting stresses caused by transverse expansion
of the composite reinforcement in concrete will be explored using beam specimens
with varying levels of clear cover over the composite reinforcements.
