The International Research Instrumentation System (IRIS) is a proposal to
provide a software framework to simplify the task of end-to-end network
performance monitoring and diagnostics and thereby improve support for
international science and engineering collaborations. IRIS will deliver a
comprehensive monitoring package that will benefit each IRNC awardee as well as
the entire project as a whole by delivering instant access to information that
will reveal the status and health of any participating
network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IRIS facilitates a broader deployment of perfSONAR
enabled resources significantly increasing the likelihood diagnostic resources
will be available along the end-to-end paths needed by researchers relying on
high-performance international network connections. As a result, NSF-funded
science efforts, such as those within Very Long Baseline Interferometry (eVLBI),
the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI), and the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), are more likely to be able
to exploit available network resources by improving their network
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will have significant impact on
the broad international science and engineering network user community by
providing key measurement tools with global applicability. IRIS will advance the
state of network measurement and monitoring by working with IRNC projects to
research and implement solutions to challenging network measurement problems.
This to have a broad impact among multiple scientific disciplines involving
global collaboration and exchange of large data sets.
