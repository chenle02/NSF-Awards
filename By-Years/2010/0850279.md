This project continues the successful Computer Science, Engineering, and
Mathematics Scholarship (CSEMS) program at the university. Specifically, it aims
to increase the number of students pursuing a computer science major by offering
substantial scholarship support. The program places special emphasis on
recruiting and retaining underrepresented groups such as women and Hispanics,
building on the infrastructure already in place at the
university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in
integrating the excellent academics of the institution and department with the
financial student support from NSF for outstanding, financially needy students.
It continues a professional development seminar for supported participants and
other interested computer science majors and supplements it with Team Work in
Several Time Zones (TWISTZ) to address the direction of computing in the global
marketplace.The seminar builds upon the previous program's state-of-the-art
techniques and peer effects for encouraging project scholars to develop good
study habits, to learn how to survey the ongoing advancement of computer
science, and to develop critical thinking. In addition to career counseling,
scholars receive encouragement to participate in funded undergraduate research
projects whose teams are spread across time zones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impact centers on the outreach to underrepresented student populations
and the cross-cultural aspect of TWISTZ. The program is developing a culture
that can attract, nurture and support underrepresented students through its
connection with the Multicultural Affairs Office at the institution.
