Abstract: This award supports preliminary research in the area of algebraic
geometric codes. In earlier work, the principal investigator combined the study
of algebraic geometric codes with another active and fertile area within coding
theory by introducing algebraic geometric codes over rings. She proved several
foundational results on these new codes, thus laying the groundwork for
applications. These applications will now be pursued. In particular, the PI will
begin by deriving a good bound on the minimum Euclidean and Lee weights of these
codes, which should lead to the construction of new nonlinear binary codes with
good parameters. She will also investigate the feasibility of defining algebraic
geometric codes coming from abelian schemes over rings. In addition, the PI will
begin research in a different area within coding theory, that of decoding
algorithms for algebraic geometric codes coming from curves over finite fields.
