This proposal studies salt induce protein precipitation; specifically the
impact of micromixing and contacting geometry on protein solubility, and the
relation between contacting conditions and precipitate morphology. The work will
be used to connect microscopic and macroscopic description of protein
aggregation and precipitation in an effort to move protein precipitation to an
engineering basis.
