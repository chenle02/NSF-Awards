This grant, funded jointly by Special Projects in Chemistry and the Division of
Materials Research provides support for the research of Profs. Schwartz and
Bernasek at Princeton University. The objective of the interdisciplinary
research is to synthesize and characterize controlled interfaces between metal
oxides and organometallic complex-derived overlayers. Synthetic interfaces of
this type are germane to catalysis, electrode surfaces and packaging
applications. The interfacial layer which this research will create is
conceptually different from that which exists in common interfaces in that
rather than relying on physical adhesion, these interfaces would involve
covalent interactions between components in the composite. The feasibility of
the synthetic approach which is based on organometallic chemistry, has already
been performed either on bulk oxide substrates under normal conditions or in
ultrahigh vacuum using single-crystal supports. The use of single-crystal
supports enables an investigation of the nature and extent of covalent
interactions between an overlayer and the surface of a support. Development of
analogous methodology for bulk oxides will enable the preparation of materials
which can be studied with regard to their bulk physical and chemical properties.
