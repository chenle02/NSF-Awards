9623718 Baker By using diblock copolymers that can be selectively tailored to
produce different packing densities on a surface, a wide regime of geometries
can be prepared in good and poor solvents. The molecular details of these more
realistic and useful sheared systems will be examined, paying particular
attention to equilibrium geometries before and after subjecting them to shear
stresses. %%% The teaching methods proposed are for an upper-level surface
spectroscopy class to combine a more traditional lecture course with hypermedia
techniques and interactive teaching styles with laboratory experiences. ***
