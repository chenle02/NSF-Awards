The Institute for Genomic Research has been granted funding for the Sixth and
Seventh Conferences on Computational Genomics (CG2003 in Boston and CG2004 in
the Baltimore/Washington Area). The goal of these conferences is to bring
together leading scientists from around the world to discuss the latest advances
in computational methods for analysis of genome sequences. The meetings address
these topics from the perspective of biological scientists attempting to make
sense of the vast quantities of genome sequence and expression data now becoming
available. The intent of the meetings is to provide a forum for a combination of
invited speakers, speakers selected from submitted abstracts, and poster
presenters to discuss their work and exchange ideas. The topics include some of
the most pressing issues facing genomics, bioinformatics, and the life sciences
more broadly. The funding will provide student fellowships, in order to increase
the amount of student participation the meetings. Increased attendance by
students is tremendously valuable for the development of younger scientists and
for the future of the field of bioinformatics.
