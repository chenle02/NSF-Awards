This award supports the research of Professor J. Stembridge to work in
combinatorics. He intends to investigate the theory of immanants, study
symmetric functions, the representations of Lie superalgebras and projective
representation of Weyl groups. He also hopes to find a faster algorithm for
computing plethysms relevant to classical invariant theory. The research is in
the general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient
methods to study how discrete collections of objects can be organized. And so,
it is extremely important to modern communications, for example the design of
large networks as in telephone systems and the design of algorithms in computer
science.
