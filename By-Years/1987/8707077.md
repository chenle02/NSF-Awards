The primary object of this research is the investigation of an innovative
technique for estimating a class of statistical models widely used in economics
and other social sciences. The general model with which the line of work is
concerned is one where the dependent variable is not continuous. Such models
include those in which data censoring or aggregation results in the dependent
variable being a discrete grouping or ordering of an underlying but unobserved
continuous variable. Another such model is the so-called discrete choice model,
which is used to analyze many economic decisions, such as housing tenure choice,
mode of transportation, and the purchase of consumer durables. In these models
the observed data usually consists simply of an observation as to whether a
particular choice was made or not. All these types of models are fundamentally
based on the idea that an underlying continuous variable, often called a latent
variable, is really the crucial factor in the person's making a particular
decision, but that variable is not itself observed. What is observed is an index
or indicator which merely shows the choice made by the economic agent. In doing
such analysis one must make assumptions about the underlying variable, and in
particular about its distributional form, and past work has shown research
results to be quite dependent on the distributional assumptions. Professor
Powell is a leader in a line of econometric research which develops estimation
techniques robust to distributional assumptions. Technically, Professor Powell
in this project derives semiparametric estimators for analyzing latent variable
models. The procedure consists of two steps. First, an index is derived based on
a group of variables exogenous to the model. Then for each observation in the
data the conditional distribution of the latent variable is centered on this
index. The second step uses the newly created data set of indices to estimate
the parameters in which the researcher is interested.
