The value of symmetry in mathematics is universally recognized as one of the
great concepts used in the analysis of complex problems. In nature as well as in
abstraction, the most symmetric choice for a solution often turns out to be the
correct one or the most favorable among all candidates. Work to be done on this
project continues an extended program in the development of a unified theory of
symmmetrization deriving from a certain master inequality formulated and proved
in 1974 (with antecedents going back to the fifth book of Pappus, at least) .
Particular emphases will be placed on extremal problems from complex function
theory, partial differential equations and quasiconformal mapping. Examples
include finding the best constant in Landau's covering theorem giving the best
inequality between the diameter of the image of a holomorphic function and its
derivative at some point. In partial differential equations, work will be done
in determining the shape of those domains of fixed diameter which minimize the
heat kernel. The distortion of quasiconformal maps in any given direction is
well documented. Very little is known on the limitations of how these maps can
distort area. Work will focus on this question. It is axiomatic in mathematics
that by asking the right questions, one is often led to the answer of a
difficult question with comparative ease. Often right questions involve new
insights into symmetry. The purpose of this research is to continue expanding
the scope of general symmetry principles which have the potential for broad
applicability.
