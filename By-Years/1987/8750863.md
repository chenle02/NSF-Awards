The Department of Geography and Planning at Appalachian State University has
begun the implementation of a plan for improved instruction in the area of
computer assisted cartography. The equipment requested for this project in
needed for the next phase in the evolution of its instructional capabilities in
computer mapping technology. Students will work on projects in which they will
generate digit files of geographic entities of varying size and scale; produce
high quality choropleth and overlay maps of large data bases using commercially
available map bases; generate maps at different scales; combine maps of
different scales on a single page; change perspectives of computer generated
maps; and use geographic information system analysis techniques. Students will
also receive experience with a large format digitizing tablet and multi-
pen/multi-color plotter which is standard in public and private agencies which
employ geographers, planners, draftsmen, designers and other scientists who work
with spatial information. This project is responsive both to trends in the
discipline and advances in the available technology.
