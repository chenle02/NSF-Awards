AST-0307824&lt;br/&gt;Wolfe&lt;br/&gt;The primary result from this research will
be to determine the star formation history of normal galaxies from the present
to redshifts around five. This has previously been done using the most luminous
galaxies, but a new technique derives star formation rates (SFRs) for objects
more representative of the protogalactic mass distribution, by observing damped
Lyman alpha systems (DLAs), a population of gaseous neutral hydrogen layers
detected in absorption toward background quasars. This method will be used to
consider a large number of issues, including how the SFR varies with redshift,
how it compares to that derived from luminous galaxies, how the SFR depends on
mass, neutral hydrogen column density, velocity width and metallicity, how it
compares to theoretical predictions, whether star formation is confined to the
central bulge or occurs throughout the absorbing gas, and whether DLAs are
spatially correlated with luminous galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All results
will end up in a generally accessible database, already in use by other
researchers. The projects involve students at various levels, as well as junior
researchers, including some from under-represented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
