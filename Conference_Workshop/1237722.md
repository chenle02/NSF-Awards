The investigator and his colleagues organize the "Mathematical Finance and
Partial Differential Equations Conference" November 2, 2012, at Rutgers
University. Methods of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations to
solve fundamental problems in mathematical finance provide the common theme that
underlies presentations by the invited and contributing conference speakers.
Almgren and Guo address applications of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and
stochastic control to efficient management of order books and trading. Research
of Levendorskii and Nistor concerns advanced methods for numerical solution of
partial differential equations arising in American-style option pricing
problems. Hobson considers robust methods for pricing complex options. Keller-
Ressel describes affine stochastic volatility models and their generalizations
while Pop explores extensions of Gyongy's theorem to the case of degenerate Ito
processes with unbounded coefficients. Mazzeo considers degenerate diffusion
processes and associated partial differential equations in mathematical biology.
Protter discusses applications of probability theory to bubbles in finance.
Zitkovic describes his work on portfolio theory and incomplete markets.

The purpose of this conference is to develop academic and industry research
collaborations based on the themes discussed by the speakers. Conference
participants come from both the academic mathematical research community and the
financial engineering industry. Interactions among the participants encourage
cross-fertilization of ideas and transfer of knowledge and lead to
identification of future research problems for academic researchers and of
possible methods to solve them. The participation of representatives from the
financial engineering industry ensures that practical problems in derivative
security pricing, risk management, and trading are introduced to academic
researchers with relevant expertise in applied mathematics. The industry
applications include improved methods to control model risk, better understand
the origins of financial bubbles, and improve asset and portfolio management for
individuals and pension funds. The participation of academic researchers ensures
that the latest academic research and methods are described to practitioners in
financial engineering. Presentations by researchers from both academia and
industry foster mathematical finance and partial differential equations as a
research discipline for Ph.D. students in pure and applied mathematics.
