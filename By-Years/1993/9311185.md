Menon This research is on the development and implementation of optimization
techniques for multilevel combinational logic circuits specified at the gate
level. Logical implementation techniques which have been proven effective in
test pattern generation are being used for this purpose. These techniques are
being applied to three problems in logic optimization: area reduction, delay
reduction, and testability enhancement. Relationships between signal values are
being used to identify common subfunctions without generating expressions for
them and putting them in any standard form. This approach is efficient and could
substitute for Boolean factorization in logic optimization. Techniques for delay
reduction involve replacing segments of long paths with shorter ones so that
false paths are not created and undetectable faults are identified during delay
reduction. The effectiveness of these techniques as supplements to an existing
synthesis system are being investigated.
