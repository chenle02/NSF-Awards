Dr. Smith plans to study the homology between the insulin and glucagon produced
by the pancreas and the insulin and glucagon produced by salivary glands using
the rat as an animal model. These hormones are important in the regulation of
metabolism and food stuff utilization. A deficiency of pancreactic insulin
production results in diabetes. Smith has evidence that the peptides produced by
the two glands are identical in terms of peptides structure and the genes that
regulate production. However, the pancreatic peptides are secreted into the
blood and act as hormones, whereas the salivary gland peptides are secreted into
the gastrointestinal tract and have no known function. Smith hopes to be able to
determine mechanisms regulating production, processing and secretion of the
salivary gland peptides as compared to the pancreatic peptides in rats of
varying ages or stages of development and under various hormonal conditions
including the diabetic state. Apparently, the salivary gland peptides are
produced in the diabetic state indicating some differences in the regulation of
gene expression between the two glands that might lead to a better understanding
of the hormonal and genetic regulation of insulin and glucagon production and to
possible mechanisms for gene or cell transfer to relieve the diabetic state.
