Abstract - CTS 9732803 Taewoo Lee A Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer
(FTIR) is acquired for use in combustion research. Studies include turbulent,
partially premixed flames, pulverized coal flames, gas turbine spray combustion
and heat transfer, porous radiant burners, and droplet-based manufacturing
processes. Both line-of-sight and tomographic reconstruction measurements are
performed.
