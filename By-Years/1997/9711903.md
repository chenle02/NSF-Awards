9711903 Kalia and Vashishta These senior PI's are well known as leaders in
multi- particle (involving more than million particles) simulations of critical
material properties. They are also pioneers in educational innovation by
introducing and successfully managing a dual degree program with a Ph.D. in
Physics and an MS in Computer Science. This grant, to a university in an EPSCOR
state, is a renewal of their research program. Specifically, it contains three
foci: (1) Residual stresses, nucleation and growth of cracks and delamination at
Al/AlO3 and Al/SiC interfaces; (2) The structure-mechanical properties
relationship and dynamics of consolidation and fracture in nanophase ceramic
composites and (3) Stresses and strains a as function of density, stoichiometry
and thickness of ceramic coatings on metals and semiconductors. %%% The two
senior collaborators form an EPSCOR state have clearly emerged as leaders in the
new field of massively parallel, multi-particle atomistic simulation of critical
material properties. Supported by state of the art computing resources, they are
studying the details of growth and mechanical properties of ceramics and ceramic
coatings on metals and semiconductors. They are also studying the characteristic
growth of a crack-tip front in fracture of materials. ***
