The investigator works in algebraic geometry, although his interests connect to
other areas of mathematics, including topology, combinatorics, physics (string
theory), number theory, and symplectic and differential geometry. This proposal,
continuing various strands of the investigator's work, deals with moduli spaces
and related notions in a variety of settings. In particular, the proposal deals
with a number of fundamental questions regarding the moduli space of curves,
Geometric Invariant Theory, topology of moduli spaces, and speculative ideas
coming out of theoretical physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry
provides a powerful theory with which to define moduli spaces of interesting
objects. Once they are defined, natural compelling questions are: what do they
look like? Are they irreducible? Connected? Of what dimension? Are they smooth?
If not, what singularities arise? What structure is exhibited by their
cohomology rings, and why should it be geometrically expected? What are their
equations? The investigator intends to address many of these fundamental
problems in a number of cases. The investigator has a track record of sustained
and serious effort both in outreach to students at all levels (high school,
undergraduate, and graduate), and in building institutions in which algebraic
geometry can grow.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will continue to attract graduate
students into algebraic geometry, both at Stanford and elsewhere, and to
continue to nurture the careers of graduate students, post-docs, and young
researchers. The investigator will continue to work with large numbers of
students at the secondary and undergraduate levels, attracting students into the
mathematical sciences.
