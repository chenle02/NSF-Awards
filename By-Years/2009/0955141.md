0955141&lt;br/&gt;Campbell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GHG implications
of using abandoned agricultural lands to grow bioenergy crops in both the U.S.
and Brazil will be studied. This will be achieved by 1) quantifying the
availability of abandoned agricultural lands through geospatial analysis of
existing land use data, 2) determining the potential biomass yields on these
lands through spatial interpolation of field trial, crop census and remote
sensing data, and 3) calculating the net GHG emissions from the life cycles of
these bioenergy resources. This research has the potential to significantly
advance knowledge and understanding of the climate change benefits that would
come from using abandoned rather then currently used agricultural land for
bioenergy crop production. Methodological advancements will result from coupling
geospatial data collection, models and analysis with life cycle GHG assessments.
