Problems in the design of low-cost networks are central to our understanding of
algorithms. Computing a minimum-cost spanning tree is one of the first graph
algorithms to be taught in any standard algorithms course; indeed, the minimum-
cost spanning tree algorithm of Boruvka is one of the earliest graph algorithms
known. In the last decade or so, similar advances in our understanding of
approximation algorithms have occurred through research into generalizations of
the minimum-cost spanning tree problem and the Steiner tree problem. This
research will consider more recent issues in the low-cost design of networks,
and to discover similar, general algorithmic techniques to address
them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One central issue now under consideration is that of
the role of uncertainty in the specification of the design of the network. One
of the ways this is done is by considering a probability distribution over the
potential connectivity requirements, leading to stochastic optimization
problems; another is that of giving a universal solution, from which a good
solution can be derived no matter what requirements are realized. Most prior
work in the area assumed that network connections would be purchased, but recent
work in infrastructure leasing considers issues in which connectivity
requirements are satisfied for shorter periods of time by leasing connectivity
from another party instead of building a network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally,
recent work has considered the general problem of dropping connectivity
requirements in the case that they become too expensive to fulfill. This has
been explored in simple cases in the past of the prize-collecting Steiner tree
problem, but more general models have only recently started to be considered.
The intellectual merit of the research lies in finding significant
methodological innovations in the course of addressing these issues, and finding
simpler, better, more general, and more practical approximation algorithms as a
result of this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Network design problems are
increasingly important in a society where reliable communication is essential.
In many situations, there is uncertainty about the inputs on which you must
compute, since, for example, it is hard to detect failed links and exact network
speeds are volatile. If successful, this research will lead to algorithms that
can deal with the uncertainty inherent in real-world networks.&lt;br/&gt;
