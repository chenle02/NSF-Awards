The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve outcomes for patients with heart
problems. This project will develop an AI solution for the automatic
interpretation of electrocardiograms (ECG) to detect and predict irregular
heartbeats. This will benefit patients with cardiac arrhythmias and will reduce
spending on cardiovascular disease. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research Phase (SBIR) I project aims to refine existing deep
learning-based detection algorithms, develop methods for the prediction of the
onset of cardiac arrhythmias, develop interpretable and explainable tools for
clinicians, and develop a web-based software tool for users to develop insights
from ECG signals. This project leverages artificial intelligence technologies,
including deep learning and natural language processing, as well as signal
processing techniques for a trustworthy and automated ECG analysis tool for
prediction and detection The techniques represent multimodal approaches derived
from various data sources, including the ECG signals and electronic health
record (EHR) documentation of clinician ECG
interpretations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
