This NSF award from the Undergraduate Mentoring in Environmental Biology (UMEB)
program will support a unique partnership between Hampton University (HU) and
the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) of the College of William and
Mary. This partnership will take form in the DREAMS (Diversity in Research in
Environmental And Marine Sciences) program. Hampton University is one of the top
ranked minority serving institutions in the nation. It has a history of
producing successful graduates in the sciences, including a growing number in
environmental biology through its Department of Marine and Environmental
Science. VIMS is a major research entity that has a strong reputation for
educating graduate students in coastal and environmental biology. The goals of
this program are: to enhance the performance of HU undergraduate students
studying environmental science, to increase enrollment and retention in HU
environmental science programs, to increase the diversity of students in the
VIMS graduate program, and to increase the diversity in the environmental
workforce in general.&lt;br/&gt; DREAMS is a comprehensive program that stresses
early involvement in research and strong mentoring as a way to enhance
undergraduate performance and the likelihood for success in subsequent graduate
training. This is of critical importance, since production of minority graduate
students in the environmental sciences is well below that which would be
predicted from the pool of students earning undergraduate degrees. The DREAMS
program will leverage the UMEB commitment by taking advantage of three other
ongoing efforts at Hampton (two sponsored by NOAA, and one by NSF), as well as a
new NSF sponsored joint effort between Hampton, VIMS, and Old Dominion
University to produce minority PhD's in the ocean sciences. &lt;br/&gt;
