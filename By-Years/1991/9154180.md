The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) is conducting a three-year program
for improving undergraduate science education that will create a number of
regionally- based science education teams across the country. Undergraduate
faculty from both two- and four-year colleges will participate in a summer
enrichment experience in the institutions and laboratories of ASM research
scientists, and interact with eminent scientists through participation in the
Society's General Meeting activities and throughout the academic year.
