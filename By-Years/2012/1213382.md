Filipp Furche of the University of California, Irvine is supported by an award
from the Chemical Theory Models and Computational Methods program in the
Chemistry Division to carry out research on electron correlation beyond the
random phase approximation (RPA). The central hypothesis of this project is that
RPA offers a better starting point for accurate and efficient electron
correlation treatments than existing methods based on semi-local density
functional or Hartree-Fock theory. The newly developed methods will be applied
to problems that are difficult or impossible to treat with currently available
electronic structure methods, including bond activation by transition-metal
clusters, lanthanide and actinide complexes with small gaps, and multipole-bound
anions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electronic structure calculations are
indispensable tools for research and development in chemistry, materials and
energy science, engineering, and biology. The methods developed in this project
will be made available in a timely fashion through the Turbomole quantum
chemistry software, which has a growing and diverse user community in both
academia and industry. The PI is also involved in educational and outreach
activities to bring computational chemistry to a broader group of scientists,
including students at undergraduate institutions with large minority
populations.
