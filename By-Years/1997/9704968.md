ABSTRACT Costin Costin will work on constructing a theory of analyzable
functions. Obtained by taking a closure of analytic functions with respect to
function operations (algebraic operations, including division, composition,
differentiation, integration, etc.) they preserve many analytic function
properties, including unique representation by expansions (formalizability) and
permanence of relations. In addition to the intrinsic interest in exploring the
limits of formalizability, there is a major practical interest in reconstructing
actual solutions from formal expansions for a wide class of equations. A
complete theory of analyzable functions is likely to have an impact in many
branches of pure and applied analysis. Costin has carried out this construction
rigorously for functions arising as solutions to linear or nonlinear
differential systems near generic singularities. Costin will use new techniques
in the classification of nonlinear differential systems near irregular
singularities, up to analytic equivalence, in providing sharp information on the
nature and location of singularities of nonlinear systems, in the study of
solvability in closed form of equations, in solving connection problems and in
justifying and improving hyper-asymptotic numerical methods. The technique will
also be extended to cover PDE's and difference equations. Asymptotic analysis is
an important method of investigation in complex systems. In many important cases
however, the quantities of interest are influenced by parameters too small to be
controlled by classical asymptotics. The field of exponential asymptotics has
been introduced as a successful theoretical and computational framework to deal
with these situations and applied in problems ranging from number theory to
optics and quantum mechanics. The present project is aimed at a rigorous
foundation of the field, at applying its techniques to the study of differential
or difference systems, as well as at extending and improving the computational
methods of this new theory.
