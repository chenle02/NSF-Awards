This award supports travel for US participants in the workshop "Mathematical
Trends in Medical Imaging", which will be held at the University of Chicago,
Chicago, IL, USA from June 23-26, 2020. The workshop will bring together junior
and established researchers from different US institutions working on both
theoretical and practical aspects of inverse problems and imaging to discuss
recent trends and new challenges in the field, mainly focusing on its
applications in medical imaging. Topics include, but are not limited to,
mathematical modelling, analytic and geometric methods, computational
approaches, and numerical algorithms.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This four-day
workshop will feature 24 forty-minute plenary talks that will address the latest
progress in research at the interface of mathematics and medical imaging, and
will discuss open problems that will drive the development in these areas in the
coming years. The discussion sessions between the talks will foster
communication and future collaboration among participants coming from
mathematics, computer science, as well as radiology departments. A contributed
poster session will also provide a platform for junior researchers to share
their research. This award gives graduate students and early career researchers,
including members of underrepresented groups and those without other funding
sources, an opportunity to attend and participate in this workshop. Over 45
participants are anticipated with approximately 20 junior researchers. The
organizing committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to
target groups through a number of different activities. More information will be
made available at the conference webpage:
