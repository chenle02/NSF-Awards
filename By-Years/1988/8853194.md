This department is committed to bringing quantitative depth and rigor to
students' visual data by installing three complementary systems: (1) a
computerized image analyzer; (2) a color video camera and recorder; and (3)
Nomarski optics to upgrade an existing phase- contrast microscope. This
equipment, along with a fluorescence photomicroscope obtained through a NSF
grant in 1985, enables the immediate introduction of image analysis into these
laboratory courses: Cell Biology, Immunology, Genetics, Plant Biology,
Biological Systems, Contemporary Biology for non-majors, and Senior Research.
Computerized image analysis enables students to accurately and rapidly measure
the size, shape and density of microscopic and some macroscopic objects, to
statistically analyze these data, and to incorporate images and statistics into
a single computer-generated lab report. The project enables both upper- and
lower-level biology students to transform initial qualitative perceptions of
visual data into statistically-supported conclusions. The grantee institution is
matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
