*** 9629778 Olsen This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will
design, optimize, and deliver a high-performance avalanche photodiode (APD) for
use in the 1.0-2.2 um spectral region as a high performance telecommunications
and LIDAR receiver. Strained epitaxial layers will be combined with multi-
quantum-well (MQW) InGaAsP/InP layers. The strained layer distorts the valence
band of the multiplying (gain) region to reduce the field at which ionization
occurs. This reduces device operating voltage and also decreases the ratio of
hole/electron ionization coefficients (compared to the unstrained case), and
thus decreases noise. In Phase I devices were fabricated and tested with tensile
and compressive strain. Feasibility of concept was conclusively demonstrated
with measured avalanche gains &gt; 100 and hole/electron gain ratios of 0.2-0.4.
Phase II will fabricate and optimize a reliable planar structure for light
response out to 1.65 um which realizes the advantages of low voltage (10-20v),
low noise operation, high gain (&gt;50) and high yield. These concepts will then
be applied to the InAsP/InGaAs materials system, along with the use of ternary
InAsP substrates, to achieve low-noise avalanche gain at 2.2um. The project will
result in a high performance, low cost, infrared detector for fiber optic
communications, eye-safe range-finding and spectroscopy. This device would also
be viable for wavelengths beyond 2 um which would open up other commercial
possibilities such as gas sensing and windshear detection. APDs are not yet
widely used in commercial long-wavelength fiber optic communication systems
because of their high-noise properties. Successful completion of a Phase II
program would enable commercialization of a low-noise device which would open up
a market, presently estimated at over $50 million per year. ***
