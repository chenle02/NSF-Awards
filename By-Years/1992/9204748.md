This research is to use long-period surface waves recorded at the TERRAscope
(the very-broadband seismic network recently installed in southern California by
the California Institute of Technology) to determine phase velocities in
southern California. A well established method will be applied to these modern
high-quality data. The period range of the previous measurements was limited to
27 seconds because of the limited quality of data. The new data set will extend
the period range to 150 seconds. The increased period is critically important
for exploring deep structures, that is, to a depth of 200 km. A better knowledge
of these deep structures in the upper mantle will help understand the dynamics
that controls the seismic activity and tectonic deformation presently taking
place in southern California. This research is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
