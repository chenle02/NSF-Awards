Ice formation in concrete is the cause of millions of dollars in damage to
concrete structures in cold regions every. This proposal takes advantage of new
sophisticated characterization techniques to develop a holistic program. At a
microscopic level, neutron diffraction will be used to determine the content of
freezable water in the cementitious matrix, and to determine the in-situ stress
and strain field in the matrix as it freezes. At a meso level, high resolution
low-temperature scanning electron microscopy will be employed to study the air-
void morphology as affected by the type of chemical admixtures and to
characterize the nucleation sites of ice crystallization. . At the macro level,
large concrete samples will be used to validate the observations learned at the
micro and meso level.
