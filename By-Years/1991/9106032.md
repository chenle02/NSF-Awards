This award describes the proposed involvement of the investigator in a
collaboration with nine universities and Fermilab in an experiment to measure
and analyze the scattering of photons from quarks. The result will be a
measurement of the distribution of momenta of quarks and gluons residing in
nuclei and a study of their transition to observable particles. The investigator
and his undergraduate and Master's thesis students plan to continue an already
ongoing role in the running of the experiment during the present year, and also
in the analysis of the data during the ensuing two years.
