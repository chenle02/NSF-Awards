Fisher, George 95-28474 Dr. Fisher will study how magnetic flux emerges from the
solar interior, where it is generated, to the surface, where it is observed.
Theoretical models of flux emergence based on the flux tube paradigm have been
tremendously successful in explaining many properties of active region magnetic
fields. These models will be improved in three ways -- first, to improve the
treatment of the velocity field on rising flux to include turbulent and
meridional flows; second, to include twists in emerging fields to account for
certain strange active regions and flaring; third, to include fragmentation of
rising flux and more carefully treat submerging flux. ***
