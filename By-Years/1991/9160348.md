Solar cells have unique advantages as an alternative source of electric power.
This program will demonstrate high specific power, lightweight, flexible, thin
silicon solar cells. These solar cells can be directly substituted for existing
state of the art silicon solar cells with the effect of significantly improving
specific power, power/area, and power supply life. The proposal describes a
lightweight, flexible, high-performance, ultra-thin silicon solar cell that
incorporates light-trapping and a graphite cloth substrate as an integral part
of the device. This new type of silicon solar cell will be developed for polar
operations. The silicon layers will be deposited by electro-deposition. These
thin films will demonstrate the lightweight and flexibility of other thin film
solar cell designs while maintaining the high performance of crystalline
silicon.
