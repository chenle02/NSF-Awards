9316022 Loeblich This work contributes to documentation of biodiversity and
ecology of one of the major faunal groups in Earth's oceans. PI and A.R.
Loeblich, Jr. have completed a monograph on the exceptionally diverse
foraminiferal fauna of the Timor Sea northwest of Australia; this research was
supported by several NSF awards in the 1980s, and is part of a series of
historically NSF-funded studies on the Timor Sea and Sahul Shelf. The monograph
describes and illustrates 940 foraminiferal species, included 97 new ones, and
almost 900 of which have not previously been illustrated. The fauna represent
water depths of 20 m to nearly 3500 m, and thus this work will also be a primary
reference for future benthic foraminiferal studies.
