Two radio spectrometers with frequency coverage from 10 to 800 MHz will be
constructed and deployed at the National Radio Quite Zone in Green Bank, WV.
This effort, (i) develops a basic research tool in solar radio astrophysics for
use by the wider community, (ii) remedies the lack of an important component of
the United States National Space Weather Program: the need for readily available
low-frequency, broadband, radio dynamic spectra in western longitudes, and (iii)
provides a platform for research and development work on broadband antennas,
feeds, and receivers operating from decimeter to decameter wavelengths. This
program has important applications for instrument upgrades as well as future
generations of instruments such as the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) and the
Frequency Agile Solar Radiotelescope (FASR).
