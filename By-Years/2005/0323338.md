Support from this grant will provide for the acquisition of a ground penetrating
radar (GPR) system for geoscience research and teaching at Coastal Carolina
University. This project is collaborative with another such request from the
University of South Carolina (USC; EAR-0232393). Together, the funds will
provide for two different but complementary GPR systems for local and regional
geoscience research and education projects that require high resolution imaging
of the near subsurface. The equipment will provide for hands educational
experiences for undergraduates at CCU and both undergraduate and graduates
students at USC and the two-unit pool will be available for sharing by either
institutional faculty members when not otherwise subscribed. The instruments
will support a range of basic research by early career faculty at these two
institutions including studies in barrier beach evolution and dynamics,
geoarchaeology and paleontology, paleoseismology and environmental geology. ***
