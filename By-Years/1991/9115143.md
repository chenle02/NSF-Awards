Dr. Craig Wheeler will use this award to explore thermal instabilities in
accretion disks in a variety of contexts in order to gain a deeper understanding
of transient phenomena in binary stars and related systems. An attempt will be
made to incorporate models of non-local angular momentum transport to supplant
current models for viscosity. The sensitivity of unstable disks to key
parameters, such as transfer rate, inner and outer disk radii, central mass, and
viscosity, will be explored. Models of the magnetically truncated disk of the
intermediate polar binary system GK Per will be refined to make quantitative
predictions of the X- ray, ultraviolet, and optical behavior of the next
outburst expected about mid 1992. Models incorporating time dependent coronae
and the attendant effects of disk irradiation from the inner disk, the compact
object, and the corona will be used to explore the behavior of soft X-ray
transients like Agl X-1 and Cen X-4 which contain neutron stars and a number of
transient black hole candidates.
