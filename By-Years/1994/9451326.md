9451326 McCutcheon The mathematics department at Los Angeles Pierce College has
been actively engaged in a project to bring computers into their calculus
classrooms. They are one of the six consortium members of the Interactive
Mathematics Text Project jointly sponsored by IBM and NSF. Until this project
they have used computers to supplement instruction in an open laboratory that is
being used to capacity for homework assignments. In this project Pierce is using
computer lessons they have developed and are developing as an integral part of
classroom instruction to replace, in part, instructor lectures with student
discovery. In addition, they are using computers to train high school and
college teachers in the use and development of interactive computer lessons.
