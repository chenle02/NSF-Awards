The possible connection between mesoscale tropospheric storms and ionospheric
spread-F events is investigated using fifty years of ionosonde data, and using
extensive incoherent scatter radar and microbarograph data. The project aims to
determine by correlative testing whether there is a statistically significant
association between periods of Spread-F observation and concurrent, identifiable
mesoscale disturbances in the tropical troposphere. The electric field strength
and direction as well as ion drift velocities will be determined for associated
events when possible, and an attempt will be made to ascertain the relationship
between the location and time of storms and the associated onset of the F-region
ionospheric regularities. This study attempts to conclusively identify or
exclude gravity waves generated by storms as a likely source of the density
fluctuations, or Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, thought to be the precursor to
F-region instabilities that generate GPS scintillation events.
