The overall goal is to develop quantitative descriptions of bacterial metabolism
to help elucidate the genotype-phenotype relation. The focus is on augmenting
network analysis and phenotype prediction by accounting for genetic-level
capabilities and control mechanisms. The tasks are to perform a sensitivity
analysis of a simplified E. coli network model contained using Lagrange
multipliers from nonlinear programming and to collect data on constraints for a
large scale dynamic FBA simulation from the literature and existing online
databases. The union of biochemical engineering and system analysis
investigators will provide significant cross-training to the student
involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
