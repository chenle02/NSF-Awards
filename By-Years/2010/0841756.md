This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Division of labor occurs at all levels
of biological organization: for example, cells in a multi-cellular organism just
as workers in a social insect colony may specialize on particular tasks. Such
specialization can lead to morphological differentiation, and thus to
evolutionary innovation. What environmental or social conditions favor such
specialization of components, and what system-level organization is needed to
reap the benefits of such specialization? The objective of this project is to
develop a new, quantitative understanding of the contribution of morphologically
distinct specialists to group success. Turtle ants (Cephalotes rohweri) will be
used as model system. These ants produce two types of workers, one of which is a
highly specialized defense soldier with a plate-shaped head, used to block nest
entrances. Because of their costs and inflexibility, the production of
specialists is limited. Defense of the colony may thus crucially depend on
effective allocation of specialists to the right place at the right time. The
project will investigate how this dynamic allocation takes place, and thus how
the ant society trades-off risk and resources; it will investigate the
contribution of specialists to colony fitness; and a model will be developed to
determine the optimal strategy for distributing specialists in a variable work
environment. The project will thus offer new insights on important questions
about the evolution of specialization. In addition, because it focuses on
defense specialists, it will have implications for optimal allocation of defense
resources in any system. The results of this project will serve not only to
increase understanding of the evolution of specialization, but also help
engineers design improved distributed problem solving algorithms, for example in
collective robotics.
