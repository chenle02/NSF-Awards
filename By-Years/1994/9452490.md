for undergraduate instruction in political science. Instructional software
introduces undergraduate students to significant concepts in political science.
This software and program also combines data on members of Congress with stored
digital audio and video of these members speaking on the House and Senate floor.
Undergraduates have an opportunity to learn political science in a laboratory
that provides access to current video, electronic text, and statistical data,
and is integrated with course instruction, exercises, and student participation.
In addition, the laboratory serves as a national training facility for faculty
and teachers.
