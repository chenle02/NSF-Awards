Nanoparticle Metrics for Computation Materials Mechanics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&l
t;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This GOALI program has the
scientific goal of directly evaluating measured and computational submicron
length scales. Additionally, it has the engineering goal of applying this to
improved materials processes for protecting and manufacturing magnetic recording
systems.&lt;br/&gt; Scientifically, we are measuring the mechanical response of
defect-free nanospheres in the 20 to 200 nm range utilizing nanoindentation,
atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Direct evaluation
of the identical number of atoms with the identical boundary conditions are
being evaluated using modified embedded atom interatomic potentials at the
smallest scales coupled with discretized dislocation dynamics at the larger
scale. Parameters to evaluate length scales associated with gradient plasticity,
volume to surface ratios, and excess surface stress included dislocation
imaging, strain hardening measures, and surface modification. Regarding the
engineering goals, improved materials processes for planarization of thin films
utilizing nanospheres surface-modified by atomic layer deposition (ALD) will be
sought. This same ALD process, as currently being investigated for nanometer
level protection of heads for magnetic recording will be applied to head media
with algorithms for improved performance against localized friction and wear as
a goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal
