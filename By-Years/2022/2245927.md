The Graduate Student Combinatorics Conference (GSCC) will be held March 17-19,
2023 at Washington University in St Louis. This will be the 16th annual meeting
of the GSCC, which is traditionally organized by graduate students. The GSCC
focuses on graduate student research presentations and will include keynote
addresses by David Galvin (University of Notre Dame), Megumi Harada (McMaster
University), and Pamela E. Harris (University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee). The
GSCC provides a unique and invaluable opportunity for graduate students in
combinatorics to experience the benefits of taking part in a research
conference. Giving their own presentations allows graduate students to develop
their formal presentation skills, helping them succeed as junior
researchers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics is a vibrant area for new and
innovative research involving problems and techniques from within algebra,
geometry, topology, probability, computer science, and analysis. This conference
will keep junior researchers aware of recent advances, and give them a platform
to present their own research. The GSCC provides an opportunity for graduate
students to network, frequently leading to joint research projects and
opportunities for future collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;Website:
