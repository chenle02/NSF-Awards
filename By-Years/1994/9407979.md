9407979 McIntosh Plants, unlike other organisms, possess two respiratory
pathways: the "normal" cytochrome pathway and an "alternative pathway". This is
important because alternative pathway respiration does not contribute to a
proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane and thus electrons that
flow down this pathway do not conserve energy. All plants apparently contain an
alternative pathway of respiration, that may be induced in response to
developmental signals (such as increased carbohydrate status and flowering) and
many environmental stimuli (such as cold, wounding, and endogenous salicylic
acid concentrations). Why should plants have a more complex respiratory system
than most other eukaryotes and what is its funciton? Although it is not possible
to form a complete answer now, alternative pathway respiration is most probably
involved in the regulation of energy/carbon balance in plants in response to
varying demands of development and the environment. A classic approach to
dissect the importance and function of any pathway is to study mutants in the
pathway. No plant mutants have been isolated for alternative pathway
respiration, possibly because of its proposed regulatory functions. The approach
put forward in this research is to create plant lines with altered amounts of
cytochrome oxidase and alternative oxidase, and to use these lines to elucidate
the genetic, biochemical, and biophysical regulation of respiratory energy
balance in plants. Tomato and potato plants will be used as experimental
systems. ***
