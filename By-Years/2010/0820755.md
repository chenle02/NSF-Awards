Towards the ultimate goal of deciphering the function of every gene in the
Arabidopsis genome, it is paramount to generate high-resolution spatial and
temporal maps of gene expression patterns and sub-cellular localization of the
corresponding gene products. Translational fusions between a reporter gene, such
as GFP, and a gene of interest in its chromosomal context provide the most
accurate information on that gene's expression pattern. In the absence of
efficient homologous recombination system in Arabidopsis, large Arabidopsis
artificial chromosomes can be precisely tagged with fluorescence proteins by
homologous recombination in E. coli and then transferred to the Arabidopsis
genome. The main objective of this project is to examine the efficiency and
effectiveness of this bacterial recombination system for large-scale gene
function analysis in Arabidopsis. The accuracy of the obtained information and,
therefore, the utility of the system will be evaluated generating GFP-tagged
Arabidopsis lines for genes with well-characterized expression patterns, as well
as with well-defined mutant phenotypes. The efficiency of each step in the
process and the "scalability" to a whole-genome level will be examined. Finally,
the utility of using additional reporter gene tags such as those based on GAL4
will be investigated, exploring the potential of employing the generated tagged
clones to confer specific well-defined expression patterns to any gene of
interest and to test the functional relevance of a particular expression
pattern. Finally, the transferability of this technology to other plant species
will be investigated.

Broader Impacts: All biological materials generated in this project will be made
available, upon testing, to the research community from the Arabidopsis
Biological Resource Center. The availability of these resources will be
announced through the Arabidopsis News Group
(http://www.bio.net/biomail/listinfo/arab-gen). List of genes, position of the
tags, and project progress will be posted in a project-dedicated webpage.
Importantly, the long-term potential impact of this project is the production of
essential tools for generating the Arabidopsis "localizome", high-resolution
expression maps of all Arabidopsis genes. This project will also provide an
excellent opportunity for attracting and introducing the field of functional
genomics to high school and undergraduate students, particularly those from
underrepresented groups and especially Hispanics.
