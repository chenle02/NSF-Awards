Nonuniformity of memory access is an almost inevitable feature of the memory
architecture in shared memory designs that can scale to large numbers of
processors, creating the increasingly important class of NUMA (nonuniform memory
access time) multiprocessors. Managing the placement and movement of code and
data is crucial to performance in NUMA architectures. This has been called the
NUMA Problem. The I/O bottleneck problem is also exacerbated by parallel
architectures which widen the gap between processing speed and disk speed even
beyond that created by improved processor technology. This project investigates
operating system mechanisms and policies for the management of the various
levels of shared storage in such large- scale shared memory multiprocessors. The
specific projects divide into the following classes: main memory management
(both traditional virtual memory and the migration and replication of pages
among various main memory modules), parallel file system design, workload
characterization and performance evaluation methodology and the role of the
programming environment in solving the NUMA Problem.
