West Virginia University is teaming with Step-Up for Women to prepare a full
proposal. The objective of the proposed project to be implemented beginning in
fall 2003 is to increase the number of women entering and remaining in the
computer science major at West Virginia University. The research question to be
addressed is whether an adaptation of the approaches used by Jane Margolis and
Allan Fisher at Carnegie Mellon University [Margolis, 2002] and by Jane Zimmer
Daniels, formerly at Purdue University and now at The Henry Luce Foundation, are
applicable at a university in a rural state with modest admissions requirements.
Central to the work is a two semester course sequence which will be discovery-
based with a real-world orientation. The results of this work should be
transferable to colleges and universities in similar states seeking to increase
all students and particularly female students in computer science.&lt;br/&gt;
