This project addresses the topic of three-dimensional noise control. The
majority of practical noise problems, such as machinery noise, are three-
dimensional and require research of the type undertaken in this project. There
is a strong need for control strategies which can be applied easily and
inexpensively to such systems and be adaptive and robust enough to operate under
major variations in operating conditions. This project investigates the
feasibility of improved control schemes by applying advanced control techniques
to a reference model generated by the boundary element model. Wave propagation
is modeled using the Kirchoff Integral equation. Finally, a control strategy
based on model reference adaptive systems is developed. The control scheme is
tested in the acoustic chambers on several machinery noise problems.
