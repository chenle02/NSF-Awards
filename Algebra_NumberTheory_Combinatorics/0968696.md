Affine combinatorics, Schubert calculus, and total positivity Title: Harvard
University

The PI proposes to develop combinatorics arising from affine Lie algebras and
loop groups. The PI with collaborators will study the Schubert calculus of flag
varieties of affine Lie groups. This includes understanding the geometry of
Schubert varieties and the combinatorics of the polynomials representing
Schubert varieties in (co)homology and K-(co)homology. Together with co-workers,
the PI will also develop a theory of total positivity for loop groups, and for
their flag varieties. The theory being developed generalizes the classical
Edrei-Thoma classification of characters of the infinite symmetric group.
Furthermore, new combinatorics for Coxeter groups occurs, including a weak order
for the limiting elements of a Coxeter group. In another direction, the PI with
collaborators will study the convex geometry of the affine Coxeter arrangement,
and in particular, certain polytopes which occur in the study of affine Schubert
varieties and total positivity of the affine Grassmannian.

The PI's research is in the area of combinatorics, which studies how to count
discrete objects. The PI studies combinatorial problems which arise from
geometry (studying shapes of objects in space) and algebraic structures
(studying solutions to polynomial equations). One of the on-going themes of the
PI's work is the study of (positive) numbers which arise in mathematics. These
numbers may occur when counting the ways geometrical objects interact in space,
or by couting certain solutions to polynomial equations. In particular, the PI
aims to understand the "positive" part of a geometrical figure in the same way
the positive real axis is the "positive" part of the real line. The PI's work
will have a significant impact on the understanding of the relationships between
geometry, algebra, and combinatorics.
