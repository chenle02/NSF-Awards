Sites within Tampa Bay Florida have recently been found to have an outbreak of a
rhizophytic green alga, Caulerpa prolifera. Historically this alga has been
present in the Bay, but has never been known to be persistent and extensive in
its cover. While C. prolifera is not invasive per se in Tampa Bay, its rapid
increase in cover and overgrowth of seagrass triggers concern that we may be
witnessing a major habitat shift in shallow water communities in this region as
has occurred in other regions of the world. The spread of C. prolifera in Tampa
Bay has implications for both the biological and physical attributes of the
seagrass ecosystem. Fortuitously Drs. Thomas and Bell have a long-term data base
on the area that can be used as a baseline to investigate the algal outbreak.
They will take advantage of the opportunity to document the beginning stages of
what appears to be an algal displacement of the dominant vegetation in the area.
They will 1) document the extent of C. prolifera spread in 4 sites where
historical data are available, and 2) assess possible community implications of
a habitat shift by comparing invertebrate and epiphyte abundance, hydrodynamic
regime, and nutrient exchange between the benthos and the water column in
seagrass versus C. prolifera ?dominated landscapes. With support from the SGER
award and building upon their combined backgrounds in seagrass landscape ecology
and hydrodynamics, Drs. Bell and Thomas will be able to document the beginning
stages of the algal outbreak and gather unprecedented information on the
temporal dynamics of habitat shifts in shallow waters or perhaps measure the
resilience of seagrass ecosystems to a major perturbation.&lt;br/&gt; A graduate
student will be supported on the project to help develop/conduct experimental
protocols and assist in field studies. Likewise qualified undergraduates will be
recruited to participate in the project. These investigators will incorporate
findings into public web pages, highlighting the research on C. prolifera.
