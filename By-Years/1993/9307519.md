The principal objective of this research project is to document magmatic
evolution within an exposed crustal section of a Jurassic island-arc complex
that was accreted to the North American continent. Rock units representative of
the lower, middle and upper crustal levels of the Bonanza arc of Vancouver
Island and others representative of preexisting crust into which the magmatic
rocks were emplaced will be studied by detailed field work, geochemical
analysis, and geochemical modelling. The study should elucidate the internal
structure of the arc and the chemical evolution of arc magmas as they pass
through and interact with the surrounding crust.
