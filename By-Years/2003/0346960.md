Bacteriophage T4 is an excellent model system for studies of DNA replication and
repair. Recognition of branched DNA is the initial step that determines the fate
of DNA replication, repair, and recombination intermediates. The central
emphasis of this research is to determine how structure specific recognition of
branched DNA is accomplished at the atomic level. Biophysical and single crystal
X-ray diffraction studies will be employed to determine intermolecular
interactions in DNA replication complexes. T4 RNase H, a member of the rad2 5'
nuclease family, has structural similarity to the eukaryotic flap endonucleases
needed for processing Okazaki fragments during lagging strand DNA synthesis and
for DNA repair events involving strand displacement synthesis. Structure
determination of T4 RNase H in complex with branched DNA substrates, and in
complex with T4 gene 32 single stranded DNA binding protein, which coordinates
T4 RNase H and DNA polymerase activities, will provide valuable insight into
this fundamental process. Diffraction data from T4 RNase H (D132N mutant) in
complex with fork DNA have been collected and structure determination is
underway. T4 gene 59 helicase assembly protein recognizes branched DNA and
directs the assembly of T4 41 helicase specifically at DNA replication forks.
Structural studies of binary complexes between 59 protein and branched DNA and
ternary complexes of 59 and 32 proteins with branched DNA will allow precise
analysis of the molecular determinants of these specific interactions. Training
in structural biology of macromolecular complexes will involve the use of
crystallization robotics, automated imaging, and high brilliance and synchrotron
X-ray sources.
