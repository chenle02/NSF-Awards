9712353 HORMIGA Spiders are numerous, widespread and have a direct impact on
human affairs. About 30 species inflict medically important bites; more
generally, spider venoms are used in medical and pharmaceutical research. Spider
silk has extraordinary physical properties; silks and their constituents are
foci of biotechnological research with possible commercial applications. Spiders
also regulate insect populations in natural and agricultural environments.
Nevertheless spider diversity and biology are inadequately understood. About
36,000 species are known to science, less than half of the number thought to be
present on Earth. Faunas in tropical and Southern Hemisphere temperate areas are
most poorly known. Even for the described species, accurate identification
manuals, keys, monographs and phylogenetic analyses are, for the most part,
lacking. In this PEET proposal, Gustavo Hormiga, John Coddington and colleagues
will improve the state of spider taxonomy by conducting monographic research
within three subfamilies (Linyphiidae; Theridiidae; Tetragnathidae) of araneoid
(Araneae) spiders. The monographic research will make use of museum and field-
collected specimens to describe new species, produce keys to species,
reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among the species, and develop a
computerized information system linking text, data, and image files and
available via the World Wide Web and CD-ROM. The research will train three new
taxonomists in modern methods, developed and applied to spiders, during the
course of the project.
