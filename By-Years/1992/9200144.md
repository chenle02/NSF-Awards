This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor
Silas C. Blackstock at Vanderbilt University. Electron transfer mediated
fragmentations and rearrangements will be examined. In particular,
fragmentations of nitrogen-containing substrates such as diazenes, nitroso
compounds, and azooxides, and rearrangements of methylenecyclopropane and allyl
vinyl ether will be examined under oxidative conditions. Short lived radical ion
intermediates will be spectroscopically characterized by low temperature solid
state and solution ESR methods. The structures of the radical ion intermediates
will be engineered to enhance their lifetimes in order to allow their direct
observations. Reaction rate measurements to determine electron transfer mediated
rate accelerations and product analysis to evaluate mechanistic hypotheses will
also be conducted. %%% The removal of an electron from an organic molecule
frequently results in cleavage of the molecule or rearrangement of the
connectivity of its atoms. In this project a variety of carbon and nitrogen
containing substrates will be used to examine these reactions. These processes
are energetically costly or nonexistant in the neutral precursors. This work
will study the electron deficient intermediates directly in order to understand
how electron transfer accelerates these reactions. Knowledge gained from this
study will facilitate informed development of new electron transfer applications
in organic chemistry.
