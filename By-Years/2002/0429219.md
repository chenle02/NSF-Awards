This award provides funding for Oregon State University to purchase basic core
instrumentation for the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering
Simulation (NEES) tsunami wave basin at Oregon State University that will be
operated by NEES Consortium, Inc., as a national shared use facility during FY
2005 - FY 2014. This award provides funding for the necessary core
instrumentation to address the major challenges in tsunami research outlined the
2003 National Research Council report entitled "Preventing Earthquake Disasters:
The Grand Challenge in Earthquake Engineering Research - A Research Agenda for
the Network for Earthquake Engineering." The instrumentation was selected with
input from the tsunami research community and includes: a free surface probe
array, an acoustic-doppler velocimeter array, a pressure transducer array, force
measurement systems (one linear actuator, one 6DOF load cell, and one
accelerometer), a mobile bed multiple-transducer array, lighting equipment, and
additional data acquisition equipment. This instrumentation will enable
researchers to develop three-dimensional, numerical simulation models of tsunami
generation, propagation and coastal effects that are experimentally verified
and, as needed, combined with selected real time tsunami data, e.g., researchers
will be able to model the breaking waves as the tsunami approaches the
shoreline, energy dissipation associated with boundary shear stresses and with
wave breaking, run-up and run-down on the shore, wave-structure interaction, and
sediment transport. The instrumentation will also be used for K-12 outreach
through demonstrated laboratory activities using the tsunami wave basin's
telepresence system. This award is funded by the NSF NEES Major Research
Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) project and is a component of the
National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP).
