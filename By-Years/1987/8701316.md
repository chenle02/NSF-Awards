Repair and retrofit of existing structures to resist seismic events is important
to Earthquake Hazard Mitigation. Application of the proper repair and retrofit
procedures can save damaged structures and upgrade existing structures for high
seismic resistance; thus potentially saving resources and lives. This research
project will be a workshop to provide an opportunity for researchers, designers,
and regulatory officials to exchange ideas and discuss current research. The aim
is to assess the state-of-the-art in the United States and Japan and to provide
a statement of need for future research activities. A proceedings of the
workshop will be published., This will be carried out under the U.S. Panel on
Wind and Seismic Effects of the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Program in Natural
Resources (UJNR). An award is recommended for the one-year complete research
project. The principal investigator is highly qualified and the institution
provides excellent support facilities.
