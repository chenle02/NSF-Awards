based architecture to create layered approach to enabling scalable fault
tolerance. The This project will focus on the middleware layer used to provide
message passing capabilities for distributed memory applications. The system
will use a component-design and implementation of the message passing system
will provide sufficient flexibility to accommodate a wide variety of application
state management and recovery mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
message passing system will have the following capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;o Failure
detection;&lt;br/&gt;o Fault tolerance of the run-time system;&lt;br/&gt;o Fault
tolerance of the message passing layer (MPI);&lt;br/&gt;o Meaningful semantics
for the message passing layer in the presence of faults;&lt;br/&gt;o Flexible
application interface for fault notification; and&lt;br/&gt;o Support for
application state management and recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will
be realized as part of the component framework of LAM/MPI, an existing high-
quality implementation of the Message Passing Interface
standard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have broader impacts in several
areas. Availability of a scalable and reliable middleware layer will enable new
levels of application scalability. In addition, new capabilities for MPI jobs
can be realized, including process migration, non-stop behavior, and gang
scheduling. Since the proposed middleware will be realized in the context of
MPI, applications written with MPI can immediately benefit from this
work.&lt;br/&gt;And, since the work will be integrated into a production-quality
implementation of MPI, the results can actually be used by a widespread
audience. The modular component-based design of our implementation will allow
the middleware to be used by a wide variety of state management and application-
specific fault tolerance schemes. Finally, important contributions from this
work are in the form of interface designs-other implementations of MPI will also
be able to adopt these approaches to provide reliability&lt;br/&gt;
