ABSTRACT 9531361 Krantz This REU site program in membranes and thin film
research will constitute ten (10) weeks of research work, training programs,
educational seminars, cultural programs and recreational activities for the
expected twelve (12) students annually. Each student will be assigned an
individual research project and it will be conducted under the guidance of a
faculty advisor. The students will interact closely with the faculty, graduate
students and others in a supportive environment. Typical research project areas
are: bioseparations, biomedical membrane applications, filtration, nonlinear
optics, polymeric membrane formation, thin liquid film dynamics, photocatalysis,
heterogeneous catalysis and microdynamics.
