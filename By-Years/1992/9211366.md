This research investigates the use of robotic hands in automated robotic
assembly. In many assemblies, the clearances allowed between mating parts are
smaller than the uncertainties associated with a robotic assembly cell and
though it is possible to reduce these uncertainties by using special purpose
mechanisms and high precision fixturing devices, this limits flexibility and
increases cost. It is preferable for the manipulator to use force/torque
feedback during the execution of assembly mating operations to reduce alignment
errors between parts which are caused by the uncertainties. By incorporating a
robotic hand into the robot manipulator system, the performance of the assembly
cell will be improved. The accuracy of force/torque measurements will be
increased by putting sensors on both the manipulator and the hand. The hand will
serve as both a general fixturing device so that the grasped part can be held
rigidly during assembly and a micromanipulator so that fine adjustments to the
position of the grasped part can be made. The central goal of this project is a
general and automated method for synthesizing force/torque guided motion
strategies which operate on a manipulator/hand system and are capable of
reducing uncertainty-induced errors during assembly execution. //
