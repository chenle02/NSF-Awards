The investigators will carry out an extensive research program to examine, at
other wavelengths, blazar sources of gamma rays observed by GLAST (Gamma-ray
Large Aperture Space Telescope, scheduled for launch in 2008). The work will
consist of radio monitoring, VLBA radio imaging and polarimetry, optical
identification, and optical spectral line observations which will provide a
multifrequency foundation for the GLAST blazar observations. They will carry out
a flux density monitoring campaign on the Owens Valley Radio Observatory 40m and
Torun 32m telescopes, and an intensive identification and spectral line
observational program at Palomar, Keck, the Hobby-Eberley Telesope, and the SALT
and ESO telescopes in the southern hemisphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impacts include working with a Chilean graduate student and developing projects
and teacher tools that will be used by students in fourteen states of the United
States and in several other countries. One third of the time on the Owens Valley
Radio Observatory 40m Telescope will be dedicated to K-12 programs involved in
GLAST observations.
