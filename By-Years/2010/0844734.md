During the development of multicellular organisms, proper cell fates can be
specified by asymmetric cell divisions, where key molecules are distributed
unequally between two sister cells. Despite the importance of this mechanism for
normal development, it remains poorly understood. The embryo of the mollusc
Ilyanassa has numerous asymmetric cell divisions and important practical and
experimental advantages, making it a useful model for understanding this
process. This group of researchers has discovered that many RNA molecules in the
embryo are specifically localized and segregated during early development by a
novel mechanism. This project will empirically determine the sequences that
control localization and asymmetric segregation of these RNAs, allowing
comparison of the RNA structures that mediate similar and different patterns of
localization. The identification of these RNA sequences will then allow these
researchers to test hypotheses about how the specificity of localization is
achieved. These experiments will also test whether the localization of one of
these RNAs is important for cell fate specification by using functional gene-
knockdown approaches. These experiments should significantly expand
understanding of how RNAs are sorted during cell division, and how this impacts
early embryogenesis. The work will also train young scientists at the graduate
and undergraduate levels for future careers as independent researchers and
scholars in this underexplored area of cell differentiation.
