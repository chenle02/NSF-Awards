"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer processor industry has moved
fully into the multi-core era to enable continual scaling of performance, but at
the cost of increased energy consumption and increased cooling costs due to
higher temperatures and thermal gradients. This proposal describes three major
research thrusts that address these costs in multiple ways: (1) New modeling and
simulation tools: We will integrate performance, power, temperature, reliability
and cooling estimation, so that the designers will be able to analyze the impact
of design choices and runtime decisions over significant time spans. (2) Runtime
thread scheduling policies: We will identify and demonstrate power and thermal
scheduling mechanisms that maintain performance, reduce the total energy
consumption, and eliminate or reduce hot spots, but also maximize processor
lifetime. The policies will use the data from thermal sensors and performance
counters to proactively drive the management decisions. (3) New cooling
strategies: Our goal is to create thermal management and cooling control
algorithms that work in tandem to reduce the overall energy
consumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research forms the basis for
discovery and learning in the areas of multi core processors, and, more
generally, system design and management. Graduate and undergraduate students
will be involved in various parts of the proposed research and help in
connecting this work with other NSF sponsored projects. The results of research,
tools and coursework materials developed will be freely and easily distributed
to engineering community at large.
