The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. William Wade of the University of Tennessee and Dr. Ferenc Schipp of Eotvos
Lorand University is to extend the martingale-based techniques of mathematics
research to study the full sequence of partial sums of a Vilenkin-Fourier
series. Results are expected to throw light on the classical case of
trigonometric series and lead to definition of relationships to other fields
like probability theory and number theory. This project in mathematics fulfills
the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
scientific experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents, pool resources and share research experience in areas of
strong mutual interest and competence.
