9310268 Wheelwright The Bowdoin Scientific Station is a biological field
station located on Kent Island, New Brunswick, Canada. The 80-ha island, ringed
by 7 km of sandy beaches and rocky intertidal, has a diversity of habitats,
including boreal forest, old fields, and marsh, and has easy access to other
islands in the Bay of Fundy. Owned and operated since 1935 by Bowdoin College in
Brunswick, Maine, the field station has promoted biological research by faculty,
graduate students, and undergraduates from numerous U.S. colleges and
universities. BSS is unusual among North American field stations in offering
both terrestrial and marine boreal habitats, and having long-term databases on
local climate and vertebrate populations. Working closely with senior
researchers, hundreds of undergraduates have been trained at BSS, and many have
gone on to prominent careers in science. The field station has recently
modernized its research facilities and scientific equipment, and expanded the
research program. Of the 109 scientific papers based on research at BSS since
1935, 24 have been published in the last six years. The field station's location
makes it ideal for research in marine biology and island biogeography. However,
many on-going projects are limited (and new projects prevented) by the lack of
facilities for marine research. Most importantly, the station currently lacks an
adequate boat for safe transportation in the Bay of Fundy. As long-term
databases at BSS have grown, new computer equipment is required for database
management. The field station's photovoltaic system needs to be expanded to meet
the energy demands imposed by increasing use of laboratory equipment and
computers. This project will address those needs. ***
