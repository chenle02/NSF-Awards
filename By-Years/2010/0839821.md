Answer set programming is an important, practical declarative programming
paradigm widely applied to knowledge-intensive applications. However, the
requirement that variables be eliminated through grounding limits modeling and
reasoning capabilities, and can yield large, incomprehensible propositional
logic programs. This project aims beyond the limitations of answer set
programming by merging the traditional stable model semantics with classical
logic. The project includes, for example, (i) the study of safety conditions,
under which first-order reasoning can be reduced to propositional reasoning,
which justifies the use of answer set solvers for grounding-independent
reasoning; (ii) the study of loop formulas with variables, which will allow
stable models to be computed by first-order theorem provers. The success of this
project will have a significant impact on a wide range of domains that requires
grounding-independent reasoning, such as Question &amp; Answer systems that use
background knowledge, as well as planning and description logics.&lt;br/&gt;
