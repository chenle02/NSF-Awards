This project continues mathematical research combining general operator-
theoretic functional analysis with differential equations. Three overlapping
areas will be treated in the work. The first concerns nonlinear partial
differential equations of evolution which are of mixed type in the space
variable. Initial work will focus on a concrete example, the Kompaneetz Equation
of plasma physics. It can be written as an abstract Cauchy problem. The first
task is to determine properties of the resolvent; in particular whether or not
it has a dense range. The second area involves semigroups of operators,
particularly those whose infinitesimal generators split into a linear and
locally smooth nonlinear part. The object is to determine conditions for a
globally defined semigroup of operators determining the solution for all time
and to bound the difference of any two solutions as a function of time and the
initial function norms. Finally, work will be done on spin polarization Thomas-
Fermi theory involving a minimizing problem for pairs of functions. One main
obstacle to finding extrema is the functional involving the two unknowns is not
convex. By topological arguments, one can show that extrema exist. The next step
will be to find a method which will produce the minima in a concrete fashion.
The project combines abstract mathematical concepts with models of various
phenomena in the physical world. Among the goals of the research is one of
fitting models into the proper generalized structures and apply the existing
theory. In this way one gains insight into the models and, at times, discovers
hidden properties.
