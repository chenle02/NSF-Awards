The Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Mass. is one of the finest
facilities for basic biological research in the world. A great deal of their
research is performed on biological specimens which are collected on a daily
basis from the ocean around the institute. This action is to support the charter
vessel which collects marine organisms for use in neurobiology.
