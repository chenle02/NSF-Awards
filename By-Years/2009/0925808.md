The objectives of the research program are to transform technologies that send,
receive and manipulate electromagnetic microwave (EM) signals by realizing
substantial reduction in device size, weight, and cost while concomitantly
enhancing performance and functionality. The approach entails: i) develop and
implement new numerical and simulation methodologies that address the EM
interaction with anisotropic ferrite materials, ii) optimize processing of low-
loss ferrite materials, and iii) develop microstrip prototypes having integrated
active tuning via low power, voltage- and current-driven transducers.

Intellectual Merit: This research eliminates the disadvantages of ferrite-based
microwave devices, namely large volume, slow response time and high power
consumption inherent to the present magnetic field-biased waveguides. The
generation of magnetic fields via small voltages (10's V) and currents (10's mA)
derived from magnetoelectric heterostructures lead to >100X reduction in power
consumption and response time. The impact is the development of planar phase
shifters and circulators having low insertion loss, high power handling, low
power consumption, and fast response time for applications in wireless and
satellite communications and mobile networking.

Broader Impact: The implementation of this program will positively impact
society?s socioeconomic challenges related to increasing the number of
underrepresented minorities in science, technology & engineering (ST&E) careers.
This is achieved by identifying, recruiting, and educating underrepresented
populations at the pre-freshmen stage of education by creating opportunities for
student exchange and diversity through the establishment of Summer Science
Magnetism Camp for rising middle school students and Magnetism and Engineering
Summer Bridge Program for high school students.
