9424278 Doyle Research will be carried out leading to a twenty-fold improvement
in accuracy of the neutron lifetime. A new cooling and trapping technique for
neutrons will be developed based on energy dissipation in superfluid helium and
trapping within a magnetic well. The lifetime measurement will permit more
precise tests of the standard model of electroweak interactions. The experiment
will be carried out at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
research reactor. This activity is multidisciplinary, bringing together low
temperature techniques and nuclear physics techniques. The new trapping method
proposed will also permit development of intense polarized ultra-cold neutrons
for further nuclear physics studies and for future materials research studies.
The lifetime measurement and the possible study of triple correlations in
neutron beta-decay are high priority activities in contemporary nuclear physics
and studies of fundamental symmetries. Development, construction, and
utilization of major state-of-the-art equipment is integral to this activity.
Education of graduate students and postdocs is a strong component in every
aspect of this grant.***
