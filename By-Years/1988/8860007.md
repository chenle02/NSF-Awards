The work to be done under this grant is aimed at electrochemically producing
alcohols at ambient temperature from carbon dioxide. The alcohols, such as
methanol can be used as fuel or as chemical feedstocks. The primary drawback to
economical electrochemical reduction of CO2 has been low efficiencies. The
technology to be investigated would increase this efficiency and make the
process economically viable. Specifically, work will be directed towards
achieving both high Faradaic efficiencies and current densities for the
electrochemical reduction of CO2 is aqueous electrolyte to alcohols. The
electrocatalysis strategy will involve providing distinct sites on the electrode
surface for electrochemically generating chemisorbed carbon dioxide (at either
FeRhO3, LaRhO3, LaNiO3 or LaCoO3 sites). This will be achieved by
electrochemically in situ depositing copper from the electrolytic cell catholyte
onto the electronically conducting metal oxide perovskite. Mechanistic insight
will be obtained on the synergistic role of this electrocatalysis approach for
enhancing CO2 reduction kinetics to give the desired condensed species
(alcohols).
