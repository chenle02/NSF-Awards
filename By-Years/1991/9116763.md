Neuronal pattern analysis (NPA) documents the dynamic brain processes of
sensation, perception, learning and cognition by recording the electrical
activity of brain neurons. Recent advances in multi-array recording technologies
have greatly expanded the rate at which NPA data can be obtained, and these
technologies have fostered means not previously available to study the
intercorrelations of dynamic activities in neuronal networks. Computational
modeling of brain dynamic activity has fostered major increment in the
requirements of data processing due to the need to analyze simulated neuronal
spike trains and to compare real and simulated neuronal data. These developments
call for parallel development of adequate database systems for organization,
rapid access, and sharing of NPA data. This project will establish a database
system (DBS) for time series neurophysiological data recorded in experiments of
members of the University of Illinois Beckman Institute Neuronal Pattern
Analysis Group. System design and implementation will be carried out with
consultation and guidance of the National center for Supercomputer Applications.
This proposed system will foster community-wide sharing of times series and
other forms of neural data, proved a model DBS that can generalize to other
neuroscience groups, and enhance the research in the involved laboratories.
