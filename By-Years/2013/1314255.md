This award provides support for a three-day conference on Combinatorics, Graph
Theory and Computing, to be held during May 23-25, 2013, at the Middle Tennessee
State University. The conference will feature invited talks as well as
contributed talks on a wide range of topics from graph theory and combinatorics.

This conference is the twenty-sixth in the series ``Cumberland Conference on
Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Computing", which was begun with the intention
of meeting a regional need. The conferences bring together internationally known
researchers, university and college professors from throughout the southeastern
region, some industrial mathematicians and computer scientists, graduate
students in these fields, and some undergraduate students. Particular efforts
are made to include faculty and students from smaller institutions throughout
the region.
