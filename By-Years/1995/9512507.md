9512507 Messina The Concurrent Supercomputing Consortium (CSCC) which is led by
the California Institute of Technology proposes to acquire a large-scale data
storage facility with a parallel I/O architecture and integrate it with the
consortium's existing computing resources. It will undertake a CSCC Archive and
Parallel Resource Interface (CAPRI) project which will enable new, data-
intensive applications to be carried out. The facility will provide the ability
to store terabytes of data and to access the storage system with multiple
parallel interfaces. It will serve as a key research instrument for the scalable
I/O research initiative. The results of the research project will enable the
scientists at the Consortium to achieve unprecedented performance on data-
intensive computational problems. The project will greatly enhance the
Consortium's computing environment by creating storage capability commensurate
with the prodigious ability of the computational resources to generate data. The
major components of the proposed system are (1) the high-performance storage
system (HPSS) software package, (2) a 64 Gigabyte on-board disk cache, (3) 16
HIPPI nodes for supporting parallel network I/O, (4) 80 Gigabytes of RAID disk
caches, (5) a 15 Terabyte archival storage system including four IBM 3490-C2A
tape drives and robotic tape handling, and (6) a HIPPI switch. ***
