This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the
general area of instrumentation development in the subfield of infrared
spectrometry. The most widely used instrument for infrared spectral analysis is
the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer. When applied to non-
repetitive samples this instrument has limited time resolution. Dr. Solomon will
use a different transform, a wavelet transform, for the IR interferograms, to
considerably improve the time resolution, and at the same time to present the
results in readily usable form. With no change in hardware, a wavelet transform
will improve the time resolution by a factor of 8, for a given spectral
resolution. With different hardware there is a potential for further
improvement. The wavelet transform method, implemented by hardware additions to
the standard FT-IR instrument, plus software, would be marketed as an option to
the standard instrument.
