This project funds travel support for students to attend the the 35th IEEE
International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2015) to be
held in Columbus, Ohio, June 29th - July 2nd, 2015. Conference experience is
critical for training undergraduate and graduate students to be well-prepared
for the computing workforce of the future. ICDCS is a premier conference and has
a wide coverage of topics in distributed computing. The conference has made
significant impacts to the computing community since it was founded in 1979. The
selected papers have influenced the design and implementation of many
distributed computing systems, software and applications today. Participation in
such a premium conference provides an excellent opportunity for students and
junior faculty members to learn the latest advances in distributed computing and
interact with peers and world-renowned researchers at an international stage.
