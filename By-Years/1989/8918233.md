The Synthesizer Generator is a well-known and successful tool for creating
language-based environments from formal specifications. Over 250 research sites
worldwide have licensed the Generator, where its broad applicability is
demonstrated by the diverse systems developed with it: programming and
specification language editors, theorem proving environments, program
verification environments, graphical editors, and the like. Recent advances in
incremental computation make interactive environments practical even for large
objects. Implementing these ideas will make improved performance available to
many users of the Generator. Offer improvements include reduced time of editor
generation, improved facilities for integration of existing editors with other
tools, and expanded architecture nd windowing platforms on which the Generator
runs. The results of this work will be a Synthesizer Generator that is available
to a wider community of researchers and an expanded number of applications.
