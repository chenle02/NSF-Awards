Group theory is applied to the analysis of atomic shells to 1) understand
better the many surprising and unexpected simplifications that occur when group
labels are used to describe atomic states and 2) exploit that knowledge in
constructing effective operators to fit experimental data more closely. This
leads to a description involving quasiparticles which can be thought of as
quarks. The work is applicable to the spectra of the rare earths and actinide
elements and has applications to many other areas of physics.
