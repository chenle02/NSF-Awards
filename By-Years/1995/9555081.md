This project proposes to design and teach a course on modern techniques for
cryptographic protocols and their ramifications. The course would be accessible
to students with no special mathematical background or talent. The primary goal
of the course is to expose students to fundamental concepts in mathematics and
theoretical computer science, using cryptography as a vehicle. A second goal is
to give students a background in an area that will be increasingly important as
use of the Internet grows and as our economy becomes more heavily based on trade
in information (including software, audio, video and film, marketing data,
etc.). Finally, the potential for widespread use of cryptography and digital
signatures brings into focus such controversial and important issues as the
conflict between privacy and law enforcement; the course would provide a forum
for discussion of such issues. The intention is that the course would serve both
to educate non-science majors and to attract prospective majors to the sciences.
Because there is currently no textbook that addresses the subject at a level
accessible to students that are not mathematically oriented, this project will
develop suitable course materials. Such materials include course notes and
homework assignments. In addition, the PI will develop a small programming
language and visual environment in which even a novice programmer can develop
and experiment with cryptographic protocols. As part of the course, students
will have "lab assignments" in which they are led through such experimentation.
The PI wil make the course materials, the programming language and environment,
and the lab assignments widely available to prospective teachers of similar
courses at other colleges.
