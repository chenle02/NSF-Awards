9615166 Gwanmesia The PI proposes significant undergraduate involvement in a
study of elastic properties of a suite of carbonate minerals of importance in
the earth's crust using a Digital Ultrasonic Interferometer. Elastic wave
velocities will be measured for hot-pressed polycrystalline specimens at ambient
pressure and temperature. ***
