This award provides partial support for the 2002 Gordon Research Conference on
Correlated Electrons to be held June 29 - July 3 on the Campus of Colby College
in Waterville Maine. NSF funds will be used to partially defray the registration
costs of advanced graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and young faculty
with no other support. The physics of correlated electrons is both rich in basic
science challenges and pregnant with possibilities for technological impact. The
conference will cover a broad range of topics that are among the most active in
this field including, superconductivity and related properties of two-
dimensional electrons in organic-molecule field-effect-transistor systems,
ferromagnetism in diluted magnetic semiconductors and other low-electron-density
systems, and new advances in experimental and theoretical studies of oxide
superconductivity. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support

conference will cover a broad range of topics that are among the most active in
this field. Conference highlights include reports on the latest advances of
efforts to understand ferromagnetism in semiconductors, a phenomenon that could
enable long-term information storage and information processing to occur in the
same semiconductor device, and reports on superconductivity controlled by gate
voltages in organic materials, a phenomenon that could lead to room temperature
superconductivity. &lt;br/&gt;
