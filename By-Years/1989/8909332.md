The objective of this project is to develop a more robust process model of plan
recognition without the restrictive assumptions of previous systems. In order to
effectively engage in a cooperative dialogue, a natural language system must be
able to infer a user's plan recognition have made several restrictive
assumptions that prevent them from handling naturally occurring dialogues. These
assumptions include: 1) a user cannot intend that the system recognize his/her
goal unless it is the only goal that can account for the current dialogue in the
given situation, and 2) the model inferred by the system is always in total
agreement with the task related plan under construction by the user. This
project will investigate a more robust model of plan recognition without these
unrealistic assumptions and which therefore will be able to handle dialogues
that are less than ideal. Our approach will be to study hjow evidential
reasoning techniques can be used to facilitate rational and natural recognition
of user intention in the presence of multiple alternatives and how techniques
for handling ill formed input can be applied to the problem of recognizing and
recovering from errors in the system's model of the user's plan.
