ABSTRACT CTS-9414584 Faghri The most important characteristics of evaporators
and condensers which are needed to meet the thermal management requirements of
emerging technologies are high heat flux capabilities, compactness and low
thermal and hydraulic resistances. Several evaporator and condenser
configurations with some new design features are proposed for theoretical and
experimental analyses to meet these requirements. The goal of these efforts is
to gain a fundamental understanding of the heat transfer processes in these
proposed high efficiency evaporators and condensers, which are useful for
various industrial and scientific applications.
