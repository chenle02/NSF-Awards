This project focuses on the neural processes by which learned motor skills are
adjusted when feedback from an animal's actions deviates from expectations.
Studies utilize a well-described neural circuit controlling learned birdsong,
and will investigate brain mechanisms that promote behavioral change when
auditory feedback from an animal's vocalizations deviates from previously
learned patterns. The focus is on a forebrain circuit implicated in motor
learning across a wide range of vertebrates. Lesions and/or reversible neuronal
inactivation will be used to determine if this forebrain circuit is directly
responsible for vocal experimentation when auditory feedback signals the need
for vocal change. Also, neuroanatomical measures will establish if such
feedback-driven behavioral plasticity entails changes in neuronal connections
within motor pathways, and whether the propensity for such neural change
decreases in older animals. The project will provide training in behavioral,
neuropharmacological, and neuroanatomical methods for both undergraduate and
graduate students. Additionally, knowledge derived from these studies will find
its way quickly into the classroom, as the investigators are involved heavily in
both undergraduate and graduate neuroscience programs. The broad aims are to
understand better how the brain evaluates the consequences of behavior, and to
identify some of the mechanisms it uses to adaptively adjust behavior. This
information will provide insights into general mechanisms of motor learning and
development, as well as adult neural and behavioral plasticity. The work should
impact a variety of disciplines ranging from cognitive and sensory-motor
neuroscience to neural reorganization.
