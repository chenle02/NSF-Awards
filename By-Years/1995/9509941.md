This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh in the
purchase of a cluster of SGI Indigo workstations. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including the following: (a) simulation of the
properties of clusters and colloidal suspensions, (b) the investigation of the
dynamics of excited molecules in condensed phases, (c) the modeling of electron
transfer reactions in donor-bridge-acceptor compounds and proteins, (d) the use
of electronic structure calculations to characterize electronically excited
states, and (e) to study reactions of hydrogen on silicon surfaces, and the
design of optical waveguides. On the instructional side, the proposed
workstations will be used in several undergraduate and graduate courses to
introduce our students to modern methods in molecular modeling and theoretical
chemistry. A workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new
way to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a "computer
network" also serves as a development environment for new theoretical codes and
algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities and
supports research in state-or-the-art applications of parallel prmcessing.
