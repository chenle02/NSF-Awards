This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The overall goal of this project is to increase
understanding of the conjugate nature of the polar ionospheres, which in part
helps understanding the multi-scale global solar wind, magnetosphere, and
ionosphere system. The project utilizes numerous types of ionospheric remote
sensing instrumentation, including: terrestrial GPS receivers, GPS satellite
occultation receivers, all-sky imagers, riometers, and magnetometers currently
deployed in the Arctic and Antarctic to estimate the 3-D time histories of the
ionospheric electron density and also to estimate the polar wind in these polar
regions. Furthermore, additional GPS instrumentation will be deployed in
Antarctica to increase the number and improve the spatial distribution of GPS
receivers in this region. Import aspects of this investigation are: (1)
utilization of a large array of instrumentation in the Arctic and Antarctic
regions to provide the maximum number of measurements of the ionosphere, (2) the
modification and deployment of commercial-off-the-shelf GPS receivers in remote
Antarctic locations to improve spatial distribution of GPS measurements, (3)
development of a new estimation algorithm for estimating the polar wind, and (4)
estimation of 3-D electron density time histories and conductances in conjugate
polar ionospheres. The fieldwork and analysis efforts associated with this
project are highly suitable for involvement and research training of graduate
and undergraduate students.
