Shaw 9617353 The award supports the Research Needs and Opportunities in
Superconductivity Workshop to be held at the Monterey Marriott Hotel,
Monterey,CA, February 10-12, 1997. The objectives of the conference are: 1.) to
review major advances in superconductivity R&D since the last workshop in 1991;
2) to identify key problems that are bottlenecking progress; 3.) to specify
areas where major breakthroughs appear possible; 4.) to identify new research
facilities or techniques that may lead to new research opportunities. The
Conference plans to invite research leaders to discuss fundamental issues in
superconductivity. The workshop will be divided into four panels: fundamentals,
materials, thin film and devices, and bulk superconductor, wires, and
applications. A proceeding will be put together by the Conference for the
report. The P.I. and his colleagues have organized similar conferences in the
past. The findings of the workshop would be able to provide NSF with suggestions
for research direction in the area of superconductivity materials processing in
the future.
