The UIC-Maneuvers project is to develop five replacement units for the middle
grades. These will be continuations of five previously developed modules. There
will be modules on topics such as Percent and Sports, Speeds, and Sizes. The use
of scientific calculators will be involved as a key element in each module. In
addition, open ended problems will be emphasized. Material for teachers and
parents will be developed as well. There will be a formative evaluation in the
development of the material and a summative evaluation of the entire project
including assessment of student learning. Finally, the modules finished under a
previous project were published by Dale Seymour and he has indicated an interest
in the proposed modules.
