This award provides 48 percent of the funds to acquire an electron probe
microanalyzer that will be installed and operated in the Department of
Geological Sciences at the University of Oregon. The remaining 52 percent is to
be provided by the institution. The new instrument will replace a 21-year old
machine that is no longer capable of providing the microanalytical data critical
to a wide range of geoscience research at the University including projects in
metamorphic, igneous and sedimentary petrology; experimental petrology;
mineralogy and crystallography; ore deposits; paleopedology; geochemistry. In
addition, research by Department of Chemistry faculty is also scheduled to use
the instrument as a means of characterizing new solid-state materials such as
modulated thin-film composites.
