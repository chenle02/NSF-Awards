The project will test a hypothesis as to the role of North Atlantic Deep Water
in ititiating glaciation via transport of heat between northern and southern
hemispheres. The hypothesis is derived from limited data with several
weaknesses. This project will use long sediment records collected from the Ceara
Rise, which intersects the flow paths of the relevant water masses, measuring
the stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in benthic foraminifera over a 1 million
year interval.
