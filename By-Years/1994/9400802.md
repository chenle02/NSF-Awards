9400802 Benatar The goal of this research is to improve our understanding of the
joining of thermoplastics and curing of thermoset polymers and composites using
intrinsically conductive polymers (ICPs). The research will cover three areas:
the development of experimental protocols and the modelling of microwave,
dielectric, induction, and resistance welding of plastics and composites using
ICPs, the development of a predictive model for charge transport and
electromagnetic radiation response mechanisms and their relation to the
molecular structure and morphology of the conductive polymer, and the
development of a variety of heating elements using intrinsically conductive
polymers and the measurement and modelling of the relationship between the
macroscopic structure of these elements and their electrical, rheological, and
mechanical properties. The welding and adhesive bonding of plastics and
composites are desirable because they minimize added weight, provide uniform
load distribution at the joint, and are economical.
