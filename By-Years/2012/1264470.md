Point-of-care devices require simple yet inexpensive platforms with
high&lt;br/&gt;sensitivity from complex media. Paper is the least expensive
platform for assay&lt;br/&gt;development and often allows results to be obtained
faster than conventional sensors.&lt;br/&gt;Current efforts to improve paper-
based detection technologies rely on physically&lt;br/&gt;adsorbed ligands (with
limited ligand amount and activity), rely on blocking agents
to&lt;br/&gt;passivate nonspecific protein adsorption (with limiting detection
sensitivity and suitable&lt;br/&gt;only for simple media or diluted samples),
and suffers from low sample retention due to&lt;br/&gt;the rapid evaporation of
samples (typically receiving less than 50% of the original&lt;br/&gt;sample in
the detection zone). Zwitterionic poly(carboxybetaine) (PCB) surface
coatings&lt;br/&gt;have been able to achieve highly sensitive and specific
detection from undiluted human&lt;br/&gt;plasma and serum. The objective of this
work is to realize inexpensive, yet highly&lt;br/&gt;sensitive paper-based
detection from complex media using zwitterionic chemistry.
