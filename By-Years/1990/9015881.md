This award will support Professor Athanassios Fokas of Clarkson University in a
research collaboration with Professor Paolo Santini of the Universita degli
Studi di Roma, "La Sapienza", Italy. The researchers intend to work on a variety
of topics including the direct linearization of a class of nonlinear evolution
equations, limits from the intermediate long wave equation to the Benjamin-Ono
equation, recursion operators and bi-Hamiltonian and coherent structures in
multidimensions. The collaborators have a history of successful interaction,
which has led to some of the best current work on the analysis of integrable
non-linear evolution equators. The mathematics is important and has potential
applications to physics and engineering.
