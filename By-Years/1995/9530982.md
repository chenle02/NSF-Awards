Abstract Varadhan 9530982 This proposal will partially support a conference on
differential equations to be held June 3-14 in Italy. Extended survey talks will
be given by H. Brezis, S.T. Yau, A. Majda, J.K. Moser, and L. Hormander. There
will also be talks by many of the international leaders in the field. There also
be participation by a large number of American postdocs and advanced graduate
students. Differential equations provide the fundamental paradigm for
mathematical models of motion. In this regard, differential equation models of
fluid dynamics are important for understanding weather prediction, airplane
flight, and the flow of blood through the human heart.
