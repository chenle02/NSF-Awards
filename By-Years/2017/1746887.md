This SBIR Phase I project will study the development of a digitally configurable
shape around which a shoe can be created. The results of this project will
enable the mass-customization of shoes so they can precisely fit the feet of the
individuals who wear them. Properly fitting shoes are intended to improve the
quality of life of customers through reduced pain and improved musculoskeletal
health. This development in shoe-making technology is of broad interest to the
population of the United States, but particularly important to women, who often
suffer from physical deformities and injuries caused by ill-fitting shoes. The
proposed innovation relies on mass-customization methods and flexible robotics
technology. Its anticipated success will provide additional jobs in the shoe
industry and related fields, and improve productivity nationwide through reduced
healthcare costs.

The strong technical innovation in this project will be the adaptation of
granular jamming technology for use in programmable shape technology. The
driving goal of the proposed project is to develop a last for use in the mass-
customization of shoes that is capable of changing shape in response to a
digital representation of the customer's foot shape. After changing shape, it
will lock into a rigid but smooth form appropriate for use in traditional shoe
manufacturing methods. The scope of the research will cover the development of
the last in a manner appropriate for use in manufacturing conditions (in terms
of both physical and temperature durability) and the creation and implementation
of algorithms for transforming foot shape data into an appropriately fitting
shoe shape and for transforming a standard shoe pattern onto an arbitrary foot
shape. Iterative design practices and just-in-time manufacturing techniques will
facilitate the development of this new technology and manufacturing methodology.
