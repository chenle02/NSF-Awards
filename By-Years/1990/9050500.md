Galveston College is improving its freshman/sophomore biology laboratories. They
are providing students with modern biological equipment that will allow them to
perform experiments which require gathering, analyzing and graphing of data. The
equipment allows the faculty to improve introductory biology courses, resulting
in increased understanding of biological principles by all students, plus a
greater retention of students in science careers. One component of the new
equipment is computers which provide for rapid and accurate data collection and
enhanced data analysis. Microcomputers make it possible for student to perform
simulation experiments of genetic, ecological, and physiological principles that
would otherwise be impossible. The college is contributing an amount equal to
the award.
