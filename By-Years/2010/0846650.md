This project will characterize gaseous nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O)
emissions from wastewater treatment plants, at the molecular mechanism and
metabolic modeling levels. Such emissions are deleterious to air quality. For
example, the greenhouse effect impact of N2O is about three hundred times that
of an equal amount of carbon dioxide. NO can directly deplete atmospheric ozone
and is rapidly converted to NO2, which is a precursor to smog. The key question
to be addressed is: What are the underlying molecular mechanisms that render one
set of biological nitrogen removal operating conditions more environmentally
sustainable than others, in terms of limiting N2O and NO emissions? The research
will be integrated into high school education in minority oriented schools in
Harlem, NY, and the PI will also mentor students from science high-schools in
New York City. Additionally, high-school science teachers will be hosted in the
PI's laboratory during the summer with follow-up guest lectures by the PI and
visits from high school students during the school year.
