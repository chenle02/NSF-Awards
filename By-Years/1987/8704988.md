The objective of this work is the convening of the llth International Congress
of Biometeorology at Purdue University, 13-18 September 1987, and publishing the
proceedings and abstracts. The Congress is held every three years.
Biometeorology attempts to describe and understand the influence of the
atmosphere and biological systems, including agricultural crops, domestic
animals and man. The Congress will almost certainly include a broad distribution
of topics.
