9400637 Dash Technical abstract: The research studies the fundamental basis of
premelting of ice and thermomolecular pressure, which cause frost heave in
frozen ground. The dynamics of the efect are studied, by polarimetry and
interference microscopy, on single crystal facets of ice, where interfacial
melting causes a thin liquid film wetting the interface. The results are
compared with theory, to investigate the orientation dependence and the
proximity effect. A second part of the program studies transport of unfrozen
liquid in monosized powders, as simple examples of porous media. Non-technical
abstract: This program studies fundamental mechanisms of frost heave. Typically,
in frozen ground, frost heave occurs as moisture is drawn toward lower
temperatures. This project investigates the basic driving pressure and the flow
of moisture, by measurements of the effect on a single crystal of ice. The
experimental results are compared with prediction based on a new, detailed
theory of frost heave. The program also includes a study of frost heave in
porous media, using specially prepared artificial powders. These powders are
more uniform than typical soils, thereby permitting a more detailed comparison
with the theory. ***
