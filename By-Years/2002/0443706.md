0443706&lt;br/&gt;Wong&lt;br/&gt;This award supports an interdisciplinary
workshop, Multimodal Bio-Medical Systems in October 2004. The goal is to
identify and highlight new computational paradigms and information
infrastructure issues to collect, process, analyze, integrate, model,
synthesize, and simulate vast amounts of heterogeneous multi-modal, multi-scale
data for emerging real-world life science applications, especially in the
domains of systems biology, biomarker and drug development, environmental and
public health. The characteristics of the data involved in these scenarios
includes: (1) large volume, (2) multiple modalities, (3) multiple biological
scale, (4) heterogeneous, (5) often distributed, and (6) requiring systems
biology and syndromic approaches. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A select group of forty
leading experts and thought leaders in the fields of biology, engineering, and
medical research will be invited to attend. In addition, two well-known
international experts in industry will give presentations and be engaged in
workshop discussions. The workshop committee will integrate and synthesize the
discussion summaries into a publishable report, including the problem statements
of the challenging and emerging multi-scale, multi-model life science
applications and suggested research directions and program establishment to the
relevant federal funding agencies. This workshop will be held in the Lister Hill
Auditorium of the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.&lt;br/&gt;
