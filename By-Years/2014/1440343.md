This is a program to develop and build a prototype in South Africa for a new
radio telescope array to measure the emission signature of neutral hydrogen from
the Epoch of Reionization, the unexplored phase in the history of the universe
when the first stars, galaxies, and quasars were formed. The project will train
undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in
instrumentation and facility development, and will foster international
scientific collaboration through a student exchange program with South Africa.
This program will host 3-4 students per summer, working on related research and
engineering problems at a rotating host institution. Other education and
outreach efforts include internships, REUs, and community college transfer
programs to radio astronomy.

The awardees will field test a new telescope design and deploy a 37-element
array at the radio-quiet Square Kilometer Array site in South Africa, using 14-m
fixed-pointing parabolic dishes which will operate between 50 to 225 MHz. The
design is driven by a recent breakthrough that allows current instruments to
remove foreground emission that would otherwise corrupt the measurements.
Exploring the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization is one of the three main
science priorities for the current decade highlighted by the Astronomy and
Astrophysics Decadal Survey (New Worlds New Horizons, 2011).
