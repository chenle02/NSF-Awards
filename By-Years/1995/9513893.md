9513893 Boyd This grant is for a program of experimental and analytical research
in nuclear astrophysics, carried out under the direction of a Ohio State
University faculty member. It will study nuclear reaction cross sections of
relevance to big-bang nucleosynthesis, search for new nuclides near the region
of proton instability (light isotopes of intermediate mass elements), and
explore components of the a capture by 12C which is important to many aspects of
the stellar evolution.. The experiments will utilize radioactive ion beam
facilities in the Michigan State University and elsewhere. A preliminary design
study of a possible new facility for neutrino aqtrophysics measurements will
also be undertaken. ***
