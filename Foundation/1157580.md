This project deals with the development of methods in proof theory, particularly
the area known as proof mining, and their application to Ramsey theory. Many
theorems in Ramsey theory can be proven using infinitary methods, in the form of
ultraproducts, nonstandard analysis, topological dynamics, and ergodic theory.
Proof mining extracts finite information from these infinite arguments. The
proposed research will apply the methods of proof mining in order to
investigate: 1) explicit bounds on numerical quantities which are not made
apparent by infinite proofs, 2) approximations of infinitary Ramsey theoretic
statements which "quantify" (typically, with a countable ordinal) how
transfinite a given construction is, and 3) new finitary analogs of infinitary
methods. Where necessary, the proposed research will also expand the repertoire
of proof mining tools by investigating how to interpret higher order notions,
particularly the topological structure of the ultrafilters, in finitary terms.

Questions in mathematics about concrete, finite properties of the integers often
turn out to have answers that make use of abstract, infinite notions. The goal
of the area of proof theory known as "proof mining" is to develop tools for
explaining this phenomenon. Often, we discover that there are finite methods
which can replace the infinite ones, at the price of making the argument much
more difficult to understand. Some of these arguments are so unwieldy that it is
difficult to imagine that they could be discovered directly. By "unwinding" the
infinite argument into finite arguments, however, we often discover new
information. For example, infinite proofs often prove that a number with some
property exists while providing no information about which number it is; the
corresponding finite argument, however, typically gives an upper bound on the
size of that number.
