This proposal requests funding for 50% of the cost of purchasing a computer
graphics system for research in geochemistry at Yale University. The research
applications include quantum mechanical studies of silicates, Monte Carlo
simulations of crystal growth and dissolution phenomena, and modeling of the
flow and chemical reactivity of natural fluids during metamorphic and
hydrothermal geological processes.
