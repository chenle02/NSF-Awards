This research, supported in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program, uses
high temperature Knudsen cell techniques coupled with mass spectrometric
measurements to characterize the vapor pressure of refractory transition metal
carbides and nitrides as a function of temperature. These data are then used to
characterize enthalpies of formation, thermodynamic functions and bond energies
of these species. Similar measurements will be made for small metal clusters and
selected diatomic metal species. The data obtained in these studies are
important for the understanding of chemical bonding, for optimizing existing and
proposed processes and for checking the results of ab-initio quantum mechanics
calculations.
