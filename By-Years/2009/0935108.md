This engineering education research award to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
will employ researchers to understand the factors that facilitate or inhibit
domestic student enrollment in engineering Ph.D. programs, and to identify
strategies for reinforcing positive factors or removing barriers. The
overarching goal of the project is to identify actionable strategies to increase
domestic student enrollments. Specifically, this study will address why the
percentage of domestic students pursuing a PhD in engineering has steadily
declined, what factors inhibit domestic undergraduates from enrolling in PhD
programs, and what changes would make PhD programs more attractive to domestic
students. In order to attract more domestic students, universities need an
empirical understanding of the factors that underlie the decision to pursue or
forego an engineering PhD. This new understanding can form the basis for a new
set of strategies for increasing domestic engineering PhD enrollments and
graduates needed by universities and industry.
