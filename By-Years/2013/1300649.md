The research objective of this award is to use computational models at different
length scales to develop an understanding of how changes to the proteins that
form the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) of the kidney alter the mechanical
properties of the basement membrane as a whole. The GBM is the major structural
layer of the filtration apparatus of the kidney, so its ability to withstand
high pressures and allow blood plasma to pass through it is necessary for proper
kidney function. A series of models from the molecular to the tissue scale will
be constructed and linked together. The stiffness and strength of the tissue
will be estimated based on the protein properties, as will the permeability of
the tissue (i.e., its tendency to permit filtration flow through it). Finally,
changes in the properties of the tissue, coupled with the known demand for
filtration, will be used to model dynamic changes in the GBM in response to
changes in load or protein properties.&lt;br/&gt;If successful, these studies
will help explain how the kidney, which filters 40-50 gallons of blood every
day, performs in healthy conditions and suffers decreased performance in
disease. The new understanding may help drive treatments for patients with
genetic diseases that affect the kidney (e.g., Alport syndrome) and also for
patients with kidney disease arising from other sources, such as diabetes. The
project also involves training of a Ph.D. student in biomedical engineering and
an outreach program for students interested in STEM at the College of the
Menominee Nation, which will contribute to the strength and diversity of our
high-tech workforce.
