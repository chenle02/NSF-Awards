This research project, directed by PI Gary Holton, is the US portion of a larger
international collaboration that was conceived under the European Science
Foundation's EUROCORES Programme, EuroBABEL. The full EuroBABEL project is a
collaboration of researchers from three countries, including the US, the
Netherlands and the United Kingdom. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular
project focuses on the linguistic prehistory of the non-Austronesian languages
the of Alor-Pantar archipelago of southeastern Indonesia. The Alor-Pantar
languages represent one of only two groups of non-Austronesian languages in
Indonesia outside of the island of New Guinea; the remaining languages of
Indonesia belong to the Austronesian family. A comparison of pronouns suggests a
genetic relationship between the Alor-Pantar languages and New Guinea languages
located some 1000 km distant. Until very recently the 15-20 Alor-Pantar
languages have remained among the least well-documented languages of Indonesia,
but a surge in field work efforts over the past decade has resulted in a wealth
of new language data. This project will bring new and recently-collected data to
bear on the question of the linguistic origins and ultimate genetic
relationships of the Alor-Pantar languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major
component of the analysis will be the reconstruction of the ancestral Proto
Alor-Pantar language using the comparative method. To accomplish this the
project will work closely with ESF partners to assemble recently-collected
lexical and grammatical documentation and will supplement these with surveys of
still-undocumented Alor-Pantar languages. These data will be used to infer sound
changes which have occurred in the history of the languages. Evidence from sound
changes will in turn allow the researchers to establish genetic subgroups and to
evaluate potential genetic relationships with the languages of New
Guinea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An additional component of the analysis is the
study of placenames, which represent one of the most highly endangered and least
documented domain of linguistic knowledge in the Alor-Pantar languages. The
structure and distribution of placenames provide insight into prehistory, often
reflecting pre-historic settlement patterns. Placenames also provide indirect
evidence of non-linguistic history, including past climate changes, since naming
practices reflect human interaction with the environment at a fixed point in
time. The GIS (geographic information systems) database compiled by this project
will facilitate future inter-disciplinary investigations of population
migrations and environmental changes and their relationships to language change.
