Six work stations (4 students/station) are used in a problem- oriented
laboratory experience which provides a realistic exposure to biology for
students who will pursue other disciplines; and establishes a solid conceptual
and technical foundation for those students who will continue in the biology
major. At the core of the approach are several simple goals: to remove the aura
of mystery surrounding science and help students experience the process first
hand; to demonstrate how concepts and techniques from diverse disciplines can be
combined effectively to address a problem; and to teach students to think
critically and communicate effectively. The equipment is also used in several
other courses in the department and enhances the quality of the senior research
experience required of all biology majors.
