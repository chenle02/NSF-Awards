This award funds U.S. participation in a joint U.S.-European research planning
workshop on invariants in computer vision. The meeting will be held in the
Spring of 1993, at a site to be determined. Invariant theory has fueled
substantial advances in object recognition, a central problem in computer
vision. There are active research programs studying applications of invariant
theory to computer vision, both tn the United States and in the European
Community. The workshop will include research presentations and discussion
sessions intended to identify important problems and opportunities for research
progress. The meeting should facilitate coordination and communication among the
research groups, and is expected to produce a publication in book form,
containing both research and tutorial material on the topic.
