The PI will organize a Gordon Research Conference on Protein Folding Dynamics to
be held on January 11-16, 2004, at the Four Points Sheraton, Harbortown,
Ventura, California. A quantitative description of Biology is rapidly emerging
as a major new frontier for science in the 21st century. This field involves the
cross-fertilization of ideas and methods from biology and biochemistry on the
one hand and the physics of complex systems on the other. Protein Folding
represents the premier case where this approach is becoming successful and is
becoming an example for other fields in biology. The theoretical and
experimental collaboration needed for the success of this field has been
established, and this Gordon Conference on Protein Folding Dynamics is becoming
the main forum for discussion of these interactions. This second Gordon
conference will provide an excellent forum for an exchange of ideas from
scientists with different backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is
supported by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and
Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Division
of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences
Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
