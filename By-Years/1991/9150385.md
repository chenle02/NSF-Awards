Oberlin College is developing two laboratory-based introductory courses for the
computer science major. The courses generally follow the outline suggested by
the ACM Curricular Committee on Computer Science, but give more emphasis to
algorithms and conceptual development of the introductory material. The
Laboratory sections are used to make the courses more realistic introductions to
the broad range of topics covered in computer science, and to speed up and
enhance the students' learning of some technical matters that require hands-on
experience. The objective is to make the courses more interesting, more useful,
and more accurate reflections of the field, and to have a positive effect on the
number of women and minorities majoring in computer science.
