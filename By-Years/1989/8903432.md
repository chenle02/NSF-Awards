This proposal outlined a joint Cornell-Brown Universities research project to
determine the diffusion properties of minerals in rocks at high pressures (up to
100 kbar) and temperatures (up to 1200oC). The objectives are to assess the
degree to which chemical and isotopic equilibrium are attained during mantle and
lower crustal processes; and to extend the capabilities of diamond anvil cells
to permit moderate duration experiments under controlled temperature and
pressure. Models will be developed in order to predict diffusion kinetics in
various minerals at high temperature and pressures. Other applications will to
models of mantle mineralogy and chemistry; basalt genesis; mantle chemical
transport; and very high grade metamorphism and melting in deep crustal regions.
