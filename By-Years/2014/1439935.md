Research Objectives and Approaches: The objective of this research is to improve
power density in&lt;br/&gt;power electronics, while lowering the economic
hurdles keeping students from participating in this&lt;br/&gt;field. The
approach is to make efficient switching power converters with frequencies at
least ten times&lt;br/&gt;higher than conventional designs with no magnetic
materials and small-valued capacitors. Resulting&lt;br/&gt;designs will have all
passive components embedded in an inexpensive circuit
board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Recent advances in power density
have been mostly due to improved semiconductors&lt;br/&gt;that switch faster but
these advances are reaching a plateau when used in conventional
circuit&lt;br/&gt;designs. This is due to frequency-dependent losses in
semiconductors and in energy storage devices.&lt;br/&gt;This research looks to
implement a value-added strategy using inexpensive printed circuit boards
by&lt;br/&gt;fabricating all passive devices with conductive traces,
transforming the printed circuit board into a&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional
resonant structure. This will eliminate post-fabrication tuning and component
variation&lt;br/&gt;while maintaining extraordinary levels of performance at
reduced cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: To enhance outreach,
educational modules on resonant power converters tied to the&lt;br/&gt;research
outcomes will engage students and increase access to this developing field. This
coursework is&lt;br/&gt;rarely available to students, specially Hispanic, who
will be a particular focus of the proposed outreach.&lt;br/&gt;The program will
follow the approach of: dramatically enhance the power electronics curriculum at
the&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan, employ educational outreach to encourage
Hispanic students to learn power&lt;br/&gt;electronics, and use low-cost
technologies to make the design and fabrication of resonant
converters&lt;br/&gt;available to a wider public.
