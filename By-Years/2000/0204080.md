DMS-0204080&lt;br/&gt;Po Hu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the
investigator intends to consider a &lt;br/&gt;circle of ideas in algebraic
topology and its interactions &lt;br/&gt;with other areas of mathematics. One
point of entry to &lt;br/&gt;these ideas is Real-oriented homotopy theory, which
uses &lt;br/&gt;the complex conjugation action on the complex cobordism
&lt;br/&gt;spectrum to approach homotopy groups of spheres. The method
&lt;br/&gt;used here is a case of descent, which appears also in
&lt;br/&gt;Voevodsky's homotopy theory of algebraic varieties. In this
&lt;br/&gt;direction, the investigator is interested in algebraic
&lt;br/&gt;cobordism, the algebro-geometric analogue of complex
&lt;br/&gt;cobordism. Another closely related idea is that of Verdier
&lt;br/&gt;and Grothendieck dualities, both in algebraic geometry and
&lt;br/&gt;in equivariant homotopy theory. Yet another related but
&lt;br/&gt;different kind of duality is Koszul duality. Using this
&lt;br/&gt;duality, the investigator, jointly with collaborators,
&lt;br/&gt;proved a version of Kontsevich's conjecture on Hochschild
&lt;br/&gt;cohomology of k-algebras. This in turn is related to the
&lt;br/&gt;question of deformation quantazation in mathematcial
&lt;br/&gt;physics. Another area into which Koszul duality enters is
&lt;br/&gt;the string topology of Chas and Sullivan, which gives
&lt;br/&gt;another connection between algebra and homotopy theory.
&lt;br/&gt;The investigator is also involved with another project
&lt;br/&gt;related to physics, namely constructing geometric models
&lt;br/&gt;of elliptic cohomology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology is the study of
spaces that can be deformed&lt;br/&gt;continuously. In part, this proposal seeks
to better &lt;br/&gt;understand maps between such objects by ``stable''
&lt;br/&gt;methods, i. e. considering a sequence of objects of &lt;br/&gt;all
higher dimensions at once, and by using certain &lt;br/&gt;summetries upon them.
Similar methods can also be used &lt;br/&gt;to study more rigid geometric
objects, for example in &lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry the solution sets of
systems of &lt;br/&gt;algebraic equations. This leads in turn to the
&lt;br/&gt;study of algebraic structures on an abstract
level.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, the related idea of string topology considers
&lt;br/&gt;not just a space itself, but structures on the space
&lt;br/&gt;consisting of loops in it. In particular, this is
&lt;br/&gt;important to string theory in physics, which sees &lt;br/&gt;the
universe as composed not of point-like particles &lt;br/&gt;but of loop-like
``strings''.&lt;br/&gt;
