9423739 Foley This is an award for a planning workshop to be held on October
31, 1994 in Washington, DC with emphasis on the characterization of
viewer/browsers for the World Wide Web (WWW) to support research and
dissemination of research results. Topics covered in the workshop will include,
but not be limited to, those aspects of Mosaic and Mosaic-like interfaces to the
WWW that would best support their use by government agencies in general, and NSF
in particular, as a means of information dissemination in the spirit of the
National Information Infrastructure. Representatives of different segments of
the information, robotics, and intelligent systems research community attend
this workshop. A report of the proceedings of the workshop is to be produced.
