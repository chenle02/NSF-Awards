&lt;br/&gt; Computer instrumentation of living environments promises to extend
the independent life span of our aging populations. This technological potential
will not be realized unless people are willing to trust their lives to such
support systems, as a replacement for human support. Very little is known about
how and why people make these important decisions. The proposed research will
study this issue using a widely adopted, computer-dependent life-saving device,
the Implantable Cardiac Device (ICD). This research will provide a foundation
for understanding how and why people agree to place their life in the hands of
computerized equipment that they cannot fully understand or control. The study
will design and validate instruments for gathering data on this decision. The
study will use in-depth interviews, and survey methods, and will gather data
from persons who have accepted or refused implantable defibrillators. Phase I,
will be an interview study, working through cardiologists, to reach their
patients. Phase II will develop, an extensible Web-based survey that can be
readily adapted to other patient populations and other technologies. Both
graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research plan. In
addition, there are a number of broader impacts. First, this research will
enhance our understanding of the key factors in the decision to entrust one?s
life to a complex computer whose workings are not understood. It will also add
to the meager collection of instruments for collecting this kind of data.
Second, the information gained about the decision to accept implant will be new,
and can serve as a guide in the design of patient information material. Third,
the information will guide the design of patient information for ?pervasive
computing home environments? and will therefore be useful to scientists and
engineers as they consider what will be the most useful features of any proposed
design.&lt;br/&gt;
