EAGER: Marrying Kinesthetic Tools and Cyberinfrastructure to Education Research
in Large Populations of Middle School Science Students &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCI
1152814&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the effort is to determine how QR code
technology embedded on a tangible kinesthetic tool, a so-called "combined tool",
can be productively used to help people learn both individually and
collectively. The role of this technology in science education is largely
unexplored, although the values of kinesthetic learning and technology-mediated
instruction are recognized. The target population is middle school science
students. The tool focuses on the study of earth science concepts including
plate tectonics. The combined tool will be assessed in multiple settings
including K-12 classrooms, museums, home-school environments, and in special-
needs groups. The project involves university faculty, undergraduates, teachers
and other educators, and students with roles in tool development, both tangible
and cyberinfrastructure and assessment.
