The proposed project seeks financial support to students and young researchers
to attend the 13th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology that will be
held in Beijing, China, August 5 - 8, 2013. The budget will be used to support
US student (undergraduate and graduate) participants and presenters. The
conference will bring together researchers and educators focused on developing
nanotechnologies and applying these technologies to space, electronic, magnetic,
sensor, and photonic devices and systems. The requested support will be used to
provide partial travel stipends for student participants at the conference,
specifically student presenters in an organized session in the form of
registration fees.
