9360318 Vaiman The Generalized Transient Energy Function Method for Power
Systems can be used when network topology is changing. This Project is intended
to develop methods for selection of optimal actions for Contingency Arming
Schemes on an analytical basis instead of "cut and try" or sensitivity methods.
We propose to develop theory, algorithms and programs for non linear models of
Power Systems. These algorithms permit to choose actions for Contingency Arming
Schemes using the Generalized Transient Energy Function Method. Utilities will
benefit by: increase of power system reliability; decrease of electrical energy
underproduction during fault and post fault regimes; selection of control
actions depending on disturbance strength in order to guarantee the transient
stability and the necessary transient performance ***
