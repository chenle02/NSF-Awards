9420853 ABSTRACT This proposal seeks to use experiment and modeling of transient
flow instabilities in fully condensing two-parallel-tube heat transfer systems
as a first step in understanding these instabilities in more complex systems.
Existing experimental equipment will be used to measure these instabilities, and
a model based on the behavior of a single equivalent tube will be used to
correlate the behavior of the two-tube system. The work seeks to provide insight
into the complex behavior of unstable flow systems, and may have important
applications in large-scale equipment such as power plant and chemical process
industry condensers where such behavior occurs.
