Abstract

Award: DMS-0072534 Principal Investigator: Carolyn S. Gordon

Inverse spectral geometry is the study of the extent to which the geometry of a
surface or, more generally, of a Riemannian manifold can be extracted from
spectral data. The primary spectral data associated to a compact Riemannian
manifold are the eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. The investigators
propose to apply recently developed methods to study the extent to which the
eigenvalue spectrum determines the local geometry of a compact Riemannian
manifold. They will also ask the extent to which additional spectral data such
as the spectrum of the Laplacian acting on differential forms of various degrees
determines the geometry of the manifold. Inverse spectral problems will be
considered on Riemannian orbifolds as well as on manifolds; orbifolds are the
most tractable singular spaces. For the Schrodinger operator "Laplacian plus
potential", the problem of recovering the potential from spectral data will be
studied in the case of line bundles over tori. In analogy to the case of planar
domains, the lowest eigenvalue of the Laplacian on a compact Riemannian manifold
may be viewed as the fundamental tone. The question of whether random Riemann
surfaces have large first eigenvalue will be studied using connections between
spectra of Riemann surfaces and spectra of graphs. For noncompact Riemannian
manifolds, the primary spectral data are the scattering poles; the investigators
expect to exhibit continuous families of isopolar metrics.

In spectroscopy, one attempts to recover the chemical composition or the shape
of an object from the characteristic frequencies of light or sound emitted. In
the case of a vibrating membrane such as a drumhead, viewed mathematically as a
bounded region in the plane, the spectrum of characteristic frequencies
corresponds to the mathematical notion of the Laplace spectrum. The Laplace
spectrum is also defined for other geometric objects called manifolds which
arise in mathematics and physics. The investigators, along with Scott Wolpert,
earlier constructed the first examples of differently shaped drumheads (planar
regions) with the same spectrum. Planar regions can differ in their global shape
but locally are identical; i.e., if you look at a small piece cut out from one
of the regions, you can not tell which region it came from. Recently, the
principal investigator developed methods for constructing geometric objects with
the same Laplace spectrum but which differ in their local as well as global
shape. These methods will be used to investigate which local geometric
properties of manifolds are not spectrally determined. Additional spectral
problems will also be considered such as the construction of surfaces of
arbitrarily large volume but having bounded fundamental tone.
