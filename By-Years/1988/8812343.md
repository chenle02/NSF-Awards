The aim of the research is to develop a new method for minimizing the loss of
the expensive affinity ligands used in aqueous two-phase partition processes for
bioseparation and biopurification. The specific study is on the purification of
a protein in an aqueous two-phase system consisting of dextran, a high
molecular-weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) with attached ligand, and a
sacrificial low molecular-weight PEG which is more compatible with dextran so it
minimizes the loss of the ligated PEG into the dextran phase. Loss of ligands is
a major impediment to the commercialization of the aqueous two-phase
partitioning process for bioseparation and biopurification. Success of the
research could accelerate the commercialization of the partition process.
