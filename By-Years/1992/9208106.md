This Science in Developing Countries award will support a regional research
workshop in the area of applied and computational mathematics. The workshop has
been organized by Professor Jose Castillo of San Diego State University together
with Professor Luis Leon of the Universidad Central de Venezuela. The purpose of
the workshop is to bring together practicing applied and computational
mathematicians in the Americas to exchange information, foster cooperation, and
promote the development of applied mathematics, especially in Latin America. It
is expected that the workshop will also lead to the establishment of applied
mathematics societies in Venezuela and in other Latin American countries. By
helping to bring together applied mathematicians to discuss a topic of
increasing importance in the region, this award fulfills the objectives of the
Science in Developing Countries Program.
