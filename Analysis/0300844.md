Abstract

This project is to study various applications of the Riemann-Hilbert problem
method. These applications include the perturbation theory of nonlinear
Schroedinger equations and several newly developed areas in connection with the
theory of random matrices. A book project on Riemann-Hilbert problems is also
included.

Riemann-Hilbert problems have been found in several important areas in
mathematics in recent years. Some afore mentioned applications also have
interdisciplinary impact. For example, the main application of the theory of
random matrices is in physics and the study of certain perturbed differential
equations enhances the understanding of signal transmissions in fibre optics.
