The Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico will plan a program of broad public
involvement in education about the Trust's ecological and anthropological
research and land management activities at the Hacienda La Esperanza Nature
Reserve. The planning activity will bring together internal and external teams
of scientists, informal science education program developers, citizen science
practitioners and citizens. With strong visitor studies input, the teams will
plan and test approaches to interpreting the natural and cultural history of
Puerto Rico's premier nature reserve. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
