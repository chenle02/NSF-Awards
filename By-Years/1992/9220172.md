The PI conduct simple shear deformation experiments using a gas-medium
deformation apparatus to investigate the mechanisms of structural evolution and
the resultant anisotropy in physical properties (seismic wave velocities, creep
strength and melt permeability) in deformed polycrystalline aggregates of
olivine and olivine plus basaltic melt. Simple shear deformation is critical,
because some key informations such as the controlling factors of anisotropic
microstructures can only be distinguished in a rotational deformation mode such
as simple shear. The results of these studies have important applications in (i)
interpretation of anisotropic structures in ultramafic rocks and hence the
rheology of the upper mantle, (ii) interpretation of seismic anisotropy in terms
of modes of mantle convection, (iii) modelling shear localization in the upper
mantle, (iv) modelling melt migration beneath mid-ocean ridges.
