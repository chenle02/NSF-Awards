This Communications Laboratory improvement project upgrades current facilities
by incorporating real-time simulation of communications systems and networks.
The real-time end to end simulation capability provides students with the
hardware and software tools necessary to support subsystem level design (e.g.,
channel equalization digital filters); additionally, system performance
evaluation (e g., bit error rate measurement) may be accomplished via a protocol
analyzer in conjunction with workstation interaction. The simulation capability
allows evaluation of designs at baseband and RF/IF frequencies. Complete student
team projects include data generation (e.g., source coding), transmission
modulation selection/channel coding, and demodulation. Students gain the
theoretical knowledge and hands-on laboratory experience to enter the technology
work force in the communications industry as a systems engineer and/or a network
analyst.
