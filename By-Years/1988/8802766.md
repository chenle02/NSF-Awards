The long term objective of this research is to understand the mechanisms
underlying cortical plasticity in adult animals. The project will examine the
details of reorganization of the forepaw representation in primary somatosensory
(SI) cortex of cats using somatic stimulation and extracellular recording
techniques. It will provide a quantitative description of receptive fields of
the forepaw representation of SI cortex in terms of postsynaptic potentials
using the intracellular recording technique and mechanical stimulation.
Subthreshold changes in the receptive field organization of SI neurons following
reversible and irreversible deafferentation along with the morphology of
physiologically identified SI neurons in normal and reorganized cortex following
intracellular injection of HRP will be studied. The results from this project
will be of importance in refining models of neocortical plasticity in adult
animals.
