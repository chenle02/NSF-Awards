EAR-0202996&lt;br/&gt;Catherine Constable&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs propose
to hold a community workshop at Scripps Institute of Oceanography to develop a
consensus plan for modern paleo, rock and geomagnetic databases. As discussed in
detail in the proposal, the conference is being held to bring together an
interdisciplinary group of experts to discuss how to bring technological
advances in IT to develop web-based handling for magnetic data. The community
will be considering how to integrate with other developing IT database
activities in the geosciences, including the international community. Funds will
be used to cover travel and accommodations of key participants from the
different sub-disciplines involved in magnetism research. It is expected that a
broad and interdisciplinary cross-section of researchers from academia,
government labs, and the broad international community will participate in the
conference.
