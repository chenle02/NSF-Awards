This Presidential Young Investigator will focus her research on a number of
outstanding statistical problems in medicine and biology. Specific areas of
research will be the design and analysis of sequential experiments and
quantitative human genetics. The research will help narrow the gaps between
theory and practice in these areas by developing increasingly functional
statistical models. A major feature of the research is the commingling of
advanced computational methodology and classical statistics. This award will
help Hardwick strengthen existing relationships with scientists outside the
field of statistics and help build new relationships.
