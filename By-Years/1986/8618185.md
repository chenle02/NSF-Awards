This three-year research program aims to better understand the thunderstorm
electrification processes. The project will examine the types of lightning
discharges, their evolution and their relationships to precipitation echos in
thunderstorms. The main sources of data come from two field programs: one
conducted near the Kennedy Space Center in Florida during 1976-78 and the other
near the Langmuir Laboratory in New Mexico in 1984. Thunderstorms play an
important role in the global electrical circuit; however, our knowledge of the
thunderstorm electrification is rather limited. This research will provide much
needed information on the electrical structure of thunderstorms.
