This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Understanding
how the TAR binding protein (TDP43) regulates alternative splicing of messenger
RNA." Alternative splicing during mRNA processing greatly contributes to
generate the protein diversity necessary for development and function of complex
organisms. TDP43 regulates exon inclusion of the CFTR gene presumably through
inteaction with nuclear proteins and specific sequences of nucleic acid. This
research investigates the molecular determinants and importance of TDP43 protein
complex formation and nucleic acid binding.
