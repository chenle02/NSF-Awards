9301788 Berman We propose to design and develop a tool for visualizing,
displaying and optimizing the data and function partitioning of large programs
coded in parallel languages with explicit decomposition constructs. This tool
will assist in ensuring that the decomposition of processes and data will
promote the most efficient use of parallelism for a given program and target
multicomputer. Coordinated with this tool will be a parallel debugger
(Panorama), which is built on the resident debugger of a commercial
multicomputer, and which will provide a number of program views that will
illuminate data movement and message traffic from the program execution.
