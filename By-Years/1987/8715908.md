This renewal project is concerned with two areas of importance for increasing
the impact of biological processes on production of specialty chemicals: use of
non-aqueous solvents for enzyme catalyzed reactions and development of novel
separations processes based on aqueous two-phase systems. The first aspect will
focus on enzyme reactions in supercritical solvents: In the previous grant
period, the stability of enzymes, both free and immobilized in dense carbon
dioxide, has been demonstrated, and kinetic data have been obtained for the
oxidation of cholesterol and the interesterification of triacylglycerides. This
research expands the possible range of substrate concentrations which can be
used with supercritical carbon dioxide by exploring its use with entrainers; it
also provides a more detailed study of the kinetic and mass transfer effects of
importance for both enzymes studied. In addition, the conformation of enzymes in
this non-aqueous medium is examined by the use of EPR spectroscopy. A nitroxide
spin-labelled cholesterol probe is employed to monitor the spatial coordinates
at the active site of cholesterol oxidase. The second aspect will focus on
aqueous two-phase systems for product recovery: This research is directed toward
establishing the fundamental molecular thermodynamics of aqueous two-phase
systems. An important objective is to determine what polymer-polymer systems may
be best suited for bioprocessing. Toward that end, the PIs continue their
measurements using light scattering and differential vapor pressure to obtain
thermodynamic parameters for aqueous mixtures containing dextran,
polyethyleneglycol, proteins and combinations of polymer-polymer and polymer
protein pairs. These data, combined with information on electrical-potential
effects due to salt partitioning and a molecular-thermodynamic model based upon
the osmotic virial equation, allow the PI's to predict polymer-polymer-water
phase diagrams and protein partition coefficients for process design and
optimization.
