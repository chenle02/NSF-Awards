Ethernet local area network (LAN) hardware is being acquired to connect three
68010-based multimicroprocessor microcomputers so that they may be used for
research in distributed operating systems (DOS's), local area network
communications, and computer architecture. These powerful third generation
workstations replace a set of three fully connected, earlier-model, 6809-based
workstations which no longer meet research needs. The resulting three-
workstation local area network primarily serves as a testbed for distributed
operating system research, especially in the area of kernel and system process
design. The network also serves to a lesser extent as a testbed to verify
simulation results on the traffic patterns within a modularly constructed node
of a large communications network, and to concurrently emulate several dataflow
architecture submachines in order to determine intersubmachine communication
requirements.
