Abstract - 9711304 Brisson, John G. The principal investigator proposes to
develop a cold-cycle dilution refrigerator (CCDR) for cooling below 100 mK.
Conventional dilution refrigerators dilute 3He into 4He at a low temperature to
achieve sub-Kelvin cooling. An inefficiency of this process is related to the
circulating of the 3He component from 0.6 K to room temperature and back again.
In the proposed design, the compressor distills and pumps the 3He component of
the mexture at 0.25 K (rather than at 300 K in conventional dilution
refrigerators) and directly returns the 3He component to the mixing chamber. The
compressor will be maintained at 0.25 K using a superfluid Stirling
refrigerator. The project will also involve the development of low-loss, low-
temperature compressor valves. The resulting CCDR will have improved efficiency,
small size and cost.
