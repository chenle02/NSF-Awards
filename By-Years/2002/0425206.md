Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, lasers have been show to offer
substantial improvements over conventional techniques for precision material
processing and manufacturing because lasers provide clean finish, high
repeatability, fast setup, and minimal lateral damage. However, laser processing
and manufacturing have a significant disadvantage of low efficiency. For laser
material processing, the first and foremost step is to couple laser energy into
the target materials. The energy coupling efficiency depends on the properties
of both the lasers and materials. In this proposal, we show that material
transport properties may be modified under certain experimental conditions when
electrons in the materials are excited to a nonequilibrium distribution. This
will potentially enhance the energy coupling efficiency for laser material
processing. Experimental studies are planned to explore these transport property
changes using ultrafast femtosecond laser techniques. This study aims at
improving the efficiency of laser energy absorption from a fundamental approach.
Students involved in this project will be trained in a broad research area
covering both optical and material sciences. &lt;br/&gt; This research is being
supported by the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program of the
Division of Chemical and Transport Systems.&lt;br/&gt;
