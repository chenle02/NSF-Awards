This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in materials theory
involves Paul Goldbart of the University of Illinois and Avraham Halperin of the
Institute for Surface Chemistry of the French National Center for Scientific
Research in Mulhouse, France. The award provides travel support and living
expenses for Dr. Goldbart. The objective of the research is to develop a
comprehensive theory of systems containing flexible linear macromolecules into
which amphiphilic monomers have been covalently incorporated. This combination
leads to a new class of materials, known as polysoaps. The project takes
advantage of French expertise in materials theory. The materials under study are
central in oil recovery and paper-coating.
