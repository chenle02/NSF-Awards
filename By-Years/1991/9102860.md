This award addresses the problem of reconstructing a three- dimensional object
from a set of planar contours (cross- sections). This is an important problem in
many research areas. For example, biologists, medical clinicians, and quality
control inspectors all try to understand the shape of objects, based on serial
sections. There are two basic approaches to the problem: volume-based and
surface-based reconstruction. If the spacing between the sections is relatively
small, then the volume-based approach is preferred and the intermediate contours
may not be necessary. However, when the spacing between sections is large, a
surface-based approach is necessary. This research will continue the Principal
Investigator's investigations into reconstruction surfaces from sparsely-spaced
planar contours, using a surface-based approach and comparing it with volume-
based approaches. The algorithms and methods developed should be useful in both
scientific and industrial applications.
