This research planning project will develop a plan to study the conditions
under which women have been able to obtain positions of leadership in labor
unions. The planning project will allow the investigator to explore the
feasibility of using a previously untapped source of data for this purpose,
namely the LM-2 reports filed with Department of Labor by American Unions each
year since 1960. She will begin the process of coding the data and converting
them into machine readable form and decide which unions to choose for her
sample. This project will result in a research proposal that will examine the
historical conditions which account for why unions develop one or another
strategy regarding the representation of women in the union leadership.
