Intellectual Merits: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in Nanotechnologies have
enabled researchers to explore many new material systems and device structures
in nanoscale and in reduced dimensions. Lithography for micro- and
nanofabrication is of utmost importance for exploiting such structures as well
as their new applications. In this GOALI program we will develop new materials
and patterning techniques related to imprinting-based nanolithography. We will
investigate a number of important scientific issues involved in this new
technology that have not been adequately addressed, to develop new materials and
methodologies to further expand the scope of its applicability to different
types of substrates and applications, and to develop simplified processes that
will make this technology accessible to wide range of researchers in different
disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
GOALI program will provide students with valuable experience from industrial
collaboration and from participation in interdisciplinary researches. The
project will also provide research opportunities for undergraduates, woman, and
summer high school students. New development from this program will be
disseminated in a timely manner through scientific conferences and journal
publications, and will be incorporated into a graduate course on micro- and
nanotechnology. By providing a truly simple, low-cost and high-throughput
nanolithography technique to the scientific community, it will not only help to
rapidly proliferate the knowledge on these new development, but also through the
interaction with researchers from other fields we will be able to identify many
new important applications that can be enabled by these
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
