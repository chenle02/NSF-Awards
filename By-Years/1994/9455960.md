9455960 Clemens The University of Utah proposes to explore a model for
undergraduate mathematics education which brings teacher/researchers into
partnerships with teams of "users" of mathematics, both within and outside the
university, with the goal of increasing mathematical power and an understanding
of the relevance of mathematics of students in a wide spectrum of disciplines
and professional careers. Building on modern research on student learning,
opportunities created by our university's reform of its liberal education
curriculum, and a new determination to reach out to other disciplines, the
university proposes to create nine cross-disciplinary teams. Each will be
charged with developing and team teaching an undergraduate mathematics course,
or modifying an existing course by the creation of modules or special units.
These courses would develop a mathematical theme through problems from the
discipline of the "outside" members of the team, from the other sciences,
engineering, economics or business. Curricula and teaching styles in these
courses will be influenced by exposure of the teams to "hands-on" experiences,
the use of small group work, and problem oriented learning.
