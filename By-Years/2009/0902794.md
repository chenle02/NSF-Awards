Funding is provided to develop replicated, multi-century tree-ring width and
intra-to-inter annual oxygen isotopic proxy records of precipitation in North
Queensland, Australia from plantation tree samples and long lived wild specimens
of Callitris intratropica and Araucaria cunninghamii. The overarching scientific
goal of the project is to develop a reliable archive of climate data from
tropical tress for which classic annual growth bands are not formed. The region
of study is strongly affected by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity,
as well as longer term droughts with great impact on agriculture and water
resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve strong international
collaboration, supporting a graduate student and post-doctoral scholar, and
bringing a different quantitative perspective to the analysis of paleoclimate
data.
