Advanced processing techniques are employed to create niobium composites that
display high strength and oxidation resistance. The research is unique in its
use of mechanical alloying to develop a large volume fraction of finely
dispersed second phase particles on a nanometer scale. The ultimate objective is
to improve understanding of structures that are stable at elevated temperatures
and display high creep strength and oxidation resistance. Properties under
investigation include high temperature creep, low temperature fracture and
oxidation.
