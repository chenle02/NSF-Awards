A new research program in theoretical gravitational physics, under the direction
of Prof. Jorge Pullin will be initiated under the CAREER program. Prof. Pullin
will undertake theoretical and numerical studies in problems dealing with the
General Theory of Relativity at a classical and quantum mechanical level. The
major focuses of the program include: 1) The development of codes for the
evolution of spherically symmetric fields applied in conjunction with
perturbation theory to the study of critical behavior of gravitational collapse
and the problem of the collision of two black holes. 2) The development of the
loop representation for quantum general relativity emphasizing the use of
extended loops, which have potential to solve several technical difficulties of
the traditional loop approach and to add insight into the classical canonical
theory underlying the loop representation. This project also includes a series
of activities in education including uses of computers, recruitment of
minorities and a book destined to graduate students.
