This award supports research in Elementary Particle Physics by Dr. Marjorie
Shapiro, a Presidential Young Investigator. Dr. Shapiro is working with the
Collider Detector Facility (CDF), one of the foremost US experiment in High
Energy in progress at Fermilab's Tevatron. She is a major contributor to the
data analysis programs for the experiment. Her research will focus on the study
of high invariant-mass quark and gluon scattering, with the hope of being able
to use jets as a tool in the search for new particles.
