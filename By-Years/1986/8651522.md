This project will provide 120 elementary and 100 middle school teachers with
four weeks of concentrated science course work and science methods instruction
during the summer of 1987. The emphasis at the elementary school level will be
to build teacher confidence and content knowledge in the following science
areas: Botany, Earth Science, and Physics-- heat and pressure physics, and sound
waves and simple harmonics. The emphasis at the middle school level will be to
introduce a variety of student-oriented teaching strategies to be used with
typical middle level curricula covering the content areas of Earth and Space
Science, Chemical Concepts, Physical Concepts, and Life Science. All teachers
will also be involved in four follow-up sessions during the 1987-88 Academic
Year. During the four-week experience, teachers will attend content
presentations in the morning followed by a directly-related methods presentation
in the afternoon. In addition to mastering the content, each teacher will be
expected to develop a lesson plan each day to be used upon his/her return to the
classroom.
