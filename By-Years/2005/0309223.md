Ecologists have long debated whether plant communities consist of interdependent
and interacting species, or of individual, co-occurring species that are adapted
to similar abiotic conditions. The proposed research addresses this question
with respect to Pinus albicaulis, a rapidly declining keystone species of
forests in the northern Rocky Mountains and North Cascade Ranges. Preliminary
results show that understory plant species interact positively or negatively
with P. albicaulis, and that these interactions may be mediated by soil
conditions which are influenced both by fire and by plant species. The
experiments proposed focus on determining the mechanisms responsible for
facilitation of P. albicaulis in harsh subalpine conditions. Results will
further scientific understanding of the mechanisms affecting plant community
structure and will assist efforts to restore this keystone species.
