9703842 Friedman The proposed research will concentrate on the development of
new analytic methods for solving free boundary problems. The first class of such
problems are the Navier-Stokes equations used to model coating flow. The second
topic will be Stefan type problems where the free boundary has very large
oscillations and this involve homogenization and boundary layers; such models
arise, for example, in chemical vapor deposition. Next topic will be the
propagation of a crack in elastic material, where the free boundary moves, with
time, into the region. Other areas of research will involve nonlinear systems of
elliptic variational inequalities and motion of particles in fluid. The problems
to be studied arise in mathematical modeling of industrial processes and design.
They include the coating of photographic film, the design of magnetic heads for
improved sound transmission, processing of semiconductors, rheological
properties of immersions, and the analysis of cracks in metals. Based on our
past experience, it is anticipated that the analytic methods which will be
developed will enable one to develop very efficient numerical schemes for
computing quantities of interest for these models, so that improved industrial
products can be designed in shorter time.
