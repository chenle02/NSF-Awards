The quest to detect and measure ultra-high-energy neutrinos (&gt;100
petaelectronvolts, PeV) is at the forefront of particle astrophysics and has
been going on for many years. Detectors that exploit photomultipliers, like the
IceCube Neutrino Observatory at South Pole, have made significant progress
detecting neutrinos up to 1-2 PeV, but to instrument realistic larger target
mass volumes, one needs to turn to techniques like the radio detection of high-
energy neutrinos in media where radio waves can easily propagate ? like an ice
sheet or shelf. The neutrinos being searched for can bring essential information
about their origins, where and how they were made, and thereby shed light on the
origins of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The nature of cosmic accelerators is
one of the key questions of modern high-energy
astrophysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Antarctic Ross Ice-Shelf ANtenna Neutrino
Array (ARIANNA) is one of the proposed detectors for ultra-high energy
astrophysical neutrinos, which is designed to measure coherent radio Cherenkov
emissions from particle showers produced by neutrino interactions within ice.
ARIANNA can be built on the Ross Ice Shelf just off the coast of Antarctica
(~100-km south from McMurdo Station), eventually covering about 1000 square-km
in surface area. There, the ice-water interface below the ~600-m thick shelf
reflects radio waves, giving ARIANNA sensitivity to downward going neutrinos and
improving its sensitivity to horizontally incident
neutrinos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this award is to complete
the deployment of the remaining four stations for the pilot 7-station Hexagonal
Radio Array (HRA, approximately 2-km distance between sides) that can serve as a
"building block" for a much larger ARIANNA project, ultimately consisting of
~960 stations. Upon completing the HRA deployment, the focus will be on analysis
tasks: carefully examining the data collected by the HRA stations,
characterizing the sources and properties of non-thermal contributions, and
monitoring the robustness of the HRA stations in its year-round operation. These
stations operate autonomously, using solar power for about 7 months and going to
sleep for austral winter months. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anticipated broader
impacts from this project include training graduate students, furthering
international scientific collaboration and cooperation in Antarctica, and
providing data that will be of significant importance and use by the neutrino
astrophysics community.
