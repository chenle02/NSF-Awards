Kilo Moana is a 186-foot, general-purpose research vessel built in 2002 and
operated by the University of Hawaii under a charter party agreement with the
Office of Naval Research (ONR). The vessel is part of the US Academic Research
Fleet (ARF) and is supported by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
System (UNOLS). Ship time is made available to academic researchers funded by
the NSF, ONR, NOAA, NASA, and other federal and state agencies.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Hawaii requests funds for purchase of
the following Oceanographic Instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) OS 38 ADCP
$188,445&lt;br/&gt;2) GP Oceanographic Winch $304,750&lt;br/&gt;3) Sound
Velocity Profiler $14,080&lt;br/&gt; $507,275&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit
Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides
infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use
instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects
(which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of
NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation
allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working,
calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research,
and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
