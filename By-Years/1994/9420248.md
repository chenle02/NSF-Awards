Determining whether or not a previous event occurred represents a central use of
memory in everyday life. This form of memory, referred to as recognition memory,
plays an important role in a diverse range of practically-important behaviors,
from eyewitness accounts of past events to childhood memories and the assessment
of their validity. A recognition memory judgment requires people to say whether
they have or have not experienced a particular event. Traditional investigations
of recognition memory have emphasized the role of decision processes, as well as
memory representations in influencing such recognition memory judgments. The
work proposed here attempts to uncover the mechanisms underlying decision
processes in recognition memory using a range of experimental techniques and
theoretical approaches. We attempt to discover the factors that sytematically
influence decision processes and the relation between these factors and observed
memory performance. We hope to use these discoveries to construct models for
measuring the validity of recognition memory across a range of situations.
