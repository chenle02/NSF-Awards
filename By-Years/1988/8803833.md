The tectonics of the southern Appalachians is dominated by northwestward vergent
overthrusting and northeast trending dextral shearing of presumed late paleozoic
age. These events obscure earlier deformational events. However, recently
completed research suggests that the first event associated with the Alleghanian
orogeny in the eastern Piedmont of Georgia and South Carolina was an episode of
ductile low-angle normal faulting. This project will test this extensional
hypothesis by mapping the kiokee belt and its boundaries westward into Georgia
to a region where the overprinting effects of subsequent deformations are less
severe and where the normal faults bounding the kiokee belt are exposed.
Structural studies will clarify the shear sense and displacement directions and
the deformation chronology will be established by U-Pb and 40 Ar/39 Ar
techniques. The results are expected to help explain the brief periods of
extensional tectonics that commonly characterize some collisional orogens.
