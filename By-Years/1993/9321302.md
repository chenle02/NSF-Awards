This research explores adaptive methods for high performance, lossy signal
compression, and in particular, focuses on a variety of methods that rely on
signal expansions. Among these are: (1) signal adaptive expansions that include
quantization and entropy coding. These are generalizations of transform or
subband/wavelet and wavelet packet schemes. In particular, adaptive wavelet
packets are being studied, both from the point of a view of constructing bases
and that of finding good and efficient algorithms to find the best bases. (2)
Overcomplete expansions or frames. The focus is on quantization performance and
computational complexity. (3) The class of compression algorithms that use
successive approximation. A rage-distortion version of matching pursuit is being
developed; generalizations of hierarchical methods based on wavelets and wavelet
packers are being investigated. (4) Adaptive schemes for compression, including
adaptive transforms and quantization. Goals include a lossy equivalent of
arithmetic coding, and a lossy dictionary based predictive compression scheme
that resembles a lossy Lempel-Ziv algorithm.
