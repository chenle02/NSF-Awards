9531584 Radin This project has to do with classifying the tilings of Euclidean
space produceable by copies of a finite set of distinct tiles. The investigator
plans to apply his recent results on rotation symmetric tilings of the plane and
space. The methods to be used are a combination of traditional ergodic theory
and new techniques from aperiodic tilings. There are fundamental mathematical
questions in common between the two areas of investigation: determining the
causes of crystalline symmetry in low temperature matter, and classifying the
tilings of space by copies of finitely many tiles. These are both optimization
problems; the crystal problem is concerned with determining the basic mechanisms
which force low temperature and high pressure matter to have the high degree of
crystalline order and symmetry which is found experimentally.
