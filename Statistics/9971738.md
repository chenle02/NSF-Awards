It is proposed to continue the research initiated by the P.I. on how to use
confidence and prediction sets for stochastic differential equations to set
hedging strategies for derivative securities. The study will investigate both
the statistical methods used to set such sets, and how to trade for a given set.
The plan is to compare sets based purely on nonparametric prediction with those
based on confidence statements, and also to look at hybrid methods, involving
neighborhoods of parametric models. The latter will also provide guidance on how
to conduct model selection in such circumstances. Several inference methods will
be investigated, ranging from excursion based methods to profile likelihood. In
terms of the interface between sets and trading algorithms, it is proposed to
extend the present theory to non-European options. It is also the plan to
investigate the multiple comparison issues that arise if one wishes to revise
prediction intervals in the course of a trading strategy. Finally, it is the
intention to look into alternative models to stochastic differential equations,
models that can be used for hedging and that are closer to the data than
continuous processes. Derivative securities -- options, futures, and similar
instruments -- have emerged as a major feature of the contemporary economic
environment. They are a versatile and efficient mechanism for trading risk, thus
lowering its cost. There is, however, a dark side to derivatives, in that it can
be hard to assess the real risks involved. This is not only the case for `naive'
market participants, as evidenced by a number of incidents involving major
financial institutions. These difficulties are, to an important extent, caused
by the absence of a connection between statistical methods and the evaluation of
financial risk. There is a substantial literature on the statistical analysis of
financial data. Apart from short-term considerations, however, there is little
knowledge on how to use statistical results based on historical data to quantify
the risks associated with derivatives. The aim of this project is to change this
situation by providing ways of tying up statistical results and the trading
strategies on which the values of derivative securities depend. This will
provide ways of setting contingency reserves and fallback liquidation strategies
without interfering in the day-to-day operation of the financial institutions
trading in options.
