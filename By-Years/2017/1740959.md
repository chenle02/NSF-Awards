This award supports participation in the Sixth Annual Midwest Women in
Mathematics Symposium (WIMS) to be held on April 7, 2018 at Purdue University.
The aim of WIMS is: (i) to highlight the scholarly contributions of female
mathematicians in the Midwest region, and (ii) to stimulate collaborations,
networking, and mentoring relations among female mathematicians in the Midwest
region. WIMS has been established as an annual event that rotates among colleges
and universities in the Midwest. The Symposium brings together female
mathematicians from across the Midwest at all stages of their careers. Based on
attendance at previous WIMS, 120 participants are anticipated in
2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Symposium features two hour-long plenary lectures
by distinguished senior female faculty members and fifteen thirty-minute invited
lectures by promising female junior faculty and postdoctoral researchers. The
topics of the academic sessions at WIMS 2018 are Analysis, Applied Math,
Geometry, and Topology. Graduate students and recent Ph.D.s have the opportunity
to present their work and work in progress at the open problem sessions.
Informal lunch time discussion gives useful career advice for both academic and
industrial research jobs to young people. The meeting work will naturally lead
to follow-up visits among the participants at other Midwest institutions and new
long-term collaborations. More details about the symposium can be found at
http://www.math.purdue.edu/calendar/conferences/mwims18/. This award is jointly
funded by the Infrastructure, Analysis, Applied Math, Topology, and Probability
programs within the Division of Mathematical Sciences at NSF.
