In number theory, it is natural to ask, for a fixed prime number p, whether the
difference of two integers is divisible by p (or a power of p), in which case we
say the two integers are congruent modulo p (or its power). The p-adic numbers
are introduced in the 20th century to capture this congruence relation among
integers: two integers are considered "close together" if their difference is
divisible by a high power of p. This way, we can perform calculus on integers,
but with a different definition of distance. This concept has been proved to be
a powerful tool in number theory, both in practical applications to
computational problems, and in theoretical applications such as the proof of
Fermat's Last Theorem. In this project the PI will use p-adic calculus to study
questions in number theory. In addition, the PI will organize Connecticut Summer
Schools in Number Theory for advanced undergraduate students and beginning
graduate students, to introduce them to topics of contemporary number theory
(including the p-adic numbers).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the PI will
study slopes of modular forms, that is the p-adic valuation of the eigenvalues
of the Hecke operator at p on the space of modular forms, or equivalently, the
p-adic valuation of the p-th coefficients of q-expansions of the eigenforms,
with the goal of gaining new insight on the recent conjecture of Bergdall and
Pollack, that will lead to a proof, by relating it to the p-adic local Langlands
program. Success in proving this conjecture will lead to proofs of other open
conjectures in the area, including Gouvea's conjecture on slope distribution,
the Gouvea-Mazur conjecture, and an unpublished conjecture of Breuil-Buzzard-
Emerton, as well as a partial result on the irreducibility of the Coleman-Mazur
eigencurve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
