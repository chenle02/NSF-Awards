Professor Gerald Caple and other members of the Chemistry Department of Northern
Arizona University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1991-93, eight
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Projects include investigation of aniline
copolymers, analysis of clays from prehistoric ruins, and monitoring of
groundwater in uranium mining districts. Students will meet weekly to discuss
their research progress and will also attend a weekly seminar on general
interest topics, such as safety and careers opportunities. Students will make at
least one oral presenation on their results and, in addition, will make a
presentation at a national conference. The participants will be Native
Americans.
