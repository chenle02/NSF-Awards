Professor Moscovici will exploit the tools of non-commutative differential
geometry and of non-commutative harmonic analysis for the investigation of
differential and topological invariants of multiply connected manifolds. The
first part of his project concerns invariants of index type and is a
continuation of his work on the Novikov conjecture. The second part, which
represents a new line of research, deals with the more subtle secondary-type
invariants (e.g. analytic torsion and the eta invariant) and aims to place them
in the framework of cyclic (co)homology and algebraic K-theory. A manifold is
the generalization to higher dimensions of a smooth two dimensional surface. For
example, the space-time continuum is a four dimension manifold. Professor
Moscovici's research is aimed at understanding these geometric objects by
exploiting connections with the theory of linear transformations (infinite
matrices) in infinite dimensional spaces.
