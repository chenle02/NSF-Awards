The goal of this project is to restructure the existing Immunology course so as
to include a laboratory section, and to update and expand the quality of the
laboratory experiences offered in such other courses as Microbiology,
Biochemistry, Physiology, Hematology, and the Undergraduate Seminar, through the
purchase of equipment needed to improve the curricular contents. These changes
are expected to enable students to meet the challenges of a technological
society. Among the instruments required to accomplish these course improvements
are chromatographic, fractionating, ultraviolet analysis and recording
equipment, electrophoretic apparatus for the analysis and isolation of antigens,
and two good research microscopes for the study of the histology of lymphoid
tissues. This project is having an impact on Hispanic students majoring in
science and those in the University's pre- health track.
