This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project addresses the
fabrication and characterization of unprecedented high performance and low cost
ceramic membranes - Bendable Ceramic Nanowire Membranes. Membrane-based
separation and filtration is a significant part of modern industries. Organic
polymer membranes, due to their low manufacture cost and flexible feature, are
dominating these markets. Ceramic membranes, despite their intrinsically
superior properties, have not been widely adopted due to their high manufacture
cost and rigid structures. In this program, Novarials will apply a novel
fabrication strategy to make next-generation ceramic membranes based on high
quality and low cost ceramic nanowires. These ceramic membranes (1) will be as
bendable and flexible as polymer membranes so that they can be integrated into
spiral wound systems to achieve high membrane packing density which is 5 to 10
times that of conventional ceramic membranes; (2) will be manufactured at low
cost which is 10~20% of conventional ceramic membranes; (3) will be pure ceramic
without organic additives, and thus pertain all the superior properties of
ceramic materials; (4) will posses nanosized pore of 2 to 100nm in diameter for
ultrafiltration where flexible glass fiber membranes failed.

These ceramic nanowire membranes will be a disruptive technology in membrane
industry. The unprecedented combination of many advantages of the ceramic
membranes including flexibility and bendability, low manufacture cost, high
stability to temperature, chemical inertness to acids, bases and chlorine, long
operation life, as well as nanosized pores, will make them quickly penetrate
into the current markets of conventional ceramic membranes. In addition, the
ceramic membranes will be a strong competitor to current organic polymer
membrane-dominated markets and a high potential candidate for new applications
where conventional ceramic membranes failed due to high cost and where polymer
membranes failed due to low stability.
