This project focuses on creating and implementing a Photonics and Lasers
Technology Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree program at Baker College of
Flint. The new program, unique in Michigan, responds to a documented need for
photonics technicians in the state, the Midwest region, and across the United
States. The project consists of multiple activities including: developing new
curricula, creating a well-equipped optics and photonics laboratory, training
faculty to teach in the program, performing outreach activities to area high
schools, and educating a first group of students to become photonics
technicians. The project also offers opportunities for flexible training of
employed technicians and displaced workers. The project leverages broad
collaborative work between Baker College of Flint, the newly formed Mi-Light
Michigan Photonics Cluster industry group, OP-TEC National Center for Optics and
Photonics Education, and Indian Hills Community College. It creates an Associate
level Photonics program that encompasses fundamental knowledge and skills in the
discipline as well as recent photonics applications that are becoming widely
used in diverse industries. The new AAS degree program creates a model that can
be adopted by colleges interested in photonics nationwide. Results of the
project will be disseminated to educational, industry and professional
organizations to reach a wide audience. The project includes efforts to recruit
underrepresented minorities and veterans to advanced technological education and
training programs. The project supports the advancement of an economically
depressed local area and the diversification of the Michigan economy as a whole.
