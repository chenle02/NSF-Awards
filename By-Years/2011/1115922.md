This project provides support for promoting student research on symbolic
computation and computational mathematics at the 17th International Conference
on Applications of Computer Algebra (ACA 2011), which is hosted by Lamar
University and held in Houston, Texas, on June 27-30, 2011. In the past several
years there has been a dramatic increase in the use of algebraic and symbolic
computation in engineering, science and education. The ACA series of annual
conferences is devoted to stimulating and enhancing this important progress
through international meetings that emphasize theoretical research and algorithm
design for software development, as well as the applications of algebraic and
symbolic computation in engineering, physical and medical sciences, pure and
applied mathematics, and education.

The ACA conferences traditionally work to ensure the future vitality of the
application fields of algebraic and symbolic computation by facilitating
development and nurturing of a community of capable graduate students and entry-
level scientists. Through keynote speakers, talks, themed workshops, timely and
topical tutorials, this conference provides mechanisms for graduate students and
young scientists to meet each other in a scientifically rigorous setting. With
researchers coming from all around the world, this conference makes a broad
impact on both the algebraic and symbolic computation research community and the
user community. Leading software companies such as MapleSoft and Wolfram
Research have been regularly attending ACA meetings.
