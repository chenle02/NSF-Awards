The objective of this research is to address one of the most profound questions
in theoretical physics today, that of the microscopic structure of space-time.
The research explores theoretical and observational issues at the interface
between known physics and the unknown realm of&lt;br/&gt;quantum gravity. It
draws on lessons and insights from a number of fields of physics, and may in
turn contribute to those fields. It thus has significant interdisciplinary
aspects, involving the areas of gravitation, quantum field theory in curved
spacetime, nonequilibrium quantum field theory, cosmology, high energy
astrophysics, atom optics, and condensed matter
physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will help guide observational
investigations from the origin of structure in the early universe to the
gravitational wave emission from distant black holes. It will probe for the
limits of relativity theory and extract new constraints on fundamental physics
from the properties of high energy radiation in the universe, and it will
develop connections between the physics of ultra-low&lt;br/&gt;temperature
condensed matter and quantum fields in curved spacetime. This research activity
is an integral part of the education of graduate students training them on
topics related to gravitation, quantum fields, statistical mechanics and
problems of the early universe and black holes. The research results will also
be assimilated into undergraduate and graduate teachings in the form of college
courses, independent studies, and popular or semi-popular lectures given by the
PIs and their associates and students.
