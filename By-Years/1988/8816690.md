This award to the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will provide 75% of the
funds needed to acquire a computer (PC) system. The instrument will be installed
and operated in the Department of Geology. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is
committed to providing the remaining 25% for this equipment. The principal use
of the PC system will be to conduct numerical modeling experiments of
metamorphic processes, the goal of which is to better understand the formation
of metamorphic rocks. The Principal Investigator is supported for research in
this area by the National Science Foundation and this award is made in direct
support of his research program.
