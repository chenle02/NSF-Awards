This action funds Nicholas DiRienzo of University of California, Davis to
conduct a research project, entitled "Hormonal regulation of personality in the
field cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus," during the summer of 2012 at Hokkaido
University in Sapporo-shi, Hokkaido. The host scientist is Dr. Hitoshi Aonuma.

Many animals exhibit personalities, defined as behavioral traits that are
correlated across contexts. Crickets possess bold and shy personalities, such
that bold individuals are less cautious during potentially dangerous situations.
The consistency of these personalities suggests there is an underlying mechanism
responsible for their expression. Biogenic amines such as octopamine and
serotonin can act as neurohormones when released into the hemolymph and have
been shown to influence cricket aggression and escape behavior. Differential
regulation of biogenic amines could act as a regulatory mechanism underlying
bold and shy personalities. To investigate this, adult male field crickets
(Gryllus bimaculatus) are being subjected to a boldness assay followed by an
aggression assay to determine if the behavioral differences of bold and shy
crickets are due to a difference in the amount of, or regulation of biogenic
amine hormones.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
