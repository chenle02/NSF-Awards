Sediments from the eastern levee of the Amazon Fan show 0.18 values that
indicate marked episodic changes in the deep.sea flow regime during glacial
times. It is hypothesized that the Amazon Fan is a climatically sensitive area
of surface water return flow to the area of deep.water formation in the North
Atlantic. To test this hypothesis, the PI will look for evidence of
paleodischarge events via changes in the 0.18 content of planktonic
foraminifera. These cores already were collected by a German cruise earlier this
year.
