0119470&lt;br/&gt;Zharov&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to
develop a new method for laser photothermal phase-contrast imaging (LPPI) which
has high absorption sensitivity and high resolution for sensing nano-scale non-
fluorescent structures at the cellular and sub-cellular levels. The specific
research objectives are to: (1) evaluate spatial resolution and sensitivity of
LPPI in a time-resolved mode by calibrating LPPI by using nano-scale liposomes
as photothermal (PT) probes, (2) examine the effects of a laser pulse on a cell
visualized by LPPI by comparing the time-resolved PT-image structure as a
function of pump laser energy and wavelength with conventional biochemical data,
and (3) develop cell PT spectral lifetime imaging and algorithms of PT time-
resolved analysis of complex nano-scale absorbing structures verified with a
multi-color PT probe model. &lt;br/&gt;
