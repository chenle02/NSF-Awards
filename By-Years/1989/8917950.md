This award provides funds for construction of a chopping secondary mirror for
the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory. This mirror, or subreflector in the
terminology of radio astronomy, will provide sky subtraction at all instrument
locations and will be especially valuable for continuum instruments such as the
Chicago 32-beam photometer/polarimeter. The design of the chopper is similar to
one already built for the Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) planned for construction
at Mt. Graham.
