This project introduces undergraduate civil engineering majors to the new and
exciting field of environmental geotechnics. A new undergraduate course is being
introduced at Purdue University. using state-of-the-art laboratory equipment.
The course is a combined instructional/laboratory course that provides the
students with an understanding of all aspects of hazardous waste site assessment
and instrumentation from the discovery that a hazardous waste site exists
through to establishing safety and management strategies and culminating in an
extensive evaluation of scientific equipment for assessing the type and extent
of contamination in the air, soil and water. An integral component of the course
is the weekly laboratory sessions where the students will become familiar with
the operation of a range of different modern scientific devices which are used
to monitor and assess surface and subsurface conditions. The development plan
also incorporates preparation of video instructional materials and is linked to
future research experiences for undergraduates.
