This project will study the middle atmosphere and lower thermosphere (60-150 km
altitude) through the continued analysis and interpretation of AIDA (Arecibo
Initiative in Dynamics of the Atmosphere) '89 data. Moreover, a new observing
program initiated at Arecibo will examine neutral wave motion in the lower
thermosphere, extending past AIDA studies of atmospheric dynamics into a higher
altitude domain.
