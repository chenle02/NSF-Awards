This research is concerned with two problems in sequential stochastic decision
processes: the analysis of Markov Decision Processes with Reward/Variability
tradeoffs and the computation of solutions in zero-sum stochastic games. Markov
Decision Processes constitute a class of paradigms widely applicable to such
areas as manufacturing systems, discrete stochastic control, etc. The
Reward/Variability tradeoff approach holds the possibility of enhancing the
acceptance of these paradigms by practitioners. The solution of zero-sum
stochastic games is generally difficult; it is expected that the proposed
approach will yield efficient algorithms for solving such problems.
