The project of Professor Paul Gemperline of East Carolina University, supported
by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry and International Programs, seeks to
develop a new class of mathematical modeling techniques. The objective is to
extract quantitative chemical composition data from on-line monitoring of
chemical reactions with multiple instrument systems. Improved modeling is
possible with the combination of intrinsic and extrinsic measurements, such as
Raman spectroscopy and on-line calorimetry. The combination should reduce both
the number of reference spectra and the frequency of instrument calibrations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mixtures of chemicals are common, occurring in industrial
chemical production, chemical separations, spatially distributed chemicals on
surfaces, and even in protein folding processes. Currently, rapid, automated
quantification requires complete sets of reference spectra and frequent
instrument calibration. Also, it is difficult to combine the results of two or
more instruments into a single report of chemical composition. Professor
Gemperline and his students will work closely with several European Union
research groups, particularly groups in Spain and the Netherlands. &lt;br/&gt;
