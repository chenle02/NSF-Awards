This is a theoretical/numerical modeling study of time- modulated boundary
forcing of convection under conditions significantly beyond the first onset of
convective instability. Time-periodic boundary temperatures as well as time-
periodic vertical accelerations will be investigated. By allowing the parameters
which control thermal convection to vary with time, the changes in convection as
well as control to enhance or reduce convective transfer and mixing will be
explored.
