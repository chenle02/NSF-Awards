The 20th Penn State plant Biology Symposium will focus on the important topic of
"Plant Stress-Omics in a Changing Climate". Plenary sessions are focused on
water and salinity, atmosphere (temperature, CO2, ozone), biotic/abiotic
interactions and the use of novel tools. The conference is held at Penn State
University, University Park takes place May 13-16, 2015. There will be two
formal poster and two short talk sessions to feature research from talented
junior scientists. The conference includes an impressive cadre of US and
international speakers. The organizing committee and speaker list seems balanced
in terms of broadening participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop
addresses an important topic in Plant Biology, namely how plants deal with
increasing environmental stresses. Particularly noteworthy is a planned workshop
preceding the meeting to provide training in novel mass spectrometric methods.
These methods are necessary to determine metabolomics changes in response to
various environmental stresses. The meeting is an ideal forum for students and
postdocs to identify future mentors, and for established scientists to forge
meaningful collaborations.
