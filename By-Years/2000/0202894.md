INT-0202894&lt;br/&gt;Yue Wu&lt;br/&gt;University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill&lt;br/&gt;$24,000&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is about international
collaboration with researchers in Korea, focusing on the structure and opto-
electronic properties of inorganic nanostructure/dye molecule hybrid systems.
This research will use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study gas adsorption
in single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and the structure of SWNT/dye system.
These nanostructure-based hybrid systems could play an important role in future
technological developments such as molecular sensors and solar cells. The
collaboration will help to advance research on the opto-electronic properties of
nanostructure/dye hybrid systems.&lt;br/&gt;
