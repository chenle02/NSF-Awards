The proposed project seeks financial support to support students, participation
in a workshop to be held February 17-20, 2013 at the Pavillon Hotel, New
Orleans, Louisiana. The 2013 Workshop on Compound Semiconductor Materials &
Devices (WOCSEMMAD) will address research areas in III-V compound semiconductor
field. It is one of the few workshop format meetings where the latest results
can be debated and discussed in a relatively open format. WOCSEMMAD has played a
key role in identifying new directions for research. It is one of the few
workshops where presentations are required to focus only on important new data,
and last minute results. Less-than-successful results are also very welcome
since they allow the participants to discuss the difficulties encountered and
propose new approaches.
