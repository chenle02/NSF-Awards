The defining characteristic of ubiquitous computing is the attempt to break away
from the traditional desktop interaction paradigm and move computational power
into the environment that surrounds the user. This award focuses on automating
the capture of individual and group experiences, in order to facilitate access
to a richly integrated record of events: the automated capture, integration and
access problem for ubiquitous computing. The natural candidates for this capture
are collaborative activities such as meetings, education, and design. This award
will initiate a large-scale ubiquitous computing effort--- Classroom 2000---to
access and support the rich interaction of classroom experience, and will grow
to support and assist students through their educational careers and beyond.
Open issues include effects of granularity of capture, support for revision
during access, and how interactions among collaborators affects capture and
integration. Of special interest is determining whether and how ubiquitous
computing technology supports note-taking practices that contribute to near-term
and long-term educational goals.
