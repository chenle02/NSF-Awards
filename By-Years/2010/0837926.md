This project will examine the state of the magnetosphere during periods when
quasi-periodic substorms, sawtooth events and steady magnetospheric convection
are occurring. The project will examine four specific questions. The first topic
is to generate a statistical study that will determine the magnetospheric state
that leads to substorms, including periodic substorms and sawtooth events, that
occur within major magnetic storms. The state of the magnetosphere will be
defined in terms of the lobe magnetic field and the plasma sheet pressure. The
second topic is to establish a quantitative relationship between the solar wind
state and the onset of magnetospheric substorms. The third topic will use data
from a variety of satellites, especially the Geotail satellite, to relate the
solar wind state to the magnetospheric state during periods of steady
magnetospheric convection. The fourth topic will be to determine whether or not
steady magnetospheric convection represents a smooth transition from substorms
when the solar wind driver becomes weak.
