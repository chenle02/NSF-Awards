9623119 McInerny This research planning grant will address the questions of: (1)
what signal or quantities should be measured, and (2) what signal processing
methods should be used to detect insulation breakdown in AC induction motors
that use pulse width modulation (PWM) control. While it is a powerful speed
control method with many commercial applications, PWM control causes electrical
harmonics when used on old motors or new high efficiency motors not designed for
adjustable speeds. These harmonics lead to motor losses, torque pulsations,
overheating, acoustical noise and mechanical vibration, and ultimately the
destruction of the electrical insulation and the motor. Dynamic analysis and
preliminary experiments indicate that signature analysis may be a useful way to
track and monitor the condition of these systems. Kalman filtering or spectral
techniques, such as wavelets, are promising methods. Because PWM control is
common in drive systems and modern air handling systems, diagnostic methods to
reliably track insulation degradation in mechanical equipment will impact both
productivity and health in factories and offices. ***
