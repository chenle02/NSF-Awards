To achieve the best performance on modern computers, one
must&lt;br/&gt;understand and exploit the interactions between program
behavior,&lt;br/&gt;run-time systems, and hardware. This research explores
compiler and&lt;br/&gt;run-time system support for improving load-value
prediction and for&lt;br/&gt;reducing the energy consumption of programs. Load-
value prediction&lt;br/&gt;exposes instruction-level parallelism in programs by
allowing loads to&lt;br/&gt;execute in parallel with the instructions that
depend on it. Energy&lt;br/&gt;reduction techniques reduce the energy
requirements of programs&lt;br/&gt;without significantly degrading
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadly speaking this research considers two
kinds of techniques: (i)&lt;br/&gt;Compiler techniques that use easily-available
information in programs&lt;br/&gt;(such as type information) to transform or
annotate code to make&lt;br/&gt;better use of hardware; (ii) Run-time system
techniques that&lt;br/&gt;reorganize and annotate data to make better use of
hardware. This&lt;br/&gt;research will also consider new hardware mechanisms for
load-value&lt;br/&gt;prediction and energy consumption that can be exploited in
software.&lt;br/&gt;
