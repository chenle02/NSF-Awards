This department is using the present award to procure the equipment needed for
teaching of modern nucleic acid research, providing students an opportunity to
explore such modern research techniques as recombinant DNA technology and
protein analysis. DNA electrophoresis and protein gel electrophoresis units
along with such supportive equipment needed in work with recombinant DNA as a
micro- centrifuge, micropipetters, a UV transilluminator, speed vac, vacuum
oven, shaker incubator, sonicator, and cold cabinet are being used by students
in a new course, Molecular Genetics, as well as in two already established core
courses. Students learn protein chemistry, DNA structure, RNA expression, and
other protocols used in recombinant DNA technology. In a five-year period about
250 undergraduates involved in an average of three to four courses per student
will have extensive hands-on experience with this equipment. This project is one
result of the university's positive steps toward providing its students with
classes in the rapidly expanding field of genetic engineering and recombinant
DNA technology. A biology faculty member with expertise in these fields, hired
in 1987, is designing the new Molecular Genetics course. The grantee institution
is matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
