Fiber damage is a major problem in injection molding and extrusion. The full
benefit of fibers as a reinforcement is not attained in these processes because
the fibers are reduced to a fraction of their original length. Prior research
have examined the damage mechanisms with the aim of understanding how the
process can be changed to maintain longer fibers. It is clear that it is the
exposure of the fibers to the melt, machinery and other fibers that cause fiber
damage, although the extent of each process has not been investigated
thoroughly. Tailored experiments will be performed to reveal the mechanisms of
fiber damage. Experiments will be performed to examine addition of the initial
material in different forms, such as powder resin/fibers, encapsulated pellets
with different aspect ratios; addition of the fibers separate from the resin in
different zones and the processing conditions in the resulting fiber
degradation. The potential impact if this research is large since it will
directly impact injection molding and extrusion which are high volume processes.
Reduced fiber damage implies that the strength, stiffness and impact properties
of components made with these processes will be considerably higher than the
present state of the art.//
