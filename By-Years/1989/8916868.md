This award provides one-half the funding required to adapt an existing gas-
source mass spectrometer so that it can be used for hydrogen/deuterium isotopic
analysis. The instrument is housed in the Department of Geology at the
University of Florida, and the University of Florida is committed to providing
the remaining half of the funds required. The new capabilities of the instrument
are needed in the research projects of eight faculty and their students. These
include research in geohydrology, ecosystems, limnology, paleoclimatology, and
archeology.
