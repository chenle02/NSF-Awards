The University of Florida continues to operate a Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) Site that focused on physics of materials. The ten-week
summer program would support 15 undergraduate students each year for three
years. Students are recruited nationwide with an emphasis to increase
participation by women, members of groups underrepresented in Science Technology
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), students from institutions with limited
research opportunities. Each REU participant is integrated into an active
research group to carry out individual research project under the guidance of a
faculty mentor. Research projects cover a wide variety of materials research
topics in physics and related fields and include experimental, theoretical and
computational projects in the design, measurement and understanding of novel
materials and quantum phenomena. The REU program also includes seminars on
contemporary research topics, visit to National High Magnetic Field Laboratory,
information on career possibilities in physical sciences, workshops and training
on scientific communication, science demonstrations by REU students to K-12
groups and social events to facilitate informal interactions among peers and
with faculty mentors. At the end of the program, students write research reports
and present their project results at a REU research symposium and are encouraged
and supported to present their REU research at national and regional scientific
meetings.

This REU Site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the
NSF REU program and NSF Division of Materials Research in the Mathematical and
Physical Sciences Directorate.
