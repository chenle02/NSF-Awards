A modern Automated X-ray Powder Diffractometer to be used in support of
Materials Research at the University of Virginia will be acquired. Faculty and
graduate students in Physics, Chemistry, and Materials Science will make
extensive use of the facility in research programs involving studies of 1) the
transport, magnetic and superconducting properties of rapidly solidified glassy
alloys, quasicrystalline, and crystalline materials, 2) compound semiconductor
materials and new rare- earth, transition metal magnetic alloys, 3) the
oxidation of alloys of aluminum, 4) metal matrix composites, 5) new high
temperature aluminum base alloys, and 6) the synthesis of novel low-dimensional
conducting materials. The facility is essential in the above research areas for
the characterization and identification of component equilibrium and the
metastable phases, the precision determination of lattice parameters, and the
determination of crystal size, strain and residual stresses.
