The Summer Research Participation Program is currently in its thirty- fifth
year of operation at Roswell Park Memorial Institute (SUNY- Buffalo). The
institute is the oldest and one of the largest comprehensive cancer centers in
the world. It is designed for high ability high school seniors. The objectives
of the programs are: 1) to teach each student functional scientific facts,
principles and techniques employed in research; 2) to expose students to an
active research environment; 3) to allow the students to witness scientific
creativity; 4) to develop in each student the skills, habits and attitudes
required by scientific investigators; 5) to further develop the students
interest in science; and 6) to help the trainee in planning his/her academic
career in science. The trainees fulfill these objectives by implementing a
research project in a research laboratory under direct supervision of a senior
investigator. The remaining time is spent attending formal lectures and seminars
in specific areas of biology, chemistry and biophysics conducted at the
Institute. Projects are assigned to students by their senior investigator who
serves as their summer mentor. The Education Department assists senior
investigators in the selection of students to insure that the students'
interests and the objectives of the program are fulfilled. A one-to- one
relationship between senior investigator and student is sought to facilitate the
learning process.
