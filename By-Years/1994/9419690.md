9419690 Whittet Dr. Whittet will use this small grant for exploratory research
to examine a new interpretation of interstellar extinction data. The PI has the
opportunity to use groundbased and satellite data bases (mostly archival) to
better understand extinction curves, to attempt to explain previously puzzling
results, and thus to formulate a more complete and realistic model.
