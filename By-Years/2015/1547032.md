The workshop on Ultrhigh Field NMR and MRI has three objectives: 1) To establish
science drivers for ultrahigh field NMR/MRI; 2) To discuss opportuities that new
technologies such as high temperature superconductors bring to NMR and MRI; and,
3) To develop a roadmap for the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
