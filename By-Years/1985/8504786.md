This research addresses two problems. First, how does one plan production for an
indefinite period when demands and costs can be forecast only for a relatively
short period in the future? Second, how can a production planner schedule work
on several different items on the same machine to minimize cost (the Economic
Lot Scheduling Problem)? Efficient algorithms will be developed for the solution
of variations of these problems.
