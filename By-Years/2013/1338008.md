1338008&lt;br/&gt;Islam&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for the
acquisition of a Micro-Particle Image Velocimetry (micro-PIV) system to conduct
micro-fluidics, MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical-systems), and biomedical flow
experiments for both research and student training at the University of Texas at
Brownsville (UTB). UTB is a minority-serving institution in the Rio Grande
Valley (RGV) of Texas. With a population of 1.5 million, comprised primarily of
Hispanics, the RGV is the fourth-largest populated region in the state. The
project supports four specific research components: (i) Integration of
Microcantilever with AC Electrokinetics for Sensing Bio-/Nano-Particles. tric
fields for the implementation of high-efficiency bioparticle collection and
separation. (ii) Biased AC Electroosmosis Micropump for Water Management in PEM
Fuel Cells. (iii) Biomimetic Flow Sensing. The main objective of this activity
is to obtain the micro-scale time-dependent flow structures. (iv) Selective
Filtration/Absorption of Nano- and Micron- Size Particles Using Carbon Nanotube-
Based Media. This activity will synthesize carbon nanotube-based media with
various morphologies and densities to selectively filter nano- and micron-size
particles from fluid flow.
