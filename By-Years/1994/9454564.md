The Science Technology: Knowledge and Skills curriculum project, (SciTeKS), will
fill the void of science-oriented technical courses in Tech Prep and similar
school-to-work transition high school programs. The project is designed to
develop printed and multimedia student and teacher materials for large context
modules involving chemistry, biology, and earth/space sciences. The development
will include curriculum design recommendations and models, multimedia
instructional and reference materials for students, suggestions and models for
implementation, support for teachers, and guidance for assessment. The
curriculum will be designed to develop in high school students skills in
teamwork, problem solving, communication, and other capabilities considered
critical for their success in the workplace and/or in further education. The
SciTeKS project will provide a two-year science curriculum for a variety of
school-to-work programs. Students completing SciTeKS will be ideally prepared to
enter immediate employment or college technician programs based on biology,
chemistry, or earth/space sciences. The pedagogical strategies will be developed
by a team of high school, college, and
