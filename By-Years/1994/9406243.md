9406243 McCallum This research will provide a deeper understanding of the
processes that operate in the formation of layered mafic intrusions, especially
the Stillwater complex. The proposed research includes three subprograms: (1)
petrogenesis of the platinum group element (PGE) ore zone, (2) origin of macro
rhythmic layering in gabbronorites, and (3) effects of influxes of magmas into
an evolving magma chamber. The study of the ore zone will utilize electron and
ion probe analyses and Pb isotopic studies to elucidate the relationship between
the host lithologies and the stratigraphic sequence. The second project will
combine a modeling approach with descriptive textural and mineralogical data
obtained by microprobe and image analysis methods to test the predictive
capacity of quantitative models of layer formation. The third project will
utilize mineral compositions determined by electron and ion probe and Nd
isotopic ratios of pyroxenes to determine whether specific contact zones are the
result of magmatic influxes rather than fractional crystallization. Study of the
Stillwater Complex is significant because it is the repository of the largest
reserves of (PGE) and chromium in the western hemisphere.
