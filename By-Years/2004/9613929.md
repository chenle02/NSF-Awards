This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at University of Miami to acquire a 300
MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: (1) characterization of cryptatium and fullerene
species, (2) aminoorganometallics and derivatized brevetoxins, (3)
supramolecular electrochemistry, (4) biomolecular recognition, and (5)
"Lantech", "Biotech" and Nitric Oxide chemistry. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
