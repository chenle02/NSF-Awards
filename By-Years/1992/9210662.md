This research planning grant will enable the researcher to continue her
investigation into the structure of the ideal class group of algebraic number
fields. In particular, she will study how the class group of a compositum
relates to those of the subfields. This is research in the field of number
theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the
divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest fields of
mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely aesthetic reasons. However,
within the last half century, it has become an essential tool in developing new
algorithms for computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
