Partially molten systems, in which a change of phase between liquid and solid
can occur, arise in a wide variety of settings, such as in the solidification of
magma chambers and the Earth's core and in the casting of metallic alloys. These
multi-phase systems are often physically complex and exhibit anomalous behavior
not seen in single phase systems. The study of such systems has bee hampered by
the lack of a set of governing equations derived from first principles. This
research will be a systematic attempt to derive such equations and to elucidate
some of their unusual properties. Also the characteristics of the mushy zone
which forms as an aqueous solution of ammonium chloride is cooled from below
will be studied experimentally to determine whether the theory can successfully
predict the occurrence and characteristics of the chimneys or channels which
from spontaneously.
