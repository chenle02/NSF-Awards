A pseudorandom generator is an efficient procedure that stretches a short input
seed into a much longer sequence that looks random. These fascinating objects
have a striking variety of applications, for example in algorithm design,
cryptography, and complexity theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of
this project is to obtain new pseudorandom generators. This objective will be
approached from different, mutually enriching routes, whose unifying theme is
the quest for pseudorandom generators that are unconditional, i.e., do not rely
on any unproven assumption. The central points of the research are: (1) Obtain
new unconditional pseudorandom generators for important computational models,
(2) analyze and improve the efficiency of constructions of pseudorandom
generators from assumptions, and (3) develop new paradigms and interdisciplinary
connections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is closely integrated with a
program to achieve broad impact through education on multiple levels. Specific
points of this program are: (1) Develop new theory courses, (2) involve students
at all levels, and (3) foster interdisciplinary collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;
