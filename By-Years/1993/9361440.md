9361440 Bartz Root research is conducted to improve the drought resistance of
food crops, to study root response to soil conditions and contamination, and for
research on disease mechanisms. Improving food production is of major importance
in the United States and a matter of survival in many third world countries.
Early studies correlated the roots observed in these views with samples of roots
dug up destructively in soil samples and meticulously washed and measured.
Recent system- improvements cut the average time to take each picture and
increased the amount of data that could be gathered by 500%. New cameras allow
higher magnification for viewing fungi and micro organisms. More accurate
movement of the microscope is needed. This research will apply computer control
and automation to the video microscope in order to: 1. Decrease the time and
labor required to gather the photographs. 2. Improve the accuracy of
registration so the photo is of the same place. 3. Make the index depth
intervals easily adjustable in the program. 4. Improve the marking of each
picture to take the data back off the tape faster and with less operator input.
5. Produce a system designed for an attainable price. ***
