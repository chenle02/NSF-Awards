Proposal Title: Consumer Credit, Housing Prices, and Consumption&lt;br/&gt;SBE-
SES 0820337: Mian&lt;br/&gt;This project evaluates the impact of the housing
boom on consumer borrowing, and consumption. The project develops a new
empirical methodology that separates the causal impact of the change in house
prices on household borrowing and consumption. The methodology explores zip code
level variation in house prices while absorbing all possible economic shocks at
the level of a county. It then uses variation in initial latent demand for
credit to provide "supply-side induced" variation in house price growth that is
plausibly exogenous to demand side changes at the zip code level. &lt;br/&gt;The
project uses detailed consumer level data on home equity lines of credit, credit
card debt, and auto loans to explore how existing home owners respond to the
exogenous component of home price appreciation. It also estimates whether the
borrowing response to home asset prices differs by a consumer's income, age and
credit history. The project follows a long period of time from 1998 to 2008, and
tests whether consumers use home price appreciation to substitute out of credit
card debt. Finally, it estimates if borrowing against home price appreciation
ultimately leads to higher default rates or not.&lt;br/&gt;The second part of
the project estimates the real side impact of increase in home prices in terms
of consumption. A major difficulty in doing so is measuring consumption at the
local (county/zip) level. This project uses detailed establishment level data
from census to construct proxies of consumption using retail sales at the local
level. These consumption measures are then used to estimate the final impact of
home prices and consumer borrowing on consumption and hence aggregate
output.&lt;br/&gt;The project's results provide new insights into the causes of
the "first major crisis of the 21st century", and also highlight the
consequences of the housing boom and bust in terms of asset prices, leverage and
consumption. The lessons learnt from our research are important for
understanding the interplay between financial and real side of the economy. In
particular, while many have often questioned the role that asset prices play in
affecting consumer borrowing and consumption, empirically isolating the
direction and magnitude of this channel has been difficult.
