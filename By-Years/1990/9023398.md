With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Tannor will study a wide variety of three-dimensional
photodissociation and reactive scattering processes using converged quantum
mechanical time dependent wavepacket methods. The results of the computations
will aid experimentalists in interpreting the mechanisms of exceedingly rapid
chemical reactions. Experimental data for these fast reactions is just now
emerging from Zewail's group at the California Institute of Technology.
Experimental absorption, emission and final product measurements will be
modeled. The processes to be studied include ozone photodissociation, IHI(-)
photodissociation, H3+ predissociation, H+H2 reactive scattering and polyene
spectroscopy and photochemistry. The results will be visualized by viewing the
three-dimensional wavepacket trajectories as a function of time, using 3-D
computer graphics. A novel and efficient set of computational techniques will be
employed, involving the synthesis of FFT and DVR methods, and propagation in the
Interaction Representation.
