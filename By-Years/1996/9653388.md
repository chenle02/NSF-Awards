New faculty at research intensive universities as well as new and more senior
faculty at universities which emphasize teaching are under increasing pressure
to broaden their skills and expertise to equally encompass research and
teaching. Additionally, new faculty at a variety of institutions are facing
increased personal stress as they attempt to balance a variety of personal and
professional obligations. This project's vision is to create self-supporting
networks among Minority Institution (MI) faculty and between MI faculty and
faculty at research-intensive institutions by bringing together current and
near-term faculty from these institutions to learn from and instruct each other.
Senior faculty will provide guidance to new faculty, those trained in the latest
research techniques will teach those less practiced or whose specialties are no
longer current. Particular emphasis is placed on involving current doctoral
students interested in pursuing faculty careers. In all cases, those willing to
invest the time and energy to expand their skills will have the opportunity to
network with others of similar interests. During the next 3 years, 90 faculty
and senior graduate students selected from among applicants at MI's and research
intensive institutions will participate in an intensive 5-day workshop held at
the University of Notre Dame. This workshop will emphasize a review of best
pedagogic practices, strategies for initiating or revitalizing a research
program, and instruction on effective mentoring practices for undergraduate
students. This project builds on existing collaborations which the GEM
Consortium has with faculty at a variety of institutions. This project promises
to leverage the resources and expertise of new and senior faculty at a variety
of institutions to build collaborative networks to improve teaching, research,
and mentoring.
