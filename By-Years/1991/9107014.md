This research is directed at establishing the conditions for the
adsorption/desorption phase transition for polyelectrolytes at the
solid/solution interface. A primary goal is to provide a comprehensive set of
data to examine some of the extensive theoretical work on polyelectrolyte
adsorption, which has not yet been fully tested, and to stimulate further
development of theory. Guided by recent theory, the effect on the adsorption
transition of variables such as the surface charge, polymer charge, supporting
electrolyte concentration, temperature and molecular weight will be examined in
detail. The principal means of regulating the surface charge will be through in
situ potentiostatic control of the electrical double-layer. Care will be taken
to produce surfaces with well-defined morphology so that the theory may be
tested with confidence. The thickness of adsorbed polymer films, as well as the
mode of attachment of polyelectrolyte molecules, will be examined by
ellipsometry and surface enhanced Raman scattering, respectively. Novel
applications of techniques such as the quartz crystal microbalance and infrared
reflectance will be undertaken to probe phase transitions in these two-
dimensional systems. Competitive adsorption studies using charged and neutral
polymers will reveal the relative importance of coulombic and non-coulombic
surface/polymer interactions. This research could potentially lead to advances
in electronic materials, biomolecular materials, and improvements in flocculants
for water purification.
