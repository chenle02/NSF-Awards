Swartz/Cornell University Project Summary The Cornell University Portable Radar
Interferometer (CUPRI) provides data for studies of ionospheric plasma and
neutral turbulence. CUPRI probes a variety of auroral and mid-latitude E- region
phenomena, F-region chemical releases, equatorial spread-F, and the polar
mesosphere. This renewal project will fund the continuing acquisition, analysis
and interpretation of CUPRI data. Both undergraduate and graduate students will
continue to play a role in CUPRI operations, data analysis, and data
interpretation.
