Abstract ATM-9400759 Wang, Bin University of Hawaii Title: Dynamics of the
Tropical Intraseasonal Oscillation The goal of this proposed research is to
futher develop physical understanding of the complex behavior of tropical
intraseasonal disturbances (TIS). The results gained from the study are expected
to be useful for future predictions of MJO and related climate variations. Three
interrelated research projects will be undertaken. 1. Interaction of TIDS and
mean tropical circulations A three-layer tropical atmospheric model describing
both the moist equatorial waves and time-mean flows will be used to investigate
the effects of a three-dimensional mean flow on wave development and
propagation, and the change of mean flow caused by momentum and heat transports
(or E-P flux) associated with wave activities. 2. Interaction of MJO and
tropical ocean To understand the nature of atmosphere-ocean interaction on
intraseasonal time scales, the PI will (a) perform numerical experiments with an
intermediate tropical ocean model to access the possible influences of an
ensemble of intraseasonal forcing on the ENSO cycle, (b) conduct an empirical
study of the relation between intraseasonal variation of SST and MJO to access
the degree of the coupling between SST and MJO, and c) analyze coupled
instability possibly arising from the thermodynamic coupling of the atmosphere
and ocean relevant to warm ocean regions. 3. Multi-scale structure of MJO and
higher-frequency disturbances The PI will investigate the multi-scale temporal
and spatial structure of the MJO and its relation to cloud clusters, tropical
cyclones, and extratropical forcing, using wavelet analysis and other effective
means. A strategy of combining theoretical, numerical, and empirical analyses is
adopted. Empirical analysis is used for revealing new facts and formulating
hypotheses, while theoretical and numerical modeling are used to explain the
phenomenon and te st the hypotheses. This research is important because it seeks
to understand variability on intraseasonal time scales.
