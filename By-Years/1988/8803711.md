This research covers VLSI physical design problems: macrocell- based custom chip
layout, interconnection within and between VLSI chips, and design for
testability. Layout problems are considered within a hierarchical automatic
building-block layout system. The problems are on timing-driven layout and
optimum layout of power and ground nets. The later problem is considered for the
case of three metal layers. Theory and algorithms for interconnection problems
are being pursued; and two specific problems are being solved. These are: three-
dimensional module interconnect including estimates of length and space, and
global and detailed routing. Also being considered are problems in routing
methodology for long-wire dominated custom chips and routing for wafer-scale
integration. Research at the interface between layout and testing is being
addressed. In particular, validation of assumptions made for design for
testability and reduction of hard-to-detect faults through layout are being
investigated. Computational geometry is being used to understand the problem of
designing repairable arrays.
