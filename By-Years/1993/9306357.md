This project continues a study of structured computational problems and
asynchronized iterative algorithms. The study includes questions related to the
structured perturbation analysis, design of efficient and robust specialized
algorithms for given classes of structures, implementations on modern high
performance computer architectures and applications to computationally intense
real life problems. Focus will be on the design of efficient and robust methods
for specific classes of very large scale computational problems coming from
applications in science. In particular such algorithms will be designed for
computational problems arising in nuclear scattering. Results will be applicable
to a broad class of problems in science and engineering, and will make effective
use of new computational architecture.
