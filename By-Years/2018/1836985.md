The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) is a National Science Foundation funded
facility that provides continuous scientific observations from the oceans at key
locations from the coasts to the deep sea. The OOI Observations come from over
500 deployed instruments aboard fixed (connected to the seafloor) and moving
(underwater robotic gliders) platforms. Observations are made available to the
community including constituencies such as scientists, fishermen, and interested
science classes, in as near to real-time as possible, and without any additional
costs. The current award will provide support to enable a successful transition
of the management of the OOI Facility from the Consortium for Ocean Leadership
to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and their partners the University
of Washington, Oregon State University, and Rutgers University. The transition
will take place over a four-month period, resulting in minimal impact on the
delivery of data to the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deliverables to be
completed under the award include an Annual Work Plan for the period October 1,
2018 to September 30, 2019, cost estimating plans, signed agreements and or
contracts between the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the subawardees,
re-assignment of leases, transfer of equipment custody, detailed plans for
configuration control, document management, and reporting, and Environment,
Health, and Safety Plan, procedures for environmental compliance, roles and
responsibilities associated with data delivery to the community, a cybersecurity
plan, and a community engagement plan. All of the deliverables will contribute
towards a successful and seamless transition, benefitting the broad
oceanographic community and all users of OOI data. OOI measurements improve our
understanding of processes impacting climate variability, ecosystems, fisheries,
geohazards, and the subseafloor environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
