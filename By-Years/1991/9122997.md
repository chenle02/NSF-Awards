The investigator will establish a network server for biological sequences
database entries, which will allow scientists to have access to these entries
without the overhead of maintaining local copies of entire databases. This
service will allow any user with an Internet confection to participate. FarFetch
will allow users to obtain sequence entries in a directly usable form as opposed
to conventional e-mail base sequence retrievers. Clients for the VMS, UNIX and
Macintosh operating systems have been written and are in the field. Development
of MS-DOS and Windows clients are planned. This award supports the purchase of
the server and supporting storage equipment. Client software will be made
available via anonymous FTP from the server. There will be no usage fees
associated with the server.
