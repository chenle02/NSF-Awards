The major goal of the proposed Euro-American Bi-Lateral Engineering Research
Workshop is to enhance effective interaction between state administrations,
local industries and academic communities in the United States and Europe, and
to provide the appropriate professional framework for technical discussions of
current practice and engineering research needs. The workshop will focus in the
area of Environmental Geomaterials with special attention to new technologies
and construction materials which ensure long- term containment performance of
engineered pollution seepage barriers in both constructed environments and
geologic media, for high or low risk radio-active materials, hazardous wastes
and a variety of chemical contaminants.
