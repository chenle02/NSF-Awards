Uridine kinase is the rate limiting enzyme in the salvage of pyrimidine
nucleotides, and in many cells or tissues it may be the only means for
synthesizing the nucleotides UMP and CMP. Our work on the enzyme from mouse
tumor cells shows that it is an allosterically regulated dissociating enzyme.
The enzyme is also inducible by the action of growth factors or mitogens. We
have developed methods for the complete purification of uridine kinase, have
prepared antibody to the enzyme, have completed the early phases for cloning the
cDNA for uridine kinase, and have obtained human and mouse lymphoma lines
mutated at the uridine kinase locus. With the above we plan to systematically
investigate structure-function properties of the enzyme by completing the
cloning and sequencing of the cDNA. We will prepare truncated cDNAs expressing
shorter enzyme fragments which wil be measured for loss or change of function.
The mutant cell lines also express enzyme with smaller subunits than normal:
these will be characterized to determine what kinetic/ functional properties
have been altered. Also, different types of cells or tissues each express only
one uridine kinase protein, but of varying size. We will seek to determine if
there are multiple genes, of which only one is expressed in a given tissue, or
if a single gene product is subject to variable processing mechanisms.
