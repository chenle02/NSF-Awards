Nano-gratings and atom interferometry will be used to measure static dipole
polarizabilities and van der Waals C3 coefficients for 15 species of atoms and
molecules. The polarizability measurements will be used to test atomic structure
calculations and to improve the accuracy of atomic clocks. The C3 measurements
will test calculations of atom-surface interactions that include core electrons
and realistic descriptions of surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts
of this work include a new course in atomic physics, support for student machine
shop work, and training several new students to become leaders in basic and
applied research. This research will foster collaborations with industry on
optics, nanotechnology, and solar energy utilization.
