The rates of photosynthesis of phytoplankton in the ocean are affected not only
by the availability of light and nutrients, but also by the turbulence in the
water column. Dr. Thomas will continue his studies on the effects of small scale
turbulence on the growth rate, cell division, and cell morphology of marine
phytoplankton using laboratory cultures. He will examine two red tide species
using varying degrees of intermittent turbulence. In addition, he will
investigate the effects of reduced temperature and turbulence on the viability
and behavior of the organisms. This research will aid in the prediction of red
tides in both time and space.
