This award will support an NSF/CMBS regional conference to be held at the
University of Louisiana at Lafayette in the summer of 2012 on the topic of
nuclear C*-algebras. The principal speaker will be Professor Wilhelm Winter from
the University of Muenster. This award will support 24 participants at different
stages of their careers.

The conference will focus on the recent advances made by Dr. Winter and his
colleagues in nuclear C*-algebras and their connections with topological
dynamical systems. Lectures will be designed to be accessible to graduate
students and mathematicians with only basic knowledge of C*-algebras, and new
open problems which present good research opportunities for graduate students
will be discussed.
