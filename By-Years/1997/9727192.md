Staubli 9727192 Research in molecular biology and genetics has led to the
development of techniques to delete or modify specific receptors or signaling
substances important for nervous system function. This work has revolutionized
the understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of physiological
processes believed important for the brain's regulation of memory, perception,
and the control of movement. The development of methods to test the three-way
links between the genetic changes, physiological mechanisms, and behavior have
lagged behind. This project develops a method for stimulating and recording
physiological activity in the nervous system in such a way that it can be
applied to the model organisms often used in molecular genetics. The hardware
and procedures developed by the project provide a way to assess brain function
and changes in awake, behaving organisms and relate them to functions at the
molecular level and at the behavioral level. This work would contribute to
understanding how neural systems at the cell and molecular level work to mediate
learning and memory, and in a more general way, provides a tool to explore the
link between molecular biology and behavior in many areas.
