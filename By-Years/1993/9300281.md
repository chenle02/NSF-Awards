This REU site award provides support for ten undergraduate researchers working
under the supervision of several faculty advisors on projects in diverse areas
of number theory, topology an mathematical models of population dynamics. They
will work both individually and in small groups. The site continues similar
activities ranging back to the beginning of the REU program. The record of
student accomplishments and science career choices has been excellent. Students
will be expected to prepare seminar talks and their work and submit final
reports at the end of the summer. Those whose progress has been particularly
successful will be encouraged to present their work at appropriate professional
meetings. In addition, it has been the tradition at this site to invite a
distinguished guest mathematician to spend a week or more with the students.
Past guests include Serge Lang, Harold Stark and Edwin Spanier.
