The efficiency of industrial microbial leaching of metal values from sulfide
minerals has remained erratic and unpredictable due to lack of quantitative
informatio about the relevant microorganisms. The goal of this research is to
gather systematic information about genetic make-up and metabolic pathways of
this bacteria. This will be achieved by developing reliable means for the
identification and classification of Thiobacillus, Leptospillium,
Acidiphiliuman, and yet unnamed bacteria important in mineral leaching in terms
of RNA base sequence. The base sequences will permit construction of
phylogenetic classification of these bacteria, which will permit the cohoice of
those microorganisms best suited for further investigation.
