In the nervous systems of all animals the neurons produce electrical patterns
which signal the next cell about an event. This type of communication is well
documented and is still under study. Central pattern generators are known to be
responsible for the production of most motor movements. In the last few years,
the notion of the central pattern generator as an autonomous network producing
stereotyped outputs has given way to a much more complex view. Central pattern
generators are multifunctional; that is, a given network of neurons can be
reorganized to produce a different pattern of activity. Dr. Hillel Chiel is
doing research to understand the cellular and synaptic basis of pattern
generation in neural networks. His research will entail (1) identifying
interneurons involved in the feeding central pattern generator of an
invertebrate, (2) analyzing their intrinsic biophysical properties and their
synaptic connections in culture, and (3) reconstructing a part of the network in
culture. This work is important because it will give us new knowledge about the
way nerve cells communicate with each other.
