A REU program will be established that focusses on the use of electrochemical
methods in the fundamental and applied studies of chemistry and chemical
engineering. Specific areas involve solid voltammetric electrode surfaces,
solid-state oxide electrode surfaces and battering electrode materials,
diffusion and mass tranfer of oxygen, and unhibition of enzyme activity using
electrochemical methods. The REU program will serve students from four.year
institutions in the upper midwest where there is limited research opportunities.
The student will be heavily involved in the research project but will also be
exposed to all aspects of the research programs at the university. The faculty
REU participants will present unformal seminars to the REU students on a regular
basis. Cooperation among student participants will be facilitated by weekly
group sessions. The REU experience is completed with a seminar presentation by
the student and the submission of a written final report which could form the
basis of a publication.
