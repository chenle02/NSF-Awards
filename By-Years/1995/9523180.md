9523180 Arnold This research focuses on the improvement of Ion Mobility
Spectrometry (IMS) with regard to sensitivity and dynamic range. The
construction of selective ion gating and ultra sensitive ion collection
electrodes, and formulating a new dynamic dilution approach to control source
analyze concentrations are the two methodq that will be used to improve upon the
specified features. These additions will yield an IMS instrument capable of 5 to
6 orders of magnitude of linear response with the additional benefit of ion
source chemistry control for more reproducible spectrometry. The IMS presently
performs tasks such as environmental monitoring and the detection of chemical
and biological agents. When this research is completed, the new technologies
will enhance the IMS performance, be integrated with other developments, and
greatly expand its commercial use.
