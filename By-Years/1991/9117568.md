The Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites provide a powerful new tool for
accurate geodetic measurements. Vectors between GPS receivers can now be
measured with accuracies of one centimeter out of a baseline of 100 kilometers
in the horizontal and 3-5 centimeters in the vertical direction. One major
contribution to the degradation of vertical positioning is inadequate correction
for time delays of GPS signals caused by water vapor in the troposphere. The
"wet-path delay" can be measured directly, in principle, using water-vapor
radiometers pointed along the line-of-sight to GPS satellites. However,
definitive line-of-sight experiments have not yet been performed. This project
will perform a definitive radiometer test by operating line-of-sight meters at
two permanent GPS sites in California. Tests will be conducted for two separate
one-month sessions during different seasons of the year. The object is to
develop wet-path delay correction techniques that optimize vertical GPS
positioning accuracy.
