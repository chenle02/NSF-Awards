Interactions between the immune and endocrine systems were first postulated
nearly a century ago. Investigations of the interactions between these two
important biological systems were sporadic over the next nine decades; however,
within the last few years, scientist have begun to realize the importance of
these two systems, and their interactions, in maintaining normal body functions
and combating disease states. Dr. Kasson has recently identified a new protein
produced by white blood cells of the immune system which communicates important
stimulatory information to the reproduction endocrine system. He thinks that
this protein may represent an important factor in immune-endocrine communication
and have proposed studies to investigate the nature and functions of this
protein. Initially he will define the nature and structure of the protein and
identify any similarities between this protein and other known proteins. Latter
studies will investigate how this protein interacts with cells of the
reproductive system and how it elicits responses in reproductive cells. These
studies will provide new information on how the immune endocrine systems
communicate and may uncover new insights into how defects in these pathways
produce disease states. A better understanding of the interactions between these
two important biological regulatory systems may lead to new therapies to treat
disease states involving deficits in immune-endocrine regulation (i.e.
autoimmune diseases, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, infertility, etc.)
