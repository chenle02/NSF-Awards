Rizzoli OCE-9633145 The general circulation, biogeochemical cycling and plankton
dynamics of the lower trophic level of the Black Sea will be investigated using
a hierarchy of increasing complex interdisciplinary numerical models. First a
one-dimensional coupled physical-biological model will be used to improve our
understanding of the biogenic element cycling, pelagic ecosystem carbon and
energy flow and microbial processes within the deep interior and shelf regions
of the Black Sea. Then three-dimensional studies will look at (a) the pathways
of nutrient transport and plankton productivity on the regional scale; (b) the
patchiness of chlorophyll concentrations in relation to mesoscale features of
the general circulation; and (c) the exchange of nutrients and biogenic
materials between the shelf and interior. The model results will be compared
with in-situ observations collected by several international programs.
