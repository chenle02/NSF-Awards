9509742 Hilbish The dynamics of hybrid zones consist of two major elements; the
dispersal of parent species and their hybrids into and out of the zone, and
their differential survival and reproduction. Strong selection operates within
hybrid populations of marine mussels species capable of large-scale dispersal.
The objectives of the work proposed here is two-fold. First, the hypothesis that
selection in the hybrid zone is determined by the environment will be tested and
potential selective agents identified. Second, the patterns of larval dispersal
across a portion of the hybrid zone will be described. This will serve to
identify the geographic and genetic origin of larvae that immigrate to hybrid
populations and are subsequently subjected to selection. Four hypotheses will be
examined to understand the role of specific environmental factors in selection
among hybrid genotypes. These studies will determine the coincidence of each
environmental stress with onset and duration of natural selection. These studies
will provide the basis for specific laboratory and field-experimental tests of
potential selective agents in future studies. Second, molecular genetic
techniques, developed with previous NSF support, will be used to determine the
origin of larval populations that recruit into hybrid populations. This
information will provide a foundation upon which to interpret the patterns of
selection observed within hybrid populations and potentially the fate of hybrid
larvae once they disperse out of the hybrid zone back into one of the parental
populations.
