Abstract

The main goal of this project is to develop new methods of nonlinear potential
theory, harmonic analysis, and partial differential equations applicable to a
wide class of quasilinear and fully nonlinear elliptic equations. Existence of
solutions understood in the renormalized or viscosity sense, sharp integral and
pointwise estimates of solutions, and removable singularities will be studied. A
related part of this project is concerned with nonlinear integral inequalities
for Wolff's potentials, as well as inequalities with indefinite weights which
appear in the form boundedness problem for linear partial differential operators
with distributional coefficients.

The proposed research will establish new applications to various problems of
nonlinear science, harmonic analysis, operator theory, and mathematical physics
which are widely used in the studies of heat transfer, fluid flow, quantum
theory, control theory, and stochastic processes. The broader impact will result
in further advances in understanding of basic nonlinear phenomena in applied
mathematics, physics, environmental and technological sciences which may be
useful in teaching and training of graduate students, younger mathematicians and
applied scientists.
