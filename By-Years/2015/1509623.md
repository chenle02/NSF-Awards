This travel grant provides partial support for U.S. participation in the
international event "Young Topologists Meeting 2015," held at the Federal
Polytechnical School in Lausanne, Switzerland, July 6-10, 2015. First started in
2007, the Young Topologists Meeting (YTM) is an annual European conference for
graduate students and young researchers in in the field of topology. The subject
of topology, the mathematical study of geometric properties that are independent
of deformation, has importance throughout mathematics as well as in a large
number of applications that range from theoretical physics to data analysis to
robotic motion planning. The YTM offers junior topologists the opportunity to
present their work to a large international audience, giving the speakers
experience as well as facilitating the dissemination of research results. In
addition, the YTM hosts two mini-courses by senior topologists that offer
introductions to advanced topics and provide gateways into these subfields for
even relatively inexperienced participants. This year the two mini-courses will
stress both of the great successes of algebraic topology: theory-building and
applications.

One course will offer an introduction to the theory of Infinity Categories from
a simple and formal perspective. Infinity categories are a relatively new
framework for understanding many tools arising in mathematics and physics,
including homological algebra, model categories, locality in field theories, and
theories of A- and L-infinity algebras. Although infinity categories can be
identified as playing a role in many areas of mathematics, their usefulness can
be limited by their combinatorial intractability -- a problem which will be
addressed by introducing infinity categories from this new viewpoint. The second
course will address applications of algebraic topology to data science. In
particular, it will describe the theory of Persistent Homology, which is a tool
used to extract meaningful inference from both large and multi-dimensional data
sets. As data becomes more ubiquitous, developing mathematical methods for
handling large amounts of data is paramount, and this course will introduce the
next generation of topologists to these problems and possible solutions through
topology.
