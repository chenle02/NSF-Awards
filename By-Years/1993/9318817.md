9318817 Berman University of California, San Diego has just been given the
opportunity to acquire from DoD (NRaD) an 8K CM-2. This machine is a SIMD
machine and provides a distinctly different programming model than that of
machines at UCSD and the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC). Acquisition of
the CM-2 would provide a major resource for our teaching and research. The CM-2
would be enormously useful to the Parallel Computation Lab, CSE Department and
UCSD in three areas: teaching, research and heterogeneous computing.
