9622714 Ponte-Castaneda This project will study the evolution of microstructural
changes during finite deformations of heterogeneous materials. Internal
variables will be used to characterize the current state of the microstructure.
These internal variables will be governed by incremental relations. Special
attention will be given to shear loadings which frequently are neglected in
earlier models. Several problems in the area of metal forming and ductile
fracture will be analyzed. These models are expected to be applicable to porous
and particle reinforced aluminum. ***
