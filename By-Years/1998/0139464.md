The REU program at the University on Michigan provides ten selected
undergraduate students from around the United States and ten students from the
University of Michigan the opportunity to participate for ten weeks during the
summer in research in the fields of astrophysics, atomic, molecular, and optical
physics, biophysics, condensed matter physics and high energy physics. Special
emphasis is placed on recruiting promising students from small liberal arts
colleges and historically black institutions that cannot provide this range of
research opportunities. The research experience is complemented by a wide range
of educational and social activities, helping the students to put their work in
a wider perspective and building a network of professional contacts for a future
career in physics. The program is continuously evaluated through a number of
short- and long-term measures, ensuring continued success in training the next
generation of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;
