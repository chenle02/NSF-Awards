Under this award, the PIs will conduct a systematic study of the partitioning of
water between common upper mantle minerals (olivine, pyroxenes, garnet) and
hydrous silicate melt. Peridotite melting experiments will be conducted over a
range of pressure, temperature and total H2O content thought to span the
conditions of partial melting in the Earth's upper mantle. Partition
coefficients for hydrogen and deuterium will be measured in these experiments
using the ion microprobe, and will be measured together with major elements and
select trace elements (Li, Be, B, LILE, HFSE, REE) in the same experiments. This
study will provide detailed data on the variability of the partitioning of water
between minerals and melt as a function of depth within the upper mantle, and
will directly compare the mineral/melt partitioning of water with that of
lithophile trace elements in upper mantle minerals.
