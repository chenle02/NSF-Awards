This project will develop compilation and implementation techniques for
declarative programming languages on distributed memory architectures. The
project consists of three parts. First, it will develop compile- time techniques
for cost analysis of mess\-age- passing implementations of declarative
languages. Second, it will develop and implement algorithms for granularity
control and task partitioning of languages with fine- grained implicit
concurrency on distributed memory systems. Finally, the project will develop
compile- time and runtime techniques for efficient execution of declarative
languages in the context of multi-level memory hierarchies.
