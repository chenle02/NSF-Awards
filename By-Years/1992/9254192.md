Oceanography is taken by 25% - 40% of our first year class, and it may be the
only science course many of these students experience. As a large class, it has
high visibility on campus and presents a vital challenge in efforts to provide
each student with a dynamic and exciting learning experience. Funds are
requested to support the creation of a set of interactive Macintosh computer
based laboratory tutorial/simulations, a comprehensive help database, and an
associated workbook. This material will be integrated with the existing graphics
database and computer automated quiz serving and fading software, and it will be
available on CD ROM and Internet to other colleges and universities teaching
oceanography. Many of the ideas and approaches developed for this project also
will be useful to others teaching large classes in other disciplines. The goal
is to make this large class experience every bit as exciting and dynamic as that
in smaller classes by creating material that will truly engage the students in
the subject matter, supported by a class structure that encourages student
responsibility and integrative thinking.
