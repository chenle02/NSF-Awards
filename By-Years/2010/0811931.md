With support from the Divisions of Chemistry and Chemical, Bioengineering,
Environmental, and Transport Systems, Dr. Hratch Semerjian of the Council for
Chemical Research will organize a workshop entitled "Right-Sizing Chemical R&D
Investments - A Critical Investment Strategy to Sustain America's Economic
Growth." A diverse group of about 30 academic and industrial leaders will
develop new methods of economic analysis needed to guide future study of optimum
and sustainable investment, from an economics point of view, that will continue
to provide a high rate of return on R&D investments. With a rigorous approach to
this question, the nation will be better positioned to "right size" and plan its
research expenditures, maximizing technical innovation, economic growth, and tax
revenues as well as increasing job opportunities for our diverse citizens.
