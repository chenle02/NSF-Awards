The investigator studies the continuous-time fractionally-integrated Auto-
Regressive Moving-Average processes and their variants, based on recent advances
in stochastic calculus of fractional Brownian motion. Such models provide a
general framework for analyzing univariate or multivariate discrete-time data
sampled from an underlying strongly-dependent continuous-time process. In
particular, the investigator develops methods for studying volatility,
fractional co-integration and temporal aggregation of long-memory time series
data. Time series data are data collected sequentially over time, and they
abound in science and other fields, e.g., finance. The investigator studies new
methods for analyzing time series data with long-memory temporal patterns. The
developed methodologies furnish general tools for analyzing changes in the
volatility pattern in the data, exploring structural relationships within a set
of time series data, and assessing effects of aggregating the data over longer
observational periods. These methods have applications in various fields, e.g.,
pricing of financial derivatives.
