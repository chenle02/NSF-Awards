Noltie of the Department of Natural Resources, University of Missouri-Columbia,
and his graduate student, Mr. Kenneth Lister, to develop a cooperative research
project in cooperation with Dr. William F. Humphreys of the Department of the
Department of Terrestrial Invertebrate Zoology of the Western Australian Museum,
Perth on the ecology, biology and evolution of cave fish that inhabit our
respective continents. They will survey prospective field sites in the vicinity
of Exmouth, Australia, ca. 1200 km north of Perth, as well as lay the groundwork
