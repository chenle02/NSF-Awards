Bodega Marine Laboratory (http://www.bml.ucdavis.edu/) is seeking 10 motivated
undergraduate students interested in marine science careers to participate in a
Summer Research-Experience-for-Undergraduate Program, supported by the National
Science Foundation. Over nine weeks, students will develop confidence and
independence in doing research and communicating science. Faculty and other
mentors will provide one-on-one research training, from choosing a topic to
writing a paper, in a friendly supportive environment. The program includes a
unit on scientific ethics as an essential element of a science career path.
Participants will receive a stipend, plus housing, meals and travel costs. BML
is situated on a biologically rich stretch of the California coast north of San
Francisco and is a part of the University of California at Davis. BML welcomes a
diverse and interactive community of visiting students and scientists each
summer. REU students can choose from a variety of study organisms, habitats both
marine and coastal terrestrial, and diverse areas of study, for example, coastal
oceanography, invasive species ecology, pollution effects on marine life, and
biodiversity. Students will also develop essential career survival skills,
including the code of scientific ethics. A goal of the program is to increase
the success of underrepresented minorities in marine science. Applications from
under-represented minority students are encouraged. More information is
available at http://www.bml.ucdavis.edu/student-info/researchexp.html or by
contacting Dr. Susan Williams (707-875-2211; slwilliams@ucdavis.edu).
