This project nwill investigate how language minority students appropriate new
forms of scientific sense-making through their participation in collaborative
scientific inquiry in biology (e.g., ethology, botany, ecology, embryology). The
investigation will be anchored in a description of the forms of scientic
understanding that Haitian students in grades 5-8 develop and an anlysis of how
these emerging forms are socially constructed in classroom settings. In the
framework of this project, understanding encompasses: conceptual knowledge in
biology, scientific sense-making practices, and epistemological beliefs about
science. The proposed work encompasses development of research instruments to
probe the various dimensions of students scientic understanding, direct work
with bilingual classroom teachers to enhance their competence to teach science
as collaborative inquiry, developmental research with children to determine how
their scientific understanding changes overtime, and ethnographic research in
classrooms to analyze how students scientific understanding is socially
constructed. Through empirical study of the ways in which scientific
understanding is socially constructed, this research will provide both a
theoretical rationale and practical model for building sense-making communities
in the science slassroom. It will characterize specific sense-making practices
which engender the development of scientific understanding in language minority
students. In addition, through its focus on biology, it will contribute to an
emerging knowledge base on conceptual change in biology.//
