The objective of this EArly Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to
explore the mechanisms through which different organizational structures drive
design decisions in the research and development of complex technological
systems. The study leverages a unique natural experiment that enables the first
direct empirical comparison of the multi-decade evolution of two functionally
identical systems, developed separately under different organizational
structures. Although significant prior research has examined both the fit
between technical and organizational architectures, and the implications of
different technical architectures for system lifecycle properties, the question
of how technical-organizational "fit" can drive desirable design outcomes
remains unexplored. To answer this question, rich process data on the sequence
of events, actions and decisions that describe the parallel development
processes will be collected. The data includes (1) in-depth interviews with each
of the key contributors, (2) proposals and progress reports written on a near
annual basis, (3) design documents, (4) press releases and (5) journal articles
capturing key outcomes. The data will be analyzed using a process tracing
approach, enabling a link to the underlying mechanisms driving each design
decision to the structure of the context of the corresponding technical and
organizational architectures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the insights
from this work have the potential to be transformative in that they will
characterize organizational configuration as a new design lever; this could
enable engineering organizations to harness research outputs more effectively
and influence the structure of the technology they produce. In addition, this
work has direct implications for current space policy debates on the role of
centralized investment in technology development and industrial policy. In that
context, prior work by the PI has been presented, at the request of executive-
level officials, at both the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). More broadly, on-the-ground
scientific data, on the actual design process, in real design organization, is
the foundation for a revolution in the science of design engineering. These
insights could yield advances in innovation productivity that will substantially
accelerate the national (and global) economy.
