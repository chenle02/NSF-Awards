This award provides partial support for the 1995 Sigma Xi forum. The forum marks
the 50th anniversary of Vannevar Bush's seminal report Science: The Endless
Frontier, with an examination of his assumptions about the role of the federal
government in supporting scientific research. The aim is to develop an updated
national mission statement for science in the aftermath of the Cold War and to
contribute to a guiding national vision for science and technology in the
decades ahead. Sigma Xi's extensive network of 500 chapters and clubs, with
outreach into the academic, industrial, and governmental sectors, provides a
solid base from which to stimulate this discussion. The forum's format,
patterned on previous successful forums, includes speakers, panels, and breakout
groups over a period of two days. Speakers include leaders in university and
industrial research, as well as government and foundation officials.
Participants will include scientists and officials from private and public
sector organizations. A proceedings volume will include breakout group
conclusions and recommendations as well as the texts of plenary addresses.
