The secretion of heterologous proteins that contain disulfide bonds is not at
its full potential. Evidence suggests that the regulation of the redox state of
the endoplasmic reticulum may be a bottleneck. A multifaceted approach is
proposed to probe and manage the redox state in yeast in order to investigate
the bottleneck hypothesis further and to ultimately increase secretion
efficiency. The four elements of the proposed work are: (1) amplify the products
of the individual genes now thought to be involved redox management to assess
the effect, (2) use display methods to uncover possibly missing pathway
elements, (3) add redox altering compounds to the growth medium to alter redox
state, and (4) develop a tachyplesin I substrate-based diagnostic system.
