This project addresses research in the design and analysis of algorithms,
motivated by applications in many other areas of computer science. Very similar
problems tend to arise in very different applications. As an example, the
``least weight subsequence problem'' which is studied in connection with certain
biological sequence comparison problems has also appeared in page layout
algorithms, VLSI design theory, and computational geometry. Also work in motion
planning for parts handlers may be couched in the language of automata theory,
and is closely related to some problems in coding theory. As a consequence,
theoretical computer science research might be most appropriately grouped by
solution style and technique, rather than by the problems that it solves. Along
with traditional sequential algorithms, there is work with parallel (PRAM model)
algorithms. Algorithms in molecular biology have become increasingly important,
as the quantity of DNA sequence information known has been growing more quickly
than the ability of computers to process it. Until recently, most workers in
biological algorithms were mathematicians and biologists. Their research
identified and formalized many problems in this area, but the algorithms they
developed tended to be simple applications of dynamic programming. This work
applies more sophisticated techniques to these problems, resulting in speedups
of one or two orders of magnitude. There will also be ongoing research on
problems of computing minimum spanning trees, both for graphs and for planar
point sets. The main focus is on dynamic versions of such problems as the
minimum spanning tree. This has led to a more general study of off-line
algorithms, and to data structures for querying the effects on the MST on
potential future update.
