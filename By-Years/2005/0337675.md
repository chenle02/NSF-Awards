&lt;br/&gt;This project have two general themes: 1) develop a new method of
doing research in education which they refer to as collaboration and 2) conduct
research statistical reasoning amount middle school students. The effort intends
to conceptualize teaching and learning of statistics as a form of data modeling.
It will conduct studies of statistical practices as used by professionals and
then carry out classroom studies of students at late elementary and middle
grades. The investigators intend to develop new formative and summative
assessments of student learning in statistical reasoning and establish
partnerships with participating teachers and develop materials.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;They will do comparative case studies of statistical consulting in a
quasi-experimental design where client domains and local work practices are
selected to serve as independent variables in the analysis, and the achieved
generality of concepts that lie behind statistical procedures serves as the
dependent variable.&lt;br/&gt;
