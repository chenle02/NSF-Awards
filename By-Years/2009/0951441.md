This engineering education award to Mississippi State University will develop
innovative new graduate and undergraduate degree programs in engineering that
are customized to the needs and strengths of veterans. A particular emphasis
will be including research experiences and industrial internships within the
degree program. The results will also be presented on the web, at technical
conferences and published in professional journals. The project is expected to
assist the transition of veterans to civilian life and to enhance the number of
students who complete engineering degrees and are ready to fill engineering jobs
or start new high tech businesses.
