This project focuses on the study of the extremal metrics in Kaehler geometry,
the Calabi flow and related PDEs, such as the complex Monge-Ampere equation and
an operator recently suggested by S. Donaldson. The stability conjecture in
Kaehler geometry relates the existence of the extremal metrics to the stability
of the underlying complex projective variety. The stability conjecture and
related problems are fundamental problems in Kaehler geometry, which has tight
relation with the partial differential equations, complex analysis and algebraic
geometry. The precise understanding of the Calabi flow will lead to solving such
a conjecture. Inspired by Perelman's success in Hamilton's problem to solve
geometrization conjecture by Ricci flow, the PI proposes to study the Calabi
flow to attack the existence of extremal metrics. The key issue for the Calabi
flow is the long time existence, the asymptotic behavior and related problems.
Based on the previous work of the PI and his collaborators, he plans to further
study the Calabi flow on Kaehler surfaces, in particular on Del Pezzo surfaces
and toric surfaces. The PI also plans to study the regularity problem of related
PDEs, such as the complex Monge-Ampere equation, which is a fundamental equation
in Kaehler geometry and is also closely related to the extremal metrics and the
Calabi flow. In particular, the PI plans to study whether some regularity
result, which has been proved for the real Monge-Ampere equation, holds or not
for the complex Monge-Ampere equation. The study of S. Donaldson's operator will
give new insight on this. Donaldson's operator can be viewed as an operator with
some nature of both the real and complex Monge-Ampere operators.

Problems in the proposal arise naturally from our attempts to understand
geometric partial dierential equations from geometry and physics, which have
tight relation with many other fields such as algebraic geometry, complex
analysis and mathematical physics. One of the key features of these problems is
how the global structure of a space influences the local, analytic properties of
the solutions of such equations. Understanding this general principle will have
broad impact in physics and other fields of science in general. The proposed
research will have immediate beneficial effect on students in PI's home
university.
