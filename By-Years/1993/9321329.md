9321329 Weisheit The program focuses on a variety of atomic processes related to
ionization and recombination events in plasmas. Emphasis is placed on phenomena
that occur in dense plasma environments, high magnetic fields or intense
radiation. The research is relevant to a better understanding of laboratory and
cosmic plasmas, X-ray lasers, quasars, stellar atmospheres and certain fusion
experiments. ***
