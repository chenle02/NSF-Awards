This award will support the travel costs of young researchers based at U.S.
institutions, in the mathematical field of Geometric Group Theory, as they
attend the Young Geometric Group Theory IV conference in Spa, Belgium, January
11-17, 2015. The week-long conference is designed to teach young researchers
some of the tools they'll need to know to be productive members of their
research communities. More information can be found at
http://java.ugent.be/yggt4/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will feature
four minicourses (on Hyperbolic groups, outer automorphisms of free groups, and
buildings) and seven research talks, all aimed at the level of graduate students
and other young researchers.
