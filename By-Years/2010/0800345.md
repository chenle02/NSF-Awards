The research to be conducted lies at the interface of numerous mathematical
disciplines in which there has been exciting progress recently. It involves in
particular the theory of dynamical systems (specifically the study of concrete
and natural group actions on locally homogeneous spaces), algebraic group
theory, analytic number theory, automorphic forms and spectral theory,
arithmetic combinatorics and mathematical physics (the quantum mechanical
behavior of classically chaotic systems). By using the rich toolbox given by the
mathematical disciplines above with particular emphasis on the tools from the
theory of dynamical systems, we plan to tackle fundamental questions in the
theory of group actions on homogeneous spaces, Diophantine approximations (e.g.
the Littlewood Conjecture and effective versions of Oppenheim Conjecture),
arithmetic, and the theory of automorphic forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope
that the research conducted in this project will build new bridges and
strengthen existing bridges between seemingly disperse mathematical disciplines.
Unlike other sciences, mathematical knowledge does not become obsolete, and by
discovering new connections between different subjects one can bring to bear
deep results, both new and old, to the fundamental questions mathematicians
investigate. A key part of the proposal is the investigation of the space of
lattices in d-dimensional Euclidean space --- a space whose investigation began
more than 100 years ago by the mathematician Hermann Minkowski to better
understand the basic properties of number fields and other purely theoretical
questions, and which is now used in an essential way in many algorithms to
tackle real life problems. While it is hard to predict what practical
applications the improved understanding of the space of lattices we hope to
attain via this proposal may have many (or maybe not so many) years down the
road, the algorithmic success of lattice space techniques suggests such
applications are quite likely.
