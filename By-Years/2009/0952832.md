Effective dynamic memory disambiguation limits many practical approaches for
code analysis, optimization, and debugging. An efficient solution to this
problem could unlock additional performance and increase the reliability of
computer systems.&lt;br/&gt;A potential avenue for overcoming the traditional
limits of hardware memory disambiguation is through the use of signature
registers. Such registers can operate on hundreds of addresses simultaneously
and can be exposed to software through a flexible and general interface for use
in a wide variety of systems. However, because signatures represent sets of
addresses imprecisely, they are prone to false positives which limit their
accuracy and effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
investigates the effectiveness of exposing signature registers to software.
Using scenarios from code analysis, optimization, and debugging as case studies,
the effectiveness of signatures is compared to other hardware memory
disambiguation techniques to evaluate their performance, complexity, and power
costs. The hardware implementation for signature registers is investigated and
refined to reduce false positives. &lt;br/&gt;
