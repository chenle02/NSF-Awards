Professor Mowat will carry out experiments on the ion- storage ring, CRYRING,
at the Mann Siegbahn Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. The dynamics of electron-
induced dissociative processes in HeH+ + e collisions as well as the hyperfine
structure spectroscopy of highly ionized (aluminum-like) ions will be the focus
of his research.
