This is a collaborative project of the University of Central Florida and the
University of South Florida. Ten undergraduate students will be involved in the
program which will span the calendar year. The students will select from several
possible projects to provide a more active involvement in the program. They will
follow a course of general immersion within the research environment including
regular meetings, and plans for professional presentations. Examples of the
kinds of projects with which the participants will work, are the following:
segmentation of optical flow field, modeling human walking for computer vision
system, pose estimation using motion trajectories, function-based modeling of
articulated objects, range image analysis, and parallel algorithms in computer
vision.
