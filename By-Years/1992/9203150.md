The focus of this research is to quantify transformation rates between
dissolved, colloidal, small particle, and large particle size classes in the
surface and deep waters of the Atlantic basin. The approach is to use highly
sensitive thermal ionization mass spectrometry and radiochemical procedures to
determine 234Th, 228Th, and 230Th in the various size classes. The colloidal
phase, traditionally collected along with the filtrate, will be sampled in-situ
using a cross-flow filtration technique. Field sampling methods will involve the
collection of large particles using filters (33um) and the direct separation and
collection of colloidal (5,000 NMW-0.2 um) and dissolved (&lt;5,000 NMW)
fractions using in-situ cross-flow filtration. These data will allow for a
separation of the processes of sorption onto particle surfaces from the
aggregation/disaggregation of colloids and suspended particles. In particular,
the mass contribution of colloidal Th and the potentially important role
colloids play as reactive intermediates in oceanic particle cycling and metal
scavenging will be assessed.
