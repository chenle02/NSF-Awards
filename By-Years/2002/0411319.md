Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal incorporates NMR as an
integral part of the instructional methodology of each upper division and
laboratory course within the department. NMR spectroscopy is introduced to
students starting in the first semester of organic chemistry and each subsequent
course builds on this foundation of 1D and 2D NMR. The NMR is also used in
undergraduate research projects, required of all majors. High school teachers
and students are provided with experiences using NMR through a series of
workshops and classroom experiments. Faculty and students from a neighboring
college also have full access to the NMR facility. The goals of this proposal
are evaluated with four methods: 1) administrating the ACS course exam for the
final in each course in our curriculum, 2) evaluation of our seniors with the
ETS senior exit exam, 3) monitoring successful completion of advanced degrees
completed by our graduates, and 4) subjective evaluation using a tool developed
by the University of Florida in 1999 that is specific to using NMR in the
curriculum.
