The objectives are to extend and validate a methodology to improve the
understanding of the link between structural design allowables for fiber
composite materials and the constituent properties of the fiber and the matrix.
The research is to improve the guidance for screening, assessing, and developing
new fibers, resins, and processes for pertinent design applications. This is an
analytical and experimental investigation. This project is one supported under
the Creativity Awards for Undergraduate Engineering Students.
