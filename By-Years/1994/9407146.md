This proposal involves the study of equilibrium and non- equilibrium properties
of nuclear matter, with applications to heavy-ion reactions, the effective
nucleon-nucleon interaction in nuclear matter, and the nuclear equation of
state. The research will employ the quantum mechanical Green function formalism
of Kadanoff and Baym. Other applications include a study of the collision term
in transport equations from a quantum mechanical viewpoint. ***
