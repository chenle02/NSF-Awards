Male ornaments, such as horns, spurs, and bright feathers have attracted the
notice of humans for centuries. These traits evolved as the male-male
competition and female partner preferences. This project employs a multi-
disciplinary, multi-trait perspective to determine the relative roles of nature
(genes) and nurture (environment) on the evolution of these characters. In
particular, the interaction of genes and the environment on multiple metrics of
male performance will be examined as well as the effects of environmental
variation on the partner preferences of females. Narnia femorata, a cactus bug,
is an excellent species for this research because juveniles in the wild grow up
on cacti with and without fruits. This difference in diet affects male
attractiveness to females and the development of male weapons (enlarged hind
legs) used in territorial competition on cactus plants. The investigators will
breed insects with and without cactus fruits to examine the influence and
interactions of genes and nutritional environments for males and females. This
work will draw on field ecology, behavioral ecology, evolutionary biology, and
quantitative genetics to provide one of the most comprehensive studies to date
linking natural environmental variation with male performance and female mating
decisions. This research will be an important step in understanding how
environmental variability influences the action of selection on these
characters. In addition, a core objective of this research collaboration is to
have broad, positive impacts on society. This project will provide opportunities
for graduate students and undergraduates to become involved in an international
partnership and will also make research results accessible and engaging to the
general public.
