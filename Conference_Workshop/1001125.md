This grant is to support US participants traveling to the Summer School on Hodge
Theory that will take place at the Abdus Salam International Centre for
Theoretical Physics (ICTP), Trieste, Italy, from June 14 to July 3, 2010. The
objectives of the Summer School are to give an overview of modern Hodge Theory
with an emphasis on integrating the geometric and algebraic aspects and on
highlighting the increasing interest on the arithmetic/geometric aspects of the
theory. The hope is to present to students the overall framework of the subject
and to introduce them to promising areas for future study and research. Thus
this summer school on Hodge Theory will provide a unique opportunity for
graduate students and young researchers to enter one of the most active areas of
current research in algebraic geometry.

Hodge theory is an important area of differential and algebraic geometry with
deep connections to many fields of mathematics and physics. Hodge theory has
involved techniques drawn from algebraic, arithmetic, analytic and diff^erential
geometry, as well as from topology and partial di^fferential equations. This
summer school on Hodge Theory will provide a unique opportunity for graduate
students and young researchers to enter one of the most active areas of current
research in algebraic geometry.
