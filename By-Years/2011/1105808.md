This project investigates the connection between geometry and topology of
3-manifolds from the point of view of triangulations. This is closely related to
the discretization of SL(2,C) Chern-Simon theory in 3-dimensions. The PI
proposes to use the volume functional on the finite dimensional space of circle
valued angle structures as the basic tool. Given a closed triangulated
3-manifold or pseudo 3-manifold, there are Haken's theory of normal surfaces,
and Thurston's algebraic gluing equation associated to the triangulation.
Haken's theory is topological and studies surfaces in 3-manifolds, and
Thurston's equation is geometric and tries to construct hyperbolic metrics from
triangulations. Solutions to Haken's equation are well understood. However,
there is no known existence theorem for Thurston's equation. The main objective
of the proposal is to establish conditions on the triangulation to guarantee the
existence of solutions to Thurston's equation. The PI will focus on the
following conjecture relating Haken's equation with Thurston's equation. It
states that for any closed minimally triangulated irreducible oriented
3-manifold, either there exists a solution to Thurston's algebraic equation, or
there exist three special solutions to Haken's normal surface equation which has
exactly one or two non-zero quadrilateral coordinates all supported in a
tetrahedron. A weaker form of the conjecture has been established by the PI
recently using volume optimization. Recent work of Futer-Gueritaud, Segerman-
Tillmann, and Luo-Tillmann shows that the conjecture in the case of simply
connected 3-manifolds is equivalent to the Poincare conjecture in dimension
three (without using the Ricci flow).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our universe is
3-dimensional. To understand the shapes of the universe and other 3-dimensional
solids, mathematicians developed the theory of 3-manifolds using topology and
geometry. To investigate these 3-dimensional spaces, one of the revolutionary
ideas of William Thurston says that one should use geometry and geometric tools
to understand the space. This program of Thurston is called the geometrization
of 3-manifolds and has dominated the study of 3-dimensional topological
investigation for the past 40 years. Recent work of G. Perelman, using the Ricci
flow method developed by R. Hamilton, established the conjecture of Thurston and
revolutionized the field. Perelman's work is widely considered to be one of the
major mile-stones in the history of mathematics. However, there remains the
problem of how to find those geometric structures theoretically predicated by
Thurston, Perelman and Hamilton. One of the goals of the proposal aims at
developing algorithms to find these geometries on 3-dimensional spaces.
