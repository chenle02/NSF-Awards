Computational geometry is an important area of computer science, with
applications in graphics, 3D modeling, robotics and topology. Geometry Week
organizes the flagship conference for computational geometry with several
workshops, most notably the Young Researchers' Forum, where PhD students and
Postdoctoral researchers can present their work. The project expects to support
the equivalent of 10 full support participants and 5 half support participants.
The proposal also aims to increase the representation of under-represented
groups at the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The travel support provided in this
project will help bring young researchers in the field of computational geometry
together and create synergies and idea exchanges to solve problems, and open up
new areas for study. Past versions of this effort have been productive in
generating several high-impact research papers in addition to encouraging and
mentoring young researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
