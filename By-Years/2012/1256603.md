This project will execute a research strategy to determine the processes
underlying tree ring formation, from the individual tree level tree-ring
formation to regional patterns of plant growth at the landscape scale. The
researcher will also use field and remote sensing observations, combined with
field manipulations, to establish the causal relationships of climate
variability and tree ring growth. The project builds on an EPSCOR-funded field
program called Nev-CAN (Nevada Climate-Ecohydrological Assessment Network),
which will provide high temporal and spatial resolution monitoring of
atmospheric, soil and vegetation variables using in place instrumentation and
remote sensing. The study areas are the Sheep and Snake Ranges in Nevada, where
the primary tree vegetation is mountain conifers, including the Bristlecone
pine, a tree used extensively in paleoclimate reconstructions using tree rings.

The broader impacts of the proposal include postdoctoral mentoring and an
international collaboration with a Canadian group active in this type of work.
The study has the potential to improve our understanding of how bristlecone
pine, a tree that provides some of the longest and most important paleoclimate
records, reacts to climate variability. In addition, the results of this work
may contribute to improved risk assessments for Great Basin ecosystems.
