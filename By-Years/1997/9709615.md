Most difficult decisions require tradeoffs among competing objectives that
cannot be maximized simultaneously. This research investigates how changes in
perceived task goals lead to changes in the relative weighting of decisions.
This research will test the recently proposed task-goal hypothesis. According to
this hypothesis, tasks whose goal is to differentiate among alternatives lead to
greater weighing of the most important objectives than tasks whose goal is to
equate alternatives. The proposed research has important implications both for
theories of decision making and for methods of measuring preferences in decision
analysis, marketing and public policy.
