Principal component analysis (PCA) has long played a central role in
dimensionality reduction and compression. However, the fact that PCA is a data-
dependent transform that is traditionally determined via a computationally
expensive eigendecomposition often hinders its use in severely resource-
constrained settings. Hyperspectral imagery is a prime example---although PCA
offers excellent decorrelation and dimensionality reduction when applied
spectrally to hyperspectral image volumes, the fact that many hyperspectral
sensors are airborne or spaceborne devices limits wider use of PCA. In such
applications, it would be greatly beneficial if PCA-based dimensionality
reduction and compression could be accomplished without the heavy encoder-side
cost entailed by traditional PCA. This research investigates a process that
effectively shifts the computational burden of PCA from the resource-constrained
encoder to a more capable base-station decoder.

The studied approach, compressive-projection PCA (CPPCA), is driven by
projections at the sensor onto lower-dimensional subspaces chosen at random,
while the CPPCA decoder, given only these random projections, recovers not only
the coefficients associated with the PCA transform, but also an approximation to
the PCA transform basis itself. By using encoder-side random projections, CPPCA
permits dimensionality reduction to be integrated directly with signal
acquisition such that explicit computation of dimensionality reduction at the
encoder is eliminated. Computation and memory burdens are instead shifted to the
CPPCA decoder which consists of a novel eigenvector-reconstruction process based
on a convex-set optimization driven by Ritz vectors within the projected
subspaces. Research activities are aimed at further understanding CPPCA both
analytically and practically, including the exploration of CPPCA in data arising
in geospatial applications, and the development of adaptations to the basic
CPPCA process so as to improve performance on anomalous data.
