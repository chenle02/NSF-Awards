The objective of this project is to undertake a fundamental and quantitative
study of the manipulation of cell metabolism for the enhanced synthesis of
foreign proteins. The proposed research program will use a combination of
experimental and theoretical methods to examine the influence that induced
protein expression has on amino acid regulation and cell growth. This study will
use an expression vector for the induced synthesis of a homopolypeptide,
facilitating a detailed examination of intracellular amino acid depletion. In
addition, this research will examine metabolic and product expression
characteristics dynamically, using a specially designed on-line cell mass
measurement device in concert with a dynamic metabolic model.
