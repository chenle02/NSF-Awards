Discrete tandem (DT) production lines, such as transfer lines, form the heart
of critical industries such as the automobile industry, and are highly capital
intensive. This effort aims to enhance the tools available for design
optimization of DT lines. The approach involves using simulations of continuous
tandem (CT) lines, where the product in the line is continuous fluid. This has
the potential of resulting in more efficient simulations, and much faster
optimization schemes--with perhaps two orders of magnitude reduction in CPU
times when these two possibilities are combined. The methodology involves: (i)
studying how to create accurate CT representations of DT lines, (ii) devising
fast optimization schemes for these CT simulations, and (iii) translating the
results to near-optimal DT line parameters. This research focuses on one
configuration of a production line, it should make a fundamental contribution to
the state-of- the-art in manufacturing systems analysis. It has the potential to
provide a richer set of tools for analysis of other types of discrete
manufacturing systems. It is expected that this research will have a short term
practical impact and a longer term theoretical impact.
