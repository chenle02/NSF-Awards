Current spoken dialog systems are generally not pleasant to interact with. While
human interlocutors can deftly negotiate and control pace, and smoothly signal
understanding, control intentions, attitude, and so on, most dialog systems deal
poorly, if at all, with these dimensions of interaction. Lacking this, dialogs
tend to be stilted, awkward and frustrating, tend to demand careful attention,
and tend to be time-inefficient. To address these problems, this research
program seeks to develop and evaluate techniques that allow dialog systems to
interpret and generate non-verbal and other indications of attitude and feeling,
thereby improving these real-time aspects of system
usability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs are recording human-human dialogs in
controlled domains, analyzing the prosodic and contextual cues that humans use.
Further, they are seeking to interpret these cues as expressing pragmatic
dimensions of the interaction. The result will be a model of real-time
interpersonal interaction as manifested in spoken dialog. This model will be
useful for the development of more usable systems for voice access to
information. The findings may also support the construction of spoken dialog
systems for more challenging dialog types, such as teaching, advising and
selling.&lt;br/&gt;
