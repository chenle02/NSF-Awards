9416148 Goltz This research is to study the impact of real-time seismic
information on the response and recovery activities of government agencies,
utilities and large corporations in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The major
objectives of this study will be to review the performance of programs which
provide real-time seismic data, examine the intended and actual utilization of
this information in the earthquake and to identify improved methods of
information delivery and application as well as data requirements. Focused
interviews with real-time information providers and recipients will constitute
the main form of data collection; review of written pans, directives, issues
papers and other documentary evidence will be a secondary source of data for
this study. This project is a contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Program and is supported by the Northridge Earthquake Emergency
Appropriation. ***
