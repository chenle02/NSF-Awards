The eighteenth international conference on parallel architectures and
compilation techniques (PACT) will be held in Raleigh, North Carolina, September
12-16, 2009. PACT is a multi-disciplinary conference that brings together
researchers from hardware and software areas to present ground-breaking research
in parallel systems ranging across instruction-level parallelism, thread-level
parallelism, multiprocessor parallelism and large scale systems.&lt;br/&gt;This
award is to make travel scholarships available to students and universities not
typically represented at PACT in order to improve the impact and outreachof this
conference.
