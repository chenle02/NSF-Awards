This project will support the participation of junior researchers (students,
postdocs, and early-career faculty members) in the 2022 Data Science and
Analytics conference that will be held on February 12, 2022, at the Center for
Data-Driven Science on the campus of the Florida Atlantic University. This is
the fourth such conference hosted by the FAU College of Science. The conference
aims to facilitate interdisciplinary interactions and collaborations in data
science and artificial Intelligence for scientific discovery. It is anticipated
that the interactions fostered by this conference will lead to cross-
disciplinary collaborations as well as new ideas needed to accelerate progress
towards a better understanding of the mathematical foundations of artificial
intelligence in the context of fundamental and applied physics
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
