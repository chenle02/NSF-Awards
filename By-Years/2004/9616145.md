9616145 Leasure Computers and software are often proposed as a solution for
weakness in science and mathematics education in K-12, but without a theoretical
and experimental basis for the application of technology, funds may be mis-spent
and education weakened. Unfortunately, the body of theoretical and experimental
results is difficult to apprehend due to its cross-disciplinary nature, small
publication base, rapidity of change, overburden of market-motivated and
anecdotal results, and cost of experimentation. This project gains access to the
most relevant research to explore alternatives for the computer-based
realization of the situational mathematics process, a learning approach used to
improve mathematics education among the predominantly Hispanic 6-12 grade
students of South Texas. The use of funds will allow visitation to leading-edge
research sites, visits by other leading researchers to the university, and funds
to purchase equipment and software for technological exploration. The use of
project funds will be guided by an oversight committee made up of the leading
researchers in mathematics education. ***
