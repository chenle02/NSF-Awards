9321393 Cruickshank A Gordon Conference on the Chemistry of Electronic
Materials is being held to address current topics in the chemistry of synthesis,
processing and use of semiconductors, dielectrics and metals in a wide variety
of potential areas in the field of electronics/photonics with a strong emphasis
on fundamental atomic level processes. Particular focus will be on critical
chemical issues in nanoscale technology. Additionally there will be an
opportunity to assess the field, and to establish ties between universities,
research institutions, and industry. It is expected that top scientists in the
field will attend, and that the Conference will provide an effective forum to
discuss and delineate the critical scientific issues in this research area, and
to consider and define the approaches and techniques needed to address them.
Understanding and controlling processes at the atomic level are becoming
increasingly important for electronic and photonic materials. %%% An evaluation
of the status of Chemistry of Electronic Materials, and especially the critical
chemical issues in nanoscale technology, and recommendations by the Conference
participants for the emphasis of future work, and their assessment of the most
important contemporary research issues will be of great value to the
understanding and enhanced utilization of chemical methodology in the field of
microelectronics. ***
