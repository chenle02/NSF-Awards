Research conducted by the Presidential Young Investigator will focus on
development and application of methods for reconstructing environmental changes,
using terrestrial records having both time control and wide distribution. New
dating and paleoenvironmental methods developed by the Principal Investigator
for rock varnish coatings, will permit radiometric age assignments and
chronometric age-determinations of many previously undateable desert surfaces.
Chemical changes in surface coatings have been found to record systematic
variations in past levels of dust, alkalinity and photosynthetic pathways of
adjacent vegetation. The next phase of research includes study of hillslope
debris in humid-temperate environments and further development of rock varnish
dating methods. Understanding environmental changes depends on obtaining "proxy"
records that are both dateable and ubiquitous. Desert varnish and slope
colluvium deposits hold great promise to provide important information for
paleoenvironmental reconstruction of past events in both semi-arid and humid
environments.
