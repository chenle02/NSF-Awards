The proposed objective is to develop a new instrument which will be able to
image the structure of human biological molecules nondestructively, in situ, in
three dimensions, with Angstrom-scale resolution. The technical means by which
it is proposed to achieve this goal is called magnetic resonance force
microscopy (MRFM). This new instrumentation technology was first described in
1991 by the proposers 13, 14, 17 . It combines the Angstrom-scale spatial
resolution of scanning probe force microscopy with the three-dimensional imaging
capability of medical magnetic resonance imaging.
