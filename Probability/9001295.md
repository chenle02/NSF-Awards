Mixing rate problems concern the rate of convergence in distribution of a
Markov process to its stationary distribution. The motivation for this research
is Monte Carlo sampling from a complicated combinatorial object X. If one can
construct a process with state space X and stationary distribution uniform on X,
and if one can show that the process converges in distribution to that
stationary distribution rather rapidly, the simulation of the process allows
simulation of points nearly uniformly distributed in X. This technique can give
accurate polynomial-time probabilistic approximations to problems. This research
will focus first on two cases of this kind of problem. This first is generating
a point at random from a convex polytope. The second is generating a random
sample path of a self-avoiding random walk. Covering problems concern the time
taken by a stochastic process to visit all of the collection of subsets of its
state space. Typically the process is a random walk on a finite graph, and
interest is in the time taken to visit all vertices. This work will concentrate
on aspects of covering times other than bounds on expected values, particularly
tail probabilities.
