In 2015, NSF awarded $6 million to establish four regional Hubs across the
nation, focusing on data science innovation and partnership building. Then, in
October 2016, NSF announced selections for Big Data Spoke projects and planning
grants to work in concert with the BD Hubs. These travel funds will support
participants to attend the first workshop on the hubs and spokes. This proposal
aims to establish an open-attendance workshop at IPDPS (IEEE International
Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium) 2017 and fund fifteen individuals.
Those funded will primarily be workshop presenters, including spokes and
planning grant PIs or Co-PIs, considered based on their experience, research
breadth and relevance to the event, diversity, and interdisciplinary blend. The
invited talks and posters will come from PIs and collaborators on BD Hubs and
spokes projects, and will highlight the current research-related activities
facilitated by the BD Hubs. The audience for this workshop will include
researchers interested in partnering with the BD Hubs and spokes on topics of
interest as well as meeting Hub members within their geographic area. This is
the first workshop on the hubs and spokes and will showcase NSF's considerable
effort to a large and relevant audience. It is a unique and interdisciplinary
event spanning several topics deemed a high priority by members of the research
community from across the country during the formation and extension of the
national network of big data hubs. A successful workshop will enhance visibility
of research related to the big data spokes projects, increase participation and
enthusiasm for hub-related activities in the South and nationally, and create an
expanded network of experts, members, and partners of the hubs. It will also
stimulate networking and recruitment of potential collaborators for current and
future work in the program, and magnify outreach related to hub-related
research, education, community-based resources.
