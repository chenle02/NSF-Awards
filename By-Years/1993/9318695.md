9318695 Sauer This project will investigate the fundamental principles of load
modeling to establish a theoretical basis for generic load representations. The
investigation will work from the framework of time-scale separation and singular
perturbation as the primary mathematical basis for static models. From this,
characteristics such as frequency and voltage dependence will be examined.
Dynamic load models will then be investigated to determine which structure
captures the important physical load characteristics while also remaining
computationally efficient. Issues which will require clarification include the
differences between the frequency of load voltage and the frequency of load
current during transients with the quasistatic approximation. The proper
dependence of quasi-static load power on bus voltage, and other dynamic
quantities will be investigated. ***
