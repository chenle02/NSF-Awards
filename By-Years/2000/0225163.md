The Center for the Study of Wireless Electromagnetic Compatibility was
established in the College of Engineering at the University of Oklahoma in 1994.
Its purpose is to link with the various industries affected by wireless
technology and bring them together to develop common solutions. This is
essential for the health growth of these industries. It is expected that the
growth of the cellular phone industry will continue to accelerate and exceed
that of the personal computer industry in the 1980's. The research focus of the
Center has been carefully developed to support the needs of the wireless
industry as defined through an original pilot study, the Charter of the Center,
and the continual input from the Center's Industry Advisory Board. The Center's
research focus encompasses the following: Electromagnetic compatibility between
products in the wireless industry and the following electronics industries;
Medical; Automotive; and Aviation. Research leading to the identification and
resolution of interaction mechanisms between the radiating devices in the
wireless industry and other electronic devices. Research concerning the
development and growth of wireless technology as well as future bands of
transmission.
