The northward flow through the Bering Strait transports nitrate-rich Pacific
waters into the Arctic basin. This influx supports the richest productivity
found in the Arctic. It has been hypothesized that export of part of this
productivity could supply significant amounts of organic matter to the central
Arctic. Part of the productivity is consumed within the Chukchi Sea via
sedimentary carbon oxidation, and the rates in the U.S. region of the Chukchi
are moderately high. However, new measurements of sedimentary sulfate reduction
rates indicate that past estimates were several-fold low. Furthermore,
conversion of inorganic nitrogen to N2 by denitrification in these sediments
appears to be rapid. Thus, the sediments in the American Chukchi may oxidize
more of the productivity and remove more of the nitrogen than previously
thought. Furthermore, a large pool of organic rich sediments underlies much of
the Russian Chukchi Sea, suggesting that even larger areas of sedimentary
consumption, perhaps with even greater rates of oxidation and denitrification,
may occur in the Russian areas. The organic rich areas of the U.S. and Russian
Chukchi Sea will be sampled throughout the ice-free regions in mid summer of
1996. At each site, sediment-water fluxes of O2, N2, N2O, inorganic nutrients,
TCO2, and alkalinity will be measured in replicate flux experiments. Vertical
profiles of sulfate reduction rates will be determined by current 35SO4 tracer
techniques. Porosity, organic matter content and pore water distributions of key
solutes will also be determined. These data would expand our knowledge of
sedimentary carbon oxidation and denitrification rates and their role in the
productivity cycle in the Chukchi Sea. The improved estimates of these
sedimentary processes will better estimate the potential for this region to
export significant quantities of organic matter to the rest of the Arctic basin.
