The Arizona State Museum is a repository for one of the largest ethnographic
collections in the country. Specializing in objects made by Native Americans in
the Greater Southwest, it is an invaluable resource for anthropological research
and public education. The objects preserved document Native American culture
since the 17th century. This project will enable the Arizona State Museum to
alleviate seriously overcrowded storage conditions and preserve over 3,000
baskets and 1,500 textiles. Funding will be used to purchase a compact shelving
system and metal cabinets which will provide a barrier against environmental
pollutants, insect infestation, and fluctuations in temperature, light and
humidity. These curation measures will greatly increase the accessibility of
these significant collections for future research use and will ensure their
safety and longevity.
