A microcomputer laboratory of varying capacity IBM computers in the Department
of Mathematics at St. Mary's University, San Antonio will facilitate the
development of a new bachelor of science program in applied and computational
mathematics. A new course in mathematical modelling will be introduced and
computers will be integrated into several mathematics courses starting with the
calculus sequence.
