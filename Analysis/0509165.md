. The proposal is for partial support of the Midwest Several Complex Variables
Meeting that has met annually since 1970s. The primary objective of the meeting
is to bring together graduate students, young investigators, and more senior
researchers. The program features plenary talks by eminent mathematicians, with
subsequent discussions with younger participants divided into groups each led by
one of the main speakers. The larger part of the funding will be used for the
travel support of graduate students and young PhDs.
