ABSTRACT CTS-0307099 A. Acrivos, CUNY City College

The primary goal of the NSF proposal is to study theoretically and
experimentally the interaction of suspended particles with a traveling electric
field having a constant amplitude. This interaction originates through the time
lag of the polarization of the particles and the suspending fluid due to the
spatial variation of the field phase in a traveling electric wave.

This project will address electro-hydrodynamic phenomena originating through the
imaginary components of the polarization of particles and a suspending fluid,
which are responsible for the loss of the electric energy. In particular, a
traveling electric field was observed to drag a fluid whereas a high gradient
electric field whose phase is constant does not generate the fluid flow.
