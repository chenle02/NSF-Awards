Dr. William H. Scouten and other members of the Chemistry Department of Baylor
University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1993-5, twelve
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a
variety of research projects. Projects range the traditional areas of chemistry
- analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry. A unique feature of
this program is the involvement of historically black and hispanic campuses as
well as predominately minority junior colleges.
