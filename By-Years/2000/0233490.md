0233490&lt;br/&gt;Sanders&lt;br/&gt;This award supports William Sanders, a
junior faculty member, and two students from the University of Illinois-Urban-
Champaign in a collaboration with Peter Kemper of the Department of Information
Science at the University of Dortmund, Germany. The project will focus on the
use of Kronecker representations and analysis methods within the Moebius
framework. The Moebius framework was developed at the University of Illinois and
makes validation of large systems models possible by supporting many different
model solution methods as well as model specification in multiple modeling
formalisms. Kronecker representations, studied by the German group, area a
mathematical way to handle large models for functional and quantitative analysis
by exploiting the fact that complex models are often built by composition of
submodels, and have revolutionized the way state-based models are represented
and solved. The joint research will provide a formal semantics for model
composition that will allow for investigating the use of Kronecker techniques
for new model composition formalisms, and will make it possible to use Kronecker
methods developed with other methods already supported by the Moebius
tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
