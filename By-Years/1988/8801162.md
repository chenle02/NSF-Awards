This project involves mathematical research that is motivated by quantum
mechanics. The quantum mechanical point of view is to represent observable
quantities by linear operators on Hilbert space rather than by scalars. In some
models, the observables give rise to an algebra of operators. Time evolution is
given by a coherent rule specifying a transformation of the algebra at each
moment. Mathematical manipulations allow one to read off properties of the
system being modeled from the way it evolves over time. In the present
undertaking, a rather general sort of time evolution, called a semigroup of
endomorphisms, is to be studied with the goal of obtaining a scheme of
classification. More specifically, the problem of developing an index theory for
such semigroups in analogy with the index theory for unbounded hermitian
operators will be investigated. A scheme for classifying all adjoint-preserving
semigroups of endomorphisms of the algebra of bounded operators on Hilbert space
for which there is an intertwining semigroup of isometries will be sought.
Results obtained for the latter situation will be applied to semigroups of
endomorphisms of the hyperfinite factor.
