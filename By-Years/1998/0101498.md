Major challenges face the Northwest and the nation both in sustaining
environments and economies and in developing educational programs to meet
present and emerging needs. Natural resources and resource-based economies are
severely threatened; restoration and conservation based on ecosystems approaches
must be implemented through public-private partnerships supported by education
programs developed in concert with new land management efforts. As an Advanced
Technological Education (ATE) focal point, the Northwest Center for Sustainable
Resources (NCSR) is transforming two-year community college programs to meet the
needs of the technological, high performance workplace in natural resource
management.

The Center is: (a) marketing and distributing curriculum projects and
clearinghouse materials both in traditional formats and electronically through
the Center's website. (b) offering faculty development institutes for high
school teachers (NCSR's Natural Resources Institute) and community college
instructors (NCSR's Ecosystem Institute and GIS Institute). (c) developing and
delivering new NCSR Adaptation Institutes to provide frameworks for curriculum
adaptation for community colleges and high schools across the nation. (d)
disseminating the Center's model partnership approach through institutes and
presentations; emphasizing employer connections and infusion of industry and
professional standards into technician education programs.

This project is building on successful Center activities including the
development and beta-testing of over 30 courses; production of materials,
newsletters, reports, and a Website; and the offering of over 20 faculty
development institutes.
