Abstract - Ungar &amp; Seider - 9632992 Process design engineers spend much of
their time developing and refining process models. Such models are typically
built using graphical editors to assemble model fragments (for individual units
or processes from code and equation libraries) into simulators. In addition,
extensive historical plant data is also available. Process models often fail to
accurately predict this plant data, due to inaccurate parameters in the model,
incorrect model equations and structure, or faults, disturbances, or inaccurate
measurements. The PIOs plan to address two related questions: (a) how to use
available data effectively to improve process models, and (b) how to use data
and models to detect and diagnose abnormalities in plant operation. The goal is
to build intelligent simulators which will aid in understanding and improving
models based on measured data. This project is to develop methods for automating
the process of preparing simulations, using chemical process simulators like
ASPEN PLUS and SPEEDUP, and interpreting their results. Its long-range goal is
to develop techniques for the automatic generation, modification, and
interpretation of dynamic simulations and to apply them to data reconciliation,
fault diagnosis, plant and controller design, and operator training. In this
work, the PIOs plan to concentrate on an initial stage of the project: the
development of a designerOs aid that can prepare a simulation model, compare the
results of a simulation with plant data and guide the process of improving the
model. This involves the development of methodologies for (1) the detection of
changes and outliers, (2) the representation of information describing the model
fragments, (3) the initialization of dynamic models, (4) the selection of model
fragments, and (5) the generation of explanations. Historical data, from
operating plants, as well as reference models, will be obtained from the CIM/21
system.
