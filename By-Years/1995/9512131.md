9512131 Hsu This is a two year award proposed by Dr. Pei-Feng Hsu, Florida
Institute of Technology and Professor Chih-Yang Wu, National Cheng Kung
University. The investigators propose to compare the integral, YIX and Monte
Carlo solutions for a rectangular and axisymmetric geometry. Nonhomogeneous
distributions are the key element of this study. The objective of this project
is to develop benchmark solutions of radiative heat transfer. This proposal
requests funds to enable a U.S. Ph.D. graduate student to spend one semester at
the National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan to work with Professor C.Y. Wu and
for the P.I.'s travel. Benchmark solutions for this system are important in view
of increasing trend toward high temperature manufacturing, materials processing
and energy production. There is a strong need for computation solutions taking
into account the effects of radiation on the total transport phenomena. This
project can advance a computation method for estimating radiative transfer and
provide opportunities for a U.S. graduate student international experience to
research and study at a university in Taiwan for one semester.
