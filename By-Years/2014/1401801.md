The plant oil-based polymer technology developed by the research group possesses
some major attributes that will lead to new application opportunities for
renewable materials. First, the number of functional groups, such as double
bonds, hydroxyl groups, and epoxide groups, per molecule is very high, which has
been shown to dramatically reduce cure rates and increase properties such as
glass transition temperature, modulus, tensile strength, hardness, and chemical
resistance of thermosets. In addition, copolymerization has been used to
increase polymer thermomechanical properties, impart desirable
solubility/dispersibility characteristics, and to introduce desirable reactive
functional groups to polymers. Several of the novel polymers have been shown to
meet or exceed the performance of petrochemical-based materials for some
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At present, about 90% of all chemicals are
based on fossil resources. Due to the finite nature of fossil resources,
dramatic fluctuations in the price of oil, and concerns about the environment,
society has taken a greater interest in the use of renewable resources for
applications that currently utilize petrochemicals. Successful further
development of this renewable polymer technology has the potential to reduce
societies' dependence of fossil resources, while also reducing environmental
issues associated with petrochemical-based materials.
