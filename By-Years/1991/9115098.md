Adaptive critic methods, and they alone in the current neural-network
literature, hold the potential of providing neural nets that to some extent
mimic a very important aspect of intelligence - the ability to learn about some
part of the world through observation and, though trial and error, to discover
how to successfully cope with that world. With several networks interacting with
each other they come somewhat closer to brainlike activities than do most other
models. There are risks, however, in this approach, as there are heuristic
aspects of the formulas to be implemented and it is impossible to rigorously
analyze the performance of these heuristic due to the massive parallel and
nonlinear nature of the networks. This research will involve computational
experiments with various problems that are easily (either analytically or
computationally) solvable using conventional dynamic programming to evaluate the
potential, and problems, of adaptive critic methods.
