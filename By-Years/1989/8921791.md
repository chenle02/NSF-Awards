This grant is in the general field of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of photoelectrochemistry of molecular thin films and interfaces.
Professor Neal Armstrong of the University of Arizona will study the effects of
order in thin film preparations of molecules prepared by vacuum thin film
deposition methods on the photoelectric response. Various methods of optical and
electron spectroscopy and electron diffraction will be used. The role of
interfacial substrate chemistry on the order and electronic response will also
be determined. Sensor devices will be explored by microscopic engineering of the
molecular composites into circuits. Multiple methods of electron and optical
spectroscopy, photoconductive response and electron diffraction will be used to
study the structure of phthalocyanine, perylene, donor-acceptor complexes and
quinones prepared as thin films on semiconductor surfaces. In addition,
modification of the layer structure by metal deposition will be studied. The
determination of the effects of long and short range order in the thin film and
the substrate surface chemistry on photoelectronic response will be
accomplished.
