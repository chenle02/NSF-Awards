The Science Department is purchasing a FT-IR and gas chromatograph for use in
the organic chemistry courses. Students in the new courses are gaining hands on
experience with two of the basic spectroscopic, analytical, and sample
manipulation tools available to chemists in the field of organic chemistry.
Students are using Infrared Spectroscopy and Gas Chromatography techniques to
test for purity, identifiy the product distribution, and characterization of
compounds they have synthesized.
