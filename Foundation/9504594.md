9504594 Knight Knight's research program, both in her hands and in those of her
students and collaborators, involves a range of topics in recursive model
theory. In this project, she will be working on several levels of abstraction,
from seeking new metatheorems to clarify connections between theories and their
models, to addressing problems about models of specific theories. One part
involves finding an algorithm for constructing a mathematical object (e.g., in
the setting of reduced Abelian p-groups) whose initial description is not
effective. Another part concerns making precise the connections between
recursion-theoretical complexity and model-theoretical definability. The current
grant provides some essential travel and supply needs for Knight's research
group. Their research activities concern an area of logic whose main focus is
computability, and which has ties to methods of building models for mathematical
theories. ***
