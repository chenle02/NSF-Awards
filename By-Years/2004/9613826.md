The PI will conduct a three-year program to develop a short-term forecasting
capability for propagation disturbances in the equatorial ionosphere.
Specifically, he will address the day-to-day variability in the development of
plasma structure in the nighttime equatorial ionosphere. This will be
accomplished with a meridional chain of ionospheric stations that spans the
magnetic dip equator. This chain will enable simultaneous measurements in the
plasma-density distribution as a function of altitude and dip latitude in both
hemispheres. Moreover, measurements of the neutral wind will not be necessary.
Specific aims of the project are: (1) simultaneously measure the plasma-density
distribution as a function of altitude and dip latitude, along a magnetic
meridian in both hemispheres, (2) measure conjugate E-region characteristics in
both hemispheres during the development of ESF, (3) evaluate the precursor
signature for ESF development using measurements in both hemispheres, (4)
perform comprehensive tests of various short-term forecasting methods, and (5)
measure the longitudinal correlation of nightly ESF development.
