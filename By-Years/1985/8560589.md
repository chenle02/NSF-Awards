Theoretical predictions are to be made for the characteristics of finite
amplitude, shallow water waves without the restriction on one-dimensionality.
Two independent spatial periods in the two horizontal directions will be
modeled, representing long-crested and short-crested waves. The complete model
will be enclosed in a simple software package.
