Little is known about the frequency and outcome of genetic recombination in
natural populations of single-celled organisms. In one group of single-celled
organisms, the ciliated protists, genetic recombination occurs by means of
conjugation. Unlike genetic recombination in plants and animals, conjugation is
disconnected from reproduction, which occurs by simple binary fission.
Conjugation is a rejuvenating event that initiates a new life cycle. This
research combines field and laboratory studies of conjugation and multiple
mating types in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. This species, which has
seven mating types, is widely used in molecular biology but its ecology is
poorly known. We will test two hypotheses: first, that conjugation occurs
frequently in natural populations, and second, that the frequencies of the
mating types are determined by both genotype and by the temperature of the
environment. The results will provide increased understanding of an ecologically
important group of protists, and will be relevant to the ongoing debate over the
origin and implications of sexual reproduction and genetic recombination.//
