It is well known that in order to communicate effectively, it is not enough to
speak in grammatical sentences. One needs to start from what the hearer knows or
is interested in and get from there to the new information that one wants to
convey. Understanding how human speakers do this is important as a pure research
topic but it is also of great practical importance: enabling humans and machines
to communicate in natural language will help with a variety of information
transfer tasks, including tutoring, search, and translation. To make headway
beyond the linguistic studies that are currently underway, a unified,
universally accepted coding system for the phenomena that influence this part of
language understanding is needed. In computational linguistics, uniform
standards for marking text and annotating corpora are increasingly recognized as
the key to progress; they allow researchers to make sure that they are
consistent in the way they apply categories. They also allow the use of machine
learning methods to help researchers to gain new insights and to analyze more
texts more efficiently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop project focuses on
two aspects of this coding problem, an understanding of the notions of
'discourse status' (is the referent being mentioned new to the discourse or
already familiar?) and of 'animacy' (e.g. is the referent a human, a machine, an
insect, a building?). The workshop brings together linguists and computer
scientists with the goal of creating a gold standard coding procedure for these
two important categories of linguistic content. The findings will then be
disseminated through the auspices of several large linguistic annotation
projects that have ties to key computer science working groups.&lt;br/&gt;
