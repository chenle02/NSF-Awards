The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this Career
award to Bowling Green University. With this award, Professor Felix Castellano
will design, synthesize and characterize photochromic luminescent quenchers
based on transition metal complexes dispersed in polymer matrices. Metal-to-
ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited states using a series of Ru (II) and Re
(I) compounds in polymer matrices will be used for a variety of data storage
applications such as write-once-read-many systems and read-write-erase systems.
One- and two-photon photochemical and photophysical processes of these polymer
composites will be determined to evaluate potential photonic device
applications. Development of new inorganic chemistry laboratory course in
partnership with a private science center will provide new education and
training opportunities to students. Planned science exhibits will reach a large
segment of population including students at different educational
levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photochromic luminescent quenchers based on
