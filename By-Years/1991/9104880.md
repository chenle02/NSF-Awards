A conference will be held at Cold Spring Harbor on the molecular neurobiology
of drosophila. Approximately 150 international scientists will participate and
support will be available to attract young scientists. Topics to be discussed
cover a number of areas in neurobiology including neuronal determination, ion
channels, neurotransmitter systems, sensory transduction and complex behavior.
