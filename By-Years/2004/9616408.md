A novel technique to mitigate the effects of fouling on heat transfer surfaces
will be explored. Using the techniques of genetic engineering, a peptide with a
strong affinity to bind the metal ion that causes scale formation will be
sought. This peptide will remove the ion from the working fluid upstream of the
heat exchanger in an ion-binding peptide column, thus preventing fouling.
Methods of regenerating the peptide for repeated use will also be investigated.
The study will focus on calcium carbonate as a common example of a scale-forming
substance.
