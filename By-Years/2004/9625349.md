Dr. James Espenson and Dr. Andreja Bakac of the Department of Chemistry, Iowa
State University, are supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division for studies to develop a
molecular level understanding of oxygen atom transfer. They will probe the
mechanisms of oxygen atom transfer reactions of transition metal oxygen and oxo
complexes. The studies include the use of the complex, methylrhenium dioxide
(MDO), as a prototype oxygen atom acceptor, and inorganic oxyanions and
transition metal oxo complexes as oxygen donors. Kinetic and thermodynamic
determinations will be carried out to construct a scale of oxygen atom transfer
reactivities on the basis of the Marcus equation. The effects of hydrogen
bonding on the stability of superoxometal complexes will be studied using
deuterium isotope effects, and the chemistry of superoxo and oxo ions of
biologically relevant chromium complexes will be investigated. Chemical
reactions in which oxygen atoms are transferred from one metal to another or
from metals to non-metals are fundamental to many biological and industrial
processes. However, advances in this area are currently hindered by the lack of
a fundamental understanding of these processes. In this project, Espenson and
Bakac will determine the rates and pathways by which oxygen is exchanged between
various atoms, and they will relate these studies to the current theory which
describes electron transfer reactions. They will explore oxygen transfer systems
with industrial and biological relevance.
