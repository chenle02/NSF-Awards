This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a
portable, low-cost, multi-pathogen rapid detection instrument for food products.
This instrument is expected to be fully integrated and will include a
microfluidics-based bioseparator / bioreactor for pathogen capture and dual
transducers for pathogen detection. The Phase I work will focus on the
development of a proof of concept for the microfluidics-based bioseparator /
bioreactor system. The commercial application of this project is in the area of
food processing and food distribution.
