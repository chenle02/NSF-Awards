The immense importance of fungi in the functioning and maintenance of ecological
processes in nature is unquestioned, but our knowledge of their biodiversity is
far from being complete. Tropical forests are thought to be the terrestrial
ecosystems characterized by the highest fungal biodiversity, but a major portion
of this biodiversity has yet to be documented. This project provides the
opportunity, during each of three summers, for at least four undergraduate
and/or graduate students to spend a month carrying out biodiversity studies of
fungi and fungus-like organisms associated with tropical forests in northern
Thailand as research projects. In Thailand, the students will interact with
scientists and graduate students at Chiang Mai University, Mae Fah Luang
University and the Mushroom Research Centre.

Student participants will be selected from a pool of applicants that will come
from universities throughout the United States. The international aspects of the
project are expected to represent an extraordinary training/educational
experience for these students, since the interaction with their student
counterparts in Thailand will involve sharing the same accommodations, joint
field work at study sites in northern Thailand and laboratory-based sessions
during which they will work together on processing and analyzing samples and
data.
