This project involves an interdisciplinary team designing, testing, and
disseminating innovative assessments for biotechnology. Using research-based
design principles, the project is focusing on two types of assessments,
conceptual and embedded. Embedded assessments are enabling the measurement of
student learning while the students participate in activities designed to foster
critical thinking skills. Conceptual assessments probe how deeply students
understand. This project is collecting and analyzing data to ensure that
assessments are valid and reliable. Student data, as well as reviews by student
focus groups and teacher advisory panels, are informing the revision of
assessments. A careful delineation of learning goals based on national standards
and an expert review panel is ensuring that the assessments are applicable for
broader use. The study builds on previous work to refine and rigorously test and
validate a concept inventory and set of embedded assessments. The concept
inventory and embedded assessments in biotechnology are being disseminated at
conferences, in publications, and on a web site. The web site highlights
research results in three areas: 1) a model for assessment design in other
college courses, 2) a resource bank of assessments with associated scoring
rubrics and examples of student work, and 3) ways to use assessments effectively
in the college classroom.
