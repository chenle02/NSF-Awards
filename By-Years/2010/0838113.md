Mathematical Sciences (21). This project is adapting multimedia demonstrations
of mathematical concepts to make them accessible to students with sensory
disabilities. The intellectual merit of the activity lies in its use of a well-
recognized and established collection of resources, "Demos with Positive Impact"
(CCLI-EMD DUE-9952306) as the source material for adaptation. Major components
include adapting existing animations for captioning and audio; addressing issues
of text legibility for display of mathematical symbols; and adapting existing
web pages for more effective use with screen readers. The project is also having
a broad impact by enabling the target audience to have access to previously
unavailable high quality multimedia demonstrations.
