Digital simulation is becoming dominant in not only many fields of physical
sciences, but computer science as well. Despite the great improvements in
processing speed over the past decades, advanced research on large-scale systems
requires simulation engines that are more powerful than the average desktop
workstation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Computer Sciences at the
University of Texas at Austin will assemble an infrastructure for performing
large-scale, memory-intensive simulations. Called Mastodon, this infrastructure
will consist of a large number of rack-mounted Linux/x86 servers, each with
multiple processors and several gigabytes of physical memory. Leveraged by
industrial and university matching funds, we anticipate scaling Mastodon to 418
processors and nearly a terabyte of DRAM. The cluster will utilize both
distributed batch scheduling using the Condor job management software, as well
as soft partitioning for timing and parallel
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This infrastructure will service the needs of
a majority of our department's faculty. The projects utilizing Mastodon include
the areas of systems (specifically, architecture, compilers, and run-time
systems), network algorithms, computational biology, multi-agent robotics, and
formal verification. In each of these areas, Mastodon makes multiple projects
feasible, whereas with conventional computing infrastructure, most of these
projects cannot even be attempted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This
unparalleled simulation resource will be made available to a broader community
as well, including students attending summer camps to increase female enrollment
in computer science, undergraduates for both educational class project and
research use, and researchers in regional departments with insufficient
resources to perform high-end simulations.&lt;br/&gt;
