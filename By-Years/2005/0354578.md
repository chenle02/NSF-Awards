This project is investigating the impact that experimentation with
nanotechnology has on middle, secondary, and university students' learning of
science and perceptions about science. The enabling tool of this project is the
nanoManipulator (nM), a device to receive visual and haptic feedback from
investigations of nanometer-sized objects. In a series of studies involving
scientists and students engaged in collaborative guided inquiry experiences, the
research team is researching the role of multiple representations (visual or
haptic) on the learning of scientific concepts of students with varying
cognitive, affective, motivational, and sociological characteristics. The study
is also examining the cognitive and affective outcomes on students' perceptions
of the nature of science and scientists. In addition, members of the project
team are exploring the development of a low-cost alternative to the current nM
research tool.
