This action would provide funds for continued research in elementary particle
physics. The scientific staff consists of three faculty, four research
associates and four graduate students. They conduct experiments at the
accelerator facility at Fermilab. Their research is in two broad categories:
Operation and upgrade of the Collider Detector Facility at Fermilab to study
proton-antiproton collisions at two trillion electron volts. The scientific
goals include a search for the top quark, precise measurements of the parameters
of the electroweak theory, accumulation of a large number of B- Mesons to
measure the parameters describing transitions among quarks via the weak
interaction and exploratory studies of the highest energy region available
today. This effort is conducted with an international collaboration in which
many other NSF supported scientists participate. A series of experiments
studying the breaking of the symmetry known as "charge conjugation - parity".
The experiments all involve the decays of K - mesons. Experiments E773 and E799,
proposal P832 and the proposed facility "Kaons at the Main Injector" are all
dedicated to these studies. The kaon program is led by NSF supported scientists.
This work is a continuation of research supported under grant PHY 8815915.
