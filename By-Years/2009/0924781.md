The project focuses on investigations of the mesosphere/lower thermosphere
region through examination of airglow spectra obtained at both low and high
latitudes. The low latitude study will analyze spectral data on the OH Meinel
band obtained by equatorial astronomical observatories. OH observations of OH
are routinely used to investigate key mesospheric variables such as
temperatures, tides, and gravity waves. The aim is to help resolve a current
controversy about the temperature variability deduced from different OH
rovibrational bands: the sky spectra from OH (v=3) and (v=8) bands will be
compared with temperatures deduced from the O2 O-1 Atmospheric band. The high
latitude study will use a new spectrograph, dubbed CESAR, developed under a
recent NSF MRI award which will be sited and operated in coordination with the
Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar. The new spectrograph will obtain
observations of the OH Meinel nightglow which will be compared to the
observations from low latitudes. Spectra obtained during aurora will be analyzed
to determine the temporal behavior of N2+, N2, and O2+ as well as the auroral
enhancements in OH and O2. In terms of broader impacts, the project adds an
important new instrument to NSF's Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar facility,
constituting a new community resource. The improved understanding of
discrepancies currently reported in inferences of mesospheric temperatures from
OH measurements will benefit researchers as well as investigations of
climatological trends. A woman scientist will be supported at the start of her
research career and undergraduate students will be involved in the project.
