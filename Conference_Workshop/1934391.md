This award provides funding for travel to a workshop entitled "Workshop in
Commutative Algebra" to be held at the Banff International Research Station in
the period October 20-25, 2019. It will feature six different topics within the
discipline of Commutative Algebra, with twelve group co-leaders presenting
proposed problems of study and directing the research conducted during the week.
It will provide new collaborations and strengthen the research network of the
forty-two participants in attendance. Researchers at all stages of career are
involved, providing opportunities for those in beginning and mid-level positions
to not only interact with experts in the field, but to explore leadership
opportunities during the workshop.

Commutative algebra is a mature field, with deep roots in number theory and
algebraic geometry, yet also with growth in its own right. It has thriving
branches bearing exciting fruits, especially as a trio of different decades-old
conjectures recently fell, making a collaborative workshop particularly timely.
The topics to be investigated at the conference include methods in primes
characteristic, Rees algebras, resolutions and complexes, combinatorial--as well
as tropical--commutative algebra, and rings of differential operators. This
workshop has the goal of bringing together high profile researchers from
underrepresented communities. More information can be found at

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
