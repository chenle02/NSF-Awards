This action is to provide support for research in probabilistic mechanics and
earthquake engineering, with emphasis on: 1) analysis of structures with random
properties using stochastic finite element methods, 2) analytic derivation of
seismic ground motion spectra using three-dimensional seismic waves, 3)
simulation of stochastic processes, fields and waves, and 4) non-periodic
inspections of fatigue-sensitive structures by Bayesian analysis. This award is
in accord with conditions contained in NSF 91-112, "Young Investigator Awards FY
1992 Program Guidelines for Submission of Nominations". Results of this research
may be applied to engineering design processes for the analysis of structural
systems, including the response to earthquake-generated ground motions.
