Abstract

Award: DMS-0533519 Principal Investigator: Yair Minsky

A workshop on "Hyperbolic Geometry" will take place at the Fields Institute in
Toronto, Ontario on May 23-27, 2006. The workshop is associated to the winter
program at the Institute on "Holomorphic Dynamics, Laminations, and Hyperbolic
Geometry" and will focus on the assimilation of recent advances in hyperbolic
geometry and 3-manifolds, the consolidation of new techniques, and the forging
of new directions and connections with related fields. Hyperbolic geometry and
the study of 3-manifolds have arrived at a crucial juncture due to Perelman's
results on Thurston's Uniformization Conjecture and the solutions of other
important problems including the Tameness Conjecture, the Ending Lamination
Conjecture, and the Ahlfors Measure Conjecture.

This award will support U.S. participants, especially junior researchers, in a
workshop at an international research center. The topic of the workshop,
hyperbolic geometry, has its roots in the 19th century search for geometries
that satisfy all of Euclid's axioms but the Parallel Postulate, and has turned
out to be a critically important structure for 2- and 3-dimensional spaces. More
information on the workshop and its parent program at the Fields Institute is
