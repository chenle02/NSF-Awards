This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II program focuses on
developing carbon nanotube-based electromechanical pressure sensors. To
translate the change in pressure into an electrical signal, current solutions
(MEMS devices) use membranes with sensors made out of doped silicon. Silicon,
however, is prone to effects of temperature changes and as a result, such
devices require additional electronics for temperature compensation and more
stringent packaging. They also have sensitivity limitations. The device in this
work will use carbon nanotubes as strain gauges. Because nanotubes have higher
sensitivity (higher gauge factor) and better temperature stability, this will
result in development of devices that are easier to manufacture (fewer
manufacturing steps), have superior precision, and require less stringent
packaging, leading to less expensive end-product. This work will combine
chemistry for synthesis of materials and microfabrication to explore important
properties of a novel nano-material carbon nanotubes. Key technical innovations
will include precise placement of nanotubes on thin membranes, novel approaches
to avoiding membrane damage during nanotube integration, forming nanotube
circuits on membranes for electromechanical pressure sensors and other
integration issues.

If successful, the project will lead to the first application of carbon
nanotubes in high-end electronic devices, enabling the development of nano-
electromechanical systems (NEMS), which convert mechanical effects into
electrical signal. Such devices, which would include pressure sensors,
accelerometers, gyroscopes and acoustic sensors, could address the unmet needs
in a wide range of applications, such as in automobiles, safety, medical,
military and process control. Specifically, in the automobile market, a
nanotube-based pressure sensor could serve as a tire pressure measuring device
and could result in over $180million in annual savings for such end users as the
automotive industry.
