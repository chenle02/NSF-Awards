In collaboration with scientists from the Monsanto Company and other area
industries, the Mathematics and Science Education Center of the Cooperating
School Districts of St. Louis, Inc., will develop and help biology teachers
introduce biotechnology units into their classes. Because it is a relatively new
area and most biology teachers have not had experience with it, this highly
important and rapidly developing field of biology is seldom included in current
classes at the pre- college level. However, teaching materials for grades 9-12
have already been written and piloted by the Center; these will be finalized and
teachers will be trained in their use so that they can be broadly introduced
into St. Louis area schools. Complementary materials for the 6th grade will be
developed and tested in actual classroom use. Materials for the 7th and 8th
grades will be developed in a subsequent project. Though the materials are being
developed and proven in St. Louis schools working with local scientists and
engineers, they will be available for national dissemination when classroom-
proven. Initial dissemination will be undertaken in this project by introducing
the materials into classrooms in other cities where Monsanto has plants and
laboratories. Cost sharing by the partners will total 93% of the National
Science Foundation funding.
