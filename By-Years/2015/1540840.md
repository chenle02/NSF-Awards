This Noyce Capacity Building project will strengthen a partnership between the
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Milwaukee Public Schools aimed at
improving the quality of STEM education in area high needs schools. The goal of
the project is to develop capacity to train Master Teachers in content knowledge
propagated in the classroom through action research. The key feature of the
project is a needs assessment that will lead to the design and implementation of
a series of micro-credential modules that will cover STEM disciplinary content,
leadership, and evidence-based pedagogies. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Research has
shown that increased insight into disciplinary content and evidence-pedagogies
has a positive effect on teacher performance and teacher professional identity,
which in turn are directly related to more effective enactment of STEM
curricula. This project builds on that research basis with a micro-credentialing
model that will provide participating teachers with opportunities to connect
their learning to classroom practice. The project also addresses a need to
enhance Master Teachers' content knowledge in Milwaukee Public Schools, as
captured by the secondary student achievement data in mathematics and science.
Evaluation of the grant activities will focus on gaining formative feedback
related to implementation and effectiveness of the needs assessment, micro-
credentialing modules, and faculty recruitment plans.
