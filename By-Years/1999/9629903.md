9629903 Cormier This is a research planning grant (RPG). The PI will synthesize
available data on the East Pacific Rise from 12 north to 15 30 north out to
seafloor of age 4-5 my. The PI will determine if there is any evidence for
along-axis variations in crustal structure and/or mantle temperature associated
with the pronounced variation an axial morphology, and if there is any evidence
that the propagating event is related to a local increase in the melt supply to
the ridge axis.
