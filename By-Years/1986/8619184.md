This proposal is a request for funds to update survey equipment for glacier and
other geophysical research. Surveying is basic to measurement of velocity and
strain on glaciers. Such measurements are one of the principal thrusts of
glaciological research at the University of Washington. Surveying is also used
to locate geophysical instruments and for earth strain measurements. New
equipment is needed to back up and supplement the existing equipment, which is
aging and limited to one set of instruments. Field programs now supported by
NSF/DPP and anticipated in the future place high, and sometimes conflicting,
demands on the one available set of instruments and are subject to possible
disruption if one component fails.
