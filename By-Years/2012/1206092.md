The Northern Illinois University group is completing its transition from the D0
experiment at Fermilab to the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) as its core program. On ATLAS, Northern Illinois has operational
responsibilities and electronics upgrades for hadron calorimetry (the ATLAS
TileCal) and in simulation and algorithm development for the Fast TracKer (FTK)
Trigger. These activities are central to the improved performance of ATLAS as
the luminosity of the LHC increases. The NIU program of physics analysis focuses
on studies of top quarks, vector bosons (W/Z), and direct photon production.
They are also involved in the search for the decays of Higgs bosons into tau
leptons, which could be an indicator of new, Beyond-the-Standard-Model
phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Northern Illinois group continues to be very
active in detector development, particularly in the domain of calorimetry and
muon detection, and has joined the Fermilab Mu2e experiment, among whose
objectives is the search for muon conversion into electrons and hence lepton
number violation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outreach to K-12 teachers and the general
public is an integral part of the Northern Illinois program. The group initiated
physics outreach on the campus in 2001, a program of effort that is now merged
into the university's STEM outreach program. And, since 2008, the group has
maintained an active center for QuarkNet, involving teachers and students in
hands-on experimentation.
