This funding supports the instrumentation of an acoustics and vibration
measurement and analysis laboratory which serves an upper-level curriculum in
engineering physics. The laboratory is structured around an existing six-station
Hewlett-Packard computer system and the instrumentation selected communicates
with the computer via the IEEE-488 bus interface. This permits group instruction
from a variety of individuals experiments and provides a cost-effective
mechanism by which smaller engineering programs can incorporate sophisticated
apparatus. This award is being matched by an amount which at least equals that
from the principal investigator's institution.
