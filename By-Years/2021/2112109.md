The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project is to enable novel binary code AI applications for cybersecurity, by
providing a fast and accurate method to reverse-engineer executable code.
Current solutions are slow and inaccurate, and the volume of code analyzed by
cybersecurity applications is huge. Cybersecurity companies either deploy
tremendous computing resources to handle huge volumes of code or only extract
superficial features from code for AI models, making those solutions extremely
vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The proposed solution will not only save
computing resources but will allow for improved solutions by extracting complex
features from executable code and applying more advanced AI
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project provides an innovative disassembly solution for binary code. The
lack of a fast and accurate disassembler has become an obstacle to the
applications of novel AI approaches in the cybersecurity industry. The proposed
solution combines state-of-the-art binary analysis techniques and newly emerging
deep learning techniques to build a fast and accurate disassembler. The proposed
solution utilizes GPU technology to accelerate the disassembly process. The
final disassembly is expected to be over 100 times faster than state-of-the-art
disassemblers, while achieving the same or better
accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
