This award is for a series of workshop activities that would result in the
development of a white paper on the potential applications of combining
atmospheric and urban digital twins in urban environments. Digital twins are
virtual representations of physical objects, processes, and systems and have
gained widespread use in the engineering community, and are currently being
adopted in the atmospheric sciences community. The impact of the workshop series
would be to engage the academic research community in the use of digital twins
for enhancing understanding of interactions between natural, physical, cyber,
and social systems within cities.

The leadership team will conduct a series of focused group meetings, invited
talks, virtual meetings, and a session at a major conference over the course of
a year that will result in the development of a white paper on the potential
applications of combining atmospheric and urban digital twins in urban
environments. Atmospheric digital twins (ADTs) are digital clones of the Earthâ€™s
atmosphere while Urban digital twins (UDTs) are digital replicas of urban
spaces. The integration of ADTs and UDTs into an atmospheric and urban digital
twin (AUDT) would result in real-time virtual representations of physical,
environmental, and social systems by providing 3D (three-dimensional)
visualization, AR (augmented reality), virtual city models, and prediction
capabilities. The objectives of the workshop are to develop clear definitions
and requirements of AUDT, develop exemplary AUDT demonstrators, and support in
channeling the different digital twin developments for weather and climate
studies.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
