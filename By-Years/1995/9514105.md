9514105 Harlow Disuse atrophy of skeletal muscle is a problem faced by inactive
animals whether it be hospital patients, astronauts in a space vehicle or
constrained animals during winter dormancy. Muscle disuse atrophy results from a
decrease in muscle mass due to a reduction in the number of fibers, a decrease
in the size of the cells or a combination of the two. Since the hibernating
black bears show little protein loss during winter inactivity and are thus an
excellent model for investigating how some animals avoid muscle disuse atrophy,
the PI plans to study the mechanism involved in the intracellular and
extracellular protein changes. The PI will also determine if lactation laces a
greater demand on muscle protein degradation. These studies will also determine
how much fat (for energy) and protein (for water) are required by overwintering
bears and what the lactation demands are on fat and muscle tissues in order to
properly evaluate the bear as a muscle conserver during periods of inactivity.
