Under this project, Bucknell University will modernize its geotechnical
laboratory within the civil engineering department. Equipment will be obtained
to measure the shear strength of soil and rock in triaxial shear. Triaxial
control panels and triaxial cells will allow the students to measure and control
the externally applied total stresses, the pore water pressure, specimen volume
change and the stress path. Consolidometers will be used to measure the
consolidation properties including preconsolidation pressures and the time rate
of consolidation of soils. This laboratory modernization will permit students to
conduct laboratory tests on a wide range of soil types with up-to-date
equipment.
