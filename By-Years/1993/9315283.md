9315283 Graves This proposal focuses on the development of a modular laboratory
course in biotechnology and biochemical engineering. These modules will be
developed in collaboration with 12 universities which constitute a group called,
"The Middle-Atlantic Biochemical Engineering Consortium (MABEC)". A set of
modular experiments will be developed and written up as a publishable laboratory
workbook. A model laboratory will be designed to accompany the set of
experiments, and individual items of equipment needed will be keyed to each
experiment. An integrated computer system will provide data acquisition,
control, and analysis functions. Dissemination will be carried out by video
taping and publishing a manual.
