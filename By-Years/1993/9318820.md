9318820 Acrivos This project involves the theoretical study of transport
processes in two-phase, macroscopically homogenous materials. A variety of
analytical and numerical techniques are used to extend the prior work of the
P.I.'s on infinitely dilute suspensions to concentrated suspensions and to
extend their work on the shear-induced longitudinal and transverse self-
diffusivity of particles to the shear-induced gradient diffusivity. This work
may lead to fundamental advances in the field of diffusive transport in
suspensions because it moves from the basic, simplified, and asymptotic
theoretical limiting cases toward the more complex systems in which the
potential applications lie. There are many potential applications because of the
very fundamental nature of the proposed study. The range of potential
applications includes sedimentation, formation of plugs in non-homogeneous shear
flow and the re-suspension of settled particles, separation of gas bubbles from
liquids under near weightless conditions (production of ultra high purity
materials in space) by thermophoresis, and prediction of effective thermal
conductivity, permeability, and other transport properties in two-phase media.
The effective medium technique for determining the effective properties of
composite materials will be put on a firmer theoretical foundation and a kinetic
model for computing particle distribution functions in flowing suspensions will
be developed. The theoretical studies in this project will be coordinated with
the P.I.'s experimental program (funded through U.S. Dept. of Energy) and the
data form the literature will be used to test the theoretical results. ***
