The Southern Basin and RAnge contains one of the Cordillera's most important
and enigmatic Cenozoic tectonic regimes - the highly extended terrane consisting
of a series of metamorphic core complexes and detachment fault structures along
the southwestern margin of the Colorado Plateau. This terrane, a 25,000 km2
region known as the Whipple domain constitutes the largest tilt-block domain
within the Southern Basin and Range and is characterized by west-tilted fault
blocks and east- to northeast-dipping normal faults. This is a project to
delineate, in three dimensions, the structural elements of t he Whipple domain
and its a boundaries. This study will pay particular attention to subsurface
tectonic configurations and spatial relationships as provided by seismic
reflection profiles and will be "ground-truthed" by field observations. The
seismic data base consists of 27 generally high- quality proprietary industry
seismic reflection profiles (1400 km) line length) which are already resident at
USC or for which we have received permission to obtain. These data will greatly
expand upon the results of earlier CALCRUST work in the Whipple Mountains, and
the portions of the COCORP and PACE transects which pass through the Whipple
domain. The Whipple domain probably represents the most complete and contiguous
overall exposure of the various structural elements of the Cordilleran highly
extended terrane.
