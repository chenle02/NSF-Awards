This project provides international travel support for the principal
investigator to conduct cooperative studies in Japan and Taiwan on a short-term
scientific visit basis. The investigator will: (1) work with Tokyo University
researchers on seismic stability problems as a follow-up to a previously held
joint seminar on the subject, and (2) engage in preliminary study on the
enhancement of damping capabilities in earthquake- resistant structures with
Taiwan investigators. Both tasks are combined to be carried out in a single trip
to the Far East during the Summer of 1992. The studies will improve engineering
understanding of two important subjects, i.e., seismic stability and damping
enhancement in civil infrastructure systems, and are expected to develop program
framework for future cooperative seminars on these subjects.
