Formal representation of uncertainty is needed for taking account of partial
knowledge, for dealing with uncertain data, for making decisions in uncertain
circumstances. Probability theory provides the classical way of representing
uncertainty, but numerous other representations have been proposed. These
representations have a lot in common. This work will survey these proposals,
with a view to exploring their relations. One approach which may serve to
provide a general framework is the set-of-classical-distributions approach. Many
representations of uncertainty can be construed as sets of distributions subject
to a certain class of constraints. For example, Shafer's support functions can
be seen as the infima of sets of distributions subject to the constraints of
convexity and a special additivity constraint. This mechanism will be used to
explore the relations among the various views. Finally, supposing that the
constraints on the set of distributions come from general statistical knowledge
in a database, this project will explore the problem of the feasible computation
of uncertainties relative to such a database.
