Technical Description: The research performed in this project aims to understand
and improve the formation of graphene on the (000-1) surface of SiC (the
C-face). Prior work has identified a new interface structure for graphene on the
C-face, occurring when the graphene is formed in a low-pressure disilane
environment. Further research of this graphene formation mechanism is performed
in this project. Decoupling of the C-face interface layer from the SiC is also
studied, using hydrogen or oxygen gases. The electronic properties of the
graphene are characterized, in collaborative studies with other scientists.
Insulating layers such as boron nitride are epitaxially deposited on the
graphene, as a first step towards the formation of graphene-insulator-graphene
junction. Methods are explored for further deposition of a second layer of
graphene on the boron nitride.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description:
Graphene, a two-dimensional monolayer of carbon, has been intensively studied
for the past decade because of the unique transport properties of electrons in
the material. For large-area production of graphene (as needed for electronic
devices and circuits), a leading method is the formation on silicon carbide
(SiC). This research project focuses on formation mechanisms for graphene on
SiC, particularly on its C-face. The project also provides broad multi-
disciplinary training to graduate students in the nanotechnology field.
Additionally, the PI presents annual lectures to middle and high school students
on nanotechnology, as well as teaching an undergraduate course on Nanoscience
and Nanotechnology. The graphene-related research of this project is used to
enhance the content of these lectures, providing the students with an apt
example of a current topic in nanoscience and nanotechnology.
