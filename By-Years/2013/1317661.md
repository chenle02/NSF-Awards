This project is being supported under a special funding focus for STEP,
"Graduate 10K+," an activity of the National Science Foundation, supported in
part by donations from the Intel Foundation and the GE Foundation, to stimulate
comprehensive action at universities and colleges to help increase the annual
number of new B.S. graduates in engineering and computer science by 10,000 over
the next decade. In particular, this project is addressing preparation,
retention and graduation of engineering and computer-science students at the
University of Texas - Pan American, primarily through four activities: 1) a
STEM-focused concurrent-enrollment program for area high-school students, 2) a
summer bridge program for entering UTPA first-year students, emphasizing
mathematics preparation, 3) supplemental instruction in gatekeeper courses for
STEM majors, and 4) augmented peer mentoring and tutoring. The intellectual
merit of the project lies in its multifaceted approach that is leveraging best
practices from the STEM educational literature, and also is building on
considerable prior efforts and strong partnerships with area schools and with
South Texas College, a two-year institution. Beyond the projected increases in
engineering and computer-science graduates, broader impacts include
strengthening the workforce for an emerging hub in advanced manufacturing in Rio
South Texas, as well as support for greater educational and economic achievement
in a high-needs region. The project is also providing a model of national
interest for greater success and degree attainment by Hispanic students in STEM.
