This project is to support students’ participation in the 54th North American
Power Symposium (NAPS), which was held at the University of Utah, during October
9-11, 2022. NAPS is a student-centric conference that brings together students,
faculty, and researchers from the industry and national laboratories, in the
power and energy systems area. The purpose of this symposium is to provide a
forum for students, faculty, and industrial representatives to discuss the
latest research ideas and findings and receive feedback from their peers. The
requested funding will be used to cover part of the travel expenses, including
meals, lodging for two nights, and discounted registration, for 50 students from
US Universities. To promote student participation, regardless of financial
status, NAPS will provide free lodging and discounted registration for students.
NAPS is technically co-sponsored by IEEE Power and Energy Society, and the
conference proceedings will be published through IEEE
Xplore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF support for NAPS 2022 will boost awareness
about issues related to the power and energy system, including decarbonization,
resilience, and energy justice. The support will also provide a unique learning
opportunity for the students in the STEM community by subsidizing their
participation in NAPS. The students are expected to receive feedback from their
peers and the faculty participants, learn from their peers and connect with
potential employers. Finally, support for NAPS will have a positive impact on
the power and energy research community in the United States, as they work
towards the nation’s energy and climate goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
