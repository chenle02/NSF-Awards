This research studies the use of power combining in multi-antenna radios. Modern
radio systems often use multiple transmit antennas and appropriate signal coding
to improve throughput and reliability of wireless links. Ideally, each amplifier
should be rated at the maximum total (or sum) power that can be transmitted from
all antennas. Due to cost and efficiency considerations, the power rating is
usually designed to be lower (typically the maximum total power divided by the
number of antennas), and this can lead to significant performance loss. This
research explores a solution using Power Combining Networks (PCN) that enable
the output of an amplifier to be switched/combined into any antenna, thus moving
power from a weaker to a stronger antenna, resulting in improved link
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The maximum output power of a MIMO (Multiple
Input, Multiple Output) antenna transmitter is limited due to bio-safety
considerations. MIMO transmission performs best when each power amplifier is
rated at the full system transmit power. If the amplifiers are fractionally
rated due to cost and efficiency considerations, the worst case loss with M
antennas can reach log M dB in the presence of channel imbalances. A PCN can
reduce this loss significantly, trading the loss of array gain for a better
channel coupling efficiency. Use of a PCN alters the effective MIMO channel and
therefore can also change the optimum transmit coding. The goal of this research
is to study fast algorithms for PCN selection, appropriate signal coding schemes
and the best realizable performance.
