This project will continue work on the development of methods that combine two
or more catalysts in one system with the goal of making known reactions faster
and more selective and also enabling new reactions. While existing multi-
catalyst systems yield more efficient and selective reactions at less expense,
their current range is limited. By broadening their use to even more reactions,
significant benefits across the field of synthesis are expected. This project
focuses on bifunctional catalysts (with two catalytic features in one molecule),
which can lead to faster reaction rates with greater enantio- and
chemoselectivity as well as better yields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award,
the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of
Professor D. Tyler McQuade of the Department of Chemistry at Florida State
University. Professor McQuade's research efforts revolve around the development
of multi-catalyst systems. The rising standard of living worldwide has resulted
in greater demand for life-saving small molecules, but access to these molecules
is threatened by rising costs of energy and raw materials. Success of the
proposed work would lead to advances in synthetic efficiency and significantly
accelerated reaction rates that would help to satisfy the global demand for
these important molecules
