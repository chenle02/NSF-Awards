This study focuses upon the development of accurate prediction methods of non-
linear, multi-degree of freedom (MDOF) structural systems subject to external
and parametric random vibration. A formulation based upon Markov methods, which
combines stochastic averaging, white noise shaping filters and moment closure
techniques is presented. The analysis yields a system of algebraic equations
which can be used to provide non-Gaussian response information. To illustrate
this general analytical approach, a series of examples focused on the response
of deep water compliant offshore platforms subjected to realistic surface wave
spectrum are presented. In order to represent the random sea environment,
dimensionless shaping filters are developed to modify the white noise input and
provide the surface elevation and fluid kinematic data needed for the response
simulation. The implications of this approach on MDOF system response and
reliability estimates is explored and discussed.
