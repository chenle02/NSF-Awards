This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
Program supports the synthesis of new organometallic compounds containing
transition metals and boron and carbon clusters. The research has two main
goals: to develop systematic preparative routes to polymetallic complexes
containing carboranes and diborols and to investigate the electronic structures
and properties of these materials. Methods to construct multi-decker sandwiches
layer by layer will first be developed, followed by techniques for linking those
molecules together. In addition, some indenylmetallacarboranes of osmium and
ruthenium will be prepared in order to test some metal insertion reactions which
could provide an alternative mode of polyhedral expansion. In all cases, the
compounds will be characterized both structurally and electrochemically, using
techniques such as NMR, vis-UV spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, cyclic
voltammetry, and ESR spectroscopy. %%% The design and synthesis of chain-like
molecules which have high electronic conductivities along the chain is a very
active area of research because of the potential use of such molecules in
molecular level electronic devices. This project involves the synthesis of
molecules in which metal atoms are linked by five-membered rings of carbon and
boron atoms in structures which resemble multi-decker sandwiches, with the five-
membered rings serving as the "bread" and the metal atoms as the "meat."
Communication between the metal atoms provides for conduction of electrons up
and down the stack. The presence of boron provides high thermal stability and
decreased sensitivity to oxidation by atmospheric oxygen.
