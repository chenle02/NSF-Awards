Neutron activation analysis will be used to determine the concentrations of
selected trace elements in atmospheric samples from the AEROCE sites. Aerosol
particle samples are collected daily at Bermuda, Barbados, Tenerife, and
Ireland, and the concentrations of up to twenty-five elements will be determined
in each. The chemical analyses provide information on three general classes of
trace constituents: mineral aerosol, atmospheric sea salt, and a variety of
enriched elements. The objectives of the study are 1) to develop a chemical
climatology for trace elements in aerosol particles over the North Atlantic, 2)
to identify the sources for the trace elements, 3) to evaluate the export of
mineral aerosol and atmospheric pollutants from the continents to the North
Atlantic region, 4) to characterize the relationships among various classes of
particulate trace substances in the atmosphere, 5) to investigate the mechanisms
involved in the atmospheric deposition process and to improve estimates of the
air/sea exchange rates for trace elements, 6) to evaluate the role of air/sea
exchange in the biogeochemical cycling of trace elements in the ocean, and 7) to
ascertain the impacts of particulate trace elements on physical properties of
the atmosphere.
