Software developers are increasingly using dynamic scripting languages not only
for quickly prototyping or as "glue"code, but also to write large applications.
Programmers like scripting languages because they have the flexibility of simply
using a variable when needed, without having to declare it. This results in
fewer lines of code and allows for faster code development. Unfortunately the
same features that make dynamic scripting languages more productive, make them
hard to generate efficient code for.

This project is working on a hardware-software solution to enable programs
written using dynamic scripting languages to run as fast as statically typed
languages, such as C, C++ or Java. To that end, this project is working on the
design of new program transformations that can generate highly efficient code by
taking advantage of innovative hardware support that detects if the assumptions
done when generating the code are correct. Additionally, novel hardware provides
to the compiler information that enables even more aggressive optimizations.
Hardware and software designs are driven by the results obtained from a study
that analyzes the main sources of overhead of scripting languages. The research
in this project will result in higher programmer productivity and will enable
the use of scripting languages in domains where they are not used today.
