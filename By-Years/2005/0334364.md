PI: Sherif El-Tawil, University of Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The events of
Sept. 11th and the ongoing terror threats highlight the vulnerability of our
infrastructure to new and unfamiliar risks. Unprotected bridge piers, in
particular, are vulnerable to accidental or malicious collision by heavy
vehicles. Many bridges in the national inventory are supported on single column
piers or two-column bents (Fig. 1a) and can be rendered useless by an attack on
a single column. Local communities and economies dependent on such vulnerable
bridges face significant exposure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intent of this
project is to investigate the use of high fidelity numerical modeling for
simulating the response of bridge piers subjected to collision by vehicles.
Detailed vehicle models will be crashed into bridge pier models with the
objective of studying the parameters influencing vehicle versus structure
collision. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed simulations are expected to lead
to a better understanding of the collision process and will lead to
quantification of structural demands created by such extreme events. This
research addresses a critical topic or immediate national importance: the
security of our bridges and their vulnerability to impact by heavy vehicles. The
products of this research will promote the development of performance-based
design philosophies which incorporate security concerns in the design process.
This will ultimately enable civil engineers to rehabilitate existing structures
and design new bridges that are more resistant to accidents and terror attacks.
