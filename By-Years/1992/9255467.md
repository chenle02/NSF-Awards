This two-part project, organized by the NSF Center for Science and Technology of
Advanced Cement-Based Materials, is targeted for two- and four-year college
faculty to enhance their capabilities to teach an interdisciplinary materials
science approach in concrete materials to civil engineering undergraduate
students. Part I is a five-day workshop integrating the materials science,
engineering, and laboratory and field aspects of concrete; Part II will provide
a two-day conference to assess the impact of the teaching program on the
participants and their students, and examine future educational initiatives.
