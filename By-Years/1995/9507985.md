The PI proposes a two-phase research program on high resolution computerized
ionospheric tomography (CIT) algorithm development. Phase I will characterize
(theoretically and experimentally) the resolving capabilities and sensitivities
of all major CIT algorithms with respect to specific reconstruction goals. Phase
II will develop high resolution CIT algorithms through (1) linkage of
traditional ground-based TEC with ionospheric data of opportunity to provide CIT
algorithms with maximum information of the true ionospheric distribution, and
(2) incorporation of mathematical equations describing ionospheric processes
into CIT algorithms.***
