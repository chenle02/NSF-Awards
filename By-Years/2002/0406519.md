0406519&lt;br/&gt;Lumia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-year award supports US-
Italy cooperative research in multiple robot arm force/impedance control and
visual servoing involving Ron Lumia, University of New Mexico, and Dr. Bruno
Sicialiano at the University of Naples, Italy. The objective of the research is
to explore visual servoing and force/impedance control on a single robot and to
expand the results to multiple robots. The project takes advantage of the
complementary capabilities of the two laboratories. The University of Naples
(PRISMA lab) has a fast real time control system for its two Comau robots. The
University of New Mexico (UNM) has developed fast visual servoing algorithms.
The use of the PRISMA system will allow the exercise of the UNM algorithms and
measure performance effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaboration will
combine fast robot control with very fast sensory processing for dual robot
applications. This will advance the theory of dual robot control and
experimentally verify the results. The results of the research will develop
insight into active vision based feedback control for single robots and dual
robot configurations demonstrate UNM's active vision system software used as
object position feedback in single and dual arm robots, and develop new theory
for controlling robots that simplifies the dynamic equations of motion. The
results will have implications for manufacturing and all advanced robotic
applications in which robots must rapidly assembly objects.&lt;br/&gt;
