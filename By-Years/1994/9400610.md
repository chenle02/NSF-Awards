9400610 Rensselaer Polytech Inst. Georges Belfort The surface of a commercially
available polymeric membrane material, poly(arylsulfone), will be modified in
order to reduce fouling when exposed to proteins during filtration. Two
different approaches of surface modification will be investigated. One approach
will use a novel photochemical method of grafting different monomers on the
surface of poly(arylsulfone) non-porous films and membranes. The other method
will involve low temperature plasma treatment with a series of monomers under
varying conditions. The modified surfaces will be characterized using
appropriate analytical techniques. The filtration performance of the modified
membranes which show most potential will be evaluated. The correlation of
surface properties to membrane filtration performance may lead to the design of
membranes with low fouling due to protein adsorption. Effective reduction of
membrane fouling is necessary for the wide scale application of membrane
separations in various area including biotechnology, water treatment and hence
civil infrastructure, and manufacturing.
