9704678 Burgoyn2 Methods will be developed for on-line preparation of H2 from
subnanomole quantities of organic H and for continous monitoring of the hydrogen
isotope ration (D/H) in the product. Integration of this system with existing
isotope-ratio-monitoring technology will allow determination of hydrogen
isotopic compositions of individual organic compounds separated by gas
chromatography.
