The award supports two visits by Dr. Philip R. Brooks of Rice University to the
University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand, to work with Dr. Peter W.
Harland on complementary experiments probing the effects of molecular
orientation during collision. At Rice, collisional ionization (or "electron
transfer collisions") are being studied at energies of a few eV, and the group
at Canterbury is initiating studies of electron bombardment ionization of
oriented molecules. In both these studies, molecules in molecular beams are
state-selected in an inhomogeneous electric field, and then oriented in a weak
uniform electric field. The orientation can thus be specified (and changed) to
study its effect on various collisional processes. The need to orient molecules
and to guide charged particles into or away from the collisional region is
common to both programs. The Rice group has extensive experience in charged
particle optics and mass spectrometry. This complementary expertise in ongoing
research justifies this cooperative research.
