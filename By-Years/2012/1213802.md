In this collaborative project, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and
Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, James D. Batteas at Texas A & M
University and Charles Michael Drain at Hunter College of the City University of
New York will design, synthesize and evaluate the conductive properties of
porphyrinoids assembled on surfaces. Using directed assembly approaches to
position molecules on surfaces, the team will examine: 1) how molecular
connectivity and local molecular interactions (i.e. environment, nearest
neighbor interactions) can be used to influence electron transport behavior and
2) how spatial confinement influences the assembly of molecules on surfaces in
nanoscopic junctions. The overarching goal of this research is to develop a
clear understanding of the role each part of the electroactive porphyrinoid, the
substrate, and the environment, plays in the electronic properties of molecular
based electronic devices. Furthering the understanding of these synergistic
effects will enable the rational design of potential More-than-Moore devices,
including enhanced photovoltaics, chemical sensors and molecular electronics.

This work addresses a key intermediate of nanoscale molecular assemblies whose
properties may show unique electrical behavior due to spatial confinement.
Importantly, this work bridges the gap between single molecule and monolayer
measurements where little research has been conducted. Students participating in
this project will receive multidisciplinary training in materials science,
nanoscience, surface chemistry and physics from both a theoretical and
experimental perspective, allowing them to develop proficiency in multiple
arenas. The outcomes of this work will be widely disseminated to a broad
audience through a range of scientific publications and presentations made at
informal public science events and research conferences. Aspects of the work
will also be incorporated as demonstrations for elementary school students, with
more advanced topics being brought right into the classrooms at Texas A & M
University and Hunter College.
