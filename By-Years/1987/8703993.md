A research program is proposed which utilizes the unique capabilities of x-ray
standing wave experiments to determine the structure of chemically distinct
overlayers epitaxially grown on nearly perfect crystalline substrates. The
growth habits of lattice matched alkali halides on germanium surfaces shall be
studied in a specially configured ultra high vacuum analysis system which
include high energy electron diffraction andAuger electron spectroscopy. This
apparatus shall also be well-suited to investigate standing waves excited by an
incident high energy electron beam, which may prove to be new surface structure
probe of wide applicability. A successful study of I-Vii heteroepitaxy on
germanium will permit the engineering of heterostructures with major
perturbations in optical properties over atomic distances, an entirely new class
of materials with excitations in the near ultra-violet. These materials may have
important technological applications, such as the possible development of new
ultra- violet lasers.
