WQED/Pittsburgh plans to produce SPACE AGE, a major eight-hour prime time PBS
television series on space sciences for airing in 1992, coinciding with the
Columbus Quincentennial Celebration and the inauguration of the International
Space Year (ISY). Produced in association with the National Academy of Sciences,
the $7.2 million series will comprehensively document the extensive influence of
space activity from scientific, technological, economic and social perspectives.
International co-operation and co- production support from several nations will
insure that topics are treated globally, rather than nationally. WQED will
develop collateral educational materials and a trade book for popular audiences;
eight years of off air taping rights for pre-college teachers will be provided.
The series should be viewed by more than seven to twelve million viewers on 320
PBS stations. NSF support will amount to approximately 9% of the $7.2 million
project total.
