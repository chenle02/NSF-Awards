EIA-0103610&lt;br/&gt;David Padua&lt;br/&gt;Univ. of
Illinois&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NGS: Collaborative Research: An OpenMP Environment
for Wide-Area Network Computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this
proposal is to develop a new programming system that will close the gap that
exists between programming SMPs and networked computer clusters, by using the
emerging standard (OpenMP) for SMPs and develop compiler and runtime support
that will enable using OpenMP on distributed platforms with optimized
performance. The proposed programming system will make it possible to program
the Grid and networked computer systems using OpenMP, the emerging standard for
shared-memory programming. The PI expects to attain high efficiency in the
execution of OpenMP programs for collection of Grid-connected computers. Through
static and dynamic compiler techniques, we expect to harness the complexity and
load fluctuations of the target environment.&lt;br/&gt;
