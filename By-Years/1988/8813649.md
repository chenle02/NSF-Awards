Supernovae are the most energetic events in the evolution of stars. They also
are relatively rare events, with the last one observed in our Milky Way Galaxy
dating back nearly 400 years. Therefore, the event of Supernova 1987A that
occured in February of 1987 in the Large Magellenic Cloud, at a distance of
160,000 light-years, was hailed as a major astronomical event and created much
activity both in observing the event and in explaining it theoretically. Woosley
works at the cutting edge of modelling supernova outbursts and the evolution of
the precursor stars leading up to the explosion, using hydrodynamic numerical
modeling and extensive nuclear reaction networks. The main focus of the current
proposal is to model Supernova 1987A and its precursor star.
