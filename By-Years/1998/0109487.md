This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
novel high-speed broadband optical switches, where the optical data do not leave
a fiber waveguide. Unlike integrated optics and planar waveguides, this approach
has strong advantages in lower insertion loss, higher speeds, lower drive
voltages, and reduced fabrication costs. Since these devices are inherently
narrow-band, they can support dramatic reduction in channel width (higher
channel count) in dense wavelength division multiplexed systems. At the same
time, the lower voltage and faster electro-optic switching allow greater speeds,
already demonstrated in excess of 110 GigaHertz in planar devices using this
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial market for high-speed, power-
efficient optical switches is among the largest in the modern economy. The
potential for cost savings via improved efficiency is expected to justify the
retrofit of existing infrastructure. Considering revenue increases due to
capacity expansion, this technology could figure prominently in the next
expansion of transcontinental, intercontinental, and metropolitan high-speed
data transfer service devices, sensors, and other devices.&lt;br/&gt;
