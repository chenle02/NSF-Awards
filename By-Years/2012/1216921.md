Duke University proposes to support technical services on R/V Cape Hatteras, a
135? general purpose UNOLS research vessel operated by the Duke/UNC Consortium
as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research
fleet. They request support for basic services only. They will provide one
technician on each seagoing research project of R/V Cape Hatteras to support
seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified
users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation. The budget
in this proposal is for the first year of a 5-year continuing
grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of
the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support
for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support
of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The support of
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
