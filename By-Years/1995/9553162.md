9553162 Laurencin This Presidential Faculty Fellow award will support a plan of
research aimed towards the design, fabrication and analyses of tissue engineered
constructs for skeletal regeneration using connective tissue cells derived from
muscle. The teaching component of the five year project will introduce new
initiatives for greater engineering education opportunities for African-
Americans, a cross-disciplinary, cross-institutional teaching program in
biomaterials, and an expansion of teaching and mentor arrangements for
individual students. ***
