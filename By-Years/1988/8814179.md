This project provides theoretical and econometric methods for analyzing how
advanced information technologies, and the structures of the organizations using
them, affect the performance of modern, complex, industrial production
facilities. The research focusses upon the productivity and reliability of
established production facilities, and its ultimate aim is to assess the impacts
of new technologies for process monitoring and control upon these two
quantitative dimensions of performance. The research agenda has three elements.
First, it aims to advance the analysis of production systems by examining the
choices of techniques for process control and organizational design that would
promote improvement sin reliability and productivity via more extensive uses of
sophisticated information technology. Second, it proposes novel formulations of
production theory that relate more directly to empirical observations of micro
level production events. Third, the project undertakes to test the usefulness of
its conceptual and methodological researches by applying these concretely, in a
study of organizational and information-technology impacts on the performance of
an economically important and exceptionally well-documented industry--commercial
nuclear power plants operated by U.S. electric utility companies.
