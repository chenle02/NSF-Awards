0220839&lt;br/&gt;Chang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan American Advanced Studies
Institute (PASI) award on Materials for Energy Conversion and Environmental
Protection, jointly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the
Department of Energy (DOE), is being organized by Dr. R. P. H. Chang of
Northwestern University in collaboration with&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Guillermo Solorzano
of the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. The proposed PASI will take place
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil during the first week of September 2003. Experts in
fields of energy conservation, energy storage and environmental remediation will
present lectures and engage students in discussion sessions. Lecturers will
discuss new materials and processes for fuel cell design and applications, new
catalytic materials for hydrogen gas generation, and the use of carbon and
metallic materials for hydrogen storage. Another part of the PASI will be
devoted to the study of environmental protection and emissions reduction for a
range of pollutants. Students participating in this PASI will develop a
collaborative research plan and gain an understanding of the latest research
related to energy conservation.&lt;br/&gt;
