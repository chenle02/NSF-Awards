9500020 Menq The goal of this research is to develop an integrated framework for
precision machining of complex surface geometries, in which product quality and
productivity are planned and controlled in the process development phase rather
than in the manufacturing phase of the production cycle. The present study
focuses on end milling, one of the most widely used machining processes in the
manufacture of parts with three-dimensional sculpted surfaces. Reliable
mathematical process models will be developed to determine the optimum machining
conditions in end milling. The first task will be to develop predictive models
for cutting forces and the resulting surface errors in various end milling
processes. The second task is to develop advanced machining strategies and
compensation schemes that utilize the developed predictive capability to plan
optimal cutting paths and feedrates for the reduction of production time and
costs, and to improve product quality by correcting the anticipated errors
before actually machining a surface. There are about fifty thousand small
machine shops in the United States that could gain some benefit from this
research. The research is intended to enhance the understanding of the cutting
performance and dimensional error formation in the end milling process, and to
develop an integrated framework for precision machining of complex surface
geometries. The models developed here can be implemented in an open computer-
aided design and manufacturing system to establish an intelligent machining
planning system for three-dimensional sculptured surface machining.
