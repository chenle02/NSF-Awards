9730222 Silver This Americas Program award will support travel and related
expenses for two junior scientists and one graduate student from US, and four
scientists from Nicaragua, to participate in a workshop on imaging and modeling
the processes occurring on the seismogenic zone of Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The
workshop, organized by Dr. Eli Silver, University of California, Santa Cruz, in
cooperation with experts from Central America, will take place in San Francisco
in December, 1997. Three previous international workshops have recommended Costa
Rica-Nicaragua as one of two highest priority regions for focused study on the
mechanics of the seismogenic zone in subduction environments. Following that
recommendation, the workshop was organized with the goal to better define the
nature of the problem, prioritize potential scientific studies, and organize
international teams to focus on different aspects of the structure and behavior
of the seismogenic zone. There is great international interest in the
seismogenic zone and specifically in Central America, and this is a first step
in the preparation for deep riser drilling into an active seismogenic zone. ***
