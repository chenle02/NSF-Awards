This project focuses on the integration of recent theoretical and algorithmic
advances in numerical models, which describe the behavior of elastic materials
on multiple scales, exhibiting stochastic behavior. The project will include
algorithmic design, convergence and complexity analysis, as well as issues that
arise in the performance of the upscaling and multilevel algorithms in realistic
simulations. The proposed research: (1) aids the development of new and robust
methods for upscaling that provide reliable calculations and predictions in
structural mechanics; (2) supports the migration of such methods into real-life
scientific and engineering simulations; and (3) engages the broader scientific
community through research and educational activities, highlighting the
integrated approach in numerical modeling of elastic materials from adaptive
discretizations to robust solvers and back.

The proposed research aims to improve understanding of the interplay between the
techniques from differential geometry and topology, which lead to
discretizations compatible with the geometric and topological structures
inherited from the physical/mathematical model. Based on this, the PIs plan to
develop agglomeration methods that offer provable optimal algorithm performance.
The novel efficient and accurate upscaling techniques for elasticity problems
have potential applications in material sciences and geosciences. In addition,
accurate coarse discretizations yield efficient multilevel solvers for the
linear systems coming from corresponding discretizations of linear elasticity.
Such solvers enable simulations with finer spatial resolution and/or reduce the
necessary computational resources for such simulations. Finally, the design of
upscaling techniques has many similarities with the design of discretizations in
general. The success of the project will facilitate accurate discretization
schemes and robust solvers for linear elasticity equations based on element
agglomeration.
