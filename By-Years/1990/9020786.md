This project supports an anthropologist conducting research in southwestern
Brazil on the social, ethnic, and dietary factors affecting the incidence of
high blood pressure in a sample of adults. 150 households will be surveyed and
biological tests assessing cardiovascular and metabolic responses to stress
conducted. The hypothesis to be tested assumes that individuals encountering
high stress, due to their social and ethnic incongruity in their life styles in
a rapidly changing social environment, will have high blood pressure, and high
total cholesterol and triglycerides. This research is important since rapid
socio-cultural changes take place in all "traditional" societies in the
contemporary world. Understanding how human populations respond biologically to
the social stress that rapid change induces will help us understand the course
of human social and biological evolution.
