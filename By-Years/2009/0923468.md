A large-scale visualization facility with integrated haptic devices is a
critical need that will enable the realization of breakthrough science and
engineering at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). Our proposed
facility (Haptic Vis-Wall) is uniquely configured to provide real-time
interaction with very large, complex data sets. Three primary research projects
and ten other projects have been identified that require a large-scale
visualization facility so that researchers can develop in-depth interpretation
of their models and data and produce intellectual insight. In addition, due to
the uniqueness of the equipment, sharing of the resource across UTSA, and the
highly visible nature of the resource, it is foreseeable that collaborations
across engineering, computer science, statistics and others will result. Also,
the capability to include haptic devices into research and teaching will spawn
new awareness and applications of this important resource into fundamental
graduate and undergraduate courses and provide an engaging vehicle for
addressing student retention and graduation rate issues.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today's students often exhibit superior learning through
graphically based instruction. This is especially true for underrepresented
minority students that are typically the first generation to attend college and
often lack access to the latest technology. As a result, this facility, which
will be open to all UTSA faculty and students, can have a significant impact on
educational and research accomplishments. Further benefits include a dramatic
increase in publicity of computational science, engineering, computer
programming, haptics and controls, and computer graphics to administrators,
faculty, students and prospective students. The facility will be centrally
located on campus for both teaching and research.
