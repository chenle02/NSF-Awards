0545987&lt;br/&gt;Smolke&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to
develop platforms for the design and construction of tailor-made molecular
sensors that will be used for programming dynamic cellular behavior. In
particular, these sensors will be used to construct signal integration schemes
for programming logical cellular response. In addition, this research includes
an integrative educational and research plan that will build new strategies for
educating scientists and engineers and lay the foundation necessary for them to
push the boundaries of scientific development and technology forward.
Specifically, this plan proposes to: (1) develop a high-throughput strategy for
the generation of trans-acting, ligand-responsive RNA switches, (2) develop
platforms for the design of cis-acting, ligand-responsive RNA switches, (3)
integrate these sensor elements into the design of logical processing schemes
that program different cellular functions depending on combinations of input
signals received, and (4) solidify a strong base in biomolecular and cellular
engineering and encourage its advancement by training and educating scientists
through cutting-edge, integrated research and educational plans.&lt;br/&gt;
