9307832 Burggren The cardiovascular system is the first organ system to operate
in developing vertebrate embryos, and proper establishment of its transport
functions is absolutely critical to the subsequent normal development of all
tissues and organs. In spite of this important early role for the cardiovascular
system, the development of its physiology remains very poorly understood for any
vertebrate, including birds and mammals. Our initial findings on anuran
amphibians (frogs) have been highly useful in advancing our understanding of
studying the general properties of embryonic circulations. Consequently, support
has been requested to expand our investigations of the development of central
arterial blood pressure and flow generation and its regulation in embryos and
larvae of the frog Xenopus laevis, which has become one of the major vertebrate
models in development biology. The major objectives of this proposal are to: 1)
determine the development of flow and pressure generation in the early embryonic
heart, and 2) to determine how external and internal influences that lead to low
tissue oxygenation and changes in blood transport demands affect both the short-
term and long-term performance of the cardiovascular system in embryos and
beyond to the adult. Measurement will include recordings of the heart rate heart
output, blood pressure, peripheral resistance and heart work. The experimental
design will encompass rearing populations of developing embryos under conditions
that include short-term and long-term exposure to low oxygen levels, and
subsequently assessing their physiological performance to determine when in
development they are most vulnerable environmental disturbance. Our studies on
physiological development and how environmental conditions impact upon it will
have very broad applicability to both vertebrate physiology and developmental
biology, particularly in the almost complete absence of similar published data
on eit her bird or mammal embryos. ***
