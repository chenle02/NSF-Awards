Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Geologic evidence indicates that many
periods of biotic and environmental crisis coincided with times when the world's
oceans were highly stratified in their chemical and isotopic composition, with
deep waters that were devoid of oxygen and likely strongly enriched in carbon
dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. The Late Permian, notable as the time of the
largest mass extinction in the fossil record (251 million years ago), is thought
to represent such an interval. Stagnation of ocean circulation has been invoked
to explain extreme oceanic conditions of widespread anoxia during this time, and
reinvigoration of circulation has been suggested as a mechanism to bring toxic
waters to the ocean's surface in a global Lake Nyos-type event, leading to mass
extinction. &lt;br/&gt;The project proposed here will explore the relationship
between ocean stagnation and chemical stratification, and the mechanisms that
sustain shallow-water anoxia in the face of wind-driven mixing, using numerical
models to ensure that the scenarios proposed are consistent with fundamental
principles of mass, energy, and isotopic balance. Model results will be compared
with existing isotopic and lithologic data. In addition, new sulfur isotopic
data will be obtained from one of the most continuous and well-studied Permian-
Triassic boundary sections in the world, providing an important missing piece of
biogeochemical information against which to evaluate the models. The modeling
will also provide motivation and guidance for further data collection in
specific locales. &lt;br/&gt;The model will have the unique ability to explore
the chemistry of an anoxic ocean, and as such, its availability should be of
great interest to the scientific community. The intuition developed should help
to guide subsequent formulation of conceptual models concerning the relationship
between climate, ocean circulation, ocean biogeochemistry, and biological
response. &lt;br/&gt;
