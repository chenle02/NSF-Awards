Research in Plio-Pleistocene hominid paleontology over the past four decades
has focused largely on exploration and recovery of fossils and artifacts from
sites in East Africa. All five known australopithecine sites in southern Africa
were discovered between 1924 and 1948; no new locality has been found in over
forty years. In order to appreciate the course of early hominid development
beyond that represented in East Africa, and in order to gain a more precise
picture of chronological relationships, it is critical that additional
fossiliferous localities be discovered in southern Africa. Plio-Pleistocene
sediments in southern Africa are represented by breccia-filled caves within the
limestones of the Transvaal System. The purpose of this project is to undertake
a systematic, exploratory survey of the outcrops along the eastern escarpment of
the Transvaal System for fossiliferous breccia caves, and to identify sites for
future, long-term excavation. The chances of finding such a rewarding site may
not be high, but the extreme value to anthropology if such a site is found makes
this exploration a most worthwhile risk.
