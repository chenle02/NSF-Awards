This proposal will extend initial research in developingtheoretical
underpinnings and creating a practical demonstrationof a graph-based modeling
system. A graph-based modeling systemrelies on attributed graphs to provide
pictorial representationsof models, to be used both for an interface with
decision modelusers and as a modeling language. There are many benefits of
apictorial diagram approach compared to the normal text approachof other
modeling languages. Such a tool for automating themodeling process should
improve the resulting models, andsubsequently improve decisions made with the
help of thosemodels.
