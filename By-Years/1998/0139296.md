This award provides funds for an REU Site in Sociology at the University of
Notre Dame. The program will support 24 students over the course of three years.
The substantive focus of the Site will be centered on protest and activism with
an emphasis on urban rioting and violent protest in the U.S. during the 1960s.
The data driving the research are the contents of a recently re-discovered
archive of data on riots, race relations, and civil rights activism in the
1960s. Very little of these data have ever been analyzed or even systematically
compiled and summarized; therefore students will have the opportunity to make
substantial contributions to the recently resurgent sociological literature
about racial rioting and collective violence. The year-lengh program will allow
sustained engagement with the research project and thereby a rich research
experience. Students will begin by engaging in foundational activities such as
reviewing literature and learning about how to process and interpret the
specific kinds of data available to them for the project. Following this,
students will develop their own research topics, write formal proposals, and
compile the data necessary to complete their projects. The second half of the
experience will focus on the execution of their research plans and writing of
formal research reports. The Site will culminate with a mini-conference in which
the students will present their work. Students will also be encouraged to submit
their reports to social science conferences and to revise toward publication.

This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract
talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research
experiences.
