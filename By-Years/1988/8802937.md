The investigators will continue theoretical modeling of stellar atmospheres with
mass loss. The emphasis rests on very luminous and massive stars, typically over
40 solar masses. Accurate line spectra are needed to obtain effective
temperatures. Such detailed understanding of the spectra yields information not
only about the causes of the winds but also about properties of stellar
evolution, such as convection; ways to identify the luminosities of such stars
in distant galaxies; and the effects on the interstellar medium. The hottest
observable stars provide important tests of our understanding of stellar
evolution, they energize the interstellar medium; and they may become accurate
indicators of distances of distant galaxies. However, observations of hot stars
can be interpreted reliably only after a detailed model of their atmospheres has
been constructed. The model must include information on both the velocities of
the winds leaving the stars and on the atoms in the winds that absorb and re-
emit the stellar radiation. Such a computation has only recently become
possible. The investigators are at the forefront of this research. This grant
will allow them to model the stellar atmospheres so that the spectra of the
hottest stars can indeed become effective tools for astronomical research.
