9361410 Dawes During the last few years, Martingale Research Corporation has
been actively developing a neural network architecture called the Parametric
Avalanche Scholastic Filter. This network architecture was developed to solve
difficult problems dealing with nonlinear dynamical systems. MRC is currently
applying this network architecture to automatic recognition of speech.
Additionally, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University is actively conducting
research in the field of acoustic emission in various structures, particularly
as applied to fatigue monitoring. MRC and Embry-Riddle propose to apply the
Parametric Avalanche to the problem of unambiguous detection and classification
of acoustic emissions resulting from crack growth in metal structures subject to
fatigue cycling. We will apply the Parametric Avalanche neural network
technology developed for speech recognition to noisy acoustic emission data with
the specific goal of demonstrating a proof-of-concept that can be further
developed into a prototype real-time fatigue crack and classification system.
