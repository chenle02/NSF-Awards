This project involves using the Global Positioning System (GPS) in eastern
Indonesia, a region of broad deformation where the continental margins of
Australia and Southeast Asia and the oceanic plates of the Pacific and
Philippine Sea are coming together at rates of 80 to 110 mm/yr. Plate tectonic
concepts do not explain the evolution of Indonesia and other diffusely deforming
belts except very generally because deformation is not confined to the edges of
well-defined, rigid plates. Hence, the study of Indonesia and places like it
will be critical in developing more general theories of global tectonics and
expanding our knowledge of the dynamics of plate interactions. Eastern Indonesia
is at the stage of assembly of the crustal elements, both continental and
oceanic, that will eventually form a complex mountain belt. The strain field
within such deforming regions is a first-order observation that can constrain
ideas about the behavior of the crust and upper mantle in mountain building.
