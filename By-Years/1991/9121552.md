Physical anthropology faces a significant challenge as large skeletal
collections are repatriated and buried pursuant to the Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act. In an effort to salvage valuable scientific
information, physical anthropologists have compiled protocols for the gathering
of standardized data. The primary objective of this project is the creation of a
computerized database system which will allow the entry, retrieval and storage
of medical and osteological information recorded for human skeletal remains. The
system implements the data standards developed by an NSF supported workshop held
at the Field Museum in 1991. In addition to personal computer based versions of
the system, an on-line INTERNET accessible national archive will be created with
upload and download capabilities.
