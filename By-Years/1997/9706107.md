9706107 Zhang One of the basic aims of igneous and metamorphic petrology is to
infer the thermal history of rocks using observed mineral assemblages and
compositions. This continuing award will support research in reaction kinetics
and geospeedometry, concentrating on using kinetics of homogeneous reactions
(i.e., reactions in a single phase) to infer thermal history. The focus will be
on the reaction of hydrous species interconversion (H2Om+O= 2OH) in volcanic
glasses, not only because of its importance in geospeedometry, but also because
H2O is the most abundant volatile component in the earth and plays the critical
role in explosive volcanic eruptions and in physical and chemical properties of
melts. Previous research provided a geospeedometer and allows the determination
of the cooling rate of hydrous volcanic glasses through IR analyses. Some of the
unexpected problems encountered this previous work (e.g., the need for a new
calibration) have been partially addressed. With this continuing award: (1) the
IR technique will be calibrated to high total H2O content - the calibration is
basic to the proposed work and that of others on hydrous systems; (2) in situ
experimental studies at high temperature and pressure on speciation and kinetics
of the reaction will be carried out; and (3) cooling rate profiles in natural
and experimental hydrous glasses will be determined.
