This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support investigation examines how women
workers' participation in civic and political life differs from that of their
male counterparts. A related issue is the connection between workforce
participation and participation in public life and whether these are the same
for women and men workers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, it is
hypothesized that womens' means to and types of political mobilization differ
from that of men, and that women engaged with NGOs are more likely than other
women workers to find the resources, rationales and opportunities to mobilize
politically. In order to investigate these concerns, a random sample of female
and male factory workers in Tijuana and Puebla, Mexico will be surveyed. A
smaller category of women workers, NGO leaders and factory managers will be
interviewed. Given the continued growth of foreign direct investment in Latin
America, the Caribbean, Asia, Africa and the Middle East in similar assembly and
manufacturing operations, the Mexican experience may well be an indicator of
future developments in other regions around the globe.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to further understanding of the levels
and types of political participation engaged in by women and men in the
manufacturing economy of developing nations. It is designed to illuminate the
means by which such workers become politically mobilized, the role that NGOs
(religious and secular) may play in furthering democratic participation, and the
contribution of such political activity to
democratization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
