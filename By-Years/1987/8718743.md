This project is an investigation of sintering of high Tc superconductors under
the influence of an electric current in order to induce texture. The recently
discovered high Tc superconductors, which have an orthorhombically distorted
perovskite structure, exhibit anisotropic superconductivity. Critical current
densities in the basal plane of the lattice are much higher than in the c-
direction perpendicular to the basal plane. In order to maximize the critical
current density of polycrystalline films made from these materials it will be
necessary to induce texture effects in the materials such that preferential
alignment of the grains occurs.
