With this grant, Wellesley College is purchasing a Leica TCS SP5 AOBS Spectral
Confocal Microscope. The impact of this instrumentation is two-fold: enhancing
the research environment for faculty in the Biological Sciences and Chemistry
Departments and related interdisciplinary programs, and enhancing research
training opportunities for students. This microscope allows the visualization of
a wide variety of fluorescent molecules for localization and live-cell imaging
studies in samples ranging from bacteria and yeast to whole mounts of brains and
seedlings. The primary users are tackling central questions in biology: membrane
trafficking mechanisms in plant cell division, stress mechanisms in
cyanobacteria, cellular uptake of antimicrobial peptides, neuroendocrine control
of behavior, mechanisms of adult neurogenesis, and brain development during
critical periods in cognitive and social development. This is a critical
investment in research programs at Wellesley College and in the next generation
of undergraduate students. Wellesley's productive record in the education of
women scientists, along with its recent progress in attracting more
underrepresented minorities to the sciences, bodes well for the sustained and
broad impact of this instrumentation on research progress, research training and
learning. The encouragement of talented young women to choose careers in the
sciences will ultimately strengthen the infrastructure of the scientific
community in the United States and yield benefits to all members of our society.
Results from the research projects will be disseminated through national or
regional presentations by students and faculty, and through peer-reviewed
journal publications.
