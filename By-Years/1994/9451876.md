9451876 Brown Connecticut College has been given a grant from the Olin
Foundation to construct a new science center that will have an observatory on
the roof. We are requesting funds to equip this observatory with a new telescope
and modern instruments. We would like to obtain a research-grade 20 inch
telescope, a CCD camera, a spectrometer and a computer workstation in order to
provide better opportunities for student research in astronomy and astrophysics
as well as improve our introductory astronomy sequence. The introduction of this
new equipment will significantly enhance the department's major in astrophysics
and minor in astronomy, as students would be able to engage in a wider variety
of research projects using modern apparatus than previously possible. We
currently use a hundred-year-old Clark refractor for both teaching, labs, and
research projects. Students, instead of dealing with science questions and doing
astronomy, spend a great deal of time adapting the Clark to work with 20th
century equipment and expectations. The new telescope will be the focal point of
the observatory and astronomy program and will greatly contribute to the new
prominence that has recently been given to astronomy at the college.
