This is a request for funds to obtain a fluorescence microscope that will be
used primarily by two research groups. One group is investigating the mechanism
by which human epithelial cells recognize and adhere to each other. The process
seems to be mediated by an integral membrane protein which has been purified and
against which antibodies have been produced. The second group is investigating
proteins involved in the shift between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism in
parasitic helminths. Mitochondrial proteins have been purified and antibodies
generated here also. The antibodies in both studies will be fluorescently
labelled and then used as probes to localize the proteins of interest in the
cellular structures, using the requested instrumentation.
