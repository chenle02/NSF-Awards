This project will support the Conference on Universal Algebra, Lattice Theory,
and Related Areas to be held August 17- 21, 1992 at McMaster University in
Hamilton, Ontario. The major purpose of this conference will be to provide an
international forum for a broad exchange of ideas and results in lattice theory,
universal algebra, and related fields. Support will be provided for the travel
of U.S. mathematicians, particularly recent doctoral recipients and graduate
students.
