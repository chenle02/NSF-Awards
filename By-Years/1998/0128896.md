Plant and pollinator interactions have profound economic and biological impact
(e.g., pollination of crops, persistence of fragmented populations or endangered
plant and pollinator species, diversification of floral form). This research
develops mathematical and computer models of plant and pollinator interaction.
Specific objectives are: (1) To investigate the dynamics of interacting plant
and pollinator populations; and (2) To understand when `generalist' (e.g., one
plant relying on many different pollinator) versus `specialist' (e.g., an
intimate one-to-one relationship between plant and pollinator) interactions
evolve. Theoretical methods are based on the premise that plants and pollinators
are participants in an economy of production and consumption (e.g., nectar,
produced by plants and consumed by pollinators). Mathematical and computer
models of plant production and pollinator consumption are integrated using the
economic notion of trade. These models provide insight into the ecological and
evolutionary dynamics of interacting plants and pollinators.

This endeavor is broadly significant in its contribution to study at the
interface between evolutionary and ecological processes, and to understanding
the evolution of plant reproductive systems and plant-pollinator mutualisms. In
addition to these academic contributions, the proposal supports science and
mathematics training with graduate research assistantships and undergraduate
learning opportunities. The proposed training exposes beginning scientists to a
research program integrating quantitative reasoning into questions of biological
relevance.
