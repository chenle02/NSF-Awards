Proposal: 9312012 ABSTRACT Date: 06/08/93 PI: Richey Institution: Pennsylvania
State University The preparation of main-group organometallic compounds will be
developed, and the structures and reactions of these compounds will be
elucidated. One portion of the research will be directed to new strategies for
synthesizing organometallate anions and coordinated organometallic cations. The
procedure involves the conversion of one organometallic compound, with a
suitable coordinating agent, to a coordinated organometallic cation, and in the
process, a negative group is transferred to a second organometallic compound to
give an organometallate ion. In a second portion of the work, mechanisms of
reactions of organomagnesiate and organozincate species with ketones will be
studied. The third portion of the research will develop new synthetic procedures
for organomagnesiate ions and determine structural features of these ions. %%%
This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of
Professor Herman G. Richey at Pennsylvania State University. New strategies will
be developed for the synthesis of organometallic compounds where the metal ions
(magnesium and zinc) carry a negative charge. The structures of the
organometallic species will be determined by x-ray and spectroscopic methods.
Reactions of these organometallic compounds will be investigated, where
particular attention will be paid to new synthetic applications. ***
