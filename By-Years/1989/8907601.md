An Engineering Research Equipment Grant is to be used to obtain a workstation
for flow visualization. It will be shared by several researchers to enhance
capabilities in existing research projects on laminar-turbulent transition,
thermal convection in materials processing, and turbulent flow structure. The
benefit of the workstation is anticipated to be much enhanced data anlysis, the
development of concepts from this capability, and the improvement of predictive
algorithms.
