This grant supports a program of research with the intense neutron flux and
specialized instrumentation of the accelerator laboratory of the University of
Kentucky. These facilities are being upgraded using funds from the EPSCOR
Program of the National Science Foundation and from the state of Kentucky.
Properties of collective excitations in heavy nuclei will be measured, with
emphasis on shape-transitional regions of the nucleons. The measurements will
probe the role of dynamical symmetries in determining nuclear spectra. Other
measurements will study the coupling between reaction mechanism and nuclear
structure, as well as the radiative capture of neutrons, protons, and alpha-
particles by light mass nuclei. In addition to their nuclear physics
implications, several of these studies also are important for understanding how
the elements are synthesized during stellar evolution.
