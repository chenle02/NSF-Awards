This projedct is for participant expenses for thed First International
Conference on Substorms (ICS) to be held in Kiruna, Sweden on March 23-27, 1992.
This ICS has been organized by the Swedish Institute of Space Physics and the
second ICS will be held in Fairbanks, Alaska in 1994. Sessions will include (1)
the ground state of the magnetosphere, (2) thed loading phase and the relation
of substorm processes between the low-altitude auroral region and the
magnetosphere, (3) substorm expansion phase, (4) substorm recovery phases, (5)
substorm-like phenomena at other bodies of the solar system, and (6) and
substorm models. This international conference is especially timely now due to
current and forthcoming programs of the Solar Terrestrial Energy Program (STEP)
which involves 4500 participants in 42 countries, and pacecraft projects of the
Interagency Consultative Group (IACG). The substorm problem is a central one in
these international programs and this conference will help to provide a renewed
focus on the key scientific questions.
