This "Socially Relevant Computing and Analytics" Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site (SRCA-REU) will immerse a diverse group of undergraduates in
a vibrant research community of faculty and graduate students working on
cutting-edge interactive and intelligent media, improving learning and
healthcare outcomes, educational technologies, and diverse forms of interaction
with and through computers. Students will be recruited from underrepresented
groups and colleges and universities with limited research opportunities through
the STARS Computing Corps, an NSF-funded national consortium of institutions
dedicated to broadening participation in computing. The project's focus on
relevant cutting edge technologies is a proven focus that can improve retention
for minorities and women.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the
SRCA-REU project lies in the discovery and evaluation of innovative, interactive
solutions to open problems in serious games, data analytics, automated camera
control, narrative generation, and animal-computer interaction. The SRCA-REU
will provide explicit research mentoring training to faculty and graduate
student mentors, and explicitly encourage faculty and student publication of
results. SRCA-REU students will present their work at an undergraduate research
competition, and will be encouraged to submit their technical papers as peer
reviewed publications. Using the Affinity Research Groups and STARS Training for
REUs models, faculty and graduate student mentors will be engaged with
undergraduates to create a supportive culture of collaboration while promoting
individual contributions to research through just-in-time training for both
mentors and students throughout the summer.
