Proposal - 0124219&lt;br/&gt;P.I. - Alberts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution, on behalf of the Academic Research Fleet proposes to
undertake a multiple procurement of electro-mechanical oceanographic cables,
torque-balanced wire rope, and fiber optic cable to meet the needs of the
research fleet for a 12-month period beginning 1 November
2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since 1982 similar efforts in the procurement of both
electro-mechanical oceanographic cable and wire rope have resulted in
substantial cost savings as compared to procurement by individual laboratories,
as well as a better utilization of available stock. In the past reels of cable
were consigned directly to universities at the time of manufacture to meet their
immediate needs. Subsequent requirements were filled from "Pool" inventories. In
1992, the procedure of delivering all new procurements to the cable pools in San
Diego and Woods Hole was initiated. The result is that currently all cables are
allotted to UNOLS vessels from the pools as the need arises. This will continue.
The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution proposes to act in the management role
for the inspection, acceptance, maintenance, record keeping and storage of the
cables and ropes. The pools will remain under the control of the National
Science Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;
