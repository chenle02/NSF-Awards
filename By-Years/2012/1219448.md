This award will provide support for early career scientists and graduate
students to participate in the CCAPP Workshop "Radio Simulations for Neutrino
and Cosmic Ray Detectors" to be held February 22nd - 24th, 2012 at the Center
for Cosmology and Astro-Particle Physics (CCAPP) at The Ohio State University.

The workshop has two major aims: 1) educating young researchers on developing
simulations for neutrino and cosmic ray experiments that use the radio Cerenkov
or geosynchotron detection techniques and 2) coming to a consensus on simulation
strategies for radio experiments. This will reduce systematic uncertainties and
improve the sensitivity of these experiments to the highest energy cosmic
messengers. The success of the workshop will rely on the active participation of
both young scientists and the world's top experts in these areas of research.

For Broader Impacts, it has a particular focus on early career scientists and
graduate students. A major goal of this workshop is to educate young researchers
and further their impact on the science of the projects. Simulation work is an
excellent way for undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs to learn about
both the physics and instrumentation aspects of the experiments and make
important contributions to the projects.
