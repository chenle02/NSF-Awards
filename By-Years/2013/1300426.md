This award continues funding of a Center to foster research and education at the
interface of the mathematical and biological sciences. The goals of the Center
are to address fundamental and applied biological questions while advancing the
mathematical sciences, and to foster the development of transdisciplinary
researchers. An interdisciplinary perspective, linking biology to the physical
and social sciences, is needed to advance modern biology along a broad array of
challenging problems while providing avenues for fundamental advances in
mathematics. The Center will develop a series of small working groups focused on
topics that will benefit from interdisciplinary efforts through an open call to
the entire community so as to make the center truly a national community
resource. These efforts have the potential to transform the way that
mathematicians and biologists collaborate, a cultural change that will spur
significant progress in both disciplines and at their interface.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past century biology has changed from mostly
describing the patterns of the living world to determining how these patterns
arose, what processes affect them and how we might effectively modify and manage
them. In collaboration with government and industry partners, the Center will
provide scientific insights into problems such as the control of invasive
species, limiting impacts of infectious diseases, and suggesting new methods for
drug design. Thus the Center will produce new knowledge that will help to shape
national policy. Educational initiatives at all levels, from K-12 students to
post-doctoral scholars, will illustrate the connections of mathematics to all
areas of biology and will train a new generation of mathematical biologists.
These efforts will be guided by the need to broaden participation by groups
under-represented in the biological and mathematical sciences. The Center will
develop a strong public outreach effort through a significant partnership and
research collaboration with the National Park Service targeting visitors to the
Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
