A technique for measuring and interpreting collisional parameters as a function
of applied electric fields provides, in effect, a direct measurement of the
density matrix and, hence, a result connecting very directly to theoretical
models. This method is applied to H+ on He collisions in the 20 to 100 keV range
resulting in electron transfer to produce H (n=2); and to electron detachment
from the negative ion H- (n=2) and H(n=3).
