The wide diversity of applications, from aero and automotive engines to micro
and nano systems, requires a diversity of nonlinear feedback designs, which
remain an important research direction. However, the increased availability of
nonlinear design methods must be accompanied with a fuller understanding of
their robustness properties with respect to unmodeled dynamics, ubiquitous in
all engineering applications. Strong nonlinearities interacting with unmodeled
dynamics may cause instability phenomena that cannot be handled by linear robust
control methods. New nonlinear robustness analysis and compensation methods are
needed to increase the applicability of nonlinear designs.

The two main themes in this proposal are, first, analysis of the behavior of
nonlinear feedback systems caused by significant dynamics not included in their
nominal design models, and, second, static and dynamic compensation methods to
improve stability properties and performance in the presence of unmodeled
dynamics. After a brief overview of the accomplishments under the current grant
in Part One, the effects of unmodeled dynamics and possible remedies are
introduced through simple examples in Part Two. The research plan, described in
Part Three, proposes an in-depth analysis and characterization of systems with
minimum and nonminimum phase unmodeled dynamics. It then suggests promising
directions for performance improvement by compensation and structure specific
robust redesigns.
