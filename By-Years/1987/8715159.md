The project is designed to develop a research proposal on "The Effects of Pore-
Throat Mineralogy and Texture on Relative Permeability and Crude Oil
Composition". The objectives of the research are: 1) to improve the recovery of
oil from hydrocarbon resevoirs and 2) to gain knowledge on the filtration of
organic molecules from crude oil by various minerals during migration. Support
of this project will assist a well trained black geologist to improve her
research capability and to complete the planning and development of a regular
MRI proposl. The planning activities, if successful, will significantly enhance
the potential of the investigator to compete for MRI and other research support
