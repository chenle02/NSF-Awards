&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With National Science
Foundation support, Theodore Fernald and Irene Silentman will conduct a two-
year, multi-faceted project on Navajo, an endangered language of the
southwestern United States. They will run a collaborative workshop to allow
language teachers and linguists to support each other in their work. They will
videotape and transcribe Navajo conversations on topics of language use in
various social settings. These conversations will contribute to the development
of a User's Guide to Navajo. The workshop will include courses on phonology, the
structure of the verb, how to teach verb forms to students, and a course in
advanced topics in linguistics. The workshop will allow linguists (both from
inside and outside the Navajo Nation) to carry out analyses of Navajo grammar
and language usage. The language teachers will have the opportunity to gain a
clearer understanding of the workings of Navajo grammar, particularly in the
complex area of verbal morphology. The linguists will have the opportunity to
use their expertise in the service of language teaching.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With roughly 80,000 to 100,000 native speakers, Navajo is
the largest native speech community in North America. But the language is
generally not being passed on to the youngest generation. The collaboration
between language teachers and linguists that this project supports will aid
community efforts to strengthen the use of Navajo and maintain its rich
linguistic and literary tradition. The User's Guide will be invaluable to second
language learners as well as to linguists. The videotapes and transcription will
be a resource for linguists to test analyses of grammatical phenomena and to
further describe how Navajo fits into the spectrum of human
languages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
