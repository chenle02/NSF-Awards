The PIs are acknowledge leaders in the field of marine sediment geochemistry
and early digenesis. With this proposal, they plan to continue studies into the
activities of bottom- dwelling animals and how they can alter material transport
and digenetic reactions in surface sediments of the seafloor. The proposal is
divided into three general research areas: a) the irrigation and diffusion
structure of solutes in the bioturbated zone, b) the permeability of burrow
linings and mucoid secretions, and c) a multi-dimensional study of solute
distributions. The proposed development of novel optical fluorosensors to
measure small scale variations in pore water chemistry is considered an exciting
and important new direction in studies of early digenesis in marine sediments.
