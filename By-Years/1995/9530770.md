Measurement of Stellar Parallaxes and Proper Motions. Dr. Upgren will continue
a program of high precision measurement of parallaxes and proper motions of
selected stars. The results of these measurements will be combined with broad-
band photometry for the study of young and old stars with low mass. Through this
program the physical properties of these types of stars will be better
calibrated. ==============================================
