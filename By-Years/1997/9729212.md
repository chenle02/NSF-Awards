Recent measurements at UC Davis and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have
shown that very low power, low cost radars can be used to measure human speech
articulator positions and motions as speech is articulated. This additional
information provides separate streams of data on the motions of the vocal folds
(i.e., providing voiced excitation information) and on the soft palate, jaw,
tongue, and lips. This project is designed to provide examples of these data
from a representative sample of speakers to the speech community for their
analysis. These include the use of two or more speech optimized radars with
simultaneous speech, optained in several noise environments. In addition,
studies of pitch synchronous processing using the excitation information and
ARMA methods will be provided for selected voiced speech segments.
