This award supports travel expenses for up to 25 undergraduate and graduate
students to attend and participate in the 2020 IEEE International Symposium on
Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (ISPASS). ISPASS provides a forum
for sharing advances in the academic and industrial research focused on
performance analysis and the design of computer systems. The student travel
grant is to support who may otherwise be unable to attend ISPASS and learn about
the advances in the field of performance analysis and the design of computer
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The travel grant selection process will give
priority to US citizens and permanent residents, with special consideration to
members of under-represented groups and participants from institutions that do
not have a strong tradition in the ISPASS research domain. This year priority
will also be given to US-citizen junior and senior undergraduate students in our
efforts to expose undergraduate students to research conferences. These students
will be encouraged to document their experience and what they learned via blog
posts which will later be published at the ISPASS conference website.
Furthermore, support from this grant will also be available to provide companion
funding for attendees with disabilities and/or parental responsibility for an
infant. These efforts are anticipated to broaden the participation in the
conference and, by extension, the computer system&lt;br/&gt;and software
research field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
