A laboratory experience is being integrated into the three- semester calculus
sequence for students of engineering and the sciences. Meeting in weekly
laboratory sessions and working on out-of-class assignments, students are using
the symbolic, numerical and graphical capabilities of Mathematica, a powerful
computer algebra system, to both reinforce and anticipate ideas being developed
in the classroom.
