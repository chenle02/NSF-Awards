The control of industrial processes is set up in a hierarchial mode. At the
bottom are the regulators which handle short term, random, rapid fluctuations,
in the middle are control actions to maintain stability in response to changes
in set point, feed, etc., and above all this is long term, production planning,
etc. The PI's work falls in the middle of the control hierarchy: he plans to
develop a high-level surveillance and corrective system that can sustain control
system and process operability when abnormal situation arise. There are hundreds
of feedback/feedforward control loops in a process plant that are supposed to
function in concert, yet reports of practicing engineers over the years claim
that half of them are out of commission at any one time reason or another.
Malfunction of control system components, human operator decisions and actions,
unusual process conditions, and control system design deficiencies are some of
the reasons. The focus of this work is to synthesize and develop a surveillance
system capable of assessing the operational status of multiloop control systems
and the integrity of operation of the process they control in continually
changing, such a surveillance system will need redetermine the current structure
each time a change in status is detected. Status changes can occur owing to
failure of sensors, failure of actuators, unrelieved saturation of process
manipulatable inputs, breaking of signal continuity in multilevel cascade
systems, and operators, unrelieved saturation of process manipulatable inputs,
breaking a signal continuity in multilevel cascade systems, and operator
actions. The system will incorporate the following components: 1. Determination
of the current control system structure. 2. Identification of the changes that
have occurred. 3. Assessment of prospective control system modifications needed
to address the exigencies of the moment. 4. Development of a procedure for
implementing the structural changes in a coordinated and safe manner.
