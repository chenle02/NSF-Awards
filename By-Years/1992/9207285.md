This research is concerned with the representations of semisimple groups over
finite fields and quantum groups. The principal investigator will study
characters of finite dimensional irreducible representations of quantum groups
at roots of 1. He will also study character sheaves and their relation with the
irreducible characters of finite groups of Lie type. Finally, he will study
canonical bases of enveloping algebras. One of the postdoctoral associates will
work on Lang's conjecture in positive characteristic and Chow groups of some
moduli spaces of curves. Another postdoctoral associate will work on a proof of
the Lefschetz Trace Formula for algebraic stacks and the conjecture of Weil on
Tamagawa Numbers over function fields. Another postdoctoral associate will study
both the applications of analytic tools to the understanding of quantum groups
and the use of quantum groups to approach questions of analytic interest.
Quantum groups are a new area of research for both mathematicians and
physicists. On the mathematical side, it combines three of the oldest areas of
"pure" mathematics, algebra, analysis and geometry, yet it is of great interest
to physicists working on conformal quantum field theory.
