9362185 Proudfoot Intelligent interface agents greatly increase the suitability
of computer technology for use by the broader population in performing simple,
human-oriented tasks. Effective intelligent agents can be built using memory-
based processing. This research involves the application of memory-based
convention, intention, and domain knowledge to handle simple scripts accessible
from the telephone. This Phase I proposal concentrates on recording and
integrating this knowledge to provide an intelligent agent for the voice dialing
telephone service. Convention and domain knowledge will be represented in
conversational scripts. Interactions with the system will be stored in dynamic
memory both as lexical sensory data and episodic conceptual structures. These
interactions will include typed natural language and typed and keyed DTMF and
silence tokens. Wherever possible, existing modules and representations will be
used for processing natural language, dynamic memory, reasoning, and
conversation control.
