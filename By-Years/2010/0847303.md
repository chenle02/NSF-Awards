This grant will to provide support for student attendance, student networking
and student mentoring activities for the first three years of the new American
Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) conference on Smart Materials, Adaptive
Structures and Intelligent Systems (SMASIS). The objectives to be achieved
through the use of support from the NSF will be 1) to promote student
participation at the conference by encouraging participation of students from
underrepresented communities, 2) to foster technical and intellectual exchange
among student attendees; and 3) to develop a network of peers and mentors for
current students who have a common interest in advancing the field of smart
materials and adaptive structures. Activities to achieve objective 1 will
include direct contact with student engineering groups at HBCUs and community
college campuses that are located close to the conference venue each year and
encouraging student attendance by covering student registration fees. Activities
to achieve objective 2 will be a field trip for all student attendees to a venue
near the conference such as a science center during which student networking
will be facilitated. Activities to achieve objective 3 will include program
activities to ensure students interact with leading professionals from industry,
government and academia. The intellectual merit of the proposed activities lies
in providing a forum to rigorously engage students as a community of peers in
technical exchange about smart materials and adaptive structures. The broader
impact of the proposed activities includes promoting participation in this
technical subject matter of students from HBCUs and Community colleges, and in
enriching student opportunities for mentoring and networking
