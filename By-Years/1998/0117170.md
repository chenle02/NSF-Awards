This award will enable researchers to develop high-resolution (~10 year
interval) microfossil and geochemical records from sediment cores recently
collected from the northern coastal waters of Lake Victoria in East Africa.
Preliminary evidence indicates that the cores contain evidence of past lake
level fluctuations due to climatic changes over the last millennium.

From these sedimentary records, researchers hope to reconstruct the
environmental history of Lake Victoria over the last 500 years, reconstruct an
unprecedented high-resolution paleoclimatological record of East African
droughts, gain insights into the role of century- to decade-scale climate cycles
in the tropics, investigate how solar variability over time affects African
climates, and examine the timing and nature of tropical climate responses to the
Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age.

As an RUI proposal, this award will provide a unique opportunity for
undergraduate students to participate in high-quality research thereby gaining
invaluable experience in practical aspects of scientific research.
