The project establishes a broad-based renewable energy education and training
program in collaboration with nearby four-year institutions and with two
technical high schools. Educators and industry experts are developing an
undergraduate certificate in renewable energy. Train the trainer workshops
prepare industry experts with classroom skills to teach credit and non-credit
renewable energy courses. Two summer institutes prepare teachers to integrate
renewable energy concepts into their existing science courses. Segments of the
summer institutes promote the understanding and application of renewable energy
for businesses and homeowners. Area research personnel consult on technical
issues, guide the curriculum development process, and provide workshop
instruction. The eight-course certificate is adapted from the renewable energy
curriculum developed by Partners in Environmental Technology Education (PETE),
Advanced Technology Environmental Education Center (ATEEC) and the Department of
Energy. Four courses are offered at CCCC and four are offered at the high
schools. High school students earn Tech Prep college credit eligibility for high
school renewable energy courses. Module format allows multiple exit and re-entry
points for trades-people with industry experience. Renewable energy
instrumentation provides hands-on real world experience for students.
Internships are required. Graduates from the certificate program are ready to
enter the emerging renewable energy industry in southeastern Massachusetts or
complete an AS degree or AA degree that prepares them for transfer to a four
year BS degree program.
