Abstract

This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2001. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Microbial Diversity and Hydrogen in
the Yellowstone Ecosystem." The goal of this work is to describe the microbial
composition and metabolic underpinnings of the Yellowstone geothermal ecosystem,
with the hypothesis that hydrogen is the primary biological energy source.
First, hydrogen concentration in waters are being measured. Then, the associated
biomass, consisting of hydrogen-metabolizing microorganisms, is being
characterized using a molecular phylogenetic approach.
