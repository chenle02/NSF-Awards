9602514 Rudder The Ralph Bunche Summer Institute brings together African
American college juniors with a view toward encouraging them to go to graduate
school in political science. Approximately 20-25 African American college
juniors are selected in a national competition administered by the American
Political Science Association. The students participate in a five-week, for-
credit Institute which includes graduate level courses, lectures from
distinguished visiting professors, coaching on the Graduate Record Examinations,
informal sessions on applying to graduate school, and visitis from leading
graduate institution recruiters. The grant from the National Science Foundation
will considerably enhance the chances for a successful summer institute. ***
