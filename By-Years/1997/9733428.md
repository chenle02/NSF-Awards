Werth 9733428 This is an award to support a project proposed in accord the with
Guidelines for Submission of Proposals to the Faculty Early Career Development
(CAREER) Program, NSF 97-87. The Principal Investigator's objectives are to
conduct research that will assist in determining the effects of interstitial
water velocity, pore and nonaqueous phase liquid properties on the
characteristics of the effective interfacial region between nonaqueous phase
liquids and groundwater, and predict time- dependent dissolution of nonaqueous
phase liquids in natural porous groundwater aquifers. He plans on using magnetic
resonance imaging to visualize local interstitial velocities, pore dimensions
and other behavior characteristics of the interfaces between nonaqueous phase
liquids and water to elucidate the mechanisms controlling dissolution of
nonaqueous phase liquids. In accord with NSF 97-87, the Principal Investigator
plans on integrating the results of his research into classroom instruction
using interactive simulation models and case studies. This approach is expected
to significantly hasten the transfer of the results of his research from the
classroom setting to consideration of its use in engineering design and
implementation of systems for solving relevant "real-world" hazardous waste
management problems. ***
