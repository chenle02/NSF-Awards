It will primarily be used in research projects that center on the general
question of how genes control development. The ability to take optical sections
and eliminate out of focus fluorescence makes the confocal microscope
particularly valuable for use in experiments where thick specimens are examined.
The proposed research, which largely involves localizing proteins and analyzing
cellular and subcellular of thick specimens, thus it should be markedly enhanced
by the use of a CLSM.
