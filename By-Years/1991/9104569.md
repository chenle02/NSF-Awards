This project will develop microlocal methods in partial differential equations
and several complex variables. The main problems to be undertaken are the
regularity of solutions to first order PDEs, the analytic regularity for
operators with double characteristics, and the Szego kernel. The questions to be
analyzed build on recent results by the PI and his collaborators. The project
considers state of the art mathematical questions. Ample areas of applied
mathematics will benefit from the results of this research.
