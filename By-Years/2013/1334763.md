This award supports fundamental optics science research on laser matter
interaction to establish a parallel laser micro-forming manufacturing
technology. Specifically, the research will use adaptive optical technology to
generate multiple laser beams with arbitrary laser beam profile and energy
distribution to perform rapid three-dimensional laser shock micro-forming on
multiple micro workpieces simultaneously. Using the adaptive laser beam shaping
tool and multi-resolution molecular mechanic simulation approach, laser-induced
shock wave interaction with micro- and nano-mechanical structures will be
studied to gain better understanding on laser-induced defect initiation,
propagation, and distribution to improve three-dimensional laser micro-forming
manufacturing outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new laser shock manufacturing
scheme developed from this research has potential to completely overhaul the
existing laser shock micro-forming manufacturing technique. It will dramatically
improve manufacturing flexibility, precision, and throughput. The scientific
investigation will advance scientific understanding on the interaction of laser-
induced shock wave with mechanical structures at nanometer scale. The new laser
shock manufacturing technology will enhance the competitiveness of the US
manufacturing industry in micro-system manufacturing and assembly. This award
also provides new training opportunities to US students in laser technology,
manufacturing, and material engineering through new course development,
extracurricular activities, and community outreach.
