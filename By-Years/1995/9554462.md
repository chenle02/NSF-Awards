9554462 The Council of Chief State School Officers proposes to collect and
report additional information about mathematics and science education from each
state. The organization has received NSF support since 1989 to design, develop,
and report on state by state differences in elementary and secondary teacher and
student participation in mathematics and science courses and published reports
in 1991, 1993, and1995. This proposal would conduct data collection and analysis
for another year. It would also analyze current state curriculum frameworks,
develop state indicators and report trends in science and mathematics education,
conduct research on new measures of the enacted curriculum and disse minate
indicators in published reports.
