This project establishes a computer classroom/laboratory dedicated exclusively
to mathematics courses. This laboratory contains 24 workstations for students
and one workstation connected to a data-video projection system. Two more
workstations are located in the Mathematical Sciences Department and can be used
by the faculty for course development and preparation. This project affects 350
students in five courses: Multivariate Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential
Equations, Numerical Methods, and Operations Research. Students use the
classroom/laboratory to actively engage in problemsolving, data analysis, and
application exploration. The faculty use the classroom/laboratory to stimulate
the students with innovative techniques involving computer technology. The
classroom/laboratory empowers the students to become involved in class projects
and individual research. This project helps the department to attain its goals
of incorporating computing technology into the undergraduate mathematics
curriculum. *
