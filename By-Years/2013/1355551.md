This effort is focused on better quantifying the emissions of aerosols and trace
gases of global significance from combustion sources in Nepal and Bhutan. Very
little information currently exists on emissions from sources such as brick
kilns, garbage burning, and cooking fires. The broader impacts of this research
include the development of a better understanding of the contribution of
emissions from South Asia to the global burden of gases and aerosol important
for predicting regional air quality and global climate change. This work is part
of a larger international effort between the US, Nepal, Bhutan, Germany, and
Italy to study atmospheric chemistry in South Asia.

Chemical species to be quantified include: PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic
diameter less than 2.5 &#956;m), elemental and organic carbon, absorption by
black and brown carbon, smoke markers, a suite of particle-phase metals and
ions, CO2, CO, CH4, more than 90 diverse non-methane organic gases, SO2, NOx,
NH3, HCN, acetonitrile, and many other types of aerosol and trace gases. The
measurements will complement ongoing regional monitoring activities by filling a
critical need for better source characterization. The results will help to
assess the relative importance of South Asian combustion sources in influencing
air quality and climate on a local, regional, and global scale.
