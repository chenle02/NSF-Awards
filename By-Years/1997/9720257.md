This project will investigate efficient multigrid (MG) and domain decomposition
(DD) algorithms for elliptic and non-elliptic problems on arbitrary unstructured
meshes, which are suitable for distributed and shared memory parallel computing
architectures. Three aspects of DD and MG will be emphasized in this work: (1)
Performance of various DD and MG algorithms on parallel computers with
particular attention paid to communication and cache memory latency. (2) Design
of optimized DD and MG "gray box" libraries for elliptic and advection dominated
problems, which exploit optional information supplied by the user. (3)
Theoretical analysis and practical design of DD and MG algorithm appropriate for
advection dominated problems. Particular emphasis will be placed on DD and MG
algorithms for solving the discretization matrices arising from a variety of
large scale scientific computing problems, such as computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) for advection dominated problems, image processing, photolithography, and
the modeling of microchip performance and fabrication. The non-elliptic behavior
of these practical problems renders the known multigrid and decomposition theory
inadequate and serves to motivate a balanced effort consisting of algorithmic
development, theoretical analysis, and practical application.
