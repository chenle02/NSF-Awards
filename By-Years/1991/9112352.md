This grant is for support of a conference to be held (March 4-6, 1991). The
Optical Computing Topical Meeting will consist of invited papers and both oral
and poster contributed papers in the areas of research in materials, devices,
architectures and algorithms relevant to optical computing. Research topics
include: Optical interconnections and buses for computing; Optical and photonic
computing systems, architectures, models and algorithms, digital or analog;
Hybrid optical/electronic processors; Optical "neural" processors, including
optical associative memories; Optical memory; Massively parallel architectures
for optical implementation; Spatial light modulators and other devices for
optical computing; Nonlinear optical phenomena of potential use in computing;
Nonlinear optical, electro-optical, and opto- electronic components; Areas of
application of the above components and processors; and Fundamental physical and
computational properties relating to the capabilities and limitations of optical
computers.
