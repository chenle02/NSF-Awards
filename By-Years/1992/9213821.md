The work to be supported will be a collaboration between Rice University,
Syracuse University and the University of Maryland. It will investigate and
develop concepts that will extend Fortran D to irregular, loosely-synchronous
problems. Fortran D, extensions of Fortran 77 and Fortran 90 that permit the
programmer to specify the distribution of data, a key step in parallelization on
distributed memory machines, has already been developed at Rice and Syracuse.
The research includes four major components: (1) Extending Fortran D to
accommodate a wider class of irregular problems and to make it possible to use
automatic data mapping strategies. (2) Investigation of high level data
structures, including data trees, synchronous problems. (3) Development of
irregular mapping algorithms and their implementation in the PARTI library. (4)
Integration of the irregular mapping strategies into the Fortran D compiler
under development at Rice and Syracuse
