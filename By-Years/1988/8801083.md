This project contains two major themes: a "complete" solution of the
L-statistics problem, and empirical processes. Specific topics to be studied
include: (1) necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotic normality and
for stochastic compactness of (a) classical L-statistics, (b) L- statistics,
L-statistics in which a fixed fraction of extreme order statistics are trimmed
and (c) L-statistics in which a vanishingly small fraction of extreme order
statistics are trimmed. (2) studentization in each of these cases. (3) providing
a studentized version of a trimmed mean, with vanishingly small trimming
fraction, that is approximately and asymptotically standard normal whenever the
underlying observations are in the domain of attraction of any stable law. (4)
extending the previous result to general L-statistics. (5) extending all above
results to include random trimming. (6) providing a probabilistic representation
of all possible limiting distributions of L-statistics in cases (a), (b) and
(c), and a characterization of when each obtains. (7) extending all results
above to generalized U-statistics. (8) limit theorems for the Kaplan-Meier
estimator process and corresponding cumulative hazard estimator process under
independent but not identically distributed censoring distributions. (9)
exponential inequalities for the weighted empirical processes of independent but
not identicallly distributed rv's. (10) the determination of Piitman efficiency
of estimators of sufficient complexity that a technique like bootstrapping is
essential to apply them to a specific data set.
