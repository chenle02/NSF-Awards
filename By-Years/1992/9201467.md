This award supports the research of Professor Glen Hurlbert for research in
graph theory and other areas of combinatorics. Professor Hurlbert will study
universal cycles and partially ordered sets as well as problems in combinatorial
number theory and combinatorial geometry. Graph Theory go back perhaps two
hundred years, but only in the last half-century has the field become an active,
fertile, and flourishing branch of mathematics. A graph is a network of lines
("edges") joining points ("vertices"), thus the language of graphs becomes a
natural way of describing interrelationships among separated objects. Graph
Theory figures most prominently as an essential tool in Communications Theory
and Computer Science. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study
how discrete collections of objects can be organized. And, so it to is extremely
important to modern communications.
