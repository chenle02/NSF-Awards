The Automotive Manufacturing Technical Education Collaborative (AMTEC) is a
consortium of 25 community colleges and 21 corporate automotive companies
working to strengthen the competency and global competitiveness of the
automotive manufacturing workforce. The consortium creates and sustains an
innovative, responsive and standards-based workforce development system that
meets the skill requirements of the auto industry. Business/industry
partnerships are created to validate the skills and knowledge required by multi-
skilled manufacturing and transportation technicians and to deliver the
technical education that meets the high-priority needs of the automotive
manufacturers, suppliers and dealers. The impact of the Center is increased
through mentoring of other colleges that are establishing automotive
manufacturing and transportation technician programs. The Center and its
partners create a transportable and updateable model for automotive
manufacturing and transportation technician education through the use of a
DACUM/Delphi process and the use of electronic technologies. A pipeline of
educated workers is built on models that successfully recruit high school
students into two-year college programs and also articulate with programs in
four-year colleges. Research on technology is transferred to the applied stage
through workshops for two-year college faculty provided by four-year college
partners. The evaluation of the Center includes assessing its impact on the
automotive industry, on community college practice and on student recruitment,
retention and placement.
