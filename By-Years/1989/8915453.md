This project utilizes recent developments in dynamical systems theory in the
analysis of engineering dynamics problems. Specifically, local and global
bifurcation techniques are used to predict dynamics behavior as a function of
system parameters, as well as to describe them. The research focuses on four
classes of systems, including the use of input waveform for the suppression of
chaos in periodically forced oscillators, the stability of modes at rest in
systems which have active modes undergoing chaotic dynamics, nonlinear dynamic
interactions in rotating mechanical systems, and simple models for the dynamic
response of mechanisms with flexible linkages. A widening gap between
theoretical developments and applications in the field of nonlinear dynamics has
occurred in recent years. This research is a direct attempt to bridge that gap
by employing modern analytical and numerical tools in the investigation of
specific mechanical systems.
