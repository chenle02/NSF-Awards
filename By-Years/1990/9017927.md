This research is a continuation of a project to determine the structure of the
earth's inner core. Seismic constraints on inner-core properties include the
velocity, density; and Q structure, and the recent suggestions of heterogeneity
and/or anisotropy. Some of these properties are not well determined and there
have been discrepancies between models obtained from body wave studies and those
from normal modes. These issues will be addressed by systematically examining a
variety of data sets which constrain inner-core structure, including ISC travel
times, GDSN waveforms, and free oscillation spectra. The aim is to find the
simplest inner-core models consistent with the data, and estimate the resolution
associated with these models.
