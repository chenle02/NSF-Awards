It is generally believed that the LHC will discover new physics at the TeV scale
that can shed light on the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking, and that
could indicate new phenomena beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. It
is also expected that in order to understand the physical origin of this new
physics, a TeV scale lepton collider will be needed. The International Linear
Collider (ILC) is the most well developed candidate for the next lepton
collider. The current ILC R&amp;D directed by the Global Design Effort (GDE),
working under the International Linear Collider Steering Committee (ILCSC), will
present a technical design report in 2012. The Linear Collider Steering Group of
the Americas (LCSGA) was established to provide guidance to funding agencies in
the U.S. and Canada, and to articulate the Americas' stance on linear colliders
within the ILCSC. An important aspect of the LCSGA activities in the coming two
years is establishing the goals and organization for linear collider work in the
period between the end of GDE and ILCSC and the time when LHC results will be
clear and can offer the opportunity to launch a linear collider project. In
early 2011, the PI of this proposal became the chair of LCSGA. This award
provides funds for a portion of the PI's salary and travel funds to cover the
expected travel associated with LCSGA activities. The intellectual merit will
reside in finding a mechanism by which the global community can come together
within a framework that allows each nation participating in a linear collider to
contribute effectively and derive the benefits of the research it enables. The
broader impacts from this proposal will stem from the more fundamental
understanding of the forces of nature that can be provided by the linear
collider beyond that which can be obtained from existing experimental
facilities. Technologies developed for it may be applicable to other fields in
science and engineering. Finding the organizational mechanisms by which a linear
collider could be realized will be critical.
