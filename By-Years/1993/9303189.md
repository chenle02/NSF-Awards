9303189 Wise This award provides infrastructure for the support of
Conceptualization and Visualization of Computation. The equipment supported
includes high performance graphical workstations, a parallel computer, and high
speed networking facilities. The faculty involved in the project are drawn from
the department of Computer Science but have substantial collaborations with
computational scientists and engineers at Indiana University. The research
supported by this infrastructure includes automated theorem proving, circuit
validation, parallel functional programming, scientific visualization,
visualization of Monte Carlo methods, visualization of processor utilization on
scalable architectures, visual programming, and visual performance monitoring
and analysis.
