The objective of this research is to develop methods for design and evaluation
of sensory feedback loops for supervisory decision and control in flexible
manufacturing cells. In these applications, processes evolving in continuous
space and time are modeled and controlled as asynchronous discrete events. The
task to be automated is decomposed into basic discrete operations with
alternative sequencing and precedence relations among the subtasks. To analyze
alternative feedback structures, information-theoretic measures are being
explored as a means for representing the requirements of the operations and the
information and decision spaces of the system components. Information-based
models will characterize sensor resolution, actuator accuracy, and the effects
of alternative internal models for information processing and decision
algorithms. Techniques from optimal stochastic control are being investigated
for potential application to decision problems in flexible cells with real-time
resource allocation. As a tool for evaluating alternative feedback structures
and decision algorithms, a discrete-event simulation model of the automated
processes will be implemented with explicit representation of the sensory
feedback loops.
