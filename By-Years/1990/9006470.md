A new class of layered ferrimagnetic compounds consisting of ordered bimetallic
layers with large spontaneous moments will be synthesized. Candidate materials
include both planar macrocyclic and non-macrocyclic systems. The aim is to
control magnetic parameters such as ordering temperatures, magnetic
anisotropies, and hysteresis curves by the choice of magnetic ions contained and
the ligands that bridge them. This award is part of the Materials Chemistry and
Chemical Processing Initiative, and it is jointly funded by the Chemistry
Division and the Division of Materials Research.
