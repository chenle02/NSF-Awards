The PIs propose to investigate the apparently ubiquitous phenomenon that people
are able to entertain only one hypothesis at a time. The PIs will examine a
number of implications of this cognitive limitation. First, the PIs will study
"pseudodiagnosticity," defined as the search for more information about one
hypothesis as opposed to gathering information about rival hypotheses in a
manner congruent with Bayes Theorem. The PIs will utilize the "information
board" methodology to assess participants' information gathering behavior.
Second, the PIs will investigate participants' information selection while
performing a covariation estimation task in which participants attempt to assess
the relation between two variables. Third, base rate neglect will be
investigated. Finally, data selection in a complex hypothesis testing
environment will be examined.
