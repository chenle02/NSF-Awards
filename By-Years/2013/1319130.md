Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) allows an untrusted party to efficiently
compute any compact function directly on ciphertexts. When made available over
an untrusted cloud server, data is submitted and returned in encrypted form, and
the execution remains secure against malicious users. Early FHE proposals had
rather disappointing efficiencies. Recently new FHE schemes based on the
difficulty of the learning with errors (LWE) problem emerged with orders of
magnitude improvement over earlier constructions. This project addresses a
variety of problems in engineering, computer science and mathematics all
centered around the goal of bringing LWE-based homomorphic encryption techniques
closer to practice which could impact the way society utilizes computing
services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team explores three research
components. The first research component investigates algorithmic optimizations
to speed up LWE-based schemes, and to develop optimized software implementations
on CPUs and graphics processing units. Specifically, the investigators apply
optimization techniques including changing the representation of the operands,
batching, and precomputation. The team also aims to build a LWE-FHE based
homomorphic instruction set. In another research component the project team
develops application specific custom hardware to overcome inefficiencies of
software platforms. Finally, we investigate the customization of parameters to
match the needs of select lightweight cryptographic primitives.
