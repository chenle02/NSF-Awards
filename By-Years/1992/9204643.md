This research is to develop the theory and a computer code for readily
available personal computers to calculate earthquake ground response for sites
on the surface of a sediment-filled valley or basin. The fundamental objective
is the theoretical determination of the eigenmodes (eigenfrequencies and
eigenfunctions) of elastic waves in basins of arbitrary shape. With a judicious
choice of approximations, this calculation could be readily available to a wide
spectrum of users whereas current calculations require extensive codes and large
computers for even simple basin structures. Applications are to site specific
engineering and earthquake hazard estimations. This research is a component of
the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
