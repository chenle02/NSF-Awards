A variety of superlattices, multilayers and metastable solids will be fabricated
by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and advanced sputtering, and characterized by
x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and other microstructure
techniques. In the rare earth superlattices, the magnetic properties, tailored
spin structures and interlayer coupling will be explored. Periodic as well as
aperiodic superlattices will be studied. They will investigate the linkage of
collinear and helical spin structures in gadolinium-dysprosium superlattices.
Iron and cobalt based superlattices are well suited for the investigation of the
magnetic properties of thin magnetic layers and effects due to layer thickness,
crystalline orientation and interfacial coupling. In multilayer systems, the
behavior of thin alloy layers, both cryatalline and amorphous, and either
ferromagnetic or spin glasss, will be studied. Magnetic surface anisotropy, its
dependence on layer thickness and crystalline orientation, and the possibility
of perpendicular surface anisotropy will be investigated in superlattice and
multilayer systems. A number of manganese-based and iron-based metastasble alloy
systems will also be studied.
