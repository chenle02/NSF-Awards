In order to have an effective agreement on greenhouse warming, it will be
necessary to have credible and comparable estimates of greenhouse gas emissions
and economic impacts of their mitigation for as many nations as possible. An
operational methodology is needed that can be standardized across country
contexts and that can capitalize on existing economic data bases. One such
methodology is structural decomposition analysis (SDA). The purpose of this
project is to develop a stronger theoretical base for the SDA methodology using
the tools of applied microeconomics, more specifically production theory,
applied demand analysis, and growth theory. While SDA estimating equations in
the past have been specified in an ad hoc manner, this research will involve
developing a formal derivation of these equations. This research is important
because it will provide researchers and policy makers with a firmly grounded
alternative to the more conventional macroeconometric and computable general
equilibrium approaches which, because of data limitations, are difficult to use
in making cross country comparisons.
