Knot theory and 3-manifolds have recently seen the fruition of several long-
standing programs. The aim of the conference is to give a forum for the research
community to assimilate recent advances and emerging techniques in the field.
The broad perspective of the conference is particularly important for bringing
young researchers to the forefront of the field; consequently, special attention
will be paid to the support of graduate students and postdocs.

Knots and the three dimensional spaces in which they live have long been
important objects of study in mathematics. More recent times have shown that the
area is intimately related to many other branches of mathematics as well as to
physical sciences like biology and cosmology. This has provided renewed impetus
for understanding these spaces. The conference will bring together experts in
various fields all of which have connections to knot theory and 3-dimensional
spaces, with the intention of disseminating recent important results in the
area, providing an overview of the current state of research, as well as
directions for future exploration. These talks are aimed at both experts and
novices in the area.
