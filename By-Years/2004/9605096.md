*** Campbell This grant will continue support for the NSF-sponsored "Research
Experiences for Undergraduates" (REU) site in the Department of Physics at the
University of Illinois, Urbana- Champaign (UIUC). Based on the previous REU
program in nonlinear science, the breadth and strength of the physics research
efforts in this department, and the specific requests of present REU applicants,
an expanded variety of related projects selected from condensed matter physics,
biophysics, astrophysics, and nuclear and particle physics will be added to the
core component of nonlinear science. The target group includes students who have
completed at least four semesters (equivalent) of undergraduate training in the
physical or computational sciences or mathematics. ***
