The acquisition of nine spectrophotometers is providing modern, reliable
instruments for first through fourth year chemistry laboratories. New and
revised experiments using spectrophotometric techniques are being introduced at
all levels. First year chemistry laboratory students are utilizing four
spectrophotometers interfaced with microcomputers to acquire data from three
experiments to quantify a chemical equilibrium constant, the percentage of
manganese in steel, and a kinetics rate law expression. Nonscience curricula
students in another laboratory course are spectrophotometrically determining the
iron content of some common foods. Students in second year quantitative analysis
are using four microprocessor controlled spectrophotometers also linked to a
microcomputer to determine two metals in mixtures and phosphorous in blood
serum. The students are also isolating and identifying lycopene and beta-
carotene from tomatoes by using a scanning ultraviolet-visible spectrometer.
Students in organic chemistry are being introduced to scanning uv-visible
spectrophotometry in a study of the isomerization of an alkene. Upper division
chemistry curriculum students are using the same scanning uv- visible
spectrophotometer to determine ligand field characteristics, stability
constants, and identify compounds. The grantee is matching the award from non-
Federal sources.
