A User Services Area Council (USAC) has been established to promote and
encourage creative exchange of international user service needs and concepts.
Constructive input from various national and international user services
organizations' efforts is also encouraged. USAC will be responsible for
researching and defining short term and long term user services needs and
coordinating developments in finding solutions. The proposed effort is to chair
and direct the USAC to promote cooperation and collaboration on user services
issues of the Internet on an international and global scale. Funding will be
provided for the attendance at three meetings during the next 12 months: the
RARE meeting in Brussels, the RIPE meeting in Geneva, and the COSINE meeting in
Paris. Thus USAC intends to provide a forum of global internet collaboration by
encouraging and coordinating international interaction between existing global
user services groups. It will also provide guidance to countries that are just
beginning to develop and provide their user services communities with support.
