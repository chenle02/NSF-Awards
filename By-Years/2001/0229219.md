Ways of Knowing, Inc. is producing two one-hour film documentarties for public
television on the origin, nature and history of writing. "The Writing Project"
(working title) is about the study of writing as a technology. The goal of the
films is to explain how writing systems work and to make people aware of the
importance of writing in societies. The programs will address what reading and
writing is, how writing was invented and how it is used in dozens of different
systems around the world. The focus is on the diversity, yet sameness, of
writing systems and on the grand variety of its uses. The target audience is the
PBS television audience, with follow-up educational viedocassette distribution
to schools and colleges to be used as an introduction to linguistics "basic
text." The program's outreach will be enhanced by a companion website and book.
