A graphics workstation will be purchased by the Department of Chemical
Engineering to visualize the suspension microstructures and evolving dynamics.
The selected system is Stardent ST3020VS. The dynamics of microstructured fluids
are simulated using Stokesian dynamics simulation. The microstructured fluids
are in the form of particles dispersed in a fluid medium where the particles
interact through any combination of Brownian, colloidal, external and
hydrodynamics forces. Microstructural (particle distribution functions, etc.)
anbd macroscopic (rheology, diffusivities, etc.) properties are determined under
highly nonequilibrium conditions typical of those found in the processing of
multiphase materials. The goal of the work is to understand the relationship
between structure and properties on the one hand and between structure and flow
on the other.
