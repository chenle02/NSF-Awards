PROPOSAL: DMS-9971629

PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Robert Ghrist

ABSTRACT:

The principal theme of this project is the development and refining of
topological techniques for answering dynamical questions about inviscid fluid
flows (the Euler Equations) in the full three-dimensional setting. Through a
correspondence between Beltrami fields and the Reeb dynamics of contact
structures, one can import techniques from contact topology and
pseudoholomorphic curve theory to answer questions of existence of solutions and
of forced recurrence. In addition, knot-theoretic techniques shed light on the
global properties of the Euler equations on Riemannian manifolds. Goals of this
project include the resolution of the Weinstein Conjecture on solid tori (which
would imply that steady force-free fields in a tokamak have closed field lines),
the spectrum of knot types which can/must appear as closed flowlines in steady
Euler flows, and the implications of the tight/overtwisted dichotomy in the
hydrodynamical context with respect to hydrodynamic instability and energy
minimization.

One of the enduring challenges in science is the comprehension and taming of
fluid behavior: from tornadoes to ocean currents, we live in a world of
complicated fluid dynamics. All of these phenomena have mathematical
manifestations --- projections onto a simplified abstract setting whose analysis
yields clues to the workings of the physical world. This project will focus on
the equations governing ``perfect'' fluids: models appropriate for certain non-
viscous fluids and plasmas alike. Emerging techniques from global geometry and
topology provide tools for attacking problems heretofore beyond the reach of
analysis. Surprisingly, such seemingly unrelated questions as ``How do strings
tie up into different knots'' and ``What does geometry in four dimensions look
like'' are closely tied to questions of recurrence and stability in steady fluid
flows.
