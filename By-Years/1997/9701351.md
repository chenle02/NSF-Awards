9701351 Beecher Bird song is widely recognized as a model system for
investigations into the biological basis of learning. It provides the best
example to date of natural learning in a vertebrate, with many striking
parallels to human language learning. Moreover, in recent years many discoveries
concerning the brain mechanisms underlying song learning have suggested that
this model system may reveal much about the general processes of learning in the
brain. This proposal will examine one key aspect of song learning, the tendency
of young birds to memorize more songs than they will ultimately keep for their
final repertoire of songs. Most studies have been done in the laboratory, but
the major study will be conducted on a free-living population of song sparrows,
thus permitting evaluation of the adaptive significance and ecological context
of song learning. The major question addressed is why do male song sparrows
produce more song types during juvenile song than they have in their final adult
repertoires? Specifically, why do they keep certain songs and not others. The
hypothesis is that they keep those songs that best match those of their
neighbors during their first breeding season. The research will record "plastic"
songs of juvenile males (song is not fully formed until March or April of the
bird's first spring) and compare these to "crystallized" song types in the
bird's adult repertoire and to the songs of adult males present in the bird's
natal summer and his first spring (a partially overlapping group). A parallel
study in the laboratory of hand-raised birds tutored by several adult males will
also be conducted. This research will allow a better understanding of how song
is learned, and insights into learning processes in general.
