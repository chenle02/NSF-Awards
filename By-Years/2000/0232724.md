0232724&lt;br/&gt;Wentworth&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award for
U.S.-France collaboration in mathematics involves Richard A. Wentworth at Johns
Hopkins University and Elisha Falbel at the University of Paris VI. The
objective of this project is a concentrated collaborative research effort in the
area of discrete groups and geometrical analysis of low dimensional manifolds.
They will study representation of surface groups in U (n) and the deformation
theory and rigidity issues of spherical CR manifolds. The U.S. investigator
brings to this collaboration expertise in the geometrical analytic aspects of
representations of surface groups. This is complemented by French expertise in
CR manifolds, discrete groups and their deformations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award represents the U.S. side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French
National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). NSF will cover travel funds and
living expenses for the U.S. investigator and graduate student. The CNRS will
support the visits of the French researcher and student to the United States.
U.S. and French graduate students will benefit from the international approach
to research and international exposure for their work.&lt;br/&gt;
