The goal of this project is to develop biodegradable microparticles for drug
delivery that could be easily and reproducibly suspended in saline for
injection. Biodegradable microparticles are being studied extensively as a means
to deliver a wide variety of drugs in a controlled manner. Technology now allow
desired release profiles to be achieved by judicious choice of biodegradable
polymers, particle size, and drug loading. The release profiles may last from
weeks to years, depending upon the materials and parameters used. One
significant obstacle to controlled drug delivery systems is the difficulty
encountered in administering these microparticles by injection. The particles
have a tendency to settle quickly in saline. This makes it difficult to
administer the entire injection volume and also causes the microparticles to
clump in the needle of the syringe, making an injection impossible. Using
viscous injection media is currently the procedure used to attempt to inject
biodegradable microparticles. This research involves a novel, proprietary method
with which biodegradable microparticles containing drugs can be surface treated
so that they can be suspended in aqueous media for long periods of time. The
novel technique is based on a proprietary processes of the star-burst type.
