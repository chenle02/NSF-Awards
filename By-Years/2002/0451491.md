The Extensible Terascale Facility (ETF), or TeraGrid, involves nine resource
providers operating high-&lt;br/&gt;performance computing, information, and
visualization facilities, interconnected with a dedicated
optical&lt;br/&gt;network and integrated with a set of common software that
presents the user community with a cohesive&lt;br/&gt;set of resources and
services. On October 1, 2004, the ETF will conclude a three-year
construction&lt;br/&gt;effort to create this distributed environment and will
transition into an operational state. This proposal&lt;br/&gt;outlines operation
for the University of Chicago resource during the first six months of FY 05. The
proposal&lt;br/&gt;focuses on the minimal resources that will allow for
production use and a development of minimal services&lt;br/&gt;needed to produce
a system that is useful to the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the
UC resource beyond what is typical of TeraGrid resource providers is in two
distinct areas. The first area is in providing production visualization services
that enable users and tools and libraries&lt;br/&gt;for visualization and
graphics developers. The second area is in operating a software development and
testing platform for the TeraGrid IA-64 users. This testbed service will be of
use to the entire TeraGrid community, providing infrastructure missing in the
current system and enabling early access to new software stacks and to future
versions of operating systems. Users will be able to access TeraGrid-aware
visualization applications in a way that, to the user, appears to be a desktop
visualization solution but in reality makes use of the rich TeraGrid
visualization resources. Needed infrastructure will be provided for developers
of specific visualization tools or parallel graphics. Over time this
infrastructure will include access to low-level services that can be put
together to form custom applications. The testbed service will support current
and prototype TeraGrid software stacks on the IA-64 architecture for production
analysis, will enable active testing of new software components, and will foster
long-term development for TeraGrid user projects before wide-scale
deployment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
