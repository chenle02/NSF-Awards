Currently used bone cements to fix implants often fail, requiring major surgery
for repair. This is a proposal to develop a calcium phosphate cement to
facilitate the ingrowth of natural bone into the gaps between the bone and so-
called "cementless" implants that do not depend on the cement for long-term
mechanical rigidity. The cement can be introduced as a liquid or paste which
then hardens within minutes. With time, the cement resorbs and is replaced by
bone. The Phase 1 study will be an examination of how different compositions and
microstructure of the cement affect resorption and bone growth in animals. If
successful, such a cement would find broad applications in orthopedic surgery.
