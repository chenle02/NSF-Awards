This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project covers a program of
research in "Fundamental Studies in Nuclear Physics" at the Kellogg Radiation
Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology. It includes primarily
experimental research addressing key issues in nuclear physics and related areas
of particle physics and particle astrophysics. Research topics include precision
studies of neutrons that could reveal the necessity of modifying the fundamental
theory of particle interactions. In addition, we will study the properties of
neutrinos emitted by nuclear reactors to provide crucial information towards the
theory that new heavy neutrinos could be responsible for generating the excess
of matter over antimatter in the early universe. Participation by postdoctoral
scholars, graduate students and undergraduate students is integrated throughout
the program, affording young researchers exceptional opportunities to advance
their training and education in these frontier areas of nuclear physics and
related areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will continue the California HIgh school
Cosmic ray ObServatory (CHICOS) program. The CHICOS program provides a unique
window on cosmic ray research and educational activities for the high school
teacher and student population of Los Angeles.
