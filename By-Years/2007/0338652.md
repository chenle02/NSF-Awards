This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the device and
market opportunity for thick magnetooptic garnet Faraday rotator films with
planar anisotropy to be operated in the near infrared. Such films would be an
innovative solution to device problems that require high speed continuously
varying Faraday rotation with applied field. The scientific understanding to
make thick-film planar &lt;br/&gt;Faraday rotators do not currently exist. This
project will develop a method to establish the necessary criteria for the growth
of materials of this type including melt composition, crystal composition,
magnetic properties and growth conditions. The magnetic properties of these
films will be optimized for sensors, where the film is required to have a
sensitive response at low fields, and photonic devices, where a linear response
to applied fields is critical. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial impact of
this project would be a less expensive magnetic and electromagnetic sensor. Such
sensors have a potential for immediate impact in reliability of electric power
distribution through failure anticipation and prevention and conservation of
electric power through monitoring and control. These sensors could be developed
at a variety of near-infrared wavelengths including the 800 nm, 1310 nm and 1550
nm bands. Applications for areas such as wheel and turbine rotation, electric
power distribution, monitoring, metering and control and battlefield proximity
sensors will be addressed in this project. The electric power application in
particular has potential to revolutionize catastrophic failure prevention in the
power grid and reduce power costs at a variety of levels. &lt;br/&gt;
