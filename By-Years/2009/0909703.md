Environmentally-induced stress is common in the life histories of organisms,
and, to a large extent, the organism's response to those stressors determines
successful survival and reproduction. Therefore, in order to understand
feedbacks between environment and organism performance, it must be determined
whether and how organisms adapt their phenotypic responses to commonly
encountered stressors such as predators. These responses to stressors may come
at both current and future costs to the organisms performance. This project aims
to determine whether and how local adaptation of the stress response occurs in
populations of wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) that live along a gradient of larval
predation risk. Using a common-garden approach coupled with stress hormone
manipulation, the project will test for adaptation in two potential mechanisms
that would reduce the costs of stress in high-predator ponds: reduction of
stress hormone production to predators, and reduction of physiological
responsiveness to circulating stress hormones. If the cost of chronically
responding to the constant presence of predators is greater than the benefit,
then investigators expect that tadpoles from populations in high-predator ponds
will exhibit either reduction of their production of stress hormones or
reduction in their response to experimentally-elevated stress hormones. The
results from this project will contribute to our general understanding of the
effects of environmental stress on organisms as well as provide insights into
how amphibians in particular are able (or unable) to cope with chronic
environmental challenges. In addition, this project will provide opportunities
for involving undergraduates in primary research, as well as incorporating
public outreach and education to local landowners regarding the amphibians and
other organisms their ponds and wetlands support.
