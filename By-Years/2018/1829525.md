Many scientific computing applications in critical areas of research, such as
nanotechnology, astrophysics, climate, bioinformatics, and high-energy physics,
are becoming more data intensive than ever before. The volume of the data and
the pressure on the runtime system capability of supporting data intensive
operations substantially increases over the time. This project introduces and
optimizes data processing capabilities within memory. The project provides a
fundamental change to data management and program optimization, and brings
promising performance and energy benefits. The project will significantly
advance simulation capabilities of scientific applications, especially those
with intensive data processing. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project
is to enable high-performance, energy-efficient, and flexible processing-in-
memory design, which is adaptive to the irregular, diverse, and changing
behaviors among data intensive scientific applications. To achieve the goal, a
heterogeneous processing-in-memory design, built up with fixed-function
processing-in-memory and general programmable processing-in-memory, is
introduced. The project explores a series of critical questions for building
emerging processing-in-memory, including heterogeneous processing-in-memory
architecture, processing-in-memory programming models, runtime design, and the
implications of processing-in-memory on high performance scientific
applications. The project will significantly advance the knowledge to build
processing-in-memory, and pave the way to integrate it into the existing and
future systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
