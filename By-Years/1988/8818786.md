This project is to study, experimentally on a shaking table, the effects of
connection flexibility on the seismic response of semi- rigid steel frames and
to explore the applicability and limitation of such frames in low and medium
rise structures. It has been widely known that connection flexibility tends to
elongate the natural period of a structure and thus might reduce the seismic
response. To date, however, no such experimental information exists to enable us
to understand the true dynamic response behavior of semi-rigid steel structures.
The research will identify parameters to control and reduce seismic responses of
semi-rigid frame structures.
