The principal investigator will develop and improve methods for studying the
dynamics of pulses in nonlinear optical fibers, providing a description of the
behavior of soliton-like pulses in several applications. This study has the
potential of providing new technological applications for nonlinear optics. The
qualitative analysis of nonlinear waves for such systems is of significant
scientific interest in view of the wide spread occurrence of such phenomena in
real world situations.
