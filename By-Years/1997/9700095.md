9700095 Liu It was recently shown feasible to use hard turning in selected
conditions to superfinish surfaces. However, just like grinding, hard turning as
a finish process may produce thermal damage to the integrity of a machined
surface if the machining conditions create too much heat conducted into the
machined surface. The objectives of this research project are: (1) to study the
integrity of machined surface by hard turning; (2) to develop a model to
estimate the onset and upper bound of the thermally damaged layer as a function
of machining conditions including flank wear; and (3) to study various
innovative methods of extending the limit imposed by surface damage (resulted by
flank wear) for the purpose of longer tool utilization. This research addresses
the problem of thermal damage in hard turning, with the potential practical
result of removing thermal burn as a major obstacle toward widespread
application of hard turning. It holds the promise of replacing separate grinding
and abrasive-based superfinish as a process for finishing hardened workpieces.
