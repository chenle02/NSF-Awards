This proposal comprises four major projects. The first one concerns the
distribution of zeros of L-functions, a vast area of research motivated by the
Riemann Hypothesis and its generalizations. The proposer plans to investigate in
a multidimensional setting the distribution of fractional parts of imaginary
parts of zeros, and to study connections with pair correlation of zeros and
primes in short intervals. The second project aims to provide, in the context of
modular forms, analogs of a recently discovered measure in the complex plane
associated to certain quotients of values of the Dedekind Eta function. The
third project is concerned with the approximation of real numbers by rationals
whose denominators are perfect powers. Over the past few decades many authors
have applied ad hoc methods to obtain nontrivial results in this type of
context. The proposer intends to use an entirely new approach, which offers
unexpected connections with very deep arithmetic phenomena. The last project
aims to provide connections between a classical trace problem of Siegel,
character values of finite groups, and Weil numbers.

This project falls in the area of number theory, one of the oldest subjects of
mathematics. The proposed research comprises projects in several major areas in
number theory that abound with open problems and which have attracted some of
the top researchers in the field. Most of the proposed projects are motivated
by, and build on, recent work by the proposer and his collaborators that has
already yielded promising results. It is hoped that by deploying a variety of
powerful methods and tools from number theory to these problems will lead to
insights and results that will open the door for further developments, and have
broader implications.
