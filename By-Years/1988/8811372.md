A phantom alternative is a choice option that looks real but is unavailable at
the time a decision is made. In practice, phantoms are a common tactic in
retailing (e.g. the bait in bait-and-switch selling tactics). Although consumer
marketing is the primary context for this research, phantom alternatives arise
in many decision applications. Classical models of individual choice assume that
phantoms do not affect choice probabilities. This cross disciplinary research
project investigates the effects of phantoms on changes in choice probabilities,
shifts in perceptions of choice alternatives and preferences of decision
criteria. The research, guided by theories of social cognition and judgment,
behavioral decision making, and cognitive dissonance, investigates three types
of phantoms: known, unknown and uncertain phantoms. The results from this
empirical research will be instrumental to the development of a general theory
of phantom effects and for adapting decision analysis procedures for choice
problems involving phantom options.
