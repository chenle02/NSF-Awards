The feasibility of inducing triploidy in red abalone (Haliotis rufescens)
through temperature shock and chemical treatment was demonstrated in Phase I
research. Triploid abalone should be reproductively sterile and channel
metabolic energy into the growth of meat and shell at a rate greater than
sexually mature diploids. In Phase II, the principal research effort will focus
on methods to maximize triploid production. Objectives for Phase II research
are: 1) to optimize triploid production methodology by manipulating treatment
timing and dosage to maximize triploid induction while minimizing treatment
mortalities; and 2) to observe diploid and triploid embryos to gain insight into
the effects that triploid induction methods have upon early developmental events
involving the activity of maternal centromeres and microtubule formation. The
induction of triploidy in abalone could increase growth rates of farmed abalone
thus increasing farm profitability. And the development of simplified methods
for the induction of triploidy would enable all farmers easy access to this
tool.//
