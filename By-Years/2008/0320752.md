This instrumentation development project will result in a new type of dynamic
light scattering (DLS) apparatus: a Speckle Ensemble Correlator, for which a
working prototype already exists. The use of area CCD detectors for
"multispeckle" dynamic light scattering has been progressing steadily. The
general approach has been to auto-correlate each pixel, and then to average the
results afterwards, all in software. This new method, Speckle Variance
Spectroscopy (SVS), is dramatically different and offers advantages in terms of
both simplicity and applicability. In effect, a linescan camera becomes a
Speckle Ensemble Correlator (SEC) in which all of the averages are explicitly-
computed ensemble averages of a single exposure of the camera; neither time
averages, temporal auto-correlations, nor image storage are necessary. The
broader impact of the project centers on the fact that it will be done at an
undergraduate Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI). The instrument development
project will involve the PI and 2-4 undergraduate research assistants over the
course of two years. In addition, the resulting instrument will be used to
support a series of undergraduate research projects for years to come.
