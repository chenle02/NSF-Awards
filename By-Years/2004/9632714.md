9632714 Cima This proposal is on research to test the hypothesis that matrix-
associated ligands for growth factor receptors stimulate cell migration in a
fashion that depends on both ligand concentration and proximity to ligands for
adhesion receptors. This research involves collaborative research between
investigators at two academic institutions, MIT and the University of Alabama at
Birmingham. This collaboration enables the investigators to combine their
expertise in cell and molecular biology and biomaterials, tissue engineering,
and quantitative analysis in order to develop a unique model system in which
both cellular parameters (receptor type, receptor signaling responses) and
environmental parameters (number, type, and nanoscale control of spatial
presentation of ligands for adhesion and growth factor receptors) can be
independently and systematically modulated. The experimental system will be
complimented by rigorous quantitative analysis of the receptor-mediated
processes which occur. This will provide a basis for choosing the most
appropriate range of system parameters to study experimentally and which allows
the results of studies in the model system to be generalized to additional cell
types important in tissue engineering. ***
