This project will use magnetogram and filtergram sequences to derive flow maps
and time histories of displacements of concentrations of magnetic flux. In
addition, the PIs will study the dispersal of flux over the solar surface on
scales of several supergranules and below, particularly the reaction of flows to
the presence of fields. The central goal is finding an appropriate model to
describe the transport phenomena associated with photospheric magnetic flux.
Specifically, the PIs hope to gain understanding of the differences in the
diffusion coefficients, to the deviations from classical random walk, and to the
dependence of the flow pattern on the local mean magnetic flux density. The
project will combine high-resolution data to allow a detailed study of
subarcsecond topology and flux dynamics with uninterrupted long-duration
sequences with large fields of view, allowing a statistical study of flux
displacement histories. The program will provide a means for systematic and
coherent analysis, specifically focusing on magnetoconvection.***
