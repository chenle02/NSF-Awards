9360374 Asawa The goal of the Phase I research is to design, fabricate and test
a new type of planar waveguide bimodal launcher which is able to launch low
order data modes and high order monitor modes simultaneously into graded index
optical fiber for use in a secure communication link. Graded-index fiber links
have wide bandwidth and high security capabilities. Three launchers will be
fabricated and tested for security and stability performance. The launchers will
have increased capabilities with two feedback channels and an additional channel
for performing OTDR diagnostics of the fiber link. The feedback channels will be
used to stabilize the data and monitor diodes and OTDR channel will be used to
determine the health of the fiber optic link and also to pinpoint the point of
intrusion when it occurs. The waveguide launcher has a potential for low cost in
production due to photolithographic preparation of the waveguides and for
thermal and mechanical stability due to no moveable mechanical adjustments. ***
