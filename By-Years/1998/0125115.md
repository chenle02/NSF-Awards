The WWMeB meeting will bring together biologists and software developers who are
working to develop a World Wide Meiosis Database. Meiosis is the process by
which egg and sperm cells are generated, the gametes. Two previous meetings have
been held. At this meeting, the organizerrs will incorporate two new gender-
specific databases that have been developed for describing events in the
development of eggs and sperm, respectively. The meeting will produce a plan for
coordinating international efforts in an area of biology where the general
processes have been highly conserved.
