The Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at the University of Montana for the summers of 2004-2006. Garon
Smith is the PI and Christopher Palmer is the co-PI. Faculty members from the
Department of Chemistry, Geology, Environmental Health and Environmental Studies
will serve as REU mentors to eight students who will each participate in an
eight-week program. Recruitment is targeted to American Indians, Hispanics and
inner city students. REU students will perform environmental chemical research.
They will participate in a weekly ethics and social action seminar providing
exposure to environmental policy issues and decision making, and attend and
participate in public hearings on environmental policies. The participants will
return to the department after the following fall semester to prepare for talks
at national meetings and for discussions on professional opportunities.
