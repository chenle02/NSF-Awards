Research on a wide variety of phenomenological and theoretical topics in
particle physics will be carried out. Two theoretical projects evaluating the
cross-sections fortriple weak gauge boson and S- and P-state (and even
D-state)quarkonium production are planned. Several more phenomenological
calculations involving psi and chi production invarious collider settings are
envisaged. Further work on tests of the hadronic (especially the gluonic)
structure functions of the photon in ep collisions will also be undertaken, as
will projects at the interface of particle physics with astrophysics and cosmic
ray physics. Much of the work to be carried out is meant to further the
extremely crucial contact between theoretical and experimental elementary
particle physics.
