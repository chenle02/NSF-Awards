The motivation for this project is the extension of centrifuge modeling to the
simulation of general three-dimensional ground motions in geotechnical
earthquake engineering. One step in this direction is the novel concept of a
Centrifuge Differential Ground Motion Simulator (CDGMS). This action is to
support, under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research program, the
exploration and testing of a Flexibase container design that can deliver
uniform, linear, quadratic or discontinuous motions to a centrifuge soil model
via a multi-shake table system. c&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Flexibase container
will permit the simulation of three- dimensional seismic characteristics, such
as those arising from non-vertical seismic incidence, traveling waves and near-
field effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finite element modeling is used to achieve
an optimal design via detailed dynamic analysis of different soil-container
designs under centrifugal forces. The computational platform will also provide
an efficient framework for iterative selection of materials, geometries,
bearings and other mechanical components in the final design. Scaled prototypes
will then be fabricated where appropriate for physical testing and performance
evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;
