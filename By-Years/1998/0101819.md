The goal of this project is to advance the state of multi-agent processing for
intelligent, adaptive biomedical monitoring systems. Adaptive reasoning will
align with an agent's mission and guide agent monitoring of aspects of a target
environment--comprised of base models with interjected instrumentation readings.
Base models are infused with "live" interactive data and decision functionality
embedded within multiple, autonomous agents, which determine actions, set off
alerts and export state. Experimentation will involve exploring the most
effective guidance capabilities from genetically programmed agents and adaptive
neural networks, in combination with a supportive knowledge base. While the
approach has broad application possibilities, it has specific implications for
supplemental assistance to medical personnel inundated with information. This
project will also provide opportunities for undergraduate students to become
actively involved in a growing area of computer science
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
