This award will support the attendance of early career scientists at the
inaugural Gordon Research Seminar on Chromatin Structure and Function, which
will be at the Jordan Hotel, Newry, Maine on July 22-27 of 2018. The format of
the meeting is a combination of talks and posters, which will promote scientific
exchange in both formal and informal settings. One session is devoted to the
professional development and mentoring of early career scientists. There will be
ample opportunity for sharing the latest research results and for
networking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting will cover the broad topics of
chromatin organization and genome architecture, and the impact of chromatin
regulation on physiology and disease. The field of chromatin biology has grown
significantly, and has contributed new concepts and technologies that have
pushed scientific boundaries and impacted related fields. Discussions and talks
regarding the development of cutting-edge technologies and how such technologies
can be used to answer questions in novel ways will be included at the meeting.
The fields of chromatin biology and epigenetics are moving at a fast pace, and
this meeting provides a venue for early career scientists from around the world
to present their latest contributions to these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
