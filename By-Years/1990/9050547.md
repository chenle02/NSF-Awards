The purpose of this project is to modernize the mechanics laboratory to a level
beyond that normally encountered in an undergraduate teaching environment. This
has been accomplished through the acquisition of a state-of-the-art testing
machine and accessories. This apparatus is interfaced with a microcomputer for
automatic data collection and analysis. The study of materials properties is
enhanced by permitting accurate determination of the stress-strain behavior of
materials and associated properties such as Poisson's ratio and the modulus of
elasticity. The laboratory's capability is expanded in a broad range of
experimental areas such as fatigue, creep, and fracture mechanics. This
equipment greatly increases the students' exposure to modern experimental
techniques and better prepares them for graduate studies and professional work.
The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's
institution.
