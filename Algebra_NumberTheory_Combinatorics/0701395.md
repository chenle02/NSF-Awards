Abstract for the award DMS-0701395 of Katz

The principal investigator proposes to continue work in arithmetic algebraic
geometry, especially the l-adic cohomology of varieties over finite fields,
exponential sums over finite fields, their associated L-functions, the
determination of monodromy groups, and the application of that determination to
the earlier questions. Some of the main tools are group theory, Fourier
Transform, and the theory of perverse sheaves. Particular topics of
investigation include the calculation of monodromy groups, the equidistribution
of character sums as the multiplicative character varies, and some 'horizontal'
equidistribution questions attached to fixed varieties over Z[1/n] and varying
primes p for which no theoretical framework, even conjectural, yet exists.

The broader impact of this project is three-fold. While it is too soon to
appraise the wide societal impact of this particular project, the last two
decades have seen stunning practical application in many fields (e.g.,
telecommunications, cryptology, and computer security, to name just a few) of a
great deal of algebraic geometry over finite fields, some of which goes back to
the nineteenth century, and all of which seemed quite arcane at the time it was
being done. On a more immediate scale, the project will lead to a great deal of
interaction with postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and advanced
undergraduates, both in theoretical collaborations and in the carrying out of
computer experiments. From the narrowest point of view, the project will advance
our understanding of the analogies between the finite field case and the number
field case, analogies which have already played an important role in shaping our
very thinking about number theory.
