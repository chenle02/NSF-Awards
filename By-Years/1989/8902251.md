This award supports the research in Algebraic Geometry of Professor Robert
Lazarsfeld of the University of California at Los Angeles. Dr. Lazarsfeld will
be continuing his work on the applications of vector bundle techniques in the
study of linear series. In particular, he intends to investigate some problems
involving the Noether-Lefschetz locus as well as some questions arising out of
work already begun with Dr. Mark Green of UCLA, on generic vanishing theorems.
This is research in the field of Algebraic Geometry, one of the oldest parts of
modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes
use of methods not only from Algebra, but from Analysis and Topology, and
conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in theoretical
Computer Science and in Robotics.
