In the first (two-year) research period, the roles of different interbilayer
forces and bilayer fluidity on the molecular-scale deformations of adhering and
fusing bilayer using novel electron microscopy and surface force measurements
have been studied. These experiments identified a particularly important role
for hydrophobic forces in adhesion and fusion. In this follow-up project, it is
further proposed to study how hydrophobic, stearic, and ionic interactions
operate at the molecular level. Various time-dependent effects associated with
hydrophobic forces and adhesion are investigated. Lipid mixtures and lipid-
protein membranes are used. The effects of fusion-inducing proteins, such as
Synexin, are probed. The Surface Forces Apparatus will be used in parallel with
a variety of Electron, scanning Tunneling, and Atomic Force Microscopy
techniques. The results will be important in (i) developing the capability to
directly study the interactions of real biological membranes and of other
biological macromolecule; (ii) the development of chemicals and processes which
can control adhesion or fusion of vesicles, liposomes, and biological cells in
biotechnological processes; and (iii) the effectiveness of surfactant as
dispersant, in flotation, in foams, and in emulsions.
