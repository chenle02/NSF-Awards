The principal investigator will continue his study of analytic torsion. This is
a poorly understood topological invariant of manifolds that can be defined using
purely analytic techniques, yet cannot be determined from local information. The
main idea of the research will be to relate the analytic torsion to other
geometric invariants of the manifold. This award will support research in the
general area of differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry
is the study of the relationship between the geometry of a space and analytic
concepts defined on the space. Global analysis is the study of the overall
geometric and topological properties of a space by piecing together local
information. Applications of these areas of mathematics in other sciences
include the structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and the
large scale structure of the universe.
