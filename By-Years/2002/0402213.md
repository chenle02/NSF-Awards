This project will continue the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM)
infrastructure, which consists of the GEM electronic newsletter, the annual
GEMstone newsletter, and the GEM web pages. The project also includes a small
research component of relevance to the Inner Magnetospheres/Storms campaign.
These efforts are centered on determining the physical causes of the semiannual
variation of geomagnetic activity, hybrid plasma simulations to better
understand kinetic processes in the magnetosphere, the non-linear response of
plasma circulation to solar wind conditions and the formation of the ring
current. The project facilitates the solution of key problems associated with
the dynamics of Earth's magnetosphere. The project also helps to train a
significant cadre of students and leverages much support from National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s space-based program.
