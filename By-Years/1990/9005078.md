Existing volcanic eruption models need to be superceded by a more adequate
modelling, since many observations of eruption columns, blasts and related
phenomena still lack theoretical explanation. Careful theoretical analyses are
essential to provide explanations against which field observations may be
tested, and to provide the stimulus for new, insightful approaches to field
investigation. Accurate modelling is now feasible due to availability of
advanced numerical techniques and supercomputers. We therefore propose to
develop a rigorous unified computational model for volcanic eruptions involving:
three-dimensional, unsteady, turbulent, compressible, thermoviscous, multiphase
radiating flow, with interaction from extraneous water, arbitrary cross-wind
profiles, stratified humid atmosphere, and realistic ground topography. Vent
orientation and shape will be arbitrary. This grant will partially support a
graduate student who will participate in the development of this model under the
supervision of the two PIs.
