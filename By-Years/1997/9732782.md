Prof. Peter C. Searson will develop an experimental and theoretical framework
to describe the electrochemical deposition of copper and gold on silicon, and to
characterize the microstructure and electrical properties of the junctions. A
combination of techniques will be used, primarily electrochemical analysis,
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, in situ microwave reflectivity, scanning
probe microscopy, electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction. The project will
result in the determination of the mechanism of the charge transfer at the
electrolyte-semiconductor interface and of the metal deposition; the kinetics of
the ion reduction at the doped semiconductor surface, and of the metal
nucleation and growth. Insight will be gained on the relationship between
interfacial chemistry and materials properties (microstructure, morphology, and
electrical properties). A scientific basis will be provided for the deposition
of high quality, uniform metal films on semiconductor surfaces, with controlled
Schottky or ohmic characteristics.
