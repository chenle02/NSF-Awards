This research provides surrogate statistical models for the usually
deterministic output of complex computer models which cannot be directly
explored in great detail because of their size and limitations on the number of
runs. The models are based on a set of runs at selected inputs to aid in
predicting the output at untried inputs, optimizing characteristics of the
output, identifying important input factors and tuning the model to physical
data. The strategies will be devised in the context of large numbers of input
factors. The ingredients will include methods to select inputs (statistical
experimental design) and to analyze the output data through the use of
stochastic process models for deterministic outputs. Supercomputing power will
be necessary to treat large numbers of factors and to extract the most out of an
expensive-to-collect set of runs from computer models that themselves may run on
supercomputers. A cross- disciplinary atmosphere will be maintained to stimulate
the formulation of relevant problems with applicable solutions.
