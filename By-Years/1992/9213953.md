Support is provided for a collaboration between J. Macek and S. Ovchinnikov to
examine the connection between the adiabatic approximation and semiclassical
theory. A short term goal is to exploit the approximate analytic solutions
developed by the Soviets to study high Rydberg states in atoms. The long range
goal of the work is to establish connections between semiclassical theory, using
Feynman's propagator techniques and the semiclassical solutions of the coupled
channel, adiabatic equations.
