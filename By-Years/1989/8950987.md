This project will develop an advanced physical chemistry laboratory which will
expose students to a modern computer-based approach to spectroscopy and
molecular modeling. The experiments are designed to illustrate the close
interaction between experiment, theory and simulation that characterizes modern
physical chemistry. The experiments are centered about three instruments -- a
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, a laser, and a differential
scanning calorimeter. These instruments will be used to investigate the response
of carefully chosen systems to electromagnetic radiation or heat, and the
results of each measurement will be compared with those simulated by the
computer on the basis of molecular models. This Instrumentation and Laboratory
Improvement (ILI) award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Duke University to acquire spectroscopic,
calorimetric and computer equipment that will be used to enhance undergraduate
laboratory instruction.
