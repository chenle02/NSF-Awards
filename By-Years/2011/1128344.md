Netcentric Software and Systems Center Proposal #1128344 Proposal #1128270

This proposal seeks funding for the Netcentric Software and Systems Center sites
at the University of North Texas and the University of Texas ? Dallas. Funding
Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved
solicitation, NSF 10-601. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals
for support of industry-defined fundamental research.

Software development is increasingly achieved via Service Oriented Architectures
(SOAs) served through web-based services, Quality of Service (QoS) is an
important issue yet major gaps exist in the QoS paradigm. The proposed work
looks at the composition approach where QoS properties are known at the
individual web component level and used to determine an overall global QoS
understanding. The proposed work seeks to establish a comprehensive framework
for QoS-assured service composition and execution using a A QoS-reconfigurable
service paradigm, compositional security and reliability analysis recently
developed by the group, and a three phase composition algorithm to rapidly
arrive at candidate compositions that meet QoA requirements.

The outcomes of the proposed work have the potential for significant impact in
the area of software development and application and the SOA community. The work
is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry
members of the center. The effort has the potential to extend the center?s
portfolio through further development and application of the QoS framework
developed. The PI plans to develop Network Centric Operations Industry
Consortium (NCOIC) patterns from the work and post these for public access. The
center will involve graduate students in the work.
