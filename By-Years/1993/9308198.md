This research involves a molecular approach to studying the mechanism for
peripheral T cell tolerance. Exposure of T lymphocytes to tolerogen in vitro or
in vivo inhibits the antigen- specific proliferative capacity of T helper (Th)
type 1 (Th1) cells, but not Th type 2 (Th2) cells. A possible mechanism for T
cell anergy involves the inappropriate expression or activation of cyclins,
highly conserved cell cycle regulatory proteins. The first objective to test
this possibility is to characterize cyclin use during cell cycle progression of
non-tolerized murine Th1 and Th2 clones. Immunoblotting techniques and H1
histone kinase assays will be used to study the levels and/or activation states
of a panel of cyclin mRNAs, cyclin proteins and cyclin-CDK complexes in resting
and antigen-activated Th cells. The second objective is to examine the effects
of tolerance induction on normal Th1 and Th2 cell cyclin use. Since little is
known about cyclin use in mammalian lymphocytes, the results of the experiments
described here will be novel, and potentially useful in delineating T cell
activation and anergy. %%% The planning activities to be supported by this grant
will give the investigator, whose background is in cellular immunology,
experience in methods of molecular biology so that she can pursue studies of the
molecular basis of the phenomenon of T cell tolerance in immune function.
