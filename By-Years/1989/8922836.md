In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Professor McCurdy plans to investigate what happens when
electrons collide with molecules, as well as what happens to atoms when they are
placed in stong electric or magnetic fields. A range of studies (including
electronic excitation, dissociation, and vibrational excitation by electron
impact) of collisions of electrons with polyatomic molecules will be performed
on small polyatomic molecules. The investigations will be based on the complex
Kohn variational approach, and the efforts will be focused on intrinsically
polyatomic phenomena and on systems which are important for plasma applications.
The same computational methods will be used to study the dynamics of atoms in
intense fields, where the field destroys the symmetry of the atomic problem.
