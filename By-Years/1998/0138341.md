Understanding what leads individuals to transfer resources to others, outside
one's own family is fundamental issue within economics, and other social
sciences. This planning grant pursues research that investigates two related
questions using a new longitudinal household survey from Indonesia. First, what
is the relationship between transfers to family members, and transfers to
community organizations? Second, are there intergenerational linkages between
transfers to family, and transfers to community institutions? The theoretical
approach used in this project models the individual's decision to participate in
a transfer network within the context of an overall utility-maximizing strategy.
Family and community networks can provide important economic benefits such as
insurance and credit, mutual labor exchange, as well as non-economic benefits
such as caring, social status and group membership. An individual will choose to
participate in a given network when the expected benefits outweigh the expected
costs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The results from this research can inform
important policy debates. Understanding which individuals and communities lack
access to formal and informal mechanisms for consumption-smoothing, risk sharing
and organizing economic production may improve the ability to target vulnerable
groups within poverty alleviation programs. In addition, identifying the
relationship between family and community networks can improve the effectiveness
of public policy towards community organizations, so as to avoid unintended
crowding out effects. If family networks and community-level networks are close
substitutes, then the expansion of community organizations may displace family-
level mechanisms for providing credit, insurance and mutual labor exchange.
