This project includes research in theoretical particle physics, and also in
aspects of astro- and nuclear physics, within the Institute for Theoretical
Physics at Stanford University. One aim of this research is to go beyond the
Standard Model of particle interactions to investigate the origins of
electroweak symmetry breaking, CP violation, and fermion mass matrices. The
emphasis of this research is on searching for new effects which can be
experimentally tested in precision accelerator experiments and rare decays.
Another goal is to use effective chiral Lagrangian techniques to study
observable effects of kaon condensation on neutron star cooling, supernovae, and
heavy ion experiments. This project should aid in increasing our understanding
of basic physical processes involving elementary particles and in identifying
tests of theories in the context of both a broad range of accelerators and of
observation of stellar bodies.
