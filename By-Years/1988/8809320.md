The objectives of this project are: to quantify the stress-transfer process in
concrete columns due to creep deformations, (2) to determine if column
longitudinal reinforcement can yield under the action of sustained axial loads,
(3) to identify changes in column lateral strength, stiffness, and
deformability, and (4) to define the influence of axial load, sustained axial
loads, (3) to identify changes in column lateral strength, stiffness, and
deformability, and (4) to define the influence of axial load, sustained load
period, and material properties on column response to lateral loads. Laboratory
specimens, comprising pairs of beam-column subassemblages will be subjected to a
sustained axial load prior to the lateral load tests. A computerized nonlinear
model will be developed to simulate the behavior of the columns including
realistic representation of material properties, effect of transverse
reinforcement, and creep effects. This is a research initiation award to develop
a computational method for assessing the effect of sustained loads on the
integrity of concrete columns. Use of the model will allow the user to define
the strength, stiffness, and deformation limits of old concrete columns.
