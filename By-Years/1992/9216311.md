Partial travel support is provided to allow a group of eleven US researchers in
the area of tribology to travel to the CIS. They will attend the Joint Soviet-
American Conference on New Materials and Technologies in Tribology, to be held
in Mensk in Belarus, and will visit a number of research institutes in Russia,
Belarus, and Ukraine. The purpose is to assess the state of tribological
research and technology in the former Soviet Union and to open channels of
communication and cooperation between tribology researchers in two countries.
