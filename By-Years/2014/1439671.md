Developing more, highly qualified mathematics and science teachers is a national
priority. This Phase I, Track I Noyce Teacher Scholarship project, Acquiring
Teaching Opportunities in Mathematics and Science (ATOMS), will recruit 24
juniors who are majoring in biology or mathematics who have not considered a
career in teaching and will provide them with three-year scholarships to
complete the requirements for a baccalaureate degree in their discipline and
Ohio's Adolescent/Young Adult (AYA) Integrated Mathematics or Life Science
licensure for grades 7-12. The program will also recruit and financially support
eight individuals who have completed an undergraduate and/or graduate degree in
mathematics, science, or a related field through a one-year rapid post-
baccalaureate program to become AYA licensed in Integrated Mathematics or Life
Science. The ATOMS program will bring together a strong team of faculty from
biology, mathematics, and education, as well as leaders and teachers in high-
needs partner schools, to prepare these ATOMS scholars with strong content
knowledge; commitment to inquiry-based science; and an understanding of how to
inspire, evaluate, and measure student learning. The ATOMS program will involve
its scholars in early field experiences in high-needs schools, education
internships at the collegiate level, workshop series focusing on integrating
content and pedagogy and developing high-leverage practices, mentorship
programs, and robust interactive communities of practice. Collectively, the
ATOMS program will aim to generate knowledge on the benefits of coupling best
practices with rigorous preparation for future teachers.
