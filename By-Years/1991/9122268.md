It is proposed to investigate the enhanced electron-electron interactions that
occur in disordered, two-dimensional metallic systems. Electron tunneling, a
direct probe of the interactions, will be employed. Through these studies it is
hoped to refine our current understanding of the metal/insulator transition in
disordered materials.
