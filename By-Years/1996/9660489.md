. This aerosol research focuses on the study of the basic parameters governing
the mechanisms dominating the transport of vapor material to particle surfaces
in flowing gas streams. It is proposed that the basic parameters be established
for the physical vapor deposition of simple organic compounds on sub-micron
particles of sodium chloride. This study will establish the feasibility of
physically coating aerosol particles with vapor. If successful this study will
establish the basic ground work for applying this technique to applications with
high commercial value. An example of an application is the in-flight coating of
plasma generated titanium oxide with an organic compound such as dimethicone.
This application is presently accomplished by an inferior process of spray
coating bulk batches of titanium oxide resulting in inconsistent particle size
distribution and overall product quality. If successful the physical deposition
of vapor on aerosol particle surfaces has many commercial applications in
addition to powder processing such as high temperature filtration efficiency and
clean room efficiency enhancement.
