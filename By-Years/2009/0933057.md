&lt;br/&gt;Fingering convection at low Prandtl number. Double-diffusive
processes play an important role in mixing the upper ocean, and have been
extensively studied in this context. Decades of experimental and theoretical
research in the high-Prandtl (Pr) number regime characteristic of the heat/salt
system have provided reliable parametrizations for the turbulent heat and salt
fluxes induced by double-diffusive instabilities, as well as insight into the
mechanisms leading to the formation of thermohaline staircases. Double-diffusive
mixing is also thought to play a major role in the astrophysical context, and in
particular in the interior of stars and giant planets. However, the
applicability of parametrizations and analytical theories derived in the high-Pr
regime to other regions of parameter space remains an entirely open question.
Indeed, studies of the characteristics of linear and weakly nonlinear double-
diffusive instability suggest that the low- Pr regime appropriate to the
astrophysical context bears little resemblance to the aforementioned heat-salt
system. The mechanism causing the saturation of the fingering instability is
still undetermined; whether fingering convection leads to the formation of
thermochemical staircases or not is an entirely open question. In short, double-
diffusive transport remains one of the most uncertain components of global
stellar/planetary evolution models. In this study, The PIs plan to carry out an
extensive numerical and analytical study of fingering convection in the context
of stellar/planetary interiors (Pr'รก 1), address the points raised above and
derive practical parametric formulae for the heat and compositional fluxes for
use by the astrophysical community in global evolution models. The numerical
tool the PIs intend to use has already been developed in the scope of a related
but different NSF-funded study. Using this tool, the PI's team obtained the
first ever evidence for 3D spontaneous thermohaline staircase formation. Since
no low-Pr, 3D Direct Numerical Simulations of fingering convection have ever
been performed, the PI's experimental results will be an invaluable point of
comparison for all existing and future theories. The analytical tools the PIs
intend to develop will be inspired by, and thus strive to extend, existing high-
Pr work. Both astrophysical and oceanographic communities, supported by state-
of- the-art numerical tools, will greatly benefit from this interaction. This
study will contribute to UC-wide efforts in the development of the Fluid
Dynamics and High-Performance Computing curricula by providing the opportunities
for undergraduate training in research (Senior Thesis projects, and UC LEADS
research opportunities) and by contributing to the construction of a fluid
dynamics student experimental laboratory with inquiry-based learning educational
techniques (as part of the Institute for Science and Engineer Educators
program).
