This award supports participants of the Southeastern Logic Symposia in
2020-2022. The first meeting will take place February 29-March 1, 2020 at the
University of Florida, Gainesville, and there will be one 2-day meeting per
year, taking place at the University of Florida in early March. The Southeastern
Logic Symposia series provides a forum for set theorists and computability
theorists to meet on a regular basis and the interactions between the two fields
keep producing new mathematical ideas. The conference series is also unique in a
geographic respect: in the south-eastern region of the US, no other regular
mathematical logic meetings take place.

Each meeting will feature three plenary talks given by senior speakers in
mathematical logic, and two special sessions, one in computability theory and
another in set theory. The organizers expect roughly 30 participants each year.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
