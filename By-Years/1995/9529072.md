The investigators' research in multiple reference point models of information
petrieval (IR) has led to the development of a collection of visual information
retrieval interfaces (VIRIs) embodying different approaches to visualizing
similarity and semantic relations among documents. These VIRIs are intended to
aid users in retrieval and organization of online information. VIRIs based on
visualization of Boolean/set operations (BIRD), distance measures in a reduced
space defined by reference points (GUIDO), similarity with respect to multiple
reference points (VIBE), and similarity defined jointly by distance and angular
separation (DARE) have been developed. User studies will be conducted with these
VIRIs in order to: 1) improve usability of their interfaces, 2) investigate
conceptual accessibility of different visualizations to potential user
populations, and 3) evaluate utility of the VIRIs for prototypical information
retrieval and organization tasks. These studies will provide the first
systematic investigation of the usefulness of document space visualizations to
expected user populations for a variety of information retrieval and
organization tasks. The interface features enhancing VIRI usability, and
information visualizations demonstrating usefulness are expected to augment
hypertext as mechanisms for organizing and accessing online information.
