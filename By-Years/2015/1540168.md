Distributed constraint optimization problems (DCOPs) have been shown to be
useful in modeling various distributed combinatorial optimization problems,
including meeting scheduling, sensor network, and power management problems.
However, many of these problems are not only distributed in nature but dynamic
as well. For example, a disaster rescue scenario can include dynamic events like
the collapse of buildings, detection of new survivors, and spread of fires.
Previous attempts to cope with dynamism in DCOPs have focused on reactively
finding a new solution when an event occurs.

In this project, the PI will take a proactive approach by taking possible future
events into consideration when searching for solutions. This research will
result in (1) a newly designed Robust DCOP (R_DCOP) model that will include a
probabilistic scheme representing the likelihood of dynamic events; and (2)
R_DCOP algorithms that will address the stochastic elements of the problem. The
broader impacts of this research project are two fold: (1) Through this
research, the PI will build the foundations for a general robust DCOP model that
can be applied in dynamic environments and spur deployment of DCOP algorithms in
the real world; and (2) This project will support broadening participation of
underrepresented students at NMSU, a minority- and Hispanic-serving institution.
