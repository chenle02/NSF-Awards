This supports the work of Dr. Tony Pantev a post-doctoral associate to Professor
Kleiman. Three problems will be studied. The first is to analyze the monodromy
group of generalized theta functions. The second problem asks for a geometric
description of the locus of motivic local systems on curves. The third problem
to be studied is a conjectural construction of Hyperkahler manifolds. This is
research in the field of algebraic geometry, yet it directly connects to two of
the great advances in theoretical physics in this century--quantum mechanics and
general relativity. Algebraic geometry itself is one of the oldest parts of
modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past
quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the
plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes
use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and
conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in physics,
theoretical computer science, and robotics. ***
