The objective of this research is to develop tunable terahertz metamaterials to
create a new class of compact electromagnetic devices for rapid real-time
sensing and detection. This will be accomplished though integration of micro-
capacitive actuators with broadside coupled split ring resonators enabling
mechanical tuning of the interlayer coupling and associated electromagnetic
response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research is that
it provides a novel approach to realize active and dynamic metamaterials.
Strongly coupled metamaterial resonators provide a unique and, as yet
unrealized, route to create tunable and adaptive electromagnetic composites. The
transformative aspect of this project is the implementation of lateral
displacement of coupled resonators using microelectromechanical systems
technology. Fundamental interactions between split ring resonators in the strong
coupling limit will be investigated as a function of lateral and interlayer
spacing. This will enable optimization of the precision voltage-controlled
response such that new metamaterial designs and fabrication methodologies can be
used to implement real-time frequency tuning from terahertz to mid-infrared
wavelengths. The chemical sensing capability of such metamaterials will be
investigated given theoretical indications of enhanced sensitivity and
selectivity afforded by the mechanically tuning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impact of this research includes interdisciplinary education and
training of undergraduate and graduate students, fostering development at the
boundaries of research disciplines where exciting scientific and technological
advances occur. Further, this project will serve as an excellent vehicle to
recruit and women and minority scientists, and lead to the development of
contemporary courses spanning from biology to physics, photonics, and
engineering.
