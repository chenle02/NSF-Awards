A philosopher specializing in biomedical ethics and a biologist who directs a
research laboratory in which research on diabetes is undertaken will study moral
problems in the use of animals in scientific research which (a) targets
widespread, debilitating diseases, (b) has a record of contributing to the
understanding and management of the disease, and (c) operates according to
professionally accepted humane standards. Much of the research on diabetes
mellitus satisfies these conditions. Through a survey of current diabetological
literature, the investigators will determine the patterns of usage of animal
models in this research, and relate this to the outstanding questions
investigators are currently pursuing. Using techniques of ethical analysis, they
will attempt to identify the moral issues suggested by this use of animals and
outline different strategies for responding to these questions -- from abolition
of the research, through various proposals for replacement, reduction, and
refinement of animal use, to intensification of current efforts. They will
display the implications of these strategies and assess which courses of action
are the most defensible. Preliminary results will be sent for comment to outside
experts and consultants. Project results will include presentations, papers and
a monograph, and will be made available to a wide audience of interested persons
and organizations. This project should make a timely, scholarly contribution to
the professional and public discussion of issues surrounding uses of animals in
research. The investigators are very well-qualified; institutional support is
very good and costs, very reasonable. This is a good example of the kind of
cross-disciplinary research EVS should encourage. Total support in the amount of
$35,939 is recommended. Of that amount, half comes from the National Institutes
of Health and is to be awarded this year. The remainder will be awarded next
fiscal year.
