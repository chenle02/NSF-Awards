The project is to study the full-scale vibration and aerodynamic behavior of the
new Houston Baytown Bridge during various critical stages of construction and
after completion of the full structure. The work includes a series of ambient
vibration surveys, a comprehensive ambient survey after completion, and a two-
year permanent installation to assess the performance of the bridge through high
wind storms. A plan will be developed for a permanent monitoring and diagnostic
system to be used by the Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation.
The data gathered will be used to validate models to predict the behavior of
long bridges under high wind load conditions. This knowledge will greatly
benefit the wind engineering community.
