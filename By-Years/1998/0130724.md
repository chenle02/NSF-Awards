EIA-0130724 &lt;br/&gt;Philip McKinley&lt;br/&gt;Michigan State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CISE Research Resources: A Proxy-Centric Testbed
for Mobile Internet Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Computer
Science and Engineering at Michigan State University will construct a state-of-
the-art testbed for research in protocols and services surrounding the mobile
Internet. The testbed will comprise four major components: (1) a high-
performance parallel proxy cluster interconnected by a gigabit Ethernet switch;
(2) new generation 802.11a wireless network components with bit rates up to 54
Mbps; (3) a wireless network analyzer that enables detailed inspection and
analysis of conditions and behavior of the wireless network; and (4) a set of
mobile hosts for collecting experimental data. The primary mission of the
testbed is to support three research projects related to mobile Internet
environments: design of new network protocols to improve the observed
performance of wireless channels in transporting multimedia data; study of
adaptive middleware services to support collaboration among heterogeneous mobile
hosts; and the use of formal analysis techniques to support automated
development and testing of interactive distributed applications.&lt;br/&gt;
