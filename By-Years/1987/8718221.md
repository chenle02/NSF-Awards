Large ice particles play a central role in the physics of clouds and
precipitation, especially in deep convective clouds. Two processes are important
for the formation of large ice particles, namely, the clumping and riming
processes. The clumping processes produces snow aggregates which may serve as
the embryos of graupel and hails. The graupel and hails then grow by riming and
recycling through dry and wet growth stages. In the riming process, latent heat
will be released which may influence the cloud dynamics. The impacts of these
processes depend very much on the ice particle growth rates. Unfortunately, our
previous understanding of the ice growth process is mostly qualitative. The main
difficulty lies in the facts that ice particles have complicated shapes and thus
complicated hudrodynamical behavior and that the motions are unsteady. Under
this grant, Professor Wang will use the cloud tunnel at the University of
California, Los Angles to conduct experiments of ice crystal aggregation, and
also carry out theoretical computations of ice crystal motion in air. Professor
Wang is competent and well qualified to carry out the work.
