With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Southern California
will acquire a Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization - Time of Flight
(MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometer. This instrument will be used in a wide variety of
research projects, including studies on a) the structure-function relationships
in small molecule therapeutics; b) synthesis of novel macromolecules for light-
harvesting and information technology applications; c) synthesis of macrocyclic
and block copolymers; d) polymer electrolytes for rechargeable lithium ion
batteries; d) structure, dynamics, and functions of packaging RNA; and e)
analysis of silicon-based monomers and polymers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matrix-
assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass
spectrometry is the technique of choice for obtaining accurate molecular weights
on molecules up to and over 300,000 daltons, with extremely high sensitivity.
Use of a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer has therefore become a standard technique,
especially in studies involving biomolecules. This research will have a
significant impact in a number of areas, especially polymer studies and
medicinal chemistry&lt;br/&gt;
