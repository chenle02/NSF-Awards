The problems of 3D shape representation, analysis, manipulation,&lt;br/&gt;and
estimation from unstructured sensor data are central not only&lt;br/&gt;to
computer vision, but are also of key significance to
geometric&lt;br/&gt;modeling, computer graphics, computational geometry, medical
imaging,&lt;br/&gt;surveillance, among others. The goal of this proposal is to
investigate&lt;br/&gt;approaches to these problems in the context of tackling
certain&lt;br/&gt;key problems in archaeology. This area of application
offers&lt;br/&gt;the following three distinct advantages: (i) it is a rich
source&lt;br/&gt;of free-form shapes, e.g., pottery sherds, marble plates and
reliefs,&lt;br/&gt;sculpture, column capitals, building facades, etc., which
are&lt;br/&gt;easily accessible, in contrast to 3D free-form shapes
obtained&lt;br/&gt;from medical images which require expert segmentation; this
data&lt;br/&gt;is also richer and more variable than data available in a
typical&lt;br/&gt;manufacturing environ-ment; (ii) the problems are of a
generic&lt;br/&gt;nature and the proposed approaches can be applied to a
variety&lt;br/&gt;of other domains; (iii) this application area forms a key
bridge&lt;br/&gt;between the Physical Sciences and the Humanities.
