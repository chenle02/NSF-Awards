This research is a continuation and extension of an existing project on the
study of dynamics of tropical intraseasonal oscillation. The objective of the
study is to enhance physical understanding of the complex behavior of
intraseasonal disturbances in spatially varying mean tropical circulations,
their interactions with the oceanic mixed layer and their roles in ENSO (El
Nino-southern Oscillation) evolution. Three research thrusts are proposed: a)
Effects of mean tropical circulation on dynamics of the intraseasonal
disturbances; b) Intraseasonal variations of air-sea interface variables and
oceanic influence on atmospheric intraseasonal disturbances; c) Response of
ocean to intraseasonal variation of surface winds and the links between
intraseasonal and interannual variations. The PI will adopt a combination of
theoretical and empirical analysis. A free atmosphere-boundary layer coupled
model developed in the existing project will be extended to include basic flow
and coupling with an ocean mixed layer model, forming a dynamics framework for
theoretical analysis. Interim COADS ship reports (1980-1987) generated by global
data assimilation systems of th European Center for Medium Range Weather
Froecasts (ECMWF), and sea-level data collected at the TOGA Sea Level Center
(1975-1987) will be used for diagnostic studies. This research is important
because it attempts to increase the level of understanding of climate processes
that influence climate variability around the world.
