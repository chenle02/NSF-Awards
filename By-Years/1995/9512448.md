9512448 Mataric The proposed project is to establish and support a new
laboratory for adaptive behavior which will be equipped with mobile robots; and
the computational, electronic, and mechanical equipment. The laboratory supports
interdisciplinary research involving engineering and cognitive science in
behavior and learning on autonomous agents. Studies to be carried in areas of
directed and emergent programming, reinforcement learning, neural network
learning, and evolutionary and genetic programming approaches. A set of related
research projects in multi-agent and multi-robot will be initiated for dealing
with a variety of agents, environments, and tasks; for selecting control
strategies; and for simplifying the task of designing complex multi-agent
systems. The laboratory will also be used for student projects in advanced
computer science courses. ***
