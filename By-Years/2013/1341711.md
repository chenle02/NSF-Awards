This award is to fund a transformational data intensive resource for the open
science community called Wrangler. Big data is creating tremendous new
scientific opportunities, but also many new challenges for data-driven science.
The computational needs of large-scale data-driven science vary across domains
and applications but there are some requirements that are widely applicable:
capacious, high performance, reliable data storage; support for diverse data
types and access methods; and support for embedded analytics that eliminate
costly data movement. Wrangler is a high performance system with an innovative
embedded data analytics capability that far exceeds the capabilities available
to the open science community today. It contains massive data storage, which can
be expanded if required, high performance, and support for both structured and
unstructured data. The storage is configured for ultra-high reliability using
replication at two locations, unprecedented analytics capabilities and
innovative NAND flash storage. The resource contains 3000 next generation Intel
Haswell cores, offering the most powerful embedded analytics capabilities in the
world for a wide range of data intensive science. Wrangler will be connected at
100 Gbps to Internet2, the fastest available connection to the biggest research
network. The project will also offer a data docking service for receiving and
ingesting data shipped on physical media. Augmented by Stampede &amp; XSEDE,
Wranglers capabilities will be enhanced through tight integration to TACC?s
Stampede supercomputer, and through TACC to other XSEDE resources.
