This award supports the 43rd Northeast Bioengineering Conference, a regional
conference that provides an opportunity to undergraduate and graduate student
researchers in the field of biomedical engineering to present their research to
a broad audience. The conference has particular impact because it allows
students who do not have the funding to attend a national scientific meeting to
present their work to fellow students, regional faculty, and representatives
from industry. The conference will be held on March 31 - April 2, 2017, at the
New Jersey Institute of Technology. The theme of the conference is "New
Biomedical Frontiers for the 21st Century." The award primarily supports a
reduction in student registration fees for all attendees, allowing the
conference to be even more affordable. The ability to participate in conferences
such as this encourages students to pursue graduate school and pursue an
academic career.

The conference expects to attract 400 to 500 attendees from around the Northeast
region of the United States, with 60 - 75% expected to be students. Over 60% of
the platform presentations will be given by trainees, in addition to 150 poster
presentations. In addition to scientific presentations, sessions on career
development in biomedical engineering will be included to specifically support
professional development of the trainees. Key Note and Plenary speakers will be
used to highlight cutting edge areas of research in both academia and industry.
Themes of the presentations will include: Regenerative Medicine & Stem Cell
Engineering; Biomaterials; Neural Engineering & Rehabilitation; Bio-MEMS and
Biomedical Devices, Biomedical Imaging, Tissue Engineering & 3D Bioprinting;
Nanomedicines; and Biomechanics.
