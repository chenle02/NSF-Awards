Geology (42)&lt;br/&gt;Computer simulation is an ideal tool for understanding
the complex effects of a variety of physical and geological processes that
interact to influence landform evolution over extended periods of time
(centuries, thousands of years, millions of years). Yet simulation models and
the visualization of their results usually require specialized software that is
not easily accessible to undergraduate education. This proof-of-
concept&lt;br/&gt;project is developing a web-based interactive landform
simulation model that can be accessed anytime and anywhere via a standard web
browser to improve undergraduate students' learning experience of landform
evolution. This web-based interactive model is employing a cellular automata
algorithm and is implemented using Java technology, which is designed to run on
different computer hardware and operating systems. Students are able to interact
with the model by selecting and manipulating different parameters (such as
precipitation intensity, degree of surface runoff, rock erodibility, tectonic
movement, etc.) through a Graphical User Interface and observe how different
combinations of processes (parameters) influence the landform evolution. This
project integrates the latest technology into undergraduate education to improve
both teaching and learning. Because of its global potential in web based
dissemination, it has the ability to reach a wide and diverse audience,
including underrepresented populations in Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and
Technology, non-traditional students, and students with learning disabilities.
In addition, it enables the investigators themselves to refine their own skills
in the new and promising area of 3D&lt;br/&gt;visualization on the web, which is
beneficial to their own teaching and research.
