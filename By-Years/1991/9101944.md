This is a travel award for exploratory visits to three institutions to visit
faculty and examine facilities. These visits are to identify the best match of
interests and appropriateness of laboratory facilities and library holdings in
preparation for a postdoctoral study program. Initial contacts have been made
with faculty at each of the scheduled institutions, who have expressed an
interest in serving as postdoctoral mentor. This travel award will enable the
investigator to meet with other members of the various appropriate departments
and make a choice of the program best suited to his goals. Initial discussions
of possible arrangements for a postdoctoral appointment will also be held.
