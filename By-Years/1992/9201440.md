This U.S.-Czechoslovakia research project in materials science is between Dr.
Terence J. Langdon of the University of Southern California and Dr. V. Sklenicka
of Institute of Physical Metallurgy, Brno, Czechoslovakia. Creep deformation at
high temperatures is an important problem in many industrial applications and
the problem is compounded in those materials, such as copper-based alloys, which
are prone to the development of extensive internal cavitation and ultimately to
cavitation failure. The researchers will employ their laboratories' extensive
experience in the areas of high temperature creep and cavitation failure. They
will conduct high temperature creep tests on selected copper-based alloys with
the long-term objective of obtaining a more complete understanding of the
deformation mechanisms and the role of grain boundary sliding in the development
of internal cavities. This project in materials science fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
