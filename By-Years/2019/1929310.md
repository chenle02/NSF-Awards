This project will support participants to attend the International Glaciological
Society symposium on Five Decades of Radioglaciology to be held at Stanford
University in July 2019. Radio-echo sounding is a powerful geophysical technique
for directly characterizing the subsurface conditions of Earth's and planetary
ice masses. Over the last five decades, a wide array of orbital, airborne,
towed, and in situ instruments, platforms, and data analysis approaches for
radar sounding have arisen. Continuing the development of radio-sounding
techniques and instruments is paramount to understanding of subsurface
conditions and processes that influence Earth's continental ice sheets and other
planetary bodies and icy moons. The participant support will focus on early
career scientists, particularly participants from groups that are
underrepresented in STEM and polar science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the
symposium is to bring together terrestrial and planetary radar scientists,
glaciologists, geophysicists, and ice-sheet modelers to discuss advances in (i)
radar sounding systems, (ii) mission concepts, (iii) signal processing, (iv)
data analysis, (v) modeling, and (vi) scientific interpretation. The symposium
seeks to attract radioglaciology experts working in ice-sheet, ice-shelf,
mountain glacier, and planetary environments, as well as modelers and other
geophysicists who are looking to apply and utilize radio-sounding in their field
of study. The symposium will run over five days, with additional short courses
to develop related skills and awareness of methods and
tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
