This award will provide partial support for one year for a graduate student in
mathematical logic who will do thesis research under the joint direction of Anil
Nerode (Professor, Department of Mathematics, and Director, Mathematical
Sciences Institute) and Juris Hartmanis (Professor, Department of Computer
Science). The research uses methods of mathematical logic to study the
complexity of parallel computation. Parallel computation is perhaps the most
promising route to vast increases in computational speed, but it is notoriously
difficult to analyse compared with the traditional serial computation that most
existing computers do.
