9424028 Whitney The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral Fellows
Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four
months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month
postdoctoral research visit by Dr. James Andrew Whitney to work with Professor
Thomas Erhard Kreis at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. One of the
defining features of eukaryotic cells is the system of membrane-enclosed
organelles through which newly synthesized secretory proteins pass on their way
to the cell surface. The transfer of membrane and secretory proteins between
these organelles typically involves the formation of distinct populations of
transport vesicles. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of these transport
events has become one of the most important problems in molecular cell biology.
The primary goal of the work proposed here is to learn more about the molecular
mechanisms involved in the selective budding of vesicles in the secretory
pathway. In particular, the PI will use relatively new in vivo imaging
techniques to follow the dynamic distribution of cytosolic proteins thought to
play a role in this process. ***
