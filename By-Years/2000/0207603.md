SGER- Mining the Deep Web for Economic Data

This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will support exploration of "the deep
web;" that is, data which is held in web-accessible databases, but which is
generally not available via the use of standard web-crawlers. Data held in web
databases may be several hundred times larger than the web we routinely access,
and which is held in html and other tagged text files. The domain to be explored
is economic information, to see whether these new data can help in economic
forecasting.
