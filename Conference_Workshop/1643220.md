This award provides support for the 2016 Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics
Symposium that will take place at Rice University in Houston, Texas on October
21-23, 2016. The Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics Symposium is a regional
weekend meeting held annually, hosted in turn by Rice University, the University
of Texas at Austin, and occasionally other institutions in the region. It is
intended for the participation of around 60 people, including 25 non-local
graduate students. The workshop brings together many senior mathematicians from
Texas and neighboring states, who may not otherwise have an opportunity to
discuss mathematics together throughout the year. Structurally the symposium
consists of 7 main lectures given by nationally recognized leaders in the field,
and contributed sessions (including a poster session) for advanced graduate
students and participating researchers from regional universities, to present
their work. This will provide graduate students with an opportunity to obtain
feedback from senior faculty from other departments. The networking activities
made possible by the Symposium will prove to be a valuable experience for young
researchers. The Symposium encourages and financially supports participation by
students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in
mathematics. The Symposium is a forum for regional specialists in mathematical
physics and related areas of analysis to become familiar with the latest
problems and present their own results; in addition it introduces young
mathematicians to the current state of the subject.

This year's Symposium will focus on the areas where harmonic analysis, dynamical
systems theory, spectral theory, and partial differential equations intersect
and interact. More information, including a list of speakers and abstracts,
registration information, and an archive of the past symposium can be found at
the website of the meeting:
