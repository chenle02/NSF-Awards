Project goals, scope and methods: Research will involve a fine-scale
geographic/genealogical study of three widely co-distributed groups of New
Zealand cicadas using mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Analyses of these
molecular data, in combination with courtship song and morphological
differences, will improve understanding of how genetic differences among
geographically isolated populations may eventually lead to
speciation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide a more complete picture
of New Zealand cicada biodiversity. While mitochondrial gene techniques are well
developed, those for nuclear genes lag behind. However, in the last few years,
the availability of complete nuclear genome sequences for a variety of animals
has revealed a large number of candidate genes that can be used for studying
closely related taxa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader significance: The longer-
term goals of the project are to explore a broad range of important biological
questions relating to: the origin, evolution, and spread of biological
diversity; the evolution of life histories; the estimation of times of
divergence in evolutionary trees; and application to genealogical tree-building.
Trainees--including undergraduates, graduate and postdoctoral students--learn
skills essential in population biology, e.g., specimen collection; database
construction; collection and analysis of genetic and behavioral data; and
written, oral, and web-based data dissemination. &lt;br/&gt;
