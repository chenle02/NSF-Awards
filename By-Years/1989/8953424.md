The American Association of Museums will conduct during 1989 and 1990 a
comprehensive survey and data collection program on the status of American
museums, establishing a baseline of data that will allow future comparisons on a
consistent basis. Nearly every aspect of museums' organization, finances, and
activities will be examined by this survey, guided by peer advice from each of
the museum types, a national Steering Committee, and by consultants with
substantials survey experience. The final products will include a public
database, a summary report and accompanying technical reports, and a press
release on the findings. The survey will encompass the universe of American
museums, including a wide variety of science and technology related institutions
and will complement the NSF-funded AS-TC science technology center survey of
1987-8. Independent scholars will be asked to carry out secondary analyses of
the data, and in future years the survey will be updated with examinations of
specific topics for further investigation. NSF support will amount to less than
10% of the total cost.
