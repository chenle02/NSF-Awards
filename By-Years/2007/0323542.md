&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This is an interdisciplinary project of theoretical
research on design of quantum and biomolecular information processing systems.
Specifically, the rate at which increases in the size/complexity of an
information processing system can lead to improvements in robustness against
environmental perturbations and systematic implementation errors are being
investigated, starting with utilization of model reduction methods from control
theory to develop general methods for scrutinizing the robustness of large but
finite quantum and biomolecular systems and proceeding to detailed analyses of
the efficiency of various known error-correction schemes. The overall goal is to
be able to elucidate fundamental limits on the degree of redundancy required to
achieve a given level of robustness. An integral part of this research is
development of a new course on multi-scale design of information processing
systems.&lt;br/&gt;
