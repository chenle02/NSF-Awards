This project focuses on the analysis of vehicle control in horizontal material
handling systems where the vehicle capacity is more than one unit load. The
primary concentration of this work is to extend vehicle routing and scheduling
models to the vehicle control problem for multiload carriers in material
handling. Two models have initially been identified as most closely resembling
the problem described: the dynamic dial-a-ride model and the fixed routes model.
Appropriate mathematical models will be formulated for analyzing the problem and
solution methodologies will be developed based on these models. It is
anticipated that heuristic procedures will be required due to the complexity of
the vehicle routing problem. Such procedures will capture the objective criteria
and the constraints observed in the mathematical models. Performance evaluations
for the methodologies will include quantitative bounds on the objective
function, empirical evaluations using benchmark data, and simulation analysis.
