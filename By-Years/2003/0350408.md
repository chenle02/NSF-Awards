In the last two decades, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been addressed
using a pattern matching paradigm with a top-down characterization of acoustic,
pronunciation, and language models as an integrated finite state network.
Although there have been significant advances over the years, the progress has
begun to slow recently; however, the current state-of-the-state has yet to rival
human speech recognition capability. This is mainly due to: (1) the inability to
obtain a complete specification of all the knowledge sources needed to solve the
ASR problem in a top-down manner, and (2) the ASR robustness problem.

This project is developing and evaluating an auditory perception approach to ASR
that is both knowledge-based and data-driven. By decomposing the ASR problem
into detection of acoustic and phonetic landmarks in the speech signal followed
by a sequence of spectral and temporal knowledge integration stages, the
proposed approach mimics the human auditory perception process while retaining
many of the key features in stochastic modeling of speech and language that have
contributed to the success of the currently prevailing pattern matching
approaches. The project is investigating the feasibility of feature detection
and knowledge integration algorithms that are foundational to the approach and
is creating a plug-and-play platform to facilitate cooperation between broad
speech science and speech processing communities.

This research should facilitate a better understanding of the link between
auditory perception and ASR, provide educational opportunities to students and
researchers to better understand speech fundamentals, challenge the signal
processing community to develop new speech feature detection algorithms, and
pave the way for a common software and evaluation platform to facilitate
collaborative ASR research.
