The Northeast Ethics Education Partnership (NEEP) program, managed by Brown
University's Center for Environmental Studies, provides training to graduate
students in research ethics, cultural relativity, and community-based
approaches. NEEP offers this training through semester-long courses and
student/faculty mentoring, as well as through an extensive training database of
slide presentations on 30 topics in research ethics, cultural competence and
community-based research. Through this award, the project team is expanding NEEP
training from its current partnership (Brown University and SUNY-ESF) to include
Northeastern University and UMASS-Dartmouth. One goal of this expansion is to
conduct short/long courses with their engineering schools, and environmental
studies and marine science departments. National dissemination of the NEEP
website training materials is being promoted and a research survey to identify
research ethical/cultural relativity issues of concern in environmental field
research is being conducted with environmental studies researchers,
environmental anthropologists/sociologists and engineers. Ethics training is
being provided to a diverse community of minority and underserved students and
women scientists through the large, racially-diverse populations being served by
UMASS and Northeastern University programs.
