TITLE: Student Travel to the AAAI Robot Competition and Exhibition

This award provides support for fifteen students, with special efforts made to
incorporate women and underrepresented minorities, to attend and participate in
the AAAI Robot Competition and Exhibition at the National Conference on
Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-2002) in Edmonton, Alberta. This event brings
together robotics researchers from colleges, universities and research
laboratories to compete and to demonstrate cutting edge, state of the art
research in this area. Students attending benefit from observing demonstrations
of the research, networking with students from other institutions with similar
interests, presenting and discussing their own research, and through a
significant mentoring program. Every supported student will be expected to write
a one or two page report on her or his experiences at the competition and
exhibition. These reports will be used in evaluating the success of the funded
student participation in the event.
