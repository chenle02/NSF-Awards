Advances in the theory of representation of physical objects will be
complemented by development of a general physical simulation system, and by
laboratory experimentation. The research will include investigation into means
to link together separate, dynamically interacting modeling systems including
abstract, geometric, and dynamic modelers. The simulation system will be used in
a number of applications, including designing high-level language constructs and
automating robot planning. Specific investigations include high-level
specification methods for physical objects and tasks (including such
manipulation of non- rigid objects as knot-tying); simulating, with dynamics,
the behavior of physical systems; and laboratory experiments to understand and
verify ideas in gripping and mating strategies, compliant motions, and other
operations in physical systems.
