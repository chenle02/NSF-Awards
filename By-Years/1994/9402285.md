9402285 Jasiuk This research is to study the local fields and effective
properties of composite materials. In particular, building on some recent
efforts in other problems, the possibility of reducing the number of independent
variables will be evaluated. Various interfacial conditions will be considered.
The resulted of this study will apply to any heterogeneous material and
therefore contribute to a more fundamental understanding in materials science.
