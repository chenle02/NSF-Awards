This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program supports instrument
development at to Arizona State University. The instrument is a solid-immersion
lens (SIL) microscope for optical spectroscopy with a spatial resolution of at
least 200 nm. The SIL microscope will feature an autofocus system and active
control of the SIL-sample separation. These innovations will make optical
spectroscopy with nm-scale spatial resolution routinely practicable. The
proposed applications will emphasize Raman and fluorescence imaging. SIL-based
micro- Raman spectroscopy offers a spatial resolution comparable or better than
Near Field Scanning Optical Microscopy. The signal strength for SIL-based
spectroscopy increases as the spatial resolution is improved. Furthermore, the
SIL microscope makes it possible to collect spectroscopic images directly on a
detector by using a global illumination technique. Initial areas of application
include carbon nano-tubes, Ge and SiGe quantum dots on silicon, and the optical
properties of photosynthetic membranes. The instrument will be build by graduate
students who will gain valuable experience in instrument
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Major Research
Instrumentation program supports a project to design and build a Solid Immersion
Lens (SIL)microscope for spectroscopic imaging with a spatial resolution of at
least 200 nm. There is a critical need for such an instrument because the
wavelength of light can be measured with unmatched precision, so that optical
spectroscopy is one of the preferred techniques for the study of materials.
However, diffraction effects pose a fundamental limit to the spatial resolution
of any optical technique, and for conventional instruments this means that it is
generally impossible to obtain spatially resolved spectroscopic information from
nanoscale objects.&lt;br/&gt;An alternative technique to overcome the
diffraction limit is the use of optical fibers with nanometer-size apertures.
The SIL-microscope will have two fundamental advantages over this approach a
much higher light-throughput and the ability to record spectroscopic images
without physically scanning a fiber tip over a sample. The instrument will be
build by graduate students who will gain valuable experience in instrument
development.&lt;br/&gt;
