The Joint Oceanographic Institutions, Inc., will provide support for a broad
range of Federal interagency scientific planning activities in oceanography and
closely related research and technology. A major focus will be to assist in
improving interaction between in situ research and satellite remote sensing in
programs such as the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), the Joint Global
Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS), and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Program (GLOBEC).
Workshops will be conducted on specialized topics of interest to these programs,
such as ocean surface layer salinity and the feasibility of its measurement by
satellite. Similarly, support will be provided for development of more effective
international coordination of the above- referenced and other U.S. global
geoscience research programs with analogous efforts in other countries.
