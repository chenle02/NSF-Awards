This project will continue an REU site, involving eight undergraduate students
per year in a summer internship program. Students will study space plasma
physics, optics and materials science. Students will construct and observe the
optical characteristics of space instrumentation, as well as the resulting
scientific return from spacecraft and ground-based instruments studying the
Earth, Sun, interplanetary space, and distant astronomical objects. Students
will meet weekly with their advising faculty to discuss progress, and give a
formal presentation of their results at the end of the summer, as well as a
written research report.
