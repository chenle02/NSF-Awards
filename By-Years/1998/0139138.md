This award provides funding to the University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB)
to establish the Internships in Nanosystems Science, Engineering and Technology
(INSET) REU site program, to be hosted by the California NanoSystems Institute
(CNSI). The project will be under the direction of Dr. Evelyn Hu. The INSET
program will involve a minimum of eight undergraduate students from California
community colleges in a program that includes the following three research
components: eight-week summer internships at the UCSB; school-year internships
for UCSB students who previously attended community colleges; and off-site
research internships at UCLA and industry for students in the summer following
an initial UCSB summer or school-year internship.
