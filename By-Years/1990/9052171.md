The psychology department is establishing a computer-based laboratory to allow
all students of psychology, beginning with the introductory course, to design
and conduct laboratory experiments and research. The department emphasizes the
scientific study of behavior throughout the curriculum and offers well developed
opportunities for research and laboratory work in advanced courses. The aim of
the project is to increase students' understanding of and knowledge about the
research process. The new laboratory consists of computer-based work stations
with color monitors, networked together and programmed using Micro Experimental
Laboratory developmental software. The laboratory allows a class to develop a
hypothesis, design an experiment, collect and analyze data, and discuss results,
sometimes within a single laboratory period. This gives students a tool which
will enable them to actually ask questions and answer them using the methods of
scientists, rather than just studying about or replicating research of others.
The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
