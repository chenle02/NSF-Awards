9709141 Deitz This project will allow the expansion of the regionally important
North Carolina State University (NCSU) insect collection significantly, allowing
for better curation and scientific access. It will provide space for the
collection to incorporate an important collection of Collembola, which are not
common in insect collections. It also provides for the incorporation of a
Coleoptera collection that is currently housed in substandard materials. Both of
these collections are at present difficult of access and endangered by their
mode of storage. This award will provide archival-quality storage for the
specimens, permit the integration of the collections into existing holdings, and
facilitate scientific study of the specimens. This award, though small,
represents a strong partnership between the awardee institution and the NSF,
because NCSU has provided additional space for the collection and 10% of the
purchase price of the equipment needed for the project.
