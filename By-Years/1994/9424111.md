9424211 Leonard This is an award to support research on the potential use of
remote fiber spectroscopy in a system to detect the presence and nature of
organic contaminants in water. This research is based on prior work that led to
development of a novel optrode that utilized a fluorescent indicator to detect
and monitor pure polar organic substances in water solution. The research to be
conducted involves a technique in which light of an appropriate wave length is
launched through an optical fiber to a remote sample. The return signal from the
sample is changed by the sample's chemical properties to reveal either the exact
nature of the chemical or the chemical group to which it belongs. Detection of
the presence and concentrations of organic substances that leak into aquifers is
an important step in remediation of soils and aquifers contaminated by hazardous
substances. Results of this research are expected to be an important link in
overall remote sensing research partly because it will focus on practical
aspects such as ruggedness, optrode lifetime and low concentration studies.
Future instrumentation based on this consist has the potential of greatly
reducing safety hazards, person hours and produce real-time chemical data on
environmental quality of contaminated environmental resources. ***
