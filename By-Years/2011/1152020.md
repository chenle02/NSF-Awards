In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor D. Tyler McQuade of the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry at Florida State University will develop new synthetic methods by
creating (1) stereoconvergent allylic substitutions, providing the same
stereoisomer for both cis and trans substrates; (2) catalyst-controlled
reactivity where neighboring stereocenters have limited impact on
diastereoselectivity; and (3) regiocontrolled catalytic hydroborations. As rare
metals such as rhodium and iridium become more expensive, it is critically
important to increase the range of reactions that can be performed by
inexpensive metals such as copper. The resulting methods could be more efficient
and selective than prior reactions and could enable new strategies to construct
valuable complex molecules from less expensive metals, providing the basic
science necessary to improve sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
work is predicted to result in not only a more thorough understanding of
catalysts that provide greater chemical control but also the creation of
promising new synthetic methods. The successful results of this work will
positively impact the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and specialty chemical
industries. In addition, this project will provide excellent training of
students, from undergraduate to post-doctoral, including those from groups
historically underrepresented in the sciences. These students will become the
vanguard, leading the way into a future of more environmentally-friendly and
internationally-competitive organic chemistry.
