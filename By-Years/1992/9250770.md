This project will provide a computer laboratory facility to: 1) improve
instruction in Computer Graphics, Assembly Language and Machine Architecture,
Advanced Programming Techniques, and C Programming courses; and 2) provide an
environment for experimentation and innovation in software development
internships/projects involving multimedia storage and presentation techniques.
The equipment provided includes 80386 CPU color graphics workstations and 80486
CPU multimedia development and presentation workstations. Multimedia
capabilities will include laserdisc, VCR, scanner, and TV tuner input. All
workstations will be networked via an existing campus ethernet. The improved
facility will enable improved instruction in interactive graphics windows and
animation, multimedia interfacing, and database storage and retrieval of
multimedia-based information. Internship software development projects will
provide a customized software library for technology instruction. The project
will be modeled for other two-year college programs through the Research Council
of the SUNY Colleges of Technology.
