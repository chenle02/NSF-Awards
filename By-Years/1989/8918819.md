This award will support Professor Lawrence Gilbert of the University of Texas at
Austin in a research collaboration with Professor Mauricio Linares of the
Fundacion Segunda Expedicion Botanica in Bogota, Colombia. The researchers
intend to study the evolutionary consequences of human impact on tropical
forests. In a previous study it was shown that the frequency of polymorphic
forms in a particular butterfly population changed dramatically during the past
century. It was hypothesized that these changes were caused by human
perturbation. In the proposed work, the investigators will gather additional
evidence about the nature of the recent evolutionary changes in the same system,
and the selection pressures that have been responsible for these changes. The
results will generate hypotheses about the nature of current natural selection
on morph frequency. Such secondary hypotheses will be tested by comparing the
distributions of phenotypes in the wild with their distributions among the
offspring of wild- caught butterflies from disturbed and undisturbed habitats.
