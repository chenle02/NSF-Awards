This project provides instrumentation needed to demonstrate in the laboratory
major topics covered in the ocean engineering classroom. The instruments are
capable of good quality data, but are sensible for undergraduate use and provide
a means for students to gain a wider knowledge of the marine environment. The
equipment consists of a trailer and 22' aluminum boat with sonar, radar, ocean
profiler, sediment corer, winch, communications, and navigational aids of
several sorts tied into a laptop computer all trailerable by any 3000 lb. rated
pickup. The package is used by all students, whether entering freshmen, or
seniors with ocean-oriented senior projects preparing to graduate.
