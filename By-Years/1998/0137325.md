The PIs will measure Uranium series isotopes (230Th/238U, 226Ra/230Th,
231Pa/235U) in order to place constraints on the eruption ages of axial and off-
axis lava flows in the 9-10N area of the East Pacific Rise (EPR), which has been
well mapped and intensively studied with Alvin for the last decade. These
U-series dates, together with new data on Sr, Nd, Pb, and Hf isotopes will be
used to evaluate the petrogenesis of the samples and to evaluate the extent of
near off-axis vs. axial additions to the ocean crust in this area, which seismic
studies indicate should be an important process (off0axis thickening of lawer
2A). The samples will be "selected" by a "randomizing" process in order to
determine theproportion of the crust that is added off-axis.
