This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2001. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Modeling Muscle
Force Generation during Posture and Locomotion." This project involves
developing models of muscle force generation. The hypothesis being tested is
that, during functional conditions, whole muscle models can be constructed by
summing responses of constituent motor units. Specific aims are to test this
hypothesis experimentally and to use nonlinear system identification to generate
a database of single motor unit models.
