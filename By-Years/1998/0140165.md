ABSTRACT

The proposed research deals with the studies of finite- and infinite-
dimensional dynamical systems as well as of some hybrid (intermediate between
dynamical and stochastic) systems. The class of hybrid systems which will be
specifically addressed is formed by deterministic walks in random environments.
It has been shownrecently that a large subclass of such systems (walks in rigid
environments) is completely solvable in 1D. The proposed study deals with the
case of environments with variable rigidity. Another part of the proposal deals
with the farther development of recently constructed first natural examples of
Hamiltonian systems with divided phase space. The goal now is to show that a
rather general class of such billiards has positive metric entropy in any
(finite) dimension. The considered problems of statistical mechanics deal with
the rigorous derivation of formulas for kinetic coefficients and for escape rate
in open systems. Among the problems which deal with infinite-dymensional systems
are chaos-order transitions in Lattice Dynamical Systems and chaos in nonlinear
wave equations. Other problems deal with various systems ranging from the
Ergodic Theory (Benford's law) to some simple models of brain dynamics and
logistics.

Traditionally the mathematical models of real systems are either purely
deterministic or purely stochastic. These two classes of models enjoy having a
rich theory, and researchers have quite good intuition on their behavior, i.e.
they basically know what to expect. This intuition is essentially based on a
rich collection of completely solvable (i.e. completely understood) models.
However, a majority of real systems are neither purely deterministic nor purely
stochastic. Instead they have both (deterministic and stochastic) features. This
project deals with a big class of such models which were independently
introduced in communication theory, statistical physics,chemical kinetics,
theory of artificiall intellect, etc.
