A person, without benefit of seeing, can come to know about certain properties
of objects by wielding and shaking them. Similarly, he or she can come to know
about certain properties of unseen surfaces by striking them with a hand-held
implement. These instances of knowing about the surrounding environment through
the use of the body, known as haptic perception, are based on mechanical forces
that distort the body's tissues in complex ways. Presumably, for each perceived
environmental property, there is a specific mechanical property. Identifying
these mechanical properties, and understanding exactly how people use them to
measure spatial characteristics of the adjacent environment, pose significant
challenges. These experiments will examine how people use the inertia tensor as
the mechanical basis for the haptic perception of the lengths, shapes, and
orientations of unseen objects wielded by hand, and they will examine how people
use the resultant of reactive forces as the mechanical basis for the haptic
perception of the distance between struck surfaces. This research will also
examine patterns of wielding, looking for a relation between the particular way
an object is wielded and the object property the person is attempting to
measure. The participants in the experiments will respond by adjusting visible,
moveable surfaces to quantify the perceived properties. Results could provide
insights valuable in the design of sensory and motor prostheses, robotic limbs,
and "smart" remote-sensing instruments.
