This proposal requests support for improvements to the research vessel R/V
RIDGELY WARFIELD, an NSF-built research vessel, operated by the Johns Hopkins
University, Chesapeake Bay Institute (CBI) and dedicated to use in support of
ocean science research. The construction or conversion activity of the
Oceanographic Centers and Facilities Section provides funds for upgrading the
capabilities of ocean science research vessels through support of ship
construction or conversion. Support is provided for such things as new
deckhouses, improved laboratory spaces, improved power systems, sophisticated
submersible handling equipment, and the lengthening of ships and even new ship
construction. The Project Directors, Dr. James D. Ebert, Director CBI, and Bruce
K. Cornwall, Marine Superintendent, are fully qualified to direct this project
having had considerable experience in overseeing similar activities. This
project will provide funds for a detailed design for the replacement of the
WARFIELD's engines and generators in order to extend the useful life of the ship
as a coastal zone research vessel.
