9307024 Beuchat Hummingbirds subsist almost entirely on a liquid diet composed
of floral nectar, and when energy demands are high they can consume more than
three times their own body mass in fluid per day. At the same time, however, the
hummingbird's high metabolism requires efficient extraction of nutrients and
electrolytes from a dilute food source that is passing rapidly through the
gastrointestinal tract for efficient nutrient extraction, electrolyte
conservation, and rapid elimination of water. For a hummingbird to
simultaneously balance energy, water, and ion fluxes is a major challenge that
raises fundamental questions about hummingbird morphology and physiology. This
study proposes to address a central problem: In what ways and by what mechanisms
do the kidney and gastrointestinal tract of hummingbird contribute to water and
ion homeostasis while at the same time allowing maximum efficiency of energy
acquisition? Using isotopically-labeled markers in artificial nectar, I can
determine the fraction of ingested fluid that is absorbed by the intestine and
the capacity of the kidney to eliminate excess water without depleting the body
of electrolytes. The efficiency of energy and nutrient extraction are determined
under conditions that influence the hummingbird's energy requirements, its
electrolyte balance, and the quality of its diet. Together, these studies will
provide information about the unique adaptations that allow hummingbirds to
specialize on a liquid diet. ***
