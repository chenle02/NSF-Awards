0348109&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need to analyze and design broadband wireless
systems and control electromagnetic interference increases with each passing
year. Though many computational electromagnetics (CEM) techniques already exist
that in principle can tackle such problems, none is efficient and accurate for
large problems involving broad bandwidths and complex geometries. Under this
grant, a new CEM technique called accurate marching by band-limited
extrapolation (AMBLE) will be created for the analysis of modern electromagnetic
devices, scattering problems, and electromagnetic compatibility concerns. Based
on time-domain integral equations (TDIEs), AMBLE will overcome the stability and
accuracy difficulties of past TDIE approaches using a novel combination of
noncausal, band-limited temporal basis functions and band-limited extrapolation
techniques designed to recover causality. AMBLE will be applied to problems
involving moving media, dielectric media, layered media, dispersive media, and
reduced dimensionality, as well as extended to work with the Nystrom method
instead of the typical Galerkin discretization. The resulting engine will form
the basis of a new virtual laboratory to be used in the electromagnetics classes
at the University of Delaware, and for outreach to high school students and the
Girl Scouts of America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
