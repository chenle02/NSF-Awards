The proposed work extends the scope of an interdisciplinary shipboard program to
investigate the environmental factors that regulate the distribution and
production of antarctic algal groups in the Ross Sea, by adding cobalt, cadmium,
and zinc trace metal analyses to the iron component that had been included in a
previously funded project. The additional trace metal analyses will be highly
complementary to the cruise objectives because carbon acquisition by marine
phytoplankton is known to be dependent on carbonic anhydrase, a metalloenzyme
that may be activated by any of these three trace elements.&lt;br/&gt;Studies of
phytoplankton abundances in the Ross Sea region have shown that productivity is
dominated by two major phytoplankton groups: Phaeocystis antarctica and diatoms.
Diatoms tend to dominate in highly stratified waters, while Phaeocystis is
dominant where deeper mixing is observed, implying that Phaeocystis are more
efficient under low light conditions. Phaeocystis populations have been observed
to cause rapid and early export of carbon from the photic zone, leading to the
hypothesis that CO2 drawdown could decrease significantly if climate-induced
upper ocean stratification were to increase. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
