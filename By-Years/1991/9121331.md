Bottlenosed dolphins have a highly efficient echolocation sense, enabling them
to examine their physical world through sound. By emitting short-duration pulsed
sounds and listening to the echoes received, dolphins are able to detect and
identify objects. Because people lack this sense, it is difficult for us to
appreciate the types of mental images or representations of objects that may be
formed through echolocation. Dolphins also possess an efficient visual sense
that is useful both underwater and in air. Are the images or representations
formed through echolocation similar to those formed through vision? Can a
dolphin recognize through echolocation an object it has inspected previously
only through vision? Conversely, can it recognize through vision an object it
has inspected previously only through echolocation? These and related questions
are addressed in a set of experimental studies with dolphins at the Kawalo Basin
Marine Mammal Laboratory of the University of Hawaii. By examining the types or
attributes of objects that may be recognized across the two senses, the
researchers will begin to develop ideas about what a dolphin "sees" with its
echolocation sense. More fundamentally, the research will also provide
information on the theoretical question of the degree to which information from
different senses is integrated centrally--what may be called the issue of the
unity versus the independence of the senses. Some degree of unity is seen in
studies with humans and nonhuman primates of the relationships between vision
and active touch. Does a similar degree of sensory unity occur in the dolphin, a
nonprimate mammal with many demonstrated intellectual capabilities paralleling
those found for nonhuman primates? What might such ability in a dolphin add to
ideas about the convergent evolution of intelligence in cetacean and primate
brains, which have traced different paths for some 20 million years? On an
applied level, might the description of echoic "visualization" by a dolphin
offer fresh insights into the construction of intelligent sonar apparatus?
