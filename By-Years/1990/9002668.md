Partial support is to be provided for a symposium: "Fluid Mechanics of Stirring
and Mixing," and a workshop to immediately precede the symposium: "Transport
Enhancement by Chaotic Advection." The location is the University of California
at San Diego, and the time is August 18 through 24, 1990 for the combined
activity. A selected group of symposium participants is to address special
issues in transport enhancement at the workshop. The symposium is also sponsored
by the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. Focus is to be
on the possibility of designing de-stabilizing configurations and strategies for
the beneficial utilization of chaotic fluid motions for enhanced transport of
heat and mass, extending even to slow viscous flows.
