This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the
National Science Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special
purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects
and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the
National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from
manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting
the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government
cooperation in the support of basic research in the mathematical sciences. This
equipment will be used to support five projects in the Department of Statistics
at Pennsylvania State University: Bootstrap Methods for Relative Risk Ratios and
EIV Models, directed by C. R. Rao and Gutti Jogesh Babu; Latent Classes,
Empirical Bayes, and Random Effects in Models for Categorical Data, directed by
Clifford Clogg and Bruce Lindsay; Statistical Inference Under Patterned
Alternatives Based on the Principle of Isotonic Regression, directed by Thomas
Hettmansperger and Robert Kelly; Rank-Based Inference for Regression with
Censored Data, directed by Michael Akritas and Yvonne Zubovic; and Development
and Applications of Statistical Theory to Problems in Ecology, directed by
Ganapati P. Patil and Marllyn Boswell.
