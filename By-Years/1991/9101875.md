The proposed research concerns the exploration of techniques for reconfiguration
of task modules on distributed-memory machines when faults occur. The problems
include (1) trade offs between local and global reconfiguration; (2)
communications required to support reconfiguration and task computation after
successful recovery; (3) fault-tolerant embedding; (4) analysis of the residual
structure of networks in the presence of faulty nodes, and (5) extensive
simulations of fault patterns and the performance of algorithms developed on a
Paralex 10-dimensional hypercube.
