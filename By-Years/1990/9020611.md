Professor Brill will continue his investigations of theoretical gravitational
physics. He will pursue topics in both classical and quantum gravity, with
studies of effects in various cosmological models playing an important role.
Alternatives to Einstein's theory will be considered, such as Kaluza-Klein
theory with torsion. This will allow the study of new physical effects such as
topological effects in higher dimensions.
