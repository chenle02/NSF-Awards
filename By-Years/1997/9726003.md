&lt;br/&gt;9726003&lt;br/&gt;Peterson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a
study of the seasonal variability and long term change of the upper ocean
structure of the Drake Passage. It consists of high density sections obtained on
each crossing by the U.S. Antarctic Program's research vessel Laurence M. Gould,
using expendable bathythermographs, supplemented by expendable conductivity-
temperature-depth probes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This information will lead to the
establishment of a high quality data base with which to study the magnitude and
depth of penetration of the seasonal signals, connections to atmospheric
forcing, and the effects of interannual variations such as those associated with
the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six sections were obtained
from the R/V Polar Duke between September 1996 and April 1997. The probes are
being supplied by the institution with other funds, and are launched by the
scientific shipboard personnel on each cruise. The continuing data analysis is
carried out in cooperation with the Argentine Antarctic Institute in Buenos
Aires.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
