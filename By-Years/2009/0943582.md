A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V
Wecoma, a 185? general purpose research vessel operated by Oregon State
University as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
(UNOLS) research fleet. The vessel is owned by the National Science Foundation.
In addition, support is requested for the NORCOR (Northwest Consortium for
Oceanographic Research) sediment sampling support facility. The request includes
five items listed by priority:

1) Piston Core Systems 2) Upgrade to a Multi-Sensor Core 3) Split core Track
Modifications 4) New 20-foot Refrigerated Van 5) KELA5701-3.5kHz Transducer

Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use
instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
