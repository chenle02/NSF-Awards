The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project concerns the
rehabilitation of movement deficits due to disease or injury. Commercially, the
project falls within the rehabilitation robot market, specifically the segment
that addresses neurological rehabilitation. Currently, available robotic
rehabilitation technology focuses mainly on the recovery of motor function after
stroke and restricts patient motion to a single plane. This project involves a
robotic device that extends the scope of current rehabilitation robots by a)
allowing unrestricted 3D movement, and b) incorporating somatosensory in
addition to motor training methods. The commercial potential of this I-Corps
project is not restricted to clinics specializing on stroke rehabilitation. The
device can be used on a broad disease spectrum that includes stroke, but can be
extended to patients with Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and traumatic brain
injuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project further develops a robotic
rehabilitation device that seeks to improve wrist/hand function. The robot
comprises a series of motors that can passively move the human wrist/hand, or
assist/resist active human wrist motion. It allows for unrestricted
3-dimensional motion while precisely recording wrist joint motion. The system is
integrated with a visual virtual reality environment that can provide movement
feedback and can serve as an interface for visual-based training regimes. The
technology has been tested in over 300 human users aged 18-82 years. It has been
applied to assess sensory and motor dysfunction in stroke survivors and patients
with Parkinson's disease. Test-retest reliability and validity of its outcome
measures has been established.
