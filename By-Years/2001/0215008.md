This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
establish the technical and economic feasibility of a novel photocatalytic
technology to inactivate air-borne surrogate bacterial spores representative of
Bacillus anthracis (anthrax bacteria). The technology is to be incorporated into
circulating air ducts of buildings, providing protection against introduction of
anthrax into central air systems by a terrorist act. The investigators have
previously developed a new class of photocatalysts that are orders of magnitude
more active for organic compound oxidation than the traditional titania. This
new class of photocatalysts will be adapted for use in anthrax spore
destruction. The program will utilize photocatalyst composition studies to
tailor a superior photocatalyst for this application, to be followed by reactor
studies of the bactericidal efficacy of the new photocatalysts, and a
competitive cost analysis of the technology relative to other alternatives for
maintenance of indoor air quality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The immediate
commercial application of this project is in the area of homeland security. The
proposed technology will protect against the threat of introduction of lethal
anthrax spores into central air systems.
