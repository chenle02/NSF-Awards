This award by the National Science Foundation to Morgan State University is for
the acquisition of a combined atomic force and magnetic force microscope
(AFM/MFM). This instrument will be used to probe the underlying physics and
characterize thin magnetic films and multi-layers. In recent years, the PI has
developed novel lower-dimensional solid state structures with optical,
electronic, and magnetic characteristics governed by quantum mechanics. Probing
the size effects and surface and interfacial physics is important in
understanding these structures and developing new technologies. The AFM/MFM
provides information on features as small as an atomic lattice for either
conductive or non-conductive samples, it enables manipulation for sample growth,
and it makes it possible to image in in-situ and controlled environments.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to probe materials with Atomic and Magnetic
Force Microscopy (AFM/MFM) is critical in understanding the physics of novel
thin film magnetic materials a few nanometers thick and a few square millimeters
in surface area. The instrument will be used to study technologically important
materials used in ultra-high-density data storage for next generation personal
computers and in developing fast, miniaturized, and reliable electronic devices.
The instrument will complement an existing magneto-optic Kerr effect instrument
and magnetron sputtering thin film growth system. Students at Morgan will learn
the basics of operating and building an AFM / MFM through a weeklong workshop at
the manufacturer's headquarters. This knowledge will enable modification of the
instrument to advance a variety of research needs and will be passed on to
future students at Morgan State University.
