The ability to recover and purify natural and recombinant proteins, and the
costs of doing so, remain a major task in introducing potential products for
biotechnology. The available bases for separation range from specific binding
onto tailored reagents to solubility and partitioning behavior governed by a
mixed bag of size, charge and hydrophobicity. The separation methods considered
here are precipitation, and ion-exchange using both resins and membranes.
Improvements in selectivity are sought by bestowing a distinctive charge on the
protein of interest such that a charge-based separation method provides
selective recovery. The charge is provided using a polypeptide "purification"
fusion tail introduced by placing a synthetic oligonucleotide at the end of the
gene for the protein. The series of fusion proteins provides a means of studying
the charge-dependent phenomena in separation methods which may be dependent on
several characteristics of the protein.
