This project aims to develop quantitative understanding of the basis for
regulation of glycogenolysis, a process most certainly carried out by multi-
enzyme complexes in muscle. Specific aims will be to develop useful models of
complexes with increasing degrees of organization, along with mathematical
expressions of their activities, so that predictions can be tested
experimentally. Models will be evaluated in terms of actual enzyme sensitivity
to effectors, response times with changes in effector levels, energy
consumption, and relationship to native glycogen particles. Microscopy of the
scanning tunneling and atomic force type(s) will be employed to visualize system
components and the complexes likely to occur with them.//
