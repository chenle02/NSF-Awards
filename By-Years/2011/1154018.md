The Department of Biology is collaborating with the Department of Mathematics
&amp; Statistics at Sam Houston State University to continue their prior S-STEM
project. The project is selecting 9 students from the freshman or sophomore
classes, 9 students from combined junior and senior classes, and 9 graduate
students each of the four years, to received scholarships of $3,000, $6,000 or
$7,250 respectively. These scholarships are proving to be effective in enabling
students to complete degree programs in a timely manner by allowing the students
to reduce their work-for-pay hours. The students are using this 'extra time' to
enrich their education through interdisciplinary experiences including research,
mentoring, and professional development. The program is aligned with the
workforce needs both in the region and nationally. To ensure student success,
PEERS offers scholars a number of services including: mentoring from faculty,
graduate students, and industry representatives; ad hoc tutoring; professional
development seminars; welcome activities; participation in both a local and a
national meeting; and access to additional support
services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is building on effective practices
learned in the prior project that demonstrated the value of increased attention
to mentoring, tutoring by more advanced students, the value for career
development opportunities, explicit attention to community building, and
interdisciplinary undergraduate research experiences. Recognizing increased need
with the biotechnology area, the PEERS program is focussing on the intersection
of biomathematics and biostatistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As 35% of SHSU
students are members of an underrepresented group, and the majors in the STEM
disciplines at SHSU are at least as diverse, the project is succeeding at
broadening the participation of such groups in the STEM workforce. Through their
deliberate and calculated actions, the project is also succeeding at increasing
the numbers of scholars transitioning to graduate school.
