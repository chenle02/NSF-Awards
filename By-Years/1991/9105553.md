As a model system to study organelle transport, pigment granule aggregation and
dispersion will be analyzed in lysed melanophores from the teleost fish, Tilapia
mossambica and Fundulus heteroclitus, and the movements of isolated granules
along microtubules will be assessed in vitro. The aim of the project is to
determine whether or not dynein and kinesin have opposing roles in the
generation of bidirectional pigment granule transport in melanophores and to
understand the mechanism by which the two directions of transport are regulated.
This laboratory has previously determined that dispersion requires protein
phosphorylation via cAMP dependent protein kinase while aggregation requires
protein dephosphorylation via calcineurin. Experiments will be carried out to
determine if dynein, kinesin, or other components of the pigment granule
transport system in the melanophores are substrates for the kinase and
phosphatase. If these substrates as well as the motors generating opposing
movements are identified, then it may be possible to elucidate the mechanism by
which the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation signal is translated into
transport in a given direction. The orderly transport of membrane-enclosed
subcellular compartments from one region of the cytoplasm to another is a very
important problem in cell biology. Such transport phenomena are responsible for
a wide variety of cellular functions, including endocytosis and secretion. In
the case of melanophores of fish, the transport of the pigment granules radially
from an "aggregated" central location to a "dispersed" situation results in a
change in the coloration of the skin of the fish, and is an important adaptive
response to predation. This project will result in information that will be of
use in not only understanding fish coloration, but also all other microtubule-
mediated translocations of subcellular compartments.
