This research is aimed at the development of a high speed, optical polarization
modulator for use in polarimeters and ellipsometers. The objective will be to
reach modulation frequencies of 10-20 kHz and in a manner which is independent
of light frequency. The rotational modulator will be used in the construction of
a high speed polarimeter and ellipsometer for the purpose of making rapid and
accurate determinations of transient structural changes in solids, liquids, and
thin films. These instrumentations will have important advantages compared with
previous designs with respect to the speed of data acquisition and improved
capabilities, such as the ability to make spectroscopic measurements of
properties like birefringence and dichroism.
