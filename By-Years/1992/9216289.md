This is a project on the control of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks
and of optical networks. We focus on three sets of issues central to the
operations of high speed networks: Traffic shaping for ATM networks Multiplexing
for optical networks Feedback control with delayed information We will use the
limit results for fast and large networks to analyze these three sets of issues.
Specifically, we will use fluid and diffusion limits and large deviation bounds.
For traffic shaping we will use a new strategy (periodic averaging of rate). We
believe this strategy can reduce significantly the amount of queuing required
inside the network, and that this strategy can simplify both the design and
control of networks. the multiplexing approach that we will study for optical
networks is statistical look-ahead multiplexing. This multiplexing approach is
designed for star optical networks. It uses the connectivity properties of these
networks but does not require tunable lasers or filters. The objectives in the
study of feedback control with information delay are to identify the feedback
control strategies that can improve the operations of high speed networks and
quantify the gain achieved by these strategies.
