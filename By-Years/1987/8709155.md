Algebraics eigenvalue problems are frequently encountered in engineering
analysis. For example, the dynamics analysis of structures leads to eigenvalue
problems which are characterized by very large sparse matrices, i.e. matrices
with many elements being zero. The solution of this eigenvalue problem
constitutes a significant computational burden for structure models possessing
thousands or tens of thousands of degrees of freedom. A new method, Component
Mode Iteration, of solution shows promise. It concerges quickly to the lowest
modes of a structure and the algorithm is inherently parallel, so that it would
be natural to implement on a parallel processor. This Engineering Initiation
project will be directed toward the further development and testing of the
component mode iteration algorithm. Several refinements will be added to the
current algorithm, e.g. eigenvalue shifts and automating the decision of
substructure division. The institutional support is adequate and the P.I. is
fully capable of carrying out the research. I strongly recommend support.
