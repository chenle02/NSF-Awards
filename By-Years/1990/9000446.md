The CEDAR ( Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions) program
has as one of its main goals the understanding of the climatology of the
thermosphere. In many of the program activities data are collected at different
locations around the globe that pertain to this goal. This project is designed
primarily to organize the community to better utilize the expanded data base
available under CEDAR and to address some of the outstanding problems of the
global structure and dynamics of the thermosphere. The initial goals will be a
synthesis of the climatological maps characterizing the global mean state and
diurnal characteristics of the thermosphere winds and temperatures obtained with
incoherent scatter radars and optical Fabry-Perot interferometers at many
different stations.
