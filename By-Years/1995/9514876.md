This research focuses on two issues related to the contracting approach to
monetary policy design. First, the project addresses a range of questions
dealing with the implementation of incentives, the relationship of alternative
policy mechanisms such as central bank independence and inflation targeting to
the type of incentive structures suggested by optimal central bank contracts,
and the effects of information on the feasibility of achieving optimal policy
outcomes. Second, the project advances our understanding of the means through
which central bank independence leads to differences in macroeconomic outcomes
by examining the role of delegation, the factors that determine the optimal
degree of delegation, and the consequences for monetary and fiscal interactions
of alternative aspects of the delegation of monetary policy authority. The
project address these issues both through theoretical modelling and applied
regression analysis. The results of this project will clarify how mechanisms
such as inflation targeting combined with central bank announcements might be
used to implement the types of optimal incentive structures emphasized in the
contracting approach to the design of monetary policy. The project will also
identify the issues that are important for determining the degree of delegation
that is optimal in the conduct of monetary policy and how the presence of
institutions that are insulated from direct electoral influences may actually
promote democratic stability. These results will contribute to the ongoing
debate on the consequences of alternative institutional structures for central
banks and the role of inflation targeting as a framework for the conduct of
monetary policy.
