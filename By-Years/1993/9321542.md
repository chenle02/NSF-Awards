93-21542 Smith, J. Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory The PI's request funding to
purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The
instruments will be used aboard the R/V EWING, a 239 foot vessel, which is owned
and operated by the Observatory. Instrumentation to be purchased includes a
continuous seawater analysis system, two EPC 9800 thermal recorders, depth
transducers for airguns and seismic streamers, six seismic airguns and firing
solenoid valves, and a set of meteorological sensors. All of this equipment is
required for successful scientific operation during NSF-funded cruises in 1994.
It will also increase the scientific capabilities of the R/V EWING for future
cruises.
