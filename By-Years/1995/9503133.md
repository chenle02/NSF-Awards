This award will continue support to Professor Moncrief to carry out mathematical
physics studies related to theoretical gravitation. The work to be carried out
includes studies of cosmological singularities, the constraint equations for
gravitation; and the study of phase space for general relativity. Professor
Moncrief is one of the few investigators capable of making progress on the hard
mathematical questions which arise from Einstein's theory of gravitation. This
research will have important consequences for both theoretical physics and pure
mathematics.
