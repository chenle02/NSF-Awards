Looking forward, a fundamental challenge in computer systems is the Power Wall,
where, due to imbalances in technology scaling, not all the cores that can be
placed in a many-core chip can be powered on at the same time. The Power Wall is
transforming all levels of the system stack, including the many-core
architecture landscape -- the focus of this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By
improving power more than an order of magnitude (and energy efficiency, several
times) over conventional operation, near-threshold voltage computing (NTC) has
the potential to push back the Power Wall. To unlock NTC?s energy efficiency
potential, however, critical barriers to NTC -- limited degree of parallelism
and higher vulnerability to parametric variation -- must be attacked. This
project suggests leveraging scaling characteristics and implicit fault tolerance
of emerging R(ecognition), M(ining), S(ynthesis) applications in order to
overcome NTC barriers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will not only address
critical barriers of NTC to unlock NTC?s energy efficiency potential, but also
deliver tools and models to quantify the implications of these barriers at the
system level. The deliverables will help the architecture community in reasoning
about and exploring how to trade-off energy efficiency for resiliency in near-
future systems capable of operating at&lt;br/&gt;as low voltages as near-
threshold.
