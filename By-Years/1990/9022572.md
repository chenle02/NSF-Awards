Misfit dislocations are thermodynamically stable in epitaxial films above a
critical thickness, which depends mainly on the misfit magnitude between the
film and substrate. The formation of dislocations does not occur immediately
when the critical thickness is exceeded since kinetic factors are involved which
are not adequately understood. This grant examines the role of misfit
dislocations and strain in affecting behavior of magnetic films. The kinetics of
dislocation nucleation in epitaxial thin films is pursued with an aim towards
developing an in-situ method for monitoring misfit dislocation formation. The
Magneto-optic Kerr (MOKE) effect is employed as a probe that is sensitive to the
presence of small strains in magnetic films. This is used to characterize misfit
strains and dislocations on epitaxial nickel/copper films. Other techniques
employed are electron microscopy and secondary electron spin polarization
analysis to determine the kinetics of dislocation formation. %%% The homogeneous
strain of lattice mismatch and the highly non- uniform strains around
dislocations have dramatic effects on magnetic properties. This research is
directed towards developing a better understanding of the formation of misfit
dislocations and their effects on magnetic films. An in-situ monitoring
technique during film growth could result from the research.
