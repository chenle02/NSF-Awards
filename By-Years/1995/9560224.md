9560224 Boulton This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
explores a new approach to ultra precision honing. Honing processes used for
flat machining play a vital role in U. S. manufacturing. With the exception of
urethane stones made in-house by some domestic end users, the bulk of these
grindstones are currently made from PVA (poly vinyl alcohol resin), produced in
Japan, and imported in the U.S. Likely products are high performance stones
engineered for flat surface machining applications that fit a low cost-of-
ownership manufacturing model. Phase I proposal will investigate new
compositions and approaches for fabricating honing stones made with U.S.
products. Optimization will be studied by testing against Japanese stones for
existing product lines and against lapping processes where honing stones are not
yet available.
