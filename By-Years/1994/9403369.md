9403369 Bolden This award is under the International Junior Investigator and
Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers to
conduct three to twelve months of research abroad at research centers of proven
excellence. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and
the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research
visit by Dr. Daphne A. Bolden to work with Dr. Marina Bentivoglio at the
University of Verona's Institutes of Human Anatomy and Histology. This research
proposes to test the hypothesis that an interaction exists between the
sympathetic and sensory division of the peripheral nervous systems. An
understanding of such an interaction would provide insights into disorders of
the autonomic nervous system in which degeneration is specific to one population
of neurons, yet consequences are seen in both divisions. The proposed studies
are designed to examine this interaction by employing a model of sympathetic
neuronal degeneration. ***
