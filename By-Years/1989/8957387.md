This Presidential Young Investigator Award given in the Organic Dynamics Program
provides support for the research of Dr. Matthew Zimmt at Brown University. Dr.
Zimmt's research is concerned broadly with electron transfer both
mechanistically and as as a probe of molecular conformation. Several
photochemical and photophysical systems will be studied. Donor-spacer-acceptor
molecules in which the donor and acceptor are rigidly held at differing angles
to each other will be prepared in order to assess both the distance and
orientational dependence of electron transfer. These studies may be germane to
molecular photodiodes and electron transfer rates in helical polypeptides. A
coherent optoacoustic method will be used to provide kinetic and calorimetric
data for intermediates with lifetimes as short as 0.08-5 nanoseconds. Distinct
donor and acceptor moieties will be placed at the termini of polymer chains and
and energy transport, as measured by enhanced donor luminescence decay will be
used to probe polymer conformation in solids under physical stress.
