Incoherent radiation offers a number of advantages over coherent radiation for
many image processing applications. It inherently gives a superior signal-to-
noise ratio and offers more flexibility. The planned research is a continuation
of previous NSF supported work (ECS-8212472) exploring aspects of image
processing with incoherent light. The image processing operations will be based
upon interferometry using extended source and polychromatic light. Work will
concentrate on three major topics: First is an extension of incoherent spatial
filtering, wherein arbitrary transfer functions are generated, comparable to
those possible with coherent optics. Second is a process whereby the image
properties, including resolution, are controlled by a parallel aperture, through
which no light from the object passes. This prospect leads to superresolution,
whereby the object light passes through a small aperture, yet is not degraded in
resolution. Third is a new kind of diffraction tomography, based on the concept
of grating imaging with incoherent light.
