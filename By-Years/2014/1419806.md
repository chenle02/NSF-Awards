The U.S. National Committee for Crystallography (USNC/Cr) is supported by an
award from the Division of Chemistry to host the 2014 USNC/Cr Young Observers
Program. This will provide travel fellowships to twenty U.S. early career
crystallographers to attend the XXIII IUCr Congress in Montreal, Canada, on
August 5-12, 2014. The Young Observers will share their research internationally
during 2014, the United Nations (UN)-declared International Year of
Crystallography. The USNC/Cr Young Observers program will pursue the following
objectives: 1) support early career U.S. crystallographers in sharing their
research at the 2014 IUCr Congress, 2) provide opportunities for interaction
between U.S. early career scientists and leading crystallographers, 3) provide a
mentoring experience to every fellowship recipient, 4) expose the awardees to
new areas of crystallography research, 5) expose the awardees to the field of
science policy, 6) build a network of early career and senior U.S.
crystallographers, and 7) foster international collaborations between U.S.
crystallographers and their international peers. The fellowship program will
enable some early career scientists who might not otherwise be able to attend
the Congress to do so through a unique program.
