A consortia of six institutions is conducting a series of six week long
workshops over a three year period to enhance the expertise of mathematics
faculty in the development and use of interactive computer experiments in
differential equations. Consortia members are Cornell University, Harvey Mudd
College, Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute, St. Olaf College, Washington State
University, and West Valley College. The computer projects are designed to be
hardware/software independent and are intended to supplement standard courses in
order to add another dimension to instruction in ordinary differential
equations. The primary goal of each workshop is to develop faculty expertise on
a particular hardware/software platform so that they can design and use
interactive computer experiments in a laboratory environment. A second goal is
to develop an ongoing Consortium to promote the writing and evaluation of
computer experiments in differential equations and its applications as well as
in related areas of mathematics.
