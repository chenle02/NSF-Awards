Anisotrophy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) is a potentially powerful indicator
of rock fabric (preferred grain orientation) that has not been fully exploited
as a tool in volcanology. This proposal seeks funds for a much more detailed
investigation of AMS fabrics in welded ignimbrites than has been attempted in
previous studies. Very carefully selected sites will be sampled in order to
evaluate the origin and nature of AMS fabrics in welded tuffs, to map out
primary flow directions on the scale of tens to hundreds of meters, to assess
the effect that secondary processes (welding and rheomorphism) have on these
primary fabrics, and to assess the degree to which AMS can be used to constrain
mechanisms of deposition from pyroclastic flows. The Bandelier Tuff, Jemez
Mountains, New Mexico will be studied.
