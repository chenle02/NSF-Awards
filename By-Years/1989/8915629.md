In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Almlof will push back the frontiers of electronic structure
calculations in two areas. His endeavors will allow workers in the field to
perform increasingly accurate calculations on molecules of current chemical and
biological interest by improving current methodologies. Direct methods for
electron correlation will be extended to general correlation schemes, and basis
sets will be developed for use in very accurate correlated calculations. These
new methods will then be applied to the study of carbon clusters, including
diamond impurities, graphite-type clusters, and intercalation compounds, as well
as smaller metal clusters. Very accurate calculations on small molecules, such
as N2 and C3, will also be performed.
