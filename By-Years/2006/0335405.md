START, established under the aegis of ICSU, and co-sponsored by the
International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, the World Climate Research
Programme, and the International Human Dimensions Programme on global
environmental change, will foster regional networks of collaborating scientists
and institutions in developing countries. These networks will conduct research
on regional aspects of environmental change, assess impacts and vulnerabilities
to such changes, and provide information to policy-makers. START will enhance
the scientific capacity of developing countries to address the complex processes
of environmental change and degradation through a wide variety of training and
career development programs. START will also mobilize resources to support
infrastructure and research programs on environmental change within developing
regions resulting in a leveraging of core support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;START's
research-driven capacity-building activities are expected to involve annually
hundreds of participants and to encourage especially young START network
scientists to become mentors and leaders in their region, to serve on scientific
and planning committees for the global change research programs, and to
contribute their scientific expertise to the policy-making process. The
Secretariat will be responsible for program planning, coordination, and resource
mobilization for the international framework of regional research networks and
programs that the International START Secretariat has established. The
Secretariat will also maintain its effort to internationalize global change
research through research-driven capacity building in developing regions of the
world. These networks and programs are expected to also engage a large number of
U.S. scientists and institutions in collaborative research
partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;
