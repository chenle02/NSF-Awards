The Association for Practical and Professional Ethics, in collaboration with the
Poynter Center for the Study of Ethics and American Institutions, and
Association members who are leading scholars and educators in the ethics of
scientific research, will provide instruction in ethical issues in scientific
research for a selected group of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in
engineering and the natural and physical sciences. The objective is to equip
these researchers with skill in ethical thinking, understanding of the
historical context of scientific misconduct and awareness of the
multidisciplinary nature of major issues in scientific research. An intensive
four day workshop will provide 15 participants in each of three years with tools
for self-directed development in these areas and a network of support. The
workshop will introduce participants to ethical theory and reasoning in the
context of discussions on topics such as data sharing and ownership; responsible
conduct of research; conflicts of interest; professional relations with
colleagues; ethical issues in computing; protection of human subjects;
variations in standards of conduct; responsibilities of engineers and scientists
to the larger society. The aim is to enable them to provide leadership in
ethical issues in the scientific community and enhanced ethics education for
their own future students. Participants will be nominated by science and
engineering faculty at research universities and through solicitations to a wide
variety of professional associations, and selected for their promise as leaders
and mentors. In advance of the workshop, they will begin to read historical
cases and introductory material, to inform themselves of standards of conduct in
their own fields, and to develop a case study for distribution and comment.
During the workshop, participants will discuss presentations and case studies,
continue to work on their own cases and those contributed by others, and review
and evaluate standards of conduct. Case studies prepared in the workshop will be
made available to faculty nationwide for use in their own courses, and
participants will be expected to share their work at their home institutions.
They will join a network of concerned scientists and engineers from the Big Ten
and other universities and receive a complementary three year membership in the
Association which will enable them to maintain the contacts needed to continue
to work in the field. Project staff and an outside evaluator will assess the
project.
