Orchids comprise one of the largest plant families with approximately 20,000
described species. They represent an extremely diverse group of organisms with a
worldwide distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The
large tribe Vandeae makes up 10% of the entire family. It possesses several very
specialized members that have been evolutionarily reduced to a leafless and
often almost stemless state. These plants depend entirely on their green roots
for food manufacture. The primary focus of this study is to develop a
phylogenetic hypothesis for these leafless Vandeae using molecular evidence from
DNA as well as evidence from macro- and microscopic root structure.

With the recent spate of molecular data, evolutionary relationships of plant
groups are being reestablished and recircumscribed. Surprisingly, Vandeae, a
significant group within the orchid family, has been essentially untouched by
molecular taxonomists. This study will provide an additional set of characters,
which can be used to derive hypotheses of evolutionary relationships. More
importantly, questions concerning the evolution of one of the most extreme modes
of epiphytism will be answered.
