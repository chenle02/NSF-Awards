0323963 Ergas The overall goal of this project is to assess the viability of
anaerobic MBRs for treatment of domestic wastewaters for reclamation
applications. Specific objectives include: (1) characterization of soluble COD
in anaerobic MBRs treating low strength wastewaters, (2) evaluation of the
effect of system operating conditions on effluent COD and membrane fouling and
(3) evaluation of anaerobic MBR for pathogen removal and reclamation
applications. The research will be accomplished through collaboration between
U.S. and Mexican research laboratories with expertise in anaerobic treatment
processes, MBR technology and pathogen removal. The U.S. team will conduct bench
scale anaerobic MBR studies under controlled operating conditions (SRT, MLSS,
COD loading rate) using synthetic, raw and settled wastewater. Studies will
focus on how the presence of a membrane separation system affect the
characteristics (VFA concentrations, MW distribution, biodegradability) of
anaerobic effluents and what operating conditions, membrane materials and
configurations minimize effluent soluble COD and maximize flux. The Mexican team
will conduct pilot scale anaerobic MBR studies, focusing on pathogen removal and
water reclamation applications.
