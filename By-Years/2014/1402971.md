Recent experimental progress in ultra-cold atomic/molecular gases and
unconventional optical lattices has allowed us to push our exploration of the
quantum world to a new limit, where a quantum many-particle system can be
controlled and measured with exceptional precision. In modern quantum physics,
one key development is the geometric/topological interpretation of quantum
systems, from which topological field theory and the concept of topological
states of matter are developed. The main objective of this investigation is to
improve our knowledge on quantum topological states of matter by realizing,
characterizing and understanding topologically-nontrivial quantum states in
ultra-cold atomic gases. The physics principles revealed in this investigation
may shed new light on other branches of scientific research including solid
state physics, quantum information and quantum computation. In addition, the
research plan contains an education component, which promotes awareness towards
the research on novel quantum states and provides the general public, especially
the next generation, novel knowledge on the future development of quantum
computation. This setup offers an ideal platform for the investigation of
quantum many-body systems and their topological
properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigation contains a combined effort of
theoretical and numerical studies utilizing modern theoretical techniques such
as quantum field theory and exact numerical methods. By identifying topological
states that are most suitable for realization in atomic systems, the study will
provide direct guidance for experimental investigations. In addition, the unique
properties of atomic gases will allow us to stabilize and to study novel
topological states, which have never been realized in other systems. By studying
these unconventional topological states, new principles of physics can emerge
and will be studied.
