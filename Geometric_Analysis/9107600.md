Professor Uribe will continue his research on problems in global analysis. In
particular he will study the spectral asymptotics of elliptic operators and
their relationships with symplectic geometry. One main problem is to relate the
asymptotic properties of the Schrodinger operator to the classical mechanics of
the system represented by the operator. A second problem is to develop the
theory of the Fourier integral operator in the setting of quantized Kahler
manifolds. The motivation for this research comes from mathematical physics and
inverse spectral problems. Inverse spectral theory tries to understand an
operator by studying how the operator separates input into discrete parts. The
Schrodinger operator in particular plays a central role in the modeling of many
physical systems and a better understanding of the spectral properties of this
operator would have broad application.
