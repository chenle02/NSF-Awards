The errors young children make during the course of language acquisition give
researchers strong evidence that grammar is not learned through pure imitation.
One error that is a characteristic of the acquisition of English is the pronoun
case error. It is typical for a 2 or 3 year old child to say something like
"*Her crashed" when the child apparently means to say "She crashed". These
errors are actually a form of overextension, that is, children overextend the
use of a pronominal case form, in this example "her", into the syntactic
environment of another, in this example, that of "she". Although psycholinguists
have known of these overextensions for a relatively long time, only recently
have they proposed testable hypotheses about the nature and causation of these
pronoun case overextensions. This research project tests unique predictions of
the Pronoun Paradigm Building Hypothesis of pronoun case overextension, and asks
three research questions: (1) Are "he" and "they" overextended more often than
"she"?; (2) Do the overextensions of third person pronouns exhibit a positive
correlation between bias and rate of overextension?; and, (3) Is "her"
overextended more than "him" and "them"? In the study, 30 children between the
ages of 30 and 36 months will be audiotaped as they interact with their primary
caregivers in three activities designed to encourage the use of third person
pronouns: (1) playing with a Little Tikes toy set, (2) the viewing and
description of a family photo-album, and (3) reading a picture book. The project
will take one year to complete.
