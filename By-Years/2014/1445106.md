Fluorescent molecules are among the important imaging reagents for biomedical
research such as DNA sequencing, cell tracing, receptor labeling, drug delivery
and in vivo imaging with a market size of approximately $492 million dollars.
The fluorescence technology is cost effective and it also provides real-time
response, and subcellular resolution. Unfortunately, blinking, quenching or
degradation of fluorescence intensity has limited the sensitivity and resolution
of these imaging techniques. In this project, the team proposes to use the boron
nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) to resolve these fluorescence issues.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BNNTs can offer all the drug delivery advantages provided
by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) without having non-radiative decay channels. Because
of the biological compatibility and electrical insulating nature, BNNTs are the
optimum fluorescent nanocarriers that can avoid quenching of fluorescence
molecules. This is theoretically sounded, as the light excited electrons in the
LUMO level (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of the fluorophores are
energetically far away from the valence level of BNNTs, and will not be
transferred to BNNTs. In addition, BNNTs offer flexibility to be functionalized
with various polymeric molecules covalently and non-covalently.
