This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the
Chemistry Division supports the 36th International Conference on Coordination
Chemistry (ICCC) in Merida, Mexico, July 18-23, 2004. Specifically, assistance
with travel costs will be provided to participants in a small workshop to
discuss the state of inorganic chemistry and how communications and
collaborations can be improved between biannual ICCC meetings. Broad
representation from the participating countries will be
sought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ICCC is a premier international meeting in the
area of inorganic chemistry. The 36th ICCC meeting was originally scheduled to
be held in Israel, but the international situation forced rescheduling. A joint
Mexican/United States organizing committee was able to reschedule the meeting to
Merida, Mexico, on short notice. This award will assist the inorganic chemistry
community to assess how international interactions can be maintained and
strengthened in times when the ICCC is not held.&lt;br/&gt;
