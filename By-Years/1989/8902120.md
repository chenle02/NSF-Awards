This project is concerned with the development and analysis of finite element
methods for partial differential equations arising from mechanics. The topics of
research include: (1) Investigation of the boundary layer of the Reissner-
Mindlin plate model, including the development and rigorous justification of an
asymptotic expansion of the solution in terms of appropriate powers of the plate
thickness for boundary conditions modelling the "soft" simply supported and free
plate. (2) The development of higher order uniformly accurate finite element
methods for the Reissner-Mindlin model (generalizing a first order method
previously developed). In addition, the boundary layer theory developed in (1)
will be used to analyze the interior behavior of methods and to develop mesh
refinement strategies for improved accuracy. (3) Investigation of the use of
nonconforming finite elements for boundary value problems in elasticity.
Particular attention is given to the validity of Korn's second inequality for
nonconforming elements with traction boundary conditions and to determining the
relationship of finite element methods based on equivalent formulations of the
equations of linear elasticity. (4) Investigation of the use of nonconforming
finite element methods for the approximation of first order linear scalar
hyperbolic equations. One application is to the problem of identifying a
variable coefficient in an elliptic partial differential equation.
