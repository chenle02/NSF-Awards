AST-0330649&lt;br/&gt;Richards&lt;br/&gt;The active galactic nuclei (AGN)
research community is in the midst of a flood of high quality data. In
particular, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) will produce data for
approximately a hundred thousand quasars and a million AGN. Because of this, and
because there has been no conference on AGN since 1998, the organizers are
holding a meeting at Princeton University on July 27-30, 2003. This meeting is
oriented towards students and young researchers, comprising long and short
invited reviews, contributions from participants, and technical discussions of
the SDSS catalogs and archive. The NSF is supporting the attendance of the more
junior participants.&lt;br/&gt;***
