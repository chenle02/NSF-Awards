Under this award, a broad collaboration led by Johns Hopkins University will
establish the framework and foundation for the National Virtual Observatory
(NVO). Establishing the framework for the NVO is the first step towards a system
that can provide seamless integration of data-intensive resources in astronomy.
When fully implemented, the NVO will serve as an engine of discovery for
astronomy. Large scale surveys of the sky from space and the ground are being
initiated at wavelengths from radio to x-ray, generating vast amounts of high
quality, irreplaceable data. The potential for scientific discovery afforded by
these new surveys is enormous. Entirely new and unexpected scientific results of
major significance will emerge from the combined use of the resulting datasets,
science that would not be possible from such sets used singly. Their large size
and complexity require tools and structures to discover the complex phenomena
encoded within them.

The NVO framework will be built by coordinating the diverse efforts already in
existence and provide a focus for the development of capabilities that do not
yet exist. The NVO will act as an enabling and coordinating entity to foster the
development of further tools, protocols, and collaborations necessary to realize
the full scientific potential of large astronomical datasets in the coming
decade. The components of the NVO include not only the archives, but also
metadata standards, a standardized data access layer, query and computing
services, and data mining applications. The new capabilities of the NVO will be
essential to realize the full value of the tera/petabyte datasets that are in
hand or soon to be created. Rapid querying of multiple large-scale catalogs,
establishment of statistical correlations, discovery of new data patterns and
temporal variations, and confrontation with sophisticated numerical simulations
are all avenues for new science that will be made possible through the NVO.
Future surveys will have well defined templates available to enable them to
publish their data more easily. The NVO, through its rich content and special
portals designed for students, teachers and the public, will have major impact
on a wide range of science education and public outreach projects. The goal of
the NVO is international in scope and the project will coordinate its
development activities with the international community, to assure that the end
result is a Global Virtual Observatory.
