Geschke plans to study applications of filtrations of Boolean algebras, Banach
spaces and C-star-algebras to problems in measure theory, functional analysis,
set-theoretic topology and topological dynamics. Filtrations can often be used
to construct automorphisms of or homomorphisms from the structures under
consideration. In other cases, interesting properties of a structure can be
characterized in terms of the existence of a filtration of a specific type. The
following topics will be considered: Cofinalities of Boolean algebras, C-star-
algebras and Banach spaces, automorphisms of the Calkin algebra and other
C-star- and Boolean algebras, Borel liftings for measure and category with a
large size of the continuum, the structure of phase spaces of minimal dynamical
systems.

Many natural questions about properties of certain infinite structures cannot be
decided using the usual axioms of mathematics. This is where logic and set
theory have to be used to analyze the situation. Boolean algebras are
sufficiently nice, so that set-theoretic methods can be applied very directly in
order to answer questions about them. Understanding this interaction between
Boolean algebras and set theory helps in getting the right intuition about
applications of set theory to questions about more complicated structures. Large
structures can often be analyzed by breaking them into smaller pieces that fit
together nicely. This approach has been particularly successful with Boolean
algebras. Therefore it should be applied systematically to study other infinite
structures as well.
