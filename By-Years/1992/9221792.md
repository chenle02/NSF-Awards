This project is for continued study of submarine lava samples and geophysical
data collected from the Galapagos platform in 1990. Geochemical studies confirm
and extend a horseshoe-shaped pattern of geochemical zonation in the zonation in
the subaerial and submarine eruptive products of the Galapagos hotspot. The
principal investigators are presently collecting major and trace element
concentrations, isotopic ratios, and radiomatic age data from an extensive suite
of submarine volcanic rocks and glasses in order to test these hypotheses.
