The workshop on Uncertainty in Computation will be held at the Simons Institute
for the Theory of Computing from October 4 to October 7, 2016. The workshop is
part of a program on Logical Structures in Computation that will take place from
August 14 to December 16, 2016. The underlying theme of the workshop is to
explore the viewpoints of the fields of logic, analysis of algorithms, and
computational complexity on uncertainty in computation. The broader significance
and importance of the workshop is that it will enhance communication between the
mathematical logic community and the community of algorithms researchers within
computing science. The workshop will encourage students to attend, and the
organizers will actively recruit scientists from a diversity of backgrounds.
