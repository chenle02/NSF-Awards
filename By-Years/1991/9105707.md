The objective of this research is the measurement and interpretation of the
horizontal component of the electric field very close to the lightning stroke.
The experiment will take place at the Kennedy Space Center during Summer 1991
and will involve rocket-triggered lightning. The proposed measurements and
analysis are important for the modelling of the lower part of the lightning
channel, in particular the lightning attachment process and the coupling of
electromagnetic energy from very close lightning to overhead wires. The
electromagnetics research group from the Ecole Polytechnique Federal de Lausanne
in Switzerland has offered to share with the University of Florida their
electric field measuring equipment: 2 Thomson CSF electric field sensors
(wideband EMP sensors ideally suited for close lightning measurements), a LeCroy
4 channel digitalizing oscilloscope, and a controlling computer. Additionally
the group will provide one experienced Ph.D. student and possibly one additional
graduate student who will travel to the Kennedy Space Center for Summer 1991 to
cooperate with our research group in making the proposed electric field
measurements and who will bring the Swiss equipment to Gainesville and help in
the calibration in Spring 1991.
