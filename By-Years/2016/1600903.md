This award provides funding for the summer school "Orthogonal Polynomials and
Special Functions to be held at the Norbert Weiner Center for Harmonic Analysis
on the the University of Maryland-College Park campus, from July 11 to July 15,
2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in
Analysis, especially on the topics of exceptional orthogonal polynomials,
elliptic hypergeometric functions, q-series and the like. A number of
distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.
The award gives early career researchers, researchers who are members of
underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF a chance to attend and
participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make
this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different
activities. More information will be made available
