This SBIR Phase 1 project aims to develop a novel continuous rotational spiral
solidification technology platform called Heliolithography (HL) to enable
economical mass production of functional end-use 3D printed parts. The potential
outcome of this feasibility study would be improving speed and performance of
the prototypes to demonstrate key advantages of the process. This highly
beneficial platform aims to advance 3D printing technology into production of
functional parts. Its success would contribute to widespread job creation in the
U.S. Manufacturing sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heliolithography
utilizes continuous rotation to overcome the inefficiencies of a serial layer to
layer process typical of stereolithography machines (SLA) that must reset, re-
position, re-supply material so the next layer can be made. The rotating method
serves as a continuous method to cure material, removes the adhesion force issue
that impedes many SLA processes from scaling up, and resupplies new material to
be cured in one motion. If successful, this will serve as a significant leap
forward in the field that will provide greater throughput for mass producing and
mass customizing 3D prints while allowing for the use of a broader range of
advanced materials with higher viscosities. The research project will also focus
on the development of an advanced non-stick coating and a tiled, high power,
high resolution light engine. A tethered liquid interface nano-coating will be
evaluated by bond line release and wear rate/durability tests. The performance
of the light engine will be validated through direct power output measurements
and also through extended functional testing for dimensional accuracy,
repeatability, and tensile &amp; impact strengths of the printed parts.
