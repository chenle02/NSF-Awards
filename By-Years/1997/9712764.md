Bala Ramachandran is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to study the reactions, isomerizations, and photoabsorption
dynamics on the lowest singlet potential energy surface of the three-atom system
oxygen, hydrogen, and chlorine. He will fit the three-atom potential energy
surface from ab initio electronic structure calculations, use quantum
wavepackets to study the dynamics of various reactions, and calculate the
vibrational-rotational spectra of the stable species. This area of research will
complement experimental studies relevant to the chemistry of stratospheric ozone
by interpreting and predicting spectroscopic signatures of important atmospheric
species. The particular system under study is also of interest due to the
richness and diversity of the dynamical phenonmena that it exhibits.
