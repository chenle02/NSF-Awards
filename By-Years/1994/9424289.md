Abstract ATM-9424289 Semazzi, Fredrick H. North Carolina State University Title:
Prediction of the Seasonal Climate Anomalies Over Eastern Africa The primary
objective of this grant is to develop a numerical modeling system for predicting
the onset, intensity and withdrawal of seasonal rains over East Africa. For this
purpose, high resolution nested grid model simulations will be conducted and
through an international cooperative arrangement such a prediction system will
be tested and refined against the seasonal forecasts issued by the Drought
Monitoring center, Nairobi. This project is important to understand and predict
the climate fluctuations over a number of East Africa countries such as Burundi,
Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Uganda and Tanzania and to assess their
possible impacts.
