Software modules are being developed which will improve student learning in
undergraduate major and service statistics courses. With these modules, students
can use modern commercial statistical software and computing equipment to
analyze realistic data. The data analysis assignments will enable students to
master the mechanics of data analysis and the important concepts that are
introduced in these courses. This is particularly so for concepts that require
visualizing in more than two or three dimensions (e.g., multiple regression
surfaces) or that require theory beyond the mathematical abilities of the
students (e.g., large-sample approximate sampling distributions). By using
modern computing technology, the students will become more actively involved in
the learning of important statistical concepts. The learning experience can be
enhanced by giving students additional statistical experiences by using
combinations of carefully designed and implemented multiple simulations and
high-resolution dynamic graphics to illustrate key ideas.
