This grant will support the renovation and update of the University of Delaware
Bartol Research Institute Computing Facility. This facility is used to support
research in the broad fields of space physics fluid dynamics, and high energy
air showers. The computational speed and capability of the facility will be
upgraded, and graphics visualization applications will be developed. This
activity is supported jointly by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
(`OMA`) and the MPS Division of Physics.
