This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research Training Group in
Genetic Mechanisms of Evolution. The faculty group is a mixture of outstanding
senior and junior investigators who come from a variety of disciplinary
backgrounds, but share a common interest in the study of genetic mechanisms and
their role in the biology and evolution of organisms. The funds will provide
stipends for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, will defray part of the
cost of the trainees' research, will enable undergraduate students to
participate research during the summer, and will allow the trainees to attend
scientific meetings. In addition, funds will be used to purchase specialized
research equipment to be used by trainees, to defray part of the cost of
trainees' research and to bring investigators from other institutions to Eugene
for colloquia. In recent years, genetics has benefitted from the development of
powerful new techniques for genomic analysis. These techniques permit studies of
genetic variability in laboratory and wild animal populations that were
previously impossible. Similarly, they allow relatively facile analysis of
physical traits (phenotypes) that result from the combined action of several
genes. This development has provided an unparalleled opportunity for the study
of the interplay of genetic variation, phenotypic variation and the environment
that occurs during evolution. To take the fullest advantage of this opportunity,
investigators will need a fundamental understanding of the principles and
practices of molecular biology, of population biology and of evolutionary
biology. This award provides funding for a training program that will produce
just such individuals.
