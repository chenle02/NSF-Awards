This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in probability
involves David Mason and Wenbo Li at the University of Delaware, and Paul
Deheuvels and Zhan Shi at the University of Paris VI. The investigators propose
to investigate several problems in the general area of limit theorems in
probability. In particular, they will investigate the sample path properties of
the multivariate Wiener process by studying the multi-fractal behavior of its
increments and obtaining precise estimates of its small probabilities. The
project takes advantage of complementary expertise of the U.S. and French
investigators in Gaussian and Wiener processes and on the path properties of
Brownian and iterated Brownian motion. The proposal will advance fundamental
understanding of limit theorems and their applications to other areas of
probability.
