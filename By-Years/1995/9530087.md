9530087 Duncan Robert Duncan of Oregon State University is supported to
participate in a planned research submersible (R/V Nautile) expedition with
French researchers to sample and analyze samples of the deep crust exposed in
the Beata Escarpment in the Caribbean Sea. Duncan's work will emphasize the
precise dating of samples from the ridge using the Argon-40/Argon-39 technique
in which his lab specializes; he will also analyze samples for rare earth
elements. The objective of Duncan's research is to test a model based primarily
on samples rocks collected on land surrounding the Caribbean that much of the
seafloor underlying the Caribbean was formed very rapidly about 88 million years
ago by a large volcanic outpouring related to the Galapagos mantle plume. In
addition to the specific studies proposed here of samples to be collected by
submersible, the project will assist in identifying precise sites for proposed
deep ocean drilling by the Ocean Drilling Program, an international
collaborative research effort led by NSF using the research drilling vessel
JOIDES Resolution. ***
