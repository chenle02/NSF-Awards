This action funds Angelina Altshuler of University of California, San Diego
(UCSD) to conduct a research project, entitled "Investigating the response of
the blood vessel surface to reduced blood flow," during the summer of 2012 at
National Health Research Institutes in Zhunan, Miaoli County, Taiwan. The host
scientist is Dr. Jeng-Jiann Chiu.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to understand the response of
the endothelial glycocalyx to blood flow reduction in the rat aorta and
consequent endothelial dysfunction. The research uses basic principles in fluid
mechanics and investigates how these principles apply to blood vessels.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
