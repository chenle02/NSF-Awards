The project will improve the undergraduate instrumentation course through the
acquisition of a high field FT-NMR and allow an incorporation of new experiments
into existing and modified course offerings. It will provide students with an
appreciation for modern methods of NMR analysis of materials. Through the
proposed course improvements, the department will be able to provide students
with training in the use and operation of a powerful analytical instrument.
These skills will enhance student preparation for chemical careers and graduate
school.
