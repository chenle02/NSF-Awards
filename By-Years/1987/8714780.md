This award supports cooperative research in hyperfine interactions in molecular
complexes and amorphous films to be carried out by Donald Ellis at Northwestern
University and E. Baggio-Saitovitch at the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas
Fisicas (Center for Physical Studies) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Theoretical
studies of hyperfine interactions in matrix-isolated systems conducted by Ellis
will be in close coordination with experimental work going on in the laboratory
of Baggio-Saitovitch in Rio. Mossbauer spectroscopy will be used to study charge
and spin distributions in nuclei. Experimental determinations will be made of
hyperfine parameters such as isomer shift, quadrupole splitting and nuclear
magnetic field. These studies are of chemical and materials interest. The
investigators in both countries are outstanding and competent scientists. The
subject matter is important as is the collaboration between theory and
experiment. Certainly the Brazilian team will benefit from the expertise of Dr.
Ellis and the Northwestern infrastructure. The Brazilian group has done
outstanding work in Mossbauer studies of matrix-isolated, small particle
chemistry so the U.S. group will benefit from this experience.
