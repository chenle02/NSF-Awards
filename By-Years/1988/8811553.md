The main goal of this research project is a novel integrated systems for stereo
vision such that its overall performance in speed and accuracy exceeds current
capability. The research will involve: (1) design and construction of a new
optical system that enables simultaneous acquisition of many axially-parallaxed
picture frames for subsequent processing, (2) design and implementation of a
method for image analysis that will capitalize on the performance of the optical
block, (3) investigation region matching (a new approach to stereo matching),
(4) integrating the optical block and image analysis system, and (5) evaluation
of the system performance in terms of accuracy and reliability of computer depth
information and speed of processing. The merit of the axial-stereo system will
be verified and presented as an alternative system for stereo vision in various
environments where its advantages can be capitalized upon.
