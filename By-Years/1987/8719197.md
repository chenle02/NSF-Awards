This is a project to produce a phonological analysis of vowel length, tone,
accent, and intonation in Luganda, a Bantu language, and to integrate this
analysis into a theory of how syntax and phonology can interact in the grammar
of a language. The alternative hypotheses of direct syntactic conditioning of
phonological rules versus indirect conditioning mediated by syntactically-
established phonological domains will be considered in a book-length treatment
of Luganda prosody. Luganda is an African language in which tone functions quite
differently from the way it does in better-studied situations such as Japanese.
This project investigates current issues in phonological theory as it applies to
the prosodic nature of language.
