Through this project, a state-of-the-art laboratory in Automatic Data Collection
and Identification (ADCI) is developed and provides training in capabilities,
function, and integration of these technologies into industrial systems. The
demand for trained engineers and technologists to implement such ADCI
technologies as Bar Code, Radio Frequency Identification, Magnetic Stripe,
Machine Vision, and Voice Recognition has exploded in recent years. Familiarity
with bar code standards, symbologies, printing methods, print quality
verification analysis, the design of ADCI databases, the integration of systems
using ADCI to track work-in-process and inventory, and evaluation procedures for
selecting different ADCI technologies will be essential to the graduating
students at the baccalaureate of science level within the next 10 years, since
the usage of these technologies is universal in industry today. Initially, this
laboratory is being utilized to support courses in Mechanical Design and
Manufacturing Problems, Automated Manufacturing, Polymer Process, Statistical
Quality Control, and Manufacturing Planning. Three other courses in Facility
Planning, Automatic Data Collection and Identification, and Senior Project are
planned for addition into the undergraduate technology curriculum.
