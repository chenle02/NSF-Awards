*** 9661065 Trnovsky This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
will explore development of a novel, ultrasensitive in situ hybridization format
for detecting single copy genes in whole cells or nuclei encapsulated in agarose
microdrops. A major goal of this research is to identify genes of interest
present in a small fraction of the cell population without using target
amplification. For single copy gene detection, the technology to be developed
will compete primarily with methods based on target amplification, such as PCR.
Although sensitive, these methods require release of target nucleic acids
because purified templates are necessary for amplifications, making them
unsuitable for cell-associated nucleic acid detection. This method to be
researched will utilize novel chemiluminescent substrates for horseradish
peroxidase in combination with a cooled CCD camera for detecting low light
levels. Because no isolation of DNA is needed for in situ hybridizations, high
signal densities are expected to permit detection of low DNA copy numbers at
different cellular locations. The method can be used for identifying genes
transferred to cellular genomes by in vitro (transfection, gene therapies) or in
vivo (viral infections, transposition) methods and determining the percentage of
cells containing transferred genes. Development of high sensitivity assay
formats for detecting minute amounts of DNA for genomics research and molecular
cytometics will contribute to development of economically important materials.
