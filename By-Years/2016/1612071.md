The international conference on Perspectives in Topology and Geometry of
4-manifolds will be held June 5--10, 2016 at the Inter University Centre in
Dubrovnik, Croatia. This conference will bring together leading researchers and
emerging mathematicians in 4-dimensional topology and geometry from around the
world, with the aims of providing directions for future research on open
problems in the subject and introducing younger mathematicians to the field. NSF
funds will be used to defray travel and lodging expenses for participants based
in the US, with priority for invited speakers, and for junior mathematicians
without other sources of funding. The conference will have an impact in
fostering communication and collaboration between topologists at various career
stages, providing perspective and new research directions for young
mathematicians.

Modern 4-manifold theory can be said to have begun in the early 1980s with the
work of Donaldson applying gauge theory. Since 2000, the attention of many low-
dimensional topologists has shifted to dimension 3, where Floer-theoretic
invariants have allowed remarkable progress. However, some of the most striking
applications of these invariants of 3-manifolds, and from a certain point of
view the philosophical motivation for the invariants themselves, relate to
4-manifolds either directly or through the techniques involved. Moreover, there
are a number of fundamental unsolved problems in 4-manifold theory that may
yield to new ideas rooted in Floer theory. The conference will serve the dual
function of publicizing the newest ideas and approaches to these unsolved
problems, and of introducing a younger generation to 4-manifold theory. With
participation by some of the preeminent leaders in the field as well as many
talented younger mathematicians, the organizers hope that this conference will
touch off new activity and progress in 4-manifold topology. As a part of the
conference we also plan to celebrate the work of Ron Fintushel and Ron Stern
which has been very influential in the development of the field. The organizers
will edit and publish a volume of proceedings associated with this conference,
with contributions from many of the speakers. The centerpiece of the volume will
be a section devoted to open problems in 4-manifold topology based on problem
sessions run during the conference by Rob Kirby, Ron Fintushel and Ron Stern.
