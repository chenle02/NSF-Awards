This two-year award supports U.S.-Sweden cooperative research in computer and
computation theory between Andrzej Proskurowski of the University of Oregon and
Stefan Arnborg of the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. The
principal objective of this project is the development of efficient algorithms
for hard optimization problems restricted to partial k- trees. The class of
partial k-trees includes most of the important families of graphs with an
underlying tree structure. This research focuses on the practical aspects of
recognizing partial k-trees and finding tree representations. Dr. Proskurowski
brings to this collaboration his expertise in algorithmic graph theory. This is
complemented by Dr. Arnborg's background in logic. They propose to address
deficiencies in current graph theory through their work on a graph reduction
system, including implementation of related algorithms, and by establishing
algorithms for obstruction sets. They will also investigate the streamlining of
algorithms in solving distance-related discrete optimization problems. Their
combined and complementary expertise and efforts could lead to new, fast,
practical algorithms for difficult optimization problems.
