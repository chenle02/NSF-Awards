The object of this research is the meteorological interpretation of the
observed electrical structure (electric field) of several mesoscale convective
systems which occurred in Oklahoma in 1991. Cognate meteorological observations,
including airborne radar and cloud physics, were also made by two research
aircraft. Particular emphasis will be devoted to the electrical structure, and
its meteorological origin, of regions of stratiform clouds and "bow (radar)
echoes".
