This proposal is to study regulation of gene expression by interaction with
transcription factor proteins which bind certain specific sequence elements in
the DNA. Two classes of transcription factors have been described: AP1 and CREB.
In order to bind DNA, the proteins must first dimerize. One of the AP1 proteins,
cJUN, can form homodimers and respond to the TRE sequence element, or can form
heterodimers with any of three CREB proteins and bind to the CRE sequence
element. Each of these complexes has a unique trans- activation potential. All
potential dimer complexes will be trans- lated from cDNA clones in reticulocyte
lysates, and binding to oligonucleotides of known sequence will be determined by
gel retardation analysis. Constructs of a plasmid containing the reporter gene
luciferase coupled to the various oligonucleotides will be used to determine
transactivation potential at various points in the cell cycle. %%% This proposal
is to study proteins which enhance and promote the transcription of DNA, the
genetic material. Two kinds of proteins (a total of four) will be used. The
proteins contain two interesting structural features: DNA binding regions and
"leucine zippers", which allow the proteins to form pairs of identical or
different proteins. Each dimer binds to a unique sequence in DNA; the sequences
will be determined and compared. The importance of the stage of the cell cycle
for one type of dimer or another will be determined using luciferase from
firefly tails as a reporter molecule.
