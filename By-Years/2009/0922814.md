0922814 &lt;br/&gt;McRoberts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this grant will support the acquisition
of a powder x-ray diffractometer (XRD) to facilitate research and research
training in the Departments of Geology and Chemistry at the State University of
New York at Cortland (SUNY-Cortland). The XRD will be used for phase
identification of clay minerals in Mesozoic Paleoclimate studies and
crystallographic characterization of novel metal-organic compounds. Two Co-I?s
(Collins and Downey) are both early career scientists and new investigators to
the NSF proposal process. The XRD will fill a gap in the analytical
infrastructure at SUNY-Cortland, an institution that currently ranks in the top
nine institutions in the U.S. that produce the largest numbers of K-12 teachers.
Students exposed to modern methods of materials characterization and imparted
with an understanding of data interpretation, potential error sources and
analysis technique limitations are well prepared to disseminate a healthy
understanding of the scientific process in our nation?s school systems.
