The Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) has recovered an ice core from central
Greenland covering a time that extends at least 100,000 years before present.
The high accumulation rate at the site makes it an ideal record for studying
climate mechanisms and variability. The electrical conductivity, which is a
function of the acid/base balance of the ice, has been measured continuously
along the core and provides the highest time resolution of the many measurements
which have been made on the core. The existing conductivity record will be
interpreted in conjunction with other records. Specific goals are; 1)
Investigation of decadal and century scale climate change, 2) Develop a
chronology of volcanic activity record in the GISP2 core, 3) Improve the
understanding of ice flow in the Summit region, 4) Improve the dating and
accumulation record of the GISP2 core, and 5) Develop a chronology of northern
hemisphere biomass burning as recorded by the GISP2 core. The GISP2 is a
component of the NSF Arctic System Science Program.
