This proposal is for a provisional allocation of time on the Blue Waters
computer system, due to become operational in 2011, and for travel funds to
support technical coordination with the Blue Waters project
team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use Blue Waters to make numerical
simulations of galaxy formation and the evolution of the universe, based on
fundamental physics, that (a) will be tested against a suite of cosmological
data-sets from new ground and space based, (b) will be used as a training set to
define the parameters of the next generation of very large cosmological
observational experiments. Two different ab initio cosmological simulation codes
will be used, Enzo and a new code, Hydro Tree Particle Mesh (HTPM), that adds
smooth particle hydrodynamics to an existing tree particle mesh
code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simulation output will be used to study galaxies
with stellar masses M_&amp;#8902; &gt; 10^9 M_Solar, computing star formation
and mass assembly history, quantifying luminosity functions and colors in
various bands at z = 0 &amp;#8722; 10, constructing light-cone data using the
simulation output, computing galaxy number counts, and providing detailed
predictions of galaxy clustering and its evolution as functions of luminosity,
color and environment. The purpose of this is to determine when and how galaxies
form, and how they evolved in the early universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will include undergraduate and graduate researchers, and will produce
spectacular visualizations that will be used for public outreach and education
in cosmology.&lt;br/&gt;
