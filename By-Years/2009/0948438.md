This grants supports an upgrade of the computer facilities now maintained by the
Alliance for Computational Earth Science (ACES) at MIT. ACES manages cluster
computing resources for three academic departments spanning two schools at MIT.
Approximately 1/3 of the processors are in the geophysics subcluster, ACES-GEO.
ACES-GEO Pis will purchase a pre-assembled cluster machine from THINKMATE which
would include a controlling node, at least 11 compute nodes and a switch unit.
Node configurations will include multi Quad-core Intel CPU, massive RAM and
storage capacities. The new cluster will support computationally intensive PI
and student research involving geodynamical modeling of Earth and Planetary
interiors, geodetic data analysis, cryosphere dynamical modeling, seismic
imaging and interpretation, land form evolution, and inversion of remnant
magnetization. The cluster will support the computational needs of four
assistant professors, two of whom are women.
