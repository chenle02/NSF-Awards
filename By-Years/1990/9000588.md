This project will study propagation of waves in one, two, and three dimensional
excitable media, with emphasis on the cardiac conduction system and Belousov-
Zhabotinski reagent. The emphasis of the study is on understanding the dynamics
of spatial patterns, especially the formation and evolution of spiral and scroll
waves. The study will involve the construction of mathematical models describing
the dynamics of patterns of propagating waves, the mathematical analysis of the
model equations, and the comparison of the mathematical results with available
experimental evidence.
