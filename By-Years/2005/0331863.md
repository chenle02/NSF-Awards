Studies of Selected Cambrian and Precambrian Fossils

Ellis L. Yochelson (EAR-0331863)

PI plans a three-part SGER research project. These include a (1) restudy of
Berkey's 1898 Taylor Falls Mollusca fauna; (2) Investigations of hyseloconid
Mollusca; and (3) Evaluation of "Horodyskia" in the evolution of Proterozoic
life. Subprojects 1 and 2 will complete research currently underway and the 3rd
subproject relates to some Proterozoic trace fossils found in Australia and
Montana that may provide strong evidence of the earliest higher eukaryotes. If
correct this would set back by 700 m.y. the earliest known direct evidence of
animals.
