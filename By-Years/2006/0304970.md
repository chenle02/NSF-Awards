ABSTRACT

This proposal presents problems in spectral theory of non-self-adjoint
differential operators in the semi-classical regime. The proposer seeks precise
estimates on the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of small perturbations
of self-adjoint operators on compact domains in several settings. In closely
related projects he plans to apply recently developed techniques to the problem
of finding asymptotics (counting functions) for the scattering poles associated
with convex obstacles and the barrier top resonances for Schroedinger operators.

This work studies the propagation of waves in settings where some form of
dissipation or the possibility of propagation to infinity gives rise to waves
which decay to zero as time increases. The rates of decay and frequency of these
decaying modes are encoded in sequences of complex eigenvalues or resonances
associated with these problems. Studying the behavior of these sequences can
lead to better understanding of the relation between rates of decay and the
underlying structure of the system. Such information has potential application
in determining the interior structure of objects from their resonant frequencies
in nondestructive testing.
