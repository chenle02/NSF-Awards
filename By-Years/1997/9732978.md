9732978 Jacko This research seeks solutions to the technical challenges of
designing computer interfaces for user populations possessing diverse visual
capabilities. The theoretical contribution of the research will be an empirical
link between clinical and functional assessments of human vision and the
behaviors and strategies exhibited by partially sighted computer users while
performing tasks requiring use of graphical user interfaces. The practical
contribution of the research will be the identification of more systematic
approaches to matching users with software and hardware combinations that will
accommodate individual users' visual profiles. This research will be integrated
into undergraduate courses in industrial engineering and computer science, and
will enhance the development of new graduate courses in industrial engineering
that center upon the design of advanced technologies for people who are visually
challenged. ***
