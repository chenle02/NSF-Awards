The purpose of this research is to advance the theory and application of
stochastic dynamic prediction (SDP). SDP equations predict the mean and other
statistical properties of an infinite ensemble of points in phase space. Current
deterministic prediction models provide forecasts of the future state of the
atmosphere, but these forecasts are less than perfect due to uncertainties in
the initial conditions and in the model dynamics. Ideally, one also would like
to be able to estimate the quality of the forecast. SDP may provide a way to do
so. The benefits are obvious. The feasibility is uncertain due to the magnitude
of the computations involved and the complexity of the physics of the
atmosphere. The PI plans to explore certain aspects of the problem using several
promising approaches developed by himself and Dr. Philip Thompson of the
National Center for Atmospheric Research. The results of this research have
potential application in a wide variety of fields involving fluid motions.
