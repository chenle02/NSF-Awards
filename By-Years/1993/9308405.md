9308405, PI-Lohmann: This research addresses two problems commonly associated
with collective action. First, political outcomes tend to be biased in favor of
small, well-organized groups and against large, diffuse groups. As an
explanation, it is often argued that smaller groups are more successful in
overcoming the free rider problem of collective action. Second, collective
action may undermine the credibility of particular regulatory policies. Firms
may have disincentives to commit resources when they anticipate that the
regulatory environment may change in response to interest groups and public
pressures. To date the analysis of these two problems is based on reduced-form
models of political participation and decision-making. This project will employ
game theoretical techniques to explicitly derive people's incentives to become
organized and policymakers' incentives to respond to their pressures. This work
will identify the factors affecting the efficiency of political outcomes and the
tradeoffs inherent in the political design of regulatory policy.
