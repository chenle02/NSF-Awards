Objective of this study is to determine the magnitude of temporal and spatial
variations in the flux of ectraterrestrial Osmium in pelagic clays over the
reatively constant background levels. Coupled study of excess 230-Th and Os in
recent pelagic clays will allow the determination of present day flux of Os in a
site in N. Pacific. The study will test if Os can be used as a tracer for
calculating precise sedimentation rates and as a geochronologic tool.
