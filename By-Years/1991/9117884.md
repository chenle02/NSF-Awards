This award provides 53% funding for the acquisition of an internally-heated
pressure vessel capable of maintaining pressures up to 0.1 GPa (10 Kbars) and
temperatures up to 1400K simultaneously. The pressure system is to be installed
and operated in the Fluids Research Laboratory in the Department of Geological
Sciences at Virginia Institute of Technology and State University. The equipment
will be used primarily in research on the properties of geologically relevant
fluids under the ambient conditions in the Earth's crust. Present work in the
Fluids Research Laboratory is focussed on water and carbon dioxide fluid
mixtures with dissolved chloride salts, their behavior when trapped in fluid
inclusions in minerals, and their use in the reconstruction of geological
conditions at the time of fluid inclusion formation.
