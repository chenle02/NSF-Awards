Fundamental issues in large-grained parallel/distributed symbolic mathematical
computation shall be explored. The overall goal is the effective parallelization
of symbolic algebra in a variety of parallel architectures. For this, a version
of the Maple system using C/Linda shall be employed as will a small-grain
parallel version of the SAC2 algebra system. The final system and library shall
be put in distributable form for researchers interested in parallel symbolic
mathematical computation.
