Current performance and reliability modeling techniques and tools are seen to
be, by themselves, largely inadequate for obtaining realistic predictions of the
behavior of very large scale electronics systems. Numerous authors have
experienced difficulties with tractability of large scale models, and have
resorted to a variety of specialized, ad hoc techniques. The focus of this
project is the development of a high-level formalism (language) for the
specification, composition, decomposition, and solution of large scale
performance and reliability models. It is expected that this formalism for model
composition will aid the modeler in assembling models of these large scale
systems and in understanding the errors as well as the gain in efficiency
achieved by alternative model composition structures. An automated model
pipefitting system is expected to emerge.
