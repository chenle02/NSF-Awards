Activated carbon is used in many drinking water treatment plants and home water
filters for the removal of unwanted dissolved compounds. Superfine powdered
activated carbon (S-PAC) is a new material that has a much smaller particle size
than traditional activated carbon. Due of its small size, S-PAC can remove
contaminants faster and with less mass, but since S-PAC particles are very small
they must be removed by membrane filtration before treated water is distributed.
This filtration is not easy because S-PAC can block the membrane pores,
negatively affecting the filter performance. One way around this might be to
create larger particles through aggregation of S-PAC before it reaches the
membranes. This study will evaluate various S-PAC aggregation techniques within
a ceramic membrane filtration module for enhancing filter performance. This
research will be carried out in collaboration with Dr. Matsui, an expert in
combining S-PAC with ceramic membranes for contaminant removal, at Hokkaido
University in Japan.

In previous work, S-PAC particles caused marked membrane pore blocking on 0.1 Âµm
polymer-based membranes in dead-end filtration. Aggregation with chemical
coagulation was shown to be successful at reducing the problem. This research
will evaluate whether the results are similar with ceramic membranes instead of
polymer ones. A ceramic membrane module will be operated with aggregated and
disaggregated S-PAC to test the filter performance and compare with previous
results. Additionally, the effects of natural organic matter (NOM) will be
evaluated. Results of this study will contribute towards the understanding of
S-PAC behavior and potential future applications for removal of trace
contaminants in drinking water treatment. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in
collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.
