ABSTRACT

OCE-0219651

A PI from Oregon State University plans to test the hypothesis that during
authigenic uptake Mo isotopes are fractionated with the lighter isotopes being
preferentially taken up relative to the heavy isotopes leaving behind a residual
(dissolved) Mo pool that is isotopically heavy relative to seawater. To prove
the hypothesis, the PI will analyze existing near surface (top 20 cm) porewater
and sediment samples from the Peru/Chile margin and the California margin for
98Mo and 95Mo to assess the early diagenetic behavior of Mo. In addition, a
cruise is planned to the Santa Barbara Basin, CA, to collect and analyze deeper
sediment and porewater samples from a region where sediments are exposed to
continuously changing redox conditions. Results from these samples will
determine under what conditions molybdenum isotopes fractionate and whether this
fractionation is preserved in the sedimentary record. This information will help
determine whether this isotope can be used as a proxy for identifying reducing
conditions in sediments.
