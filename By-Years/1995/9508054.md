9508054 Heinz Under the direction of the PI, the University of Chicago will
acquire a neodymium-yttrium lanthanum fluoride (Nd-YLF) and C02 lasers,
associated stabilization equipment, new diamond anvil cells and a high pressure
gas loading apparatus. This equipment will both modernize and add many necessary
improvements to the diamond anvil laboratory at the University for research in
high temperature, high pressure mineral physics. The PI's research focuses on
the accurate measurement of melting curves for mantle and core minerals so as to
constrain the maximum temperature of the lower mantle and the temperature of the
inner-outer core boundary, a fundamental problem in the earth sciences. In
particular, the acquisition of a stable high power Nd-YLF laser will enable
detection of the enthalpy of fusion for Earth materials in the laser-heated
diamond anvils. The acquisition of the CO2 laser will enable this laboratory to
make melting measurements with bmth types of laser for intra and inter-
laboratory comparisons with the goal of resolving these differences. Since the
lasers couple with solids in different ways, the types of materials that can be
studied is greatly increased by having both types of lasers. Finally, due to the
stability of the new lasers, it will be possible to interface with the
synchrotron source currently being commissioned at the Consortium for Advanced
Radiation Sources (CARS) sector of the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne
National Laboratory. ***
