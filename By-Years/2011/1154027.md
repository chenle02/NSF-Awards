The TiPi: Engineering and Engineering Transfer Pipeline Project is using
scholarship support to recruit, retain and graduate 75 Engineering and
Engineering Technology students. The financially needed, talented scholarship
awardees will transfer from two-year schools into the third year at Rochester
Institute of Technology. The students will be enrolled full-time in the
Engineering and Engineering Technology Bachelor degree programs. The scholarship
funds are supplemented by institutional financial aid intended to ensure the
scholars graduate on time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scholar program builds on a
well-established infrastructure of student support and intervention. The scholar
support mechanisms identify scholars in academic jeopardy and proactively
intervene on their behalf. The project's proactive student support programs
could become a national model for assisting similar transfers into private
institutions. The project uses co-op experiences designed to increase the
probability of career success thereby impacting the scholars for a lifetime.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Periodic program assessment includes quantitative data
such as grade point average and co-op salaries and qualitative data from surveys
of scholars, faculty and employers.
