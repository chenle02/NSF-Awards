Image quality degradation is inevitable in various scientific and engineering
applications such as biomedical/astronomical imaging and error-prone image
communications. Physics-based solutions to fight against those adversary factors
(e.g., sensor noise, optical blur and channel errors) are often too expensive;
therefore it is highly desirable to develop computational alternatives to
salvage those degraded images. Computationally efficient and high-quality image
restoration algorithms could find a wide range of applications from energy-
efficient sensing to more-affordable healthcare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research contains two components. First is to characterize both nonlocal
invariance and local variation of images in a principled fashion. A new
framework called Bayesian structured sparse coding will be developed to unify
and extend several existing classes of models (e.g., wavelet-based and patch-
based) for natural images. Second, the new theoretical framework will facilitate
the invention of computationally efficient inference algorithms for image
restoration applications. The ultimate objective along this line of research is
to make the developed Bayesian image restoration algorithms not only
theoretically optimal but also practically feasible.
