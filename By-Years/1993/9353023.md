9353023 Abernethy Furman University will initiate a four-week summer residential
Young Scholars project in computer science for twenty-seven students entering
grades 11 and 12. Topics such as neural networks, image processing, algorithm
complexity and shortest network problems will be explored using lectures,
videos, bibliographic materials and laboratory work. Program instructors and
undergraduate lab assistants will work with small groups of research teams
consisting of four or five participants.students will present their results at a
closing day ceremony. Ethics of science will be observed using the case study
method. Career activities will include field trips to local computing sites and
a "shadowing the professional" activity at local job sites. Follow up activities
including two one day conferences and presentations by participants on their
academic year research activities conclude the program. ***
