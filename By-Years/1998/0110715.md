Abstract:

This project analyzes the partitioning of the eye field in the Drosophila
embryo. The eye field in the anterior neural plate of vertebrates and the head
of the Drosophila embryo exhibit a high degree of similarity regarding the fate
map of the visual system, and the signaling pathways controlling this fatemap.
Drosophila counterparts of Shh (Hh), BMB4 (Dpp) and EGF, as well as Pax6, Six6
and many other regulatory genes all function in the Drosophila embryonic head.
Preliminary data show that Dpp is secreted in the dorsal midline and forms a
dorso-ventral gradient that specifies the different domains within the eye
field. Dpp is then down-regulated in the eye field, except for its posterior
boundary from where it may form a posterior-anterior gradient that partitions
the visual primordium into larval and adult eye, and optic lobe. Hh is secreted
at the lateral boundary of the eye field and may form a gradient that
antagonizes the early Dpp gradient. Dr. Hartenstein and his research group will
address the topology and morphogenesis of the Drosophila eye field and test
their models of Dpp and Hh function in partitioning the eye field. The first aim
is to reconstruct the details of the fate map, and to investigate the
morphogenesis of the visual system. The second aim addresses the function of dpp
in the eye field by investigating the dpp loss of function, heterotopic and
heterochronic expression of dpp, activated Dpp receptor, and dominant negative
Dpp receptor. In the third aim Dr. Hartenstein will analyze the role of Hh and
its interaction with Dpp. The hypothesis will be tested that Hh negatively
interacts with Dpp function. This would represent an interesting parallel to the
vertebrate neural tube where ventral release of Shh also antagonizes BMPs
secreted from dorsal tissue. By generating Dpp:hh double mutants and expressing
mutant constructs the interaction of these genes in the embryonic head will be
tested. In aim four Dr. Hartenstein will address the control of Dpp activity in
the embryonic head. By establishing specific differences and similarities
between early eye patterning in Drosophila and vertebrates, Dr. Hartenstein
anticipates to furnish relevant information that helps interpreting Shh and BMP
function in neural fate determination and to provide important insights in the
evolution of the brain.
