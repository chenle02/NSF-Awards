The University of the Sacred Heart will initiate a five-week,
multidisciplinary, residential, Young Scholars project for 15 students entering
grades 9,10,11,12, followed by a school year follow-up component for students
from Puerto Rico's public and private school system. Students are selected to
participate through a carefully designed screening procedure, with an emphasis
to be placed on participation by women and the disabled. The project's focus is
interdisciplinary and stresses the development of basic investigation and
research skills. Through lectures on scientific issues and contact with
different specialists, participants are presented with a broad spectrum of
science and mathematics careers from which to choose, and are encouraged to make
a career selection or to establish a career goal. Project design is highly
motivational and challenging, seeking to capitalize to a maximum on
participants' demonstrated interest and high potential in science and math
disciplines.
