This research involves a field experiment that will determine the impact of
helminth parasitism on a cyclic snowshoe hare population during its first 2
years of decline from peak abundance. The overwinter food shortage and intense
predation that typically occur at this stage of the hare cycle, together with
major demographic changes, provide a unique opportunity to test hypotheses about
parasitism's interaction with malnutrition and predation. The field experiment
entails a 2 x 2 factoral design with three replicates. Each replicate consists
of food-added and food-normal treatments within which the demographic attributes
(survival, reproduction, movements, etc.) of parasite-free and parasite-normal
cohorts will be monitored through radio telemetry. Pilot studies have
demonstrated our ability to purge gastrointestinal helminths and lungworms from
snowshoe hares in the wild and to assess proximate cause of death of radio-
collard hares. The project will test long-standing theory or factors controlling
population aples in vertebrate species.
