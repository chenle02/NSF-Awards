Chemical processing systems are inherently non-linear. These systems include
units such as polymerization reactors, high purity distillation columns, etc.
Control schemes presently in use are designed by obtaining an approximate linear
model, valid around an operating steady state, and applying linear control
techniques. For processes that do not operate around a steady state, for example
batch processes, approximate linearization along a nominal time-varying path
results in a linear system with time-varying parameter are used. With increasing
demand for high product quality (for high value added chemicals, for example),
increasing energy costs and enviromental concerns, and, decreasing cost of
implementing advanced control systems (with more sophisticated lower cost
computers), the use of complex nonlinear control systems is becoming viable. The
goal of this research project is to develop a new method for analyzing the
behavior of nonlinear processes and to synthesize stable robust nonlinear
control schemes for such systems. Specifically the PI's focus is to: 1. Develop
a theoretical framework so that the properties and underlying structure of a
nonlinear system become clear and well understood. In this direction, results
from differential geometric systems theory will be revisited from an engineering
viewpoint and solutions to other theoretical problems will be pursued. 2.
Synthesize general control algorithms. 3. Develop software tools so that the
implementation of the above algorithms becomes straightforward. 4.
Experimentally apply the resultant algorithm to a polymerization reactor and
thus evaluate the performance of the control schemes.
