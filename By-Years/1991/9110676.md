The ability of the retina to regenerate in amphibians, teleosts and embryonic
chicks is a particularly striking example of central nervous system repair
following traumatic damage. In chick, the source of new retinal neural precursor
cells in the regenerative process has been identified as the retinal pigmented
epithelium. However, with increasing development the pigmented epithelium of the
chick embryo loses its ability to generate neuronal cells. To study molecular
mechanisms underlying this transdifferentiation and loss of regenerative
capacity, the embryonic chick pigmented epithelium will be studied in a tissue
culture system. The role of the extracellular matrix molecules, laminin and
basic fibroblast growth factor, on transdifferentiation will be studied.
Neuronal cells will be identified with antibodies to neuron specific markers. In
addition, the polymerase chain reaction will be used to determine whether the
GAP-43 or neurofilament genes are expressed. It also will be determined whether
pigmented epithelium loses its regenerative capacity in the in vitro system. In
addition, the expression of neuronal phenotype will be studied in relation to
the expression of two chick genes that are homologous to the neural
determination genes of the achaete scute complexes that play a role in neural
determination in the fruit fly. These studies have the potential for identifying
genes that play a role in the determination, as well as the regeneration, of
retina.
