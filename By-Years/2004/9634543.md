The objective of this work is to provide a capability of obtaining a
significantly increased resolution for abnormal foci (tumors and knots) in
cellular biological tissues by ultrasonic detection. An ultrasonic transducer
array with special electroding is to be designed, tested and its operation
evaluated. This work will look at the electrode patterns and the measurement of
the actual beam characteristics using a biological phantom. Electronic circuitry
will be developed for increased sensitivity in data acquisition and detection.
