Oxygen Diffusion Characterization of Fiber Reinforced
Polymers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Investigator: Rajan Sen sen@eng.usf.edu
(Principal Investigator)&lt;br/&gt; Venkat R. Bhethanabotla (Co-Principal
Investigator)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Externally bonded fiber reinforced
polymers (FRP) are widely used for the repair and rehabilitation of concrete
structures. As the FRP material is bonded to the concrete surface, it
automatically acts as a barrier to deleterious materials that can cause
reinforcing steel to corrode. This study will undertake experimental and
theoretical investigations to characterize FRP micro-structure relating to
oxygen ingress, a parameter that is critically important for sustaining
electrochemical corrosion of steel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this
research are to: (1) conduct diffusion tests to establish the role of fiber
architecture in preventing oxygen ingress; (2) conduct limited corroborative
diffusion tests on concrete specimens; (3) conduct a detailed investigation of
the fiber-matrix interface and (4) develop appropriate numerical models to
extend the findings from the experimental studies. Results are expected to
provide information on fiber architecture that is most effective for repairing
corrosion-damaged concrete structures. &lt;br/&gt;
