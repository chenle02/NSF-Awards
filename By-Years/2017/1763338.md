The Riemann Hypothesis is a celebrated unsolved problem in pure mathematics that
dates back to 1859. Its motivation is to find a precise count for the number of
prime numbers up to a large quantity. In modern times the Riemann Hypothesis is
recognized as one of a host of similar problems about the underlying structure
of nearly every counting problem that arises in number theory. In order to
stimulate progress on this problem a three-and-a-half day conference will be
held at the University of Bristol June 4 - 7, 2018 for up to 140 participants.
There will be about 15 lectures during the meeting and there will be time
scheduled for discussion of promising avenues. It is important that U.S. based
researchers attend this meeting; especially recent PhD recipients and
researchers from under-represented groups are encouraged to apply to attend.
This award will help support that particular effort. &lt;br/&gt;The website for
the conference
is&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;https://heilbronn.ac.uk/2017/08/08/perspectives-on-the-
riemann-hypothesis/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is believed that the analogue of the
Riemann Hypothesis should hold for every L-function in the Selberg Class, or
equivalently for every cuspidal automorphic L-function of a certain type. There
are literally dozens of approaches that have been tried. An expected outcome of
this meeting is that various approaches with similarities will be grouped
together in order to better assess their viability. In this way the focus will
be narrowed to a few of the more promising avenues.
