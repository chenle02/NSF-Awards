The objectives of this research are to develop a better understanding of
reinforced soil at failure; and to develop a new modeling technique of
reinforced soil mass and design techniques of reinforced soil structures.
Homogenization techniques will be applied to reinforced soil to produce an
"equivalent anisotropic continuum." An alternative approach where reinforced
soil is considered as a two-component system (applicable to sparsely reinforced
soils) will also be considered. Experimental verification on reinforced soil
samples in a standard triaxial test apparatus are planned. Anisotropy of failure
criteria, dilatancy characteristics, and failure modes will be investigated.
