Worldwide, there is great and justifiable concern about global climate and
environmental change; in the United States there is also justifiable concern
over lack of science literacy. Both issues will be addressed through the
development of this curriculum. Materials will be developed for a course in
earth systems science for upper-level high school students. Logistically,
curriculum materials will build on the sophisticated, low-cost, monitoring
technology already developed by TERC. Conceptually, these materials will use a
constructivist approach (hands-on, active learning, including real research) to
illustrate the principles of systems and classical ecology. The curriculum will
address several important concerns in science education, and will empower
students to understand the dynamic and interactive nature of ecosystems. The
modules will be earth-science/ecologically oriented, integrated with several
other sciences, and developed for the upper high school level student. The
materials are designed to be integrated into existing curricula.
