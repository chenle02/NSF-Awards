This research is intended to provide new connections between two areas of
mathematics, probability and functional analysis. One of the main objects of
investigation is a random matrix, a large rectangular array of random data. The
Principal Investigator strives to understand the properties of such arrays which
hold with high probability and the dependence of those properties on the nature
of random entries and the structure of the matrix. This study will have
potential applications beyond the realm of pure mathematics, as random matrices
are used in statistics, computer algorithms, and wireless communication. A
special emphasis will be placed on the study of sparse matrices as these
matrices naturally appear in signal reconstruction and big data analysis.
Another direction of the research is the study of random graphs, which are
random networks of nodes connected by roads (edges). Besides representing real
transportation networks, graphs can be used to model interaction of atoms in a
material, internet communities, etc. The project provides research training
opportunities for graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main direction of
this research is the non-asymptotic theory of random matrices, a new and rapidly
developing area of research analyzing spectral characteristics of a random
matrix of a large but fixed size and striving to obtain bounds valid with high
probability. The Principal Investigator intends to study singular values,
eigenvalues, and eigenvectors of different ensembles of random matrices of a
large size. The results obtained in this direction would have important
applications within the random matrix theory in proving limit laws for the
spectral characteristics of random matrices. Another area of study will be the
geometric properties of such matrices considered as linear operators between
certain normed spaces. Such results can find applications in computer science
and signal reconstruction where random matrices are widely used for signal
encoding and decoding. Another part of this research will address the problems
arising in geometry of random graphs. The Principal Investigator will also
concentrate on studying the process of growth of random graphs by analyzing the
evolution of corresponding random matrices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
