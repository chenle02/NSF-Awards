Lessons already learned under an existing award (NCR9527664) entitled "Wireless
Field Test Project" will be applied to implement wireless communications between
the Internet node and seven research institutions in Mongolia's capital,
Ulaanbaatar. The wireless links are needed to support U.S.-Mongolian research
collaborations because the legacy Soviet era telephone infrastructure in
Ulaanbaatar is not adequate for supporting the needed Internet applications. In
addition to providing needed Internet connectivity between U.S. and Mongolian
researchers, this project will test the wireless systems in a harsher physical
environment than is experienced in the current NSF wireless project. It will
also test the ability of a technically competent, but culturally and physically
remote local team to maintain and operate the equipment. This will provide
valuable insight for future Internet extensions to other remote areas that have
priority for U.S. research activities.
