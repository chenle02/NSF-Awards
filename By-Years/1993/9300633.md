9300633 GOPAL A form of non-programmed adaptive information processing called
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) provides an alternative means for performing
complicated and creative tasks like pattern classification and completion as
well as image and speech recognition. ANNs are inherently parallel in structure,
they distribute knowledge throughout the system rather than concentrating it in
specific locations, and they are fault- tolerant, learning from and making
decisions based on incomplete, noisy, or imprecise information. Because of these
characteristics, ANNs offer great potential for future use in processing of
geographic information, but that potential has not been widely explored by
geographers and regional scientists. Working with an Austrian collaborator, an
American geographer will explore a number of potential uses for ANNs in
geographic research. Attention in this project will focus on applications to the
study of spatial interaction. Application-dependent neural spatial interaction
predictors will be designed, implemented, and tested, as will unsupervised ANN-
based interaction pattern detectors. ANN approaches to these problems will be
compared with traditional statistical approaches through empirical testing with
data on Austrian inter-regional telephone calls. This project constitutes an
exploratory look into the potential for using ANN approaches in the analysis of
geographical patterns and processes. By focusing on spatial interaction, the
investigators will explore new analytical perspectives on an important topic for
which conventional approaches are well established. Regardless of the outcomes
of these comparisons, scientists in geography, regional science, computer
science, and related fields will benefit from this research on an innovative new
approach to problem solving. ***
