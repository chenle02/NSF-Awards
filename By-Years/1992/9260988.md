Language is the binding force of a nation and has served as the communication
tool for its people. The diversification of languages among various nations in
the world has created the language barrier which is one of the major causes for
today's world disorder. Machine translation holds the key to solve the language
barrier problem. We consider Chinese-to-English translation by computer because
Chinese and English are certainly two of the most popular languages in the
world. In this proposal we are concerned with an important aspect in Chinese-to-
English by computer. After eight years of research, Julius T. Tou invented the
CITAC computer for translating Chinese sentences and text into idiomatic
English. CITAC (patent pending in US, PRC, UK), the world's first genuine
Chinese translation machine, is an intelligent computer. However, due to the
radical differences between the Chinese language and the English language, the
English translation generated by CITAC is idiomatically correct but may be
grammatically wrong for reasons to be explained in the proposal. To make the
CITAC output of English grammatically correct, we propose to conduct research
for the design of a self-correction scheme for English grammar improvement. When
the propose research is completed, we anticipate that CITAC will become a full-
fledged computer to translate Chinese sentences and text into perfect English.
Thus, the potential application of the research are to make Chinese-to-English
machine translation a reality, not just and academic endeavor. The success of
the proposed research will beat the Japanese in machine translation research and
will enable the United State to rule the roost in machine translation
industry.//
