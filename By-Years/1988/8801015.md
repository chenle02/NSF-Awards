Astragalus (loco weed) is the largest genus of flowering plants in the world
and is especially well represented in western North America, where there are
over 400 species. Nevertheless, its species have rarely been the subject of a
biosystematic study. Nine closely related annual members of the genus, native to
Arizona, California, and Nevada, have been chosen as an appropriate group for
such a study. The extent of morphological divergence in the fruits and flowers
of these plants, reflected in their previous assignment to three different
genera, is quite remarkable. The objective of the proposed research is to
examine the evolutionary processes which have brought about and preserved this
diversity. Specifically, this study will 1) clarify phylogenetic relationships
among the members of the study group based on anatomical, cytological, and
genetic data, and 2) use data derived from the analysis of genetic variation to
evaluate breeding systems, speciation processes, and levels of divergence in the
group.
