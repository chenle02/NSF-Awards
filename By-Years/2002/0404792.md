&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research involves the total synthesis of the
structurally unique polycyclic marine bryozoan alkaloids of the
chartelline/chartelamides/securamine group. A strong emphasis will be placed on
developing innovative and practical methods of organic synthesis which will be
of use to chemists in both academia and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this
award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Steven M. Weinreb in the Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania
State University. Professor Weinreb will focus his work on development of
methodology and new strategies for the synthesis of heterocycles and
heterocyclic marine natural products. The work has great potential for broader
impact in the pharmaceutical industry and the project serves as an excellent
venue for the training of graduate students and postdoctorals. &lt;br/&gt;
