This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S. participants in
the "Workshop in Partial Differential Equations and Several Complex Variables"
that will be held August 5-9, 2013, in Serra Negra, Brazil.

This event will focus on recent developments that have occurred at the
crossroads of two important areas of mathematical analysis, namely, partial
differential equations and several complex variables, areas in which the
Brazilian mathematical community is well represented. The centerpieces of the
workshop are two mini-courses directed at graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s:
one by Irina Mitrea of Temple University on topics related to the geometry of
real-analytic submanifolds of complex spaces, and the other by Bernhard Lamel of
the University of Vienna dealing with the interplay of several complex variables
with harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory. The conference program
provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young
scientists to present their work.
