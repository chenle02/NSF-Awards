Traditionally, researchers in the atmospheric sciences have had great needs in
the area of computational support. This is due to the emphasis in the science on
observations (hence, the need to manipulate and display large quantities of
data) and the requirement for solutions to non-linear partial differential
equations which can only be solved numerically with the aid of high speed
computers. Many of the needs of atmospheric scientists can be satisfied by large
centralized computer facilities (e.g. the National Center for Atmospheric
Research Scientific Computing Division; National Science Foundation Sponsored
supercomputer centers), but it has long been demonstrated that on-site access to
mid-range computers with good computational and graphical capabilities can
substantially enhance education and research productivity. In conjunction with
cost sharing by Purdue University, this award will assist in the purchase of a
mid-range departmental computer which will directly support educational
activities and the research of seven faculty members who are either currently
supported by the Foundation or have pending proposals.
