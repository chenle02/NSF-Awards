This research project considers the development of various techniques in the
study of small value theory: Both typical behaviors and rare events of the type
that positive random quantities take smaller values.&lt;br/&gt;The typical
behavior deals with the expectation of the minimum over a family of non-negative
random variables as the size of the index set grows larger.&lt;br/&gt;Topics in
this direction include&lt;br/&gt;minimum length spanning tree indexed by
spanning trees, comparison inequalities for minimum of the absolute value of
Gaussian vectors, random assignment type problems indexed by permutations, and
the first passage percolation indexed by paths.&lt;br/&gt;The rare events of
small value type deal with decay probabilities of positive random quantities
taking smaller values than typical ones.&lt;br/&gt;Topics in this direction
include small ball probabilities, lower tail behaviors and level crossing
probabilities.&lt;br/&gt;The very successful applications of tools developed by
the proposer over the last few years will be expanded to a detailed study of
various isoperimetric type Gaussian inequalities, tensored random fields,
Gaussian chaos, Brownian eddy models, permanental processes, and positivity
exponents for random polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;The major objective is to build and
extend a general small value theory based on systematic study of various methods
and diverse applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two fundamental phenomena in
probability theory are typical behaviors such as expected values, laws of large
numbers and central limit theorems, and rare events such as extremely big or
small values.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to deepen our understanding of small
value phenomena for positive random quantities by developing new techniques in
the study of relevant physical and biological random models.&lt;br/&gt;This
research benefits both undergraduate and graduate education and research. Many
open problems and results from the proposed study will be used as students
course projects.&lt;br/&gt;This research should improve our understanding of
extremal random events and provide basic tools for the study of our random
environment.
