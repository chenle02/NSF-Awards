9401827 Swift In this project, the PI will provide hydrographic support for WOCE
(World Ocean Circulation Experiment) Hydrographic Program (WHP) sections I9N
(95deg East), I7N (Arabian Sea), and I3 (transIndian Ocean at 20deg S), as part
of the US WOCE Indian Ocean Expedition (IOE). The PI will also provide logistics
support (shipping and travel) for other investigators as needed. This work is
the primary data collection activity for the US WOCE IOE.
