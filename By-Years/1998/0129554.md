The proposed workshop is a follow-up activity to a pilot effort funded by the
EHR/REC as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) in FY 2000 that focused
on evaluator capacity building and the importance of cultural context in
conducting evaluations. This proposal builds on the strategies and activities
implemented in the pilot workshop and will incorporate lessons learned and
feedback from the pilot workshop participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major
objectives for this workshop would be to provide participants with:&lt;br/&gt;1.
an introduction to the role and importance of program evaluation in urban
school&lt;br/&gt;settings&lt;br/&gt;2. a general overview of major evaluation
theories/approaches that have defined the field&lt;br/&gt;of educational
evaluation&lt;br/&gt;3. a closer look at a few emerging evaluation
theories/approaches that accept cultural&lt;br/&gt;context as an important
factor in program evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;4. preliminary considerations of
culturally responsive approaches in the design and&lt;br/&gt;implementation of
program evaluations.&lt;br/&gt;5. A videotape and accompanying CD of the
workshop will be developed by a professional&lt;br/&gt;media company for use in
future professional development workshops and recruitment.
The&lt;br/&gt;workshop participants and evaluation facilitators will receive
copies of the videotape and&lt;br/&gt;CD.
