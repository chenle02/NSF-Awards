The goal of this project is to develop a computational simulation tool to allow
scaling up the designs of laboratory sized of semi-industrial granular flow
systems to full scale industrial dimensions. The Phase I project will
concentrate on dilute granular systems, setting the framework for the inclusion
of increasingly dense in the future Phases. The analysis will be based on the
kinetic theory and numerical computations. Practical applications range from the
design of chutes to hoppers to bins and other systems for transporting bulk
solids.
