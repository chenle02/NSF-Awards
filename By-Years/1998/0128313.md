This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will determine
the technical and commercial feasibility of using the rapid freeze prototyping
(RFP) and jet model making (JMM) processes to produce ice and wax patterns used
in investment casting to fabricate metal castings for dental restorations. The
Phase I effort is to develop a solid freeform fabrication based dental
reconstruction system that can be used by dental labs to produce high-quality
crowns, bridges, and implant structures rapidly and cost-effectively from
digital images and computer-aided design data.

The commercial potential of this project will be more precise dental
restorations costing less. In 1999 this market was estimated to be about $2.5
billion with an expected annual growth between 10-15 percent.
