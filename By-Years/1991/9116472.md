Dr. Ludmil Bankov of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences' Space Research
Institute will visit Dr. Roderick Heelis of the Center for Space Sciences, at
the University of Texas, Dallas, to prepare a cooperative research project on
high latitude ionospheric electrodynamics. The resulting proposal is intended
for consideration under the US- Bulgaria Cooperative Science Program and, if
successful, should contribute to our knowledge of the interaction of the Earth's
magnetic field with the sun by drawing upon data from two spacecraft (NASA's
DE-2 and Bulgaria-1300) which simultaneously cross the high latitude region in
different local time sectors.
