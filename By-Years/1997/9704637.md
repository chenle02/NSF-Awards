9704637 Milgram The research in this project is led by three principal
investigators from the Mathematics Department at Stanford University: R.L.
Cohen, S.P Kerckhoff, and R.J. Milgram. Cohen and Milgram both have research
projects that involve studying the algebraic topology of spaces ("moduli
spaces") that arise as the set of solutions to equations coming from Geometry
and Theoretical Physics. These include the Yang-Mills equations defining
instantons on four dimensional manifolds, and the Cauchy-Riemann equations,
which define holomorphic structures on maps from surfaces to a variety of
important target manifolds. In addition, Cohen plans to use techniques from
Algebraic Geometry and Topology to study a holomorphic version of the K-theory
of an algebraic variety. These lead to invariants of holomorphic bundles in a
systematic way. Milgram plans to continue to study the emerging connections
between the structure of finite groups and homotopy theory. He will also study
the topology of certain special types of function spaces with applications to
both homotopy theory and other areas of mathematics. S.P. Kerckhoff studies low
dimensional topology and geometry. In this project he plans to continue his work
on hyperbolic geometric structures in dimension 3. This includes studying
structures with singularities along links and along graphs. He will use both
combinatorial and analytic methods. Recent interactions between mathematics and
physics have brought new ideas and problems into mathematics related in part to
the physicists' desire better to understand quantum field theory. Among the
mathematical results of this interaction have been extensive new information
about the geometry of 3- and 4-dimensional spaces, including counterexamples to
basic conjectures and new structure results. The major focus of this project is
to apply much more advanced results from deep, well-developed areas of
mathematics, such as algebraic topology and homotopy theory , to these new ideas
and problems, as well as to related questions. ***
