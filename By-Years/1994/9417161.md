Woosley, Stanford 9417161 Woosley and his group will continue theoretical
studies of stellar evolution, supernovae and nucleosynthesis. They plan to
improve the physics in their computer models for stars more massive than eight
solar-masses, to continue their efforts to find the prototypical theoretical
counterparts for supernovae of various types (SN 1993J,for example), to build
more realistic multidimensional computer models of the supernova explosion
itself for massive stars and white dwarfs, and to explore the entire range of
isotopic nucleosynthesis created in these events. ***
