Mathematical Sciences (21) In this proof of concept (POC) project faculty at a
number of the two-year colleges in the University of Wisconsin System are
collaborating with colleagues at the University of Wisconsin-LaCrosse to explore
the creation and use of "shareable content objects" (SCOs) targeting trouble
spots in a typical pre-calculus course. Assembly tools are also being made
available to faculty so that they may reuse and repackage these SCOs into larger
grained learning modules without having to author new component objects from
scratch. A prototype repository of these SCOs is under development, and the
experiences of faculty in this creation and assembly process is being captured
in the form of case studies.
