ABSTRACT The proposal seeks funding to co-sponsor a conference with the
Engineering Foundation on " Understanding Heat Exchanger Fouling and Its
Mitigation." The conference will be held in Barga, Italy from May 11 to 16,

mitigation of fouling in heat exchange equipment. Funding from NSF will be used
to cover the cost for several participants.
