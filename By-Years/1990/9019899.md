Free Electron Lasers (FEL's) are novel sources of coherent electromagnetic
radiation whose emissions arise from the nonlinear coupling of a relativistic
electron beam with a spatially periodic wiggler. In this research the
investigator proposes to investigate and formulate the physics and design issues
associated with the use of the CEBAF electron beam and a plasma wave wiggler to
produce short wavelength FEL radiation. This unique electron source and advanced
wiggler concept combine to form an innovative radiative source for solid state
and medical research applications. In the planning grant period, an extensive
review of the methods of analysis for each of the program objectives will be
conducted. Additionally, an extension of the present theory of magnetic field
error will be extended to plasma wave wigglers. These preliminary results will
form the basis and details on which the proposed program objectives will be
achieved.
