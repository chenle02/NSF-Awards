9416604 Monismith This project consists of conducting a fairly comprehensive
field study of the dynamics of tidal estuarine flow using a combination of
intensive studies of the local dynamics with longer-term moored measurements.
The central hypothesis to be tested is the dominance of an along-stream local
balance of forces. Specific questions to be addressed on this project are: (1)
How significant are horizontal advective processes relative to vertical momentum
transfer in establishing the state of the water column?; (2) How do various
bathymetric configurations effect this relation?; (3) How are vertical momentum
transfer and mixing affected by stratification in the tidal flows of a partially
mixed estuary?; (4) More generally, if local balances dominate, are current
ideas about the effects of stratification on the energy bearing scales of
turbulence sufficient to explain the structure of the tidal flows measured in
the field?; and, (5) Can internal waves be observed in the velocity and density
fields? Are they a significant contributor to the total variance of these
fields? ***
