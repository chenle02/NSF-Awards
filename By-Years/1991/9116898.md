Thrust fronts are located at the interface between thrust belts and foreland
basins. The unique array of structures found in these zones (opposing vergencies
and triangle zones) may be due to normal propagation of the thrust belt towards
the foreland or they may be developed because the thrust belt could move no
farther towards the craton. This project will examine subsurface and surface
data from the Precordillera of western Argentina where a thrust front is well
exposed, and considerable seismic data is available for reprocessing. Results
will help resolve the origin of thrust front structures and in understanding the
mechanics of thrust belts in general.
