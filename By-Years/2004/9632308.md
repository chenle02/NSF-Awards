9632308 Brosnan The study of natural catastrophes, such as volcanoes, provides
vital information on their role in the ecology and evolution of communities.
Rare events, may have important, even pivotal roles in ecosystems, but they are
hard to study. From a conservation standpoint, rare events may be of greater
importance to diversity patterns than normal events. Studies of natural
catastrophes can in turn provide a biological and predictive framework for
interpreting human impacts on natural systems. This knowledge is vital to the
design of biologically meaningful conservation plans. Effects of volcanic
eruptions on reef ecosystems (e.g. Mount Pinatubo). By studying effects of the
current eruption on the reefs around Montserrat, we have an opportunity to
expand our knowledge of volcanic impacts on reef ecology, and strengthen our
effectiveness in reef conservation. Dr. Brosnan will study the effects of
volcanic eruption on the reef community by repeating surveys of the reefs. She
will set up permanent monitoring quadrats at impacted reefs (south and east
coasts), and control reefs on the northwest coast that receive no volcanic input
and monitor changes in the reef community and compare changes in impacted and
nonimpacted reefs. ***
