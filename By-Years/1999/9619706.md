9619706 Clark ABSTRACT The National Nanofabrication Users Network (NNUN) is a
national partnership of research facilities providing unparalleled opportunities
for researchers from many disciplines and organizations to fabricate structures
utilizing advanced nano- and micro-fabrication technology. Initiated by NSF in
1994, NNUN is serving as a useful model for linking expensive facilities to gain
synergy and minimize duplication. NNUN proposes establishment of a network-wide
REU program. The intent is to capitalize on the extensive, interrelated
infrastructure of NNUN to provide a much broader and richer REU experience than
any one site could provide. The proposed program will build upon several
existing enrichment programs existing at various NNUN sites. By expanding the
program, we expect to strengthen and enrich the REU experience in several ways:
* With the geographical spread embodied with NNUN, we will be able to contact
and attract a broader range of minority/female students. * The pool of faculty
will increase by a factor of 3-4. This should enable a better match between
student and faculty interests. * The REUs will be exposed to various aspects of
"networking" across large geographical distances, an experience likely to be
important in their careers. * We will offer a convocation at the end of the
program which will provide a majority of the students with a "2 site"
experience. ***
