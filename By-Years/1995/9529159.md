9529159 Aki This project brings together a strongly coordinated group of
geologists, geotechnical engineers and seismologists from a number of
organizations to address geotechnical site characterization and ground motion
response issues resulting from the Northridge earthquake. The proposed work is
heavily leveraged by cost-sharing from the California Department of
Transportation, with additional cost-sharing from the Electric Power Research
Institute, the Southern California Earthquake Center, and the U.S. Geological
Survey, and with cooperation from the California Department of Mines and
Geology. The objectives of the project are: 1) collection, compilation, and
rapid dissemination of high- quality site geotechnical and geophysical data to
the research community; and 2) focused analyses limited to the following: *
determining the extent to which local site and regional wave propagation effects
control strong ground motion, including nonlinear site response; * evaluating
the adequacy of the conventional approach to estimating site effects using:
measured shear-wave velocities, the results of laboratory tests, and one-
dimensional equivalent- linear and nonlinear analyses; * assessing the degree of
model complexity (2- and 3-D analyses) required to adequately explain site
effects; and * determining the uncertainties in measured properties and how
these uncertainties affect ground motion predictions. The research objectives
are addressed in three phases by the integrated group of geologists,
seismologists and geotechnical engineers. Extensive coordination between
institutions is facilitated through a formal advisory structure. In Phase 1, a
series of geotechnical investigations are conducted at significant sites of
strong motion recordings and/or structural failures. In Phase 2, data collected
in Phase 1 is evaluated and combined with results of other data collection
efforts to establish a comprehensive database for modeling ground motion. The
aim is to establish standard 1-D geotechnical models that include material
strain dependencies, as well as 2- and 3-D structural models. A workshop will
facilitate coordination between investigators and dissemination of data. Phase 3
involves site response analyses of the data collected in Phase 2, with
comparisons made of ground motion response calculations to Northridge earthquake
observations. The final report will document site investigations and site
response issues as well as all of the ground motion analyses conducted. ***
