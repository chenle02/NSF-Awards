9402437 Brown This grant will permit the author to complete the construction of
a high-pressure consolidometer in which he plans to replicate the
temperature/pressure conditions of an accretionary prism. Mixtures of different
sediments and porewaters will be subjected to varying physical conditions for
1-2 months, in order to determine changes in both physical and chemical
conditions occurring deep within the prism.
