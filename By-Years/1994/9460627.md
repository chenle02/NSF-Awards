Acorn NMR proposes to create a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer
"flight simulator" which would run on a personal computer. This would be used as
a teaching tool, so that students could explore the effects of numerous data
acquisition parameters on the resulting data without monopolizing expensive
instrument time. All major aspects of instrument control could be included, as
well as data processing and interactive spectral interpretation. Such a teaching
tool would give students a solid understanding of NMR spectroscopy which does
not depend on access to an actual spectrometer. The Simulator will build on
Acorn NMR's existing software products to form a complete educational package.
Their existing PC-based software includes a comprehensive NMR data processing
program and an NMR shimming simulation program.
