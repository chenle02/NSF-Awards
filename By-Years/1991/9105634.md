It is proposed to complete the analysis of moored acoustic current measurements
from the Gulf Stream gathered as part the joint NSF/ONR Synoptic Ocean
Prediction (SYNOP) program. The investigation centers on the regional energetics
and eddy-mean flow interaction in the large meandering region of the Gulf
Stream.
