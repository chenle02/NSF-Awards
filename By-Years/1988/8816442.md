The primary objective of this two-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research
project in low temperature physics between Janez Seliger of the Josef Stefan
Institute and V. Hugo Schmidt ot Montana State University, is to obtain a
fundamental understanding of superionic conductivity and ferroelectric and
ferroelastic materials and systems using NMR and NMQ techniques. This work
should substantially advance knowledge of structure of ferroelectrics. This
project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science
and Technology and is funded through a joint fund consisting of matching
contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is
provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. Grants
are made to the principal Yugoslav institute. Dollar funds are included for U.S.
scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in
the U.S.
