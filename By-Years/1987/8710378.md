Research on the sediment and pollutant transport problem is of a dual nature.
First, derivation of an analytic model to explain and quantify the process is
pursued. Second, a laboratory test tank is used to gather data to both test the
developed model and give directions for field studies. This project is one
supported under Creativity Awards for Undergraduate Engineering Students.
