The mathematics department at Maharishi International University is implementing
a plan to improve its undergraduate mathematics program. The primary goals are:
(1) to develop in every undergraduate student through a process of exploration
and discovery the understanding that the essence of mathematics is the precise
quantification of patterns and relationships, and (2) to develop in our
mathematics and science students better problem solving skills so that they may
successfully apply mathematical concepts to model and solve practical
problems.Steps being taken to implement these goals include (1) a revised course
content in the mathematics core course taken by all undergraduate students, (2)
the development of a general education geometry course aimed at humanities
majors, and (3) restructuring of the calculus sequence, including the adoption
of the Harvard Consortium Calculus textbook.The computer laboratory includes
Macintosh computers running Mathematica and Geometer's Sketchpad. Three primary
uses of the computers are (1) to generate examples from which students may
observe patterns and make conjectures, (2) to apply graphical, numerical, and
symbolic approaches to develop a deeperunderstanding of the important concepts
of mathematics and (3) to use technology to more realistically apply these
concepts in real-world situations. Mathematica notebooks to accompany the
Harvard Consortium Calculus text are also being developed.
