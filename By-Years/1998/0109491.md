This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
optical amplification in a single-mode polymer optical fiber. Phase I will: 1)
incorporate various rare earth chelates into polymer systems; 2) demonstrate
amplification in the material; 3) make a polymer fiber with a rare-earth core;
and 4) demonstrate amplification in the fiber. Single mode polymer optical fiber
waveguides will be made with a mode profile that matches that of standard silica
glass fiber, thus making the amplifier fiber compatible with existing fiber-
optic components.

Besides applications in phased array radar, these amplifiers are expected to
impact the long-haul fiber amplifier business, but it's largest impact will be
in small and regional network applications, particularly for fiber-to-the-
neighborhood and fiber-to-the-curb uses. The new technology will also impact the
amplifier market for local intranets, as well as provide cost-effective
amplifier solutions for small networks and hybrid fiber-coax cable TV systems.
