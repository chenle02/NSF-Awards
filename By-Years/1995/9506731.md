ABSTRACT This award provides partial support for the continuation of activities
of the Polar Research Board (PRB) for the period January 1, 1995 through
December 31, 1995. The activities are designed to make research in the polar
regions more productive and responsive to the needs of the United States, and to
maintain U.S. awareness and representation in ongoing international science
programs. Overall, the Board's program provides national and international
scientific and technical information of the U.S. government policy makers and
the polar research community, represents U.S. interests in international non-
governmental polar scientific organizations, and conducts special programmatic
studies in areas of polar science and technology deemed necessary by the
government, research and business community, or the PRB. To that end, the Board
will actively assist the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) in U.S.
preparations for, and holding the International Conference for Arctic Research
Planning in 1995. The conference, to be co-hosted by Dartmouth College and the
U.S. Army's Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, is sponsored by
the PRB and the National Science Foundation. During the year, the Board will
also provide information on the activities of IASC and the Scientific Committee
on Antarctic Research (SCAR)(a non-governmental science organization which also
serves as an advisory body to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, to the
U.S. government agencies and polar research community through regular meetings,
mailings and electronic mail. An annual report of the Board for 1995 will be
published, and its activities will also be reported in the Journal of Antarctic
Research and Arctic Research of the United States.
