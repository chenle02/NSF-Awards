Properties of radiation generated by fluctuating sources of different states of
coherence will be investigated. The effects of spatial and temporal correlations
of source fluctuations on spectra of emitted light will be studied. The aim is
to provide a theoretical basis for spectroscopy of partially coherent sources.
Further, the techniques of modern coherence theory will be used to develop a
treatment of scattering of polychromatic light of any state of coherence from
media which exhibit spatial and temporal statistical fluctuations in their
macroscopic parameters. A concept of instantaneous cross-spectral density will
be applied to propagation of very short optical pulses, specifically to a study
of how the instantaneous spectrum of a light pulse changes in the process of
propagation.
