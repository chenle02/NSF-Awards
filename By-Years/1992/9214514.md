This U.S.-Mexico award will support Professor Sandip Pakvasa and a group of
theoretical physicists from the University of Hawaii in Manoa and the University
of Massachusetts at Amherst, in collaboration with a group of physicists at the
Mexican Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados (CINVESTAV). The
objective of the proposed research is to study various fundamental questions
concerning the standard model of electro-weak interactions. In particular, the
group plans to investigate radiative corrections in the standard model,
calculate decay rates, polarization effects, and branching ratios in the non-
leptonic decays of baryions, pursue theoretical and phenomenological studies of
CP violation, and study models for Fermion masses and mixings and their
implications for collider physics. This research cooperation will unite leading
researchers in the U.S., with considerable experimental expertise at colliding
beam and non-accelerator physics facilities, with one of the strongest
theoretical groups in Mexico in the area of unified models. The proposed
collaboration will serve to enhance interactions between these active groups and
promote the training of graduate students.
