The Department of Mechanical Engineering at Clemson is enhancing its established
undergraduate research program through this summer component. The REU site
involve students from Clemson and other institutions in a ten week program of
research, seminars, and workshops. All of the activities challenge the
participants intellectually and develop their critical thinking skills as well
as their ability to work independently. The one-on-one contact with faculty and
interaction with graduate students also introduce these students to the
opportunities in graduate education and the career options in research and
academia. The Department of Mechanical Engineering has demonstrated its interest
in undergraduate research through the established Senior Departmental Honors
program. This program includes a research component and the writing of a senior
thesis. Fifty percent of the faculty of the department have participated in this
program which spans the areas of thermal and fluid science, mechanical and
manufacturing systems, engineering mechanics, and materials. The summer program
complements this existing program and provides opportunities for a more diverse
group of students.
