9410218 Barbone Proposed in this RIA research project is the study of a model
which consists of an acoustic beam of finite width propagating normally into a
laminated dissipative half-space containing randomly distributed point scatters.
This problem combines many of the essential difficulties encountered in imaging
parenchymal tissue: inhomogeneity on many scales, non-constant attenuation,
random scattering, and backscatter from interfaces. The goals of the asymptotic
analysis correspond to the two stages in the research plan: (1) to formulate a
diffraction -corrected one-dimensional inverse problem consistent with the
three- dimensional imaging problem, and (2) to examine different averaging
techniques for the random scattering and determine their applicability to
texture analysis. ***
