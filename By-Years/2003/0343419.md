Currently titanium alloys are being used for aerospace structures because of the
high specific&lt;br/&gt;strength. Recently carbon fiber with ultra high modulus
has been developed. In this research program a titanium / high modulus carbon
hybrid composite will be developed to obtain both high specific strength
and&lt;br/&gt;high specific stiffness. An inorganic matrix will be used which
will also provide high temperature&lt;br/&gt;resistance. The primary objectives
are to evaluate: the compatibility of the inorganic matrix
with&lt;br/&gt;titanium and the feasibility of fabricating composite plates. The
plates will be made using vacuum&lt;br/&gt;bagging technique and will be tested
in tension and bending. The key issue is the behavior of
interface&lt;br/&gt;between carbon fibers and the titanium plates.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the hybrid composite will provide a new
breakthrough for the fabrication of high temperature,&lt;br/&gt;high specific
strength and high stiffness structural components. These components will
have&lt;br/&gt;excellent potential for use in aerospace, automotive and civil
engineering structures.&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will be recruited for
the project. Through their involvement in the project&lt;br/&gt;they will be
exposed to latest materials and their
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
