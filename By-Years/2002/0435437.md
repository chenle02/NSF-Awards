This project is designing new application and network transport protocols as
well as improved workload characterizations and models for evaluating the
protocols. In the domain of workload characterization, the project is evaluating
and extending a new method for network traffic characterization called Bayesian
Block (BB) analysis that is significantly more accurate than previous methods
for estimating the time-varying rate of bursty event processes, such as packet
losses in a network flow, packet or flow arrivals to a gateway or end host in
the network, or requests arriving to a network service. Anticipated results
include (a) more precise and accurate characterizations of these network event
processes, (b) more precise and realistic synthetic workload models for network
flows, and (c) extensions to the BB analysis method to improve its accuracy. The
project is also investigating more precise and accurate peer-to-peer workload
characterizations that can be used in the design of improved peer-to-peer
applications. In the domain of protocol design, the project is investigating (a)
new near-optimal download protocols from multiple (peer-to-peer) servers, and
(b) exploratory design of new transport protocols. The new transport protocols
employ forward error correction to recover from packet loss as well as BB
analysis at the receiver to determine when to send feedback to the sender
regarding observed packet loss rate for use in regulating the rate the packets
are sent to the receiver.
