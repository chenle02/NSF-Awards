The 15th ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), sponsored by ACM
SIGCOMM, in cooperation with USENIX, is to be held in Tokyo, Japan, October
28-30, 2015. This award assists approximately 12-14 graduate students from US
institutions to attend this conference. IMC is the primary venue for presenting
new research results on collecting and analyzing measurements of the Internet.
Attending conferences such as IMC is of paramount importance for graduate
students pursuing research in the field. Authors have the opportunity to present
their work and all attendees have a chance to interact with many others
performing leading-edge research in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit: This proposal will serve to widen the audience attending the Internet
Measurement Conference (IMC), raising the level of interaction and the potential
for new collaboration, new investigations, and higher quality research. Given
the rising cost of international travel, the grant will enable students (who
otherwise do not have sufficient funds) to attend the conference in
Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This proposal, by enabling students
to attend who might not otherwise be able, will increase the dissemination of
the conference's research results to a larger and more diverse audience. It also
integrates research and education of graduate students by allowing students to
observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the
field. Giving preference in grant awards to women and minority students widens
the participation among these underrepresented groups. Furthermore, by
advertising to a wide range of colleges and universities, participants from a
more diverse set of institutions should be able to attend and benefit from the
conference.
