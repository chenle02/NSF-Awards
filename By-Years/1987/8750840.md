A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer is being used in a number of courses
by the Chemistry Department at Reed College to afford students a wider
opportunity to utilize modern, state-of-the-art instrumentation in their
undergraduate studies. Applications in both introductory and advanced organic,
inorganic, physical, and instrumental chemistry together with a significant
focus on undergraduate research are involved.
