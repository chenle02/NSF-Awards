9352254 Okumura A one quarter undergraduate laboratory course in surface science
is being developed in order to introduce chemistry majors to concepts and
techniques commonly employed in studies of chemistry on surfaces. This program
complements our existing physical chemistry laboratory course which emphasizes
gas phase and condensed phase topics. To incorporate the new material, we are
expanding the physical chemistry laboratory from two quarters to three. Five
experiments are being developed. Students are performing three experiments on a
UHV surface apparatus: elemental analysis of surface composition by Auger
Electron Spectroscopy (AES), surface structure studies using Low Energy Electron
Diffraction (LEED), and desorption kinetics measurements of chemisorbed
molecules by Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD). In a fourth experiment,
surface structure is being studied in a complementary approach with a scanning
tunneling microscope (STM) in air; the emphasis is on surface electronic states.
Finally, transmission FT-IR spectroscopy is being used to examine structure of
adsorbates on supported metal particles. The institution has already purchased a
vacuum chamber, LEED optics, and sample manipulator, and made available vacuum
pumps for the UHV instrument. This apparatus is being completed by including
sample mounting and introduction hardware, electronics, and residual gas
analyzer for TPD. An instructional STM is being used in the surface imaging
experiment. Finally, we are upgrading an existing FTIR spectrometer for the
adsorbate spectroscopy experiment. ***
