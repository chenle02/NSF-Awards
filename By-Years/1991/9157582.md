The proposed research focuses on a multidisciplinary approach toward
computation of macromolecular structure. The aim is to (1) develop new
algorithms for multivariate minimization and molecular dynamics on
supercomputers, and (2) apply them to outstanding problems in nucleic acid and
protein dynamics. A key vehicle is the Langevin/Implicit-Euler scheme for
molecular dynamics, permitting large time steps and damping high-frequency
modes. Efficient conformational searches and global optimization strategies will
be applied to important folding problems in DNA and proteins.
