Members of the myosin family of actin-based molecular motors use the chemical
energy from ATP hydrolysis to perform mechanical work such as vesicle, membrane
and mRNA transport in cells. One member of the family, myosin VI, is unique in
that it travels towards the pointed ends of actin filaments, as opposed to the
barbed ends. Pointed-end directionality enables myosin VI to transport endocytic
vesicles from the cell surface to the cell interior. Myosin VI is processive;
for each diffusional encounter with an actin filament, a single myosin VI
molecule possessing two catalytic subunits takes multiple steps, each coupled to
an individual ATPase cycle, before dissociating. The two subunits alternate
between leading and trailing positions on the actin filament track. Slow, rate-
limiting ADP release enables myosin VI to remain attached to actin for a large
fraction of its ATPase cycle time and is believed to coordinate the catalytic
cycles of the two heads so that at least one is bound to actin and ADP at all
times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, biochemical and biophysical
experiments will be employed to provide a complete and detailed characterization
of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of ADP and actin binding to myosin VI,
and to identify the mechanism of communication between the catalytic subunits
during processive stepping. The detailed analysis of reaction mechanisms will
provide quantitative models for the molecular mechanisms of energy transduction,
processivity and regulation in myosin VI. General principles about free-energy
coupling and cooperativity in molecular motors will emerge from this
work.&lt;br/&gt;
