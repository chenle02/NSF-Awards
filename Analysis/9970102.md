Abstract Evens

Evens will continue his work on the relation between geometry and representation
theory. In his work with Lu, he will attempt to generalize their previous
theorem relating the new field of Poisson geometry to the classical 19th century
problem of computing intersection multiplicities. In particular, he hopes to
find a Poisson structure to help compute quantum cohomology of the flag
manifold. In his work with Grojnowski, he will continue his study of
multiplicities of restrictions of representations of real semisimple groups,
with the goal of solving certain multiplicity one problems. He will study
characteristic cycles for nilpotent orbits and their relation to certain
problems in representation theory.

The use of symmetry in the study of geometrical problems has been one of the
great unifying themes of modern mathematics. Ideas based on considerations of
symmetry have had a profound impact on elementary questions in arithmetic and on
physics, especially to quantum mechanics. There are certain topological
constructions which are analogous to the problem of counting points in a finite
set. The investigator plans to apply these constructions to problems motivated
by number theory and theoretical physics.
