This project is at the interface of analysis and resolution of singularities,
the latter area often being considered to be a part of algebraic geometry. Work
will be done in several subjects, most of which have connections to various
parts of mathematics. These subjects include restriction theorems for the
Fourier transform and associated problems in partial differential equations,
maximal averages over surfaces, and oscillatory integral operators with real
phase. The investigator's earlier research has found applications in scalar
oscillatory integrals with real phase and in stability problems for integrals,
and another goal of this research is to provide further developments in these
fields. The investigator is also interested in pursuing analogues of these
oscillatory integral results to integrals over other fields such as the p-adics,
which in turn are connected with various topics in number theory.

Much of the research proposed is part of harmonic analysis (broadly construed),
a field with substantial connections to applied fields such as wavelets,
physics, and electrical engineering. In the long term, improved understanding of
theoretical aspects of harmonic analysis has the potential to lead to
applications in more applied subjects, which in turn have a broad impact on
society as a whole. The investigator expects to have numerous interactions with
students, helping in the development of the scientific human resources of this
country. Furthermore, the investigator's university is an urban state university
with one of the most diverse student populations in the country, having students
of many ethnic and national origins. This occurs in both the undergraduate and
graduate student body. Hence it is likely that working with students will help
increase diversity in mathematics and related areas.
