There are presently three ways of bringing optical technology and integrated
electronics together. The first is to use silicon and produce a laser with
silicon. This seems out of the question, although not entirely. The second is to
use gallium arsenide for both optics and circuitry. However, the use of gallium
arsenide for circuits is more expensive and difficult than using silicon. The
third alternative, and the one which seems most viabale, is that of bringing the
silicon circuit technology together with gallium arsenide technology, which is
the focus of the present proposal.
