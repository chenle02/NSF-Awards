Recent years have seen the emergence of large-scale data clusters consisting of
hundreds of thousands hard drives in data-intensive computing. Because failure
of a disk could cause loss of valuable data or information, the direct and
indirect costs of ever often disk failures are becoming increasingly critical
issues in the deployment and operation of these computational platforms. Recent
studies conclude that the trend in data-intensive computing is towards much
higher disk replacement rates in the field than the Mean-Time-To-Failure
estimates of the manufacturer datasheet would suggest, even in the first years
of operation. Hence, the recovery becomes state of storage.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing storage recovery solutions successfully developed
optimal and near-optimal parallelism layouts such as declustered parity
organizations at small-scale storage architectures. There are very few studies
on multi-way replication based storage architectures that are equally important
but significantly different from erasure code based storage architectures.
Moreover, it is difficult to scale up to a large size because current placement-
ideal solutions have a limited number of configurations. Lastly, fast recovery
demands efficient reverse data lookup, which is not well studied in current
scalable data distribution schemes. The investigators develop methods and tools
for achieving fast recovery by exploiting optimal and near-optimal parallelism
techniques, and distributed hash table and reverse hashing techniques to improve
the scalability of reverse data lookup in high-performance storage systems. The
proposed research, if successful, will have broad impact in both fault-tolerance
computing and high-performance computing community by providing a scalable and
fast storage recovery solution.
