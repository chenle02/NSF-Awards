PI: Pankaj Jaiswal (Oregon State University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPIs: Dennis
W. Stevenson (New York Botanical Garden), Sinisa Todorovic and Eugene Zhang
(Oregon State University), Elizabeth Arnaud (Bioversity International/CGIAR,
France), Christopher Mungall (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Senior Personnel: Barry Smith (University at Buffalo), Georgios V.
Gkoutos and John Doonan (University of Aberystwyth,
UK).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plant researchers must be able to quickly search for
genetic information from a wide range of online databases. Unfortunately, the
researchers who originally provided the data and those who are analyzing it
often use inconsistent terminology, making keyword searches less effective. To
remedy this problem, the project will develop common gene annotation standards
and a universal vocabulary of plant biology and diseases. It will also draw up
standards and workflows for the creation and curation of such terminology.
Additionally, it will develop a web portal and data warehouse to host this
shared vocabulary and related annotation information to enable access by the
broader plant community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will create a
centralized platform where reference ontologies for plants will be used to
access cutting-edge data resources for analyzing plant traits, phenotypes,
diseases, genomes, genetic diversity and gene expression data across a wide
range of plant species. It will empower researchers to build hypotheses and
discover, query, and analyze plant genomics data to address complex questions
that would not otherwise be tractable. Ultimately, plant breeders can use this
information to develop higher-yielding, more nutritious crops that tolerate
stress and resist disease. As an educational component, the project team will
reach out to K-12 and undergraduate students and the plant research community.
Through this project, the scientific community will be able to contribute
genetic annotation data to the warehouse via a collaborative web site that will
also provide multiple ways to analyze and download data and other resources.
