Plant morphogenesis relies on the continued proliferation and differentiation
of cells derived from the shoot apical meristem. In response to a variety of
signals, cells in the shoot apical meristem convert from vegetative to floral
growth. This switch is accompanied by a number of morphological and biochemical
changes, resulting in a change in the pattern of organ initiation and the type
of organ that is formed. In addition, intercellular signals appear to be
required for establishing the floral pattern. Dr. Irish proposes to investigate
these processes in Arabidopsis by characterizing some of the key genes required
for establishing both the floral pattern of organogenesis and specific tissue
identities. She will take two approaches to address these problems. By using
both molecular and genetic techniques, she hopes to clarify the pathway(s)
involved in establishing the floral pattern by defining new genes required to
specify the first steps in floral morphogenesis. In addition she proposes clonal
analysis experiments aimed at testing the cellular autonomy of previously
characterized mutations, which allow her to define the gene products involved in
cell-cell signalling mechanisms required for the development of the floral
pattern.
