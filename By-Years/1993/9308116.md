Financial support is requested for young faculty and graduate students to
participate in a NATO workshop on the subject of spatio-temporal patterns in
nonequilibrium complex systems. The aims of the workshop are: 1) to bring
together researchers working with a variety of different materials and to work
towards a unified description of pattern formation in complex systems, and 2)
examine and foster the role of pattern formation in science and technology. This
workshop, which is third in a series, will be held in Santa Fe, New Mexico
during April 1, 1993 through June 30, 1993.
