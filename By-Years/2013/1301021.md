This award will provide three years of support for the Midwest Dynamical Systems
Seminar (MWDS); the first occurrence of this conference to be funded by this
grant will be October 25-27, 2013 at Indiana University-Purdue University
Indianapolis. The MWDS is one of the country's longest running and most
influential analysis conference series: it has been in existence for over forty
years, the last twenty-two with NSF support. The MWDS has positively affected
the careers of several generations of mathematicians. It is not possible to
tabulate the number of mathematical papers that have resulted from the
interactions that the event has fostered. The MDWS meets annually at venues all
around the country, but primarily at locations in the
Midwest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the many long-standing, recurring
mathematical conferences in the US, the MWDS stands out as a model of successful
efforts to ensure diversity and broaden participation. From its inception the
MWDS has displayed as one of its hallmarks the inclusion of women, young
mathematicians, and members of underrepresented groups. This will not change
with the current award: the bulk of the forty individuals who will receive
support for any meeting of the MWDS will be women and young mathematicians
(graduate students, postdocs, untenured assistant professors).
