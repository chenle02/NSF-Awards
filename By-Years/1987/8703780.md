This project will be supported by a joint award from the Chemistry Office of
Special Projects and the Cellular Biosciences Cell Biology Program as part of
the Chemistry of Life Processes Initiative. It is aimed at developing a
quantitative understanding of the cell adhesion properties of the Arg-Gly-Asp
(RGD) moiety. It is based on the premise that a detailed investigation of how
RGD density and distribution affect cell adhesion properties of well-defined
surfaces will reveal important correlations between ligand-receptor density and
cell binding. At present, such correlations have been impossible to establish
due to the structural complexity of natural adhesive- promoting proteins, and
cell surfaces. The ultimate objective of this research is to provide unique
insights into the molecular basis of cell recognition and adhesion. Immediate
objectives of this research include: (1) the synthesis of polymerized
phospholipid Langmuir-Blodgett films containing a controllable density and
distribution of RGD-bearing peptides, and (2) a quantitative analysis of how
peptide density, distribution, and spacing from the surface influence cellular
recognition and binding.
