This project addresses the design and synthesis of zeolite-like frameworks based
on assembly of Archimedean polyhedra constructed from hydrogen-bonded molecular
tiles and related molecular frameworks to create a new family of microporous
molecular frameworks with structures and properties that can be modified through
choice of molecular constituents. These frameworks are used as scaffolds that
encapsulate functional molecules such as laser dyes as well as templates for
synthesis of nanoreticulated metal oxides that replicate the topology of the
zeolite-like frameworks. This work also capitalizes on the unique ability of
lamellar GS compounds to form high quality thin films with controlled two-
dimensional packing of conjugated guest molecules with adjustable electronic
properties for a systematic examination of electron transport in a field effect
transistor configuration.

The motivation for this project is driven by promise of new materials that
capitalize on the versatility of organic synthesis, which permit manipulation of
properties through molecular design. The project explores the synthesis of
materials for a new generation of solid-state lasers as well as the molding of
nanomaterials with unique electronic properties that can impact technologies
ranging from displays to solar energy. The project also provides summer research
experiences for undergraduates and faculty from minority-serving and four-year
institutions, research experiences for high school students, exposure of
students and postdocs to the industrial section through the NYU University
Chapter of the Chemists' Club, and professional development opportunities for
students and postdocs that will prepare them for careers in science and
engineering.
