The objective of this research is the investigation of the field of motion in
the tropical Pacific using four existing VHF (50 MHz) radars located in Peru,
Christmas Island, Phonpei, and Biak, Indonesia. Topics for investigation include
measured vertical motion, the vertical flux of horizontal momentum between the
boundary layer and roughly 20 km. These measurements will be used in cognate
studies of gravity waves, thermal convection and tidal oscillations. This
research is a joint activity between the University of Colorado and NOAA's
Aeronomy Laboratory.
