9527622 Wunderlin The University of South Florida herbarium is nationally and
internationally known for its collections from Florida, North America and Latin
America. The herbarium conserves 212,000 specimens, including 275 types. The
facility is actively used by taxonomists and ecologists in the region to
investigate biodiversity issues. This award will alleviate danger to the
collections presented by overcrowding of the specimens, and also provide more
work space for scientists who are using the collection. The compactor storage
system and new cases that will be purchased from this award will allow for 15
years of growth in the collection.
