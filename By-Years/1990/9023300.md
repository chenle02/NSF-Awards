The College of Marine Studies at the University of Delaware will acquire
oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use equipment.
This equipment is made available to users of the institution's research vessel:
the R/V CAPE HENLOPEN, a 115-foot vessel that is owned and operated by the
University. A significant portion of the ship's operating schedule during 1991
is in support of NSF- sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also
increase the capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support research
and engineering activities. The instrumentation includes: -Scintillation counter
for measurements of radio-isotope tracers and other chemical parameters,
-portable fume hood for removing chemical fumes from the ship's chemical
laboratory van. The equipment described above will increase the capability of
the University to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.
