Imaginative use of computational mathematics can provide insight into some of
the most difficult questions about nonlinear partial differential equations.
Among these are problems of transonic aerodynamics and plasma physics that
appear superficially not to be well posed, but become so when weak solutions are
introduced correctly. Numerical analysis of the weak solutions is a major
challenge to mathematics. The investigator conducts research in this area of
applied mathematics in collaboration with both graduate students and
postdoctoral assistants. This project is concerned with the numerical solution
of nonlinear partial differential equations, and the principal results are codes
that work effectively on the latest generation of computers and have significant
technological applications. Emphasis is placed on research in high performance
computing that brings to bear on previous algorithms the advantages of parallel
architecture. The investigator collaborates with mathematicians, physicists and
engineers, aiming at successful transfer of technology to industry. A principal
area of study is the problem of transport in magnetic fusion energy research.
This phenomenon can be modeled by a Monte Carlo method that provides good
estimates of the transport.
