In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Subprogram of the
Physical Chemistry Program, Evans will work on the theory of the intermolecular
structure and dynamics of a hard smooth convex body (HCB) model of polyatomic
molecules. The overall theme of the project is to understand the predictions of
the simplest model that can serve as a reference system for future work. In one
project pertaining to self diffusion the aim is to analyze the effects of caging
versus momentum feedback recollisions on the translational and rotational
dynamics of nonspherical molecules in dense fluids. The HCB model has been
applied to gas phase reaction dynamics and it successfully interprets steric
effects on cross sections in oriented molecule reactions. Plans include
extension of this model to incorporate energy bottlenecks in chemical reactions.
When the HCB model is applied to the analysis of structural order in liquids, it
predicts how the solvent aligns around a solute. The work will be extended to
analyze long and short range orientational order in liquids of nonspherical
molecules. The present analytical theory, combined with the computer simulations
on precisely the same systems, provides an unobscured look at the properties of
fluids of polyatomic molecules.
