Dr. Fine is continuing his research into the development of lower probability
based on models for frequentist phenomena and is continuing to explore the
implications of such models, particularly as they contrast with analyses of such
phenomena by conventional probability. His previous research allowed him to
break a bond between convergence of relative frequencies and hypotheses of
stationarity. An example of a stationarity hypothesis is the common assumption
in analysis of frequentist phenomena of successive trials being independent and
identically distributed. In this new research, Dr. Fine is examining some forms
of evidence that would lead to the adoption of lower probability models;
continuing to develop an ability to construct lower probability models to
conform with the evidence; and strengthening the calculus by adoption and study
of an appropriate notion of lower expectation. Lower expectation can provide
entry to associated concepts of conditioning and independence and to the
rudiments of statistical decision theory. It is hoped that this research will
encourage the broadening of the scope of probabilistic reasoning by exploring
alternatives to conventional probability with some of the vigor with which the
various interpretations of probability have been discussed.
