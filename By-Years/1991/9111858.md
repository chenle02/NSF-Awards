This project will produce contract designs for the mid-life refits of three NSF-
owned research vessels - the R/Vs ENDEAVOR, OCEANUS and WECOMA operated by the
University of Rhode Island, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Oregon
State University, respectively. These R/Vs are 15 years old and need mid-life
modifications to prevent science mission obsolescence and to rejuvenate their
material condition. This is Phase II of a 3-phase program. Phase I produced a
preliminary design for improvements to be accomplished in varying degrees on
each ship. Phase II will produce bid-ready contract designs for each ship and
Phase III proposals, one for each ship, will be for the actual mid-life refits
staggered over three years. A management team with representatives from the ship
operations and science staffs of each institution will oversee Phase II
activities, and the firm of Rodney E. Lay &amp; Associates will provide naval
architecture and engineering services.
