The purpose of this study is to understand how natural selection on various
physiological, behavioral, and life history traits in a model organism, yellow-
bellied marmots, varies over time in a rapidly changing environment. By
following the fate of individually-marked marmots, this research will provide
new insights on the limits of evolutionary responses to environmental change.
This research will transform our views of potentially "good" and "bad" changes
that are driven by the environment. These methods and results should be
applicable to a variety of other species that are likely to initially do
"better" but may ultimately do "worse" from earlier arrival of spring
conditions.

The broader impacts of this project will include: (1) recruitment and training
of graduate and undergraduate students from under-represented groups; (2) wide
dissemination of research results to scientific audiences and the general public
via scientific and popular articles and talks, and engagement with science
journalists; (3) maintenance of Marmot Minutes (a blog), The Marmot Burrow (a
website), and The Marmots of RMBL (a website); and (4) continuation of one of
the world's longest-running studies that follows the fate of individually-marked
mammals. This dataset has become an important window on the effects of climate
change on a hibernating vertebrate, and a valuable data set that can be used to
explore both population and evolutionary dynamics.
