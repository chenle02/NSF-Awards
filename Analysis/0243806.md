ABSTRACT

PI: Mariusz Urbanski, University of N. Texas DMS-0243806

"Dynamical Systems, Denton 2003"

This award provides substantial support for active research mathematicians (both
advanced and beginning) with limited means of support to attend and participate
in the conference Dynamical Systems, Denton 2003. The conference is designed to
provide an opportunity for leading experts in the fields of ergodic theory,
topological dynamics, smooth dynamical systems, holomorphic dynamical systems,
one-dimensional dynamics, combinatorial ergodic theory and Hamiltonian dynamical
systems to share their ideas with the research community. With only a single
speaker scheduled at any given time, the conference will also give less renowned
speakers and their ideas exposure to a wide audience. The plenary speakers will
be Krystyna Kuperberg, Carlangelo Liverani, Rafael de la Llave Michael Lyubich
and Lai-Sang Young.
