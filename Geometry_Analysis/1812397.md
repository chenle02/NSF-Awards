A three-dimensional manifold is locally modelled on the space in which we live,
but globally it can be quite different. Such manifolds and their higher-
dimensional variants have proved to be astonishingly important, arising in many
branches of mathematics and physics. Recently, study of these manifolds has seen
a period of remarkable transformation, with progress made by understanding
symmetries of the manifolds and the related so-called "covering spaces." These
are succinctly encoded by a purely algebraic object known as the fundamental
group. The interplay between the fundamental group and the manifold is at the
center of this research project. The project aims to better understand more
general groups in addition to those arising from manifolds. Recent work has
focused on the longstanding question of how one might recognize various classes
of groups from "local data" and on trying to reconstitute the group as global
data.

This project is focused on representations, in various settings, of groups
arising in low-dimensional geometry and topology (e.g. free groups, surface
groups, and Kleinian groups). The project addresses questions of distinguishing
such groups in the setting of finitely-generated residually finite groups by
their profinite completions. Remarkably, the case of the free group is still
open and continues to provide focus for work in this direction. The project also
addresses connections with number theory, algebraic geometry, mapping class
groups, and the topology of higher dimensional hyperbolic manifolds. Among other
objectives is a better understanding of the arithmetic of canonical components
of character varieties of knot groups.
