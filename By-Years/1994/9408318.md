9408318 Jayawickrama The objective of this research is to apply the concept of
System Identification Method (SID) to optimize the use of existing monitoring
well data and to improve the reliability of the site information used in the
characterization of hazardous waste sites. The SID method which has been
successfully employed in many other branches of engineering has never been used
in geotechnical and geo-environmental engineering applications. The method
involves the study of the characteristics of an unknown system by observing how
the system responds to a known stimulus or input.In the proposed research, the
unknown system will be the contaminated site. Data describing the actual system
behavior will be in the form of existing monitoring well data on contaminant
propagation within the site. ***
