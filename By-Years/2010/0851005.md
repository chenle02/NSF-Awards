The PI will investigate the role of turbulent heating in the origin and dynamics
of the solar wind. He will use a combination of 'weak' and 'strong' turbulence
theory to investigate the strength of the so-called "quasi-parallel cascade."
The small scale waves produced by the quasi-parallel cascade have very high
frequencies, and can cause perpendicular ion heating via a cyclotron resonance.
The PI will also use high accuracy test particle calculations to investigate
perpendicular ion heating by low frequency "quasi-2D" turbulence, which is
believed to be the energetically dominant component of solar wind turbulence.
The PI will then incorporate these results into a 1D fluid model of the solar
wind that solves for the radial evolution of the turbulence and plasma
properties. He will test and validate his theoretical results by comparing the
1D fluid model to observations of the temperature profile, temperature
anisotropy, and bulk flow speeds of protons, electrons, alpha particles, and
minor ions in the corona and solar wind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
addresses a key element of the Solar, Heliospheric, and INterplanetary
Environment (SHINE) research program, which is to gain an understanding of the
mechanisms of solar wind heating and to incorporate them into global models,
with the objective of reproducing the observed properties of the solar wind. The
PI is a Science Working Group Leader for the SHINE community and a new member of
the SHINE Steering Committee, where he helps organize SHINE community workshops.
He will continue his active involvement as an instructor at specialized summer
and winter schools for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and advanced
undergraduate students at the University of New Hampshire (UNH). By providing
young scientists with specialized training and exposure to recent developments
in solar physics research, these topical schools promote the integration of
research and education at UNH.
