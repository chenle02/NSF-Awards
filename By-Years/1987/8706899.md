The interaction of plasmas with fluidized beds is of great interest for mass
transformation of solid particulates. Long residence times are available and
extensive exposure can be established until chemical reactions with the ionized
medium are completed. As an example, such reactions involve high frequency
discharges over a wide range of pressures and power density, for the purpose of
alumina reduction or silicon carbide deposition. This capability should lead to
an understanding of a variety of interesting industrial processes: powder
processing, ceramic synthesis and deposition, electronic materials
manufacturing.
