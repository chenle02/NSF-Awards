This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Franklin and Marshall College, which is an
undergraduate school, acquire, maintain and operate a Polarized Specular
Reflectance Microspectrophoto meter. The areas of chemical research that will be
enhanced by the acquisition include: 1) Polarized Specular Reflectance
Spectroscopy on Binuclear Metalloprotein Models and Porphyrinic One-Dimensional
Conductors. 2) Polarized Spectroscopy of Porphyrin Analogs and One- Dimensional
Porphyrinic Conductors. 3) Polarized Electronic Spectroscopy in the
Determination of Solvent Effects on Solution Photophysics. 4) Spectroscopic
Studies of Metalloprotein Active Sites. Polarized specular reflectance
spectroscopy is used to study the spectroscopy of absorption bands, where the
spectral data on structurally defined inorganic complexes correlate the
electronic structure with the geometric features of the metal complexes. This
correlation provides definitive spectral assignments which allows the unique
electronic structures of the complexes to be known.
