The goal of this project is to delineate and understand variability in the
mesosphere-lower thermosphere due to the interaction of atmospheric tides and
planetary waves. The approach is to employ temperature measurements from the
TIMED and EOS satellites, data recorded by ground-based wind radars, and an
observation-driven, nonlinear mechanistic model. Satellite data will be used to
diagnose planetary waves and to recover the spectrum of diurnal tides. Global
tidal winds will be computed from the observed temperature tides, and
synthesized at longitudes and latitudes of individual radars. A comparative
analysis with the radar data will then be used to validate the global tidal
winds and to illuminate the extent to which local temporal variations can be
attributed to global-scale influences including cross-hemisphere coupling. The
underlying mechanisms and origins of tide-planetary wave interaction, including
forcing terms, relative importance compared to other tidal sources and the role
of atmospheric background conditions will be diagnosed from various model runs.
