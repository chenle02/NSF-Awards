Dr. Anand Pandian, of Johns Hopkins University, will investigate questions of
political regionalism and identity through a systematic examination of the use
of place in Indian commercial cinema. India has the largest film industry in the
world, and its films have had a profound impact on public culture. Indian
commercial films make deliberate use of location to provoke affective responses
among projected audiences. The project focuses on the Tamil-language regional
cinema of south India, where filmmakers have sought since the late 1970s to
project cultural identity as an artifact of regional custom and local cultural
practice. However, in the 1990s, localism began to yield to broader currents of
cultural globalization, with film crews traveling thousands of miles to shoot
scenes in far-flung European, Asian, and African localities. With this spatial
shift in mind, the project examines why and how filmmakers in contemporary south
India connect with the emotions of their audiences by working on their spatial
imaginations and what consequences these tactics have regional, national, and
international identity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out
through an intensive ethnographic study of filmmakers and film production
practices in south India: the social worlds and daily practices through which
filmic spaces are manufactured and charged with feeling. Research methods will
include interviews, archival research, participant observation with working film
units, and text analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is important
because it will contribute to social scientific understanding of media
production and the role that media plays in cultural identity. The project also
will contribute to a deeper public understanding of three phenomena: the
cultural forces propelling contemporary globalization; the powerful emotional
effects that media have upon everyday life throughout the world; and the means
by which ordinary experience has itself become mediated by technologies like
cinema and television.
