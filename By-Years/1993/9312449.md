9312449 Sanders The use of isentropic potential vorticity as a tool for studying
the structure and evolution of synoptic-scale atmospheric phenomena is very much
"in vogue". The conservation of potential vorticity is a key assumption. In a
recently completed pilot study using operational analyses from the National
Meteorological Center, Dr. Sanders found evidence suggesting this assumption is
not valid. Under this award, he will further extend his initial study using
higher temporal and spatial resolution information. As part of his
investigation, he will attempt to relate changes in potential vorticity to sub-
grid scale processes in the observed behavior of synoptic systems. Besides its
potential for contributing to improved understanding of the physical processes
involved in synoptic weather systems, the research will force the community to
scrutinize and perhaps better understand the uses and limitations of so-called
"PV thinking". ***
