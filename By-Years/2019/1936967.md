This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award will support the
establishment of a network of operations researchers and a science plan to
address cross-cutting methodological challenges in hazards and disaster
research. An abiding challenge for decision making in the context of hazards and
disasters derives from the need to provide prescriptive (decisional) guidance
under dynamic conditions of sometimes profound uncertainty and risk. Addressing
these challenge requires a renewed focus on identifying potentially high-impact
research problems that lie beyond the boundary of existing disciplinary and
interdisciplinary methods to address. This is particularly true for problems
that involve large-scale, sometimes sustained interaction between human-machine
systems and hazard-related phenomena within a broader policy and social
context.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; This project will establish the Operations and
Systems Engineering Extreme Event Research (OSEEER) network, designed to marshal
both traditional and non-traditional sources of expertise in order to accomplish
three main objectives: first, to create and sustain a network of researchers,
collaborators and other affiliates working within and across operations
engineering-centered areas; second, to stimulate this network through workshops
and early-stage research activities in order to define high-impact,
methodologically challenging problems in the field in the domain of hazards and
disasters; and third, to develop publications and other outputs that establish
preliminary research results and an agenda for future work to address emerging
challenges that will contribute to society's ability to mitigate, respond to and
learn from hazards and disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
