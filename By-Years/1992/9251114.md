Make mathematics courses more relevant| Use technology effectively| Have
students learn experientially and collaboratively| Throughout the nation these
have been clear and urgent calls. A course for liberal arts majors (Math 1010)
is being developed to address these issues. This four- semester-hour course
includes a two-hour laboratory each week in which students learn to solve
problems. They generate data and have group discussions comparing alternative
strategies for solving a problem. Then they give both written and oral
presentations of their solutions. Computer are used for graphing data, for doing
statistics, for solving linear programming and financial problems, and then for
integrating all of these into written reports. Students leave this course with
an appreciation of how mathematics and computers are used as tools in modeling
and problem solving. The goal is that eventually 1,000 Appalachian students will
take this course per year, and that this course will serve as a model for other
schools.
