This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, continues studies of the infrared spectroscopy of molecules adsorbed on
metal surfaces. Detailed reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopic studies of
methyl thiolate, methoxy, and ethylidyne moieties adsorbed on silver,copper, and
rhodium surfaces will be carried out. All of these systems exhibit Fermi
resonance effects which couple the symmetric C-H stretch fundamental with methyl
bending overtones, and serve as excellent models of the important physical
interactions between adsorbate molecules and between the adsorbate and the
surface. The quantitative understanding developed in this work will have wide
applicablility in the use of infrared spectroscopy to study surface chemistry.
%%% The widespread use of infrared spectroscopy to study the mechanisms of
surface chemical processes is a method development which has provided an
increased understanding of a number of important heterogeneous systems. The goal
of this research project is to develop the detailed knowledge of the infrared
spectroscopy of molecules adsorbed at surfaces which will enable the continued
use of infrared to monitor surface reactions. High resolution IR methods provide
a wealth of information, and the results of this research project will be
essential to the development and implementation of these methods.
