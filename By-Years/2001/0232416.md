&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
investigate the feasibility&lt;br/&gt;of developing a technology to optimize
accumulation and subsequent removal of a valuable element from integrated
gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) systems. IGCC is a highly efficient, low-
emissions technology that uses coal and other feed stocks to produce
electricity, process heat, and high-value fuels and chemicals. Deposits
containing a valuable metalloid accumulate in an IGCC system, requiring
significant downtime for&lt;br/&gt;cleaning and loss of revenue. The proposed
technology will lead to recovery of a&lt;br/&gt;metalloid as part of routine
operation of IGCC systems. Metalloid capture will be performed using bench-scale
laboratory equipment with a simulated gasification environment. Bonding
mechanisms will be characterized to determine if spalling of deposits through
thermal cycling and soot blowing is a feasible method of recovering deposits on-
line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This innovation would substantially increase revenue
by providing a marketable product stream and would decrease operating and
maintenance costs by improving the efficiency of the system.&lt;br/&gt;
