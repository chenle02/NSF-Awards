Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this proposed study are to better
understand the behavior of platinum group elements (PGEs) during dehydration of
the downgoing slab and flux melting of the mantle wedge above it. What are the
parent-daughter fractionations that occur and how do these contribute to
creation of mantle heterogeneities. Since the Tonga-Lau basin system is
intraoceanic, the complications due to continental crust can be avoided.
Analyses of Re, PGEs and Os isotopes plus 0 and S isotopes will be done for
existing ODP samples from the Tonga system and old Pacific crust that have been
characterized for other trace elements and isotope systems. Having a well-
characterized suite of representative samples should allow an assessment of the
relative contributions of subducted sediments, altered ocean crust, and the
mantle wedge in arc and back arc volcanic
rocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
