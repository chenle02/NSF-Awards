The purpose of this research is to construct a prototype ex vivo bone marrow and
to analyze its function. The information obtained will be extremely valuable in
understanding the principles of complex organ tissue culture in general, and for
developmental biology of hematopoiesis in particular. The results of this
research would greatly improve the availability and safety of the blood supply
for clinical transfusion therapy, thereby improving the delivery of health care.
