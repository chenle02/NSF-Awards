This research project aims to advance the fundamental knowledge and process
technology for mass-production of lightweight, high-performance injection molded
parts by creating synergistic marriage of two emerging technologies, i.e.,
nanocomposites and microcellular injection molding. Systematic experimental,
analytical, and modeling studies will be conducted to identify the key
processing parameters for microcellular injection molding with nanocomposites
and their effects on materials properties and to advance the understanding and
mathematical modeling of cell nucleation and growth in microcellular plastics
with micro-/nano-scale particles and fibers. Since 1976, plastics have been the
most widely used materials in the U.S., surpassing steel, copper, and aluminum
combined by volume. Among the various plastics processing methods, injection
molding accounts for one-third of all polymers processed.

These research activities and results will be incorporated into the polymer
engineering curricula to stimulate students' interest in advanced research and
education. Students of underrepresented groups will be recruited to participate
in the research through the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
supplement. Close collaboration with industrial partners via the industrial
consortium and the Engineering Outreach Program will be emphasized to facilitate
sharing of expertise and resources, validation of research outcome, transfer of
technology, education of the workforce, and assessment of the economic gain.
Successful execution of this research will have broad impacts in extending the
industrial applications and adoption of nanocomposites and microcellular
injection molding, ultimately helping the U.S. plastics industry to gain
competitive edge in the global marketplace.
