Keil (OCE-9711792) ABSTRACT Keil OCE-9711792 Geochemists have long recognized
the potential importance of mineral surfaces in protecting and preserving marine
organic matter (OM) in aquatic sediments. This proposal seeks to further out
understanding of OM preservation by evaluating in more detail the organic
mineral to mineral surface area ratio (OM:SA) which has recently been shown by
this PI and others to be useful for evaluating OM preservation in marine
sediments. The proposed measurements are aimed at answering fundamental
questions in marine geochemistry about the factors and processes that form and
mold the OM:SA relationship. A wide range of approaches will be used to evaluate
marine sediments, including: a combination of probing techniques (X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV photooxidation, density fractionation);
adsorbing extracted organic matter to know mineral phases; and, conducting
microbial degradation experiments. The PI will conduct these experiments on
samples collected from contrasting redox environments and OM:SA settings. The
proposed studies build on successful experiments previously conducted by the PI
and should lead to a significant advancement in our understanding of OM
preservation in ocean sediments.
