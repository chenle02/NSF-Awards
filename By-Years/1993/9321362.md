9321362 SIMS The scarcity of black pearl oysters is the single greatest
constraint to expansion of this industry. Many Pacific atoll lagoons are
suitable for pearl farming, but simply lack the oysters. The Hawaiian subspecies
of black pearl oysters (P.Margaritifera galtsoffi) was once common in the
islands, but was heavily overfished for pearl shell. Only remnants of the
population remain. Re-establishment of pearl oyster stocks in Hawaii could lead
to a small commercial fishery for pearl shell. The development of a commercial
black pearl hatchery using the local oysters is the necessary first step in
developing and implementing pearl culture in Hawaii. This research will assess
the technical and financial feasibility of land-based as well as ocean-based
grow-out techniques designed to accommodate conditions found in Hawaii and other
S. Pacific Island groups. In addition, the establishment of a quarantine
hatchery to produce stock from other S. Pacific Islands, e.g., Christmas Island,
could lead to joint venture farms with these various island groups. If
successful, this project would lead to a competitive pearl oyster culture
operation and enhance the economic status of the region.
