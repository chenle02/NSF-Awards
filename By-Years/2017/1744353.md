This research is focused on the study of how gas-phase species are converted to
and processed in tropospheric aerosols. The proposed experiments represent an
innovative approach to understanding the nature of the chemical interactions
between reactive gases and organic matter in the presence of transition metal
ions at air-aqueous interfaces. The results are expected to provide new
information on the formation and evolution of tropospheric aerosols, especially
those that are known to have adverse health impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
effort includes a systematic study of gas-liquid reactions taking place on the
surface of aqueous and aqueous/water soluble organic solutions of selected
substrates, exposed to the major gaseous O3, H2O2 and NO2 oxidants in ambient
air under experimental conditions relevant to the troposphere. The central aim
is to map the dependence of the extent of Fenton chemistry on: (1) pH, (2) the
nature of typical organic substrates, either alone or in synthetic mixtures, (3)
the presence of ligands representative of those found in secondary organic
aerosol, as well as sequestering ligands, and (4) the presence of Cu ions. The
project will provide new data to improve models of interfacial reactions on
organic material in the atmosphere.
