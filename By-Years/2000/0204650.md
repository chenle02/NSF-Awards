ABSTRACT DMS - 0204650.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We plan to study isoperimetric
inequalities for Dirichlet eigenvalues of&lt;br/&gt;biharmonic operator in
dimensions greater than 3, for the sums of reciprocals&lt;br/&gt;Neumann
eigenvalues, for the Willmore functional of a surface,
isoperimetric&lt;br/&gt;inequalities for Dirichlet Laplacian with Bonnesen type
term.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By isoperimetric inequality we mean any inequality
relating two or more domain&lt;br/&gt;functionals (defined on the same domain)
which is such that the equality sign&lt;br/&gt;actually holds for some domain of
the class under consideration (or in some&lt;br/&gt;appropriate limiting sense).
There are still some open fundamental questions in&lt;br/&gt;this classical
area.&lt;br/&gt;
