The project has two major goals. The first goal is to uncover specific
information about the response of various physical systems (described by
boundary value problems for partial differential equations) to the presence of
inhomogeneities (defects), the spacing of these inhomogeneities, or parametric
changes in the boundary conditions. Emphasis is placed on developing very
precise asymptotic formulas and a priori estimates that may help to assess the
accuracy of these formulas. The work largely (but not exclusively) focuses on
steady state and time harmonic situations, considering scalar equations as well
as systems (in particular Maxwell's equations). Significant effort will be
invested in accurate characterization of the response for a wide range of
frequencies. The second goal is to demonstrate how to use such structural
knowledge about the nature of the response, in combination with measured data
(say, from an accessible part of boundary, or from the "far field") to
effectively infer information about the parameters of the system (e.g., the
location and the character of the inhomogeneities). Special attention will be
given to methods that effectively use a wide range of frequencies to improve
reconstructions.

This project investigates fundamental mathematical problems that underlie
nondestructive inspection of hidden aspects of objects. Three particular imaging
applications concern ground penetrating radar (e.g., for anti-personnel mine
detection) eddy current imaging (e.g.. for corrosion assessment), and optimal
imaging (for biomedical applications). This work will form a basis for the
design of detection (and location) algorithms that are more precise (less
sensitive to noise) and much faster than those currently in use. The project
will develop software of use to practitioners that will be made publicly
available. The work may lead to the development of a theoretical framework that
will be useful in many other contexts as well.
