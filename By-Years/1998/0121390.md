This project is collecting solid earth science data sets and complementing them
with a system of easy-to-use, interactive user tools to provide a dynamic and
engaging learning environment for students at all levels ranging from K-12, to
undergraduate, graduate, and lifelong learners. In addition, evaluation of the
system for use in undergraduate and high school classes is underway. Through
this project a unique digital library environment is created for users to
interactively study the same data sets that earth science researchers are
utilizing to learn about the dynamics of the planet, and how changes in the
earth system affect daily life. In addition, collaboration with the staff of the
Cornell University libraries enables the investigation of the requirements
needed to maintain a persistent digital collection. Partial co-funding for this
project is being provided by the Division of Earth Sciences in NSF's Geosciences
Directorate.
