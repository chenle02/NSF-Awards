9417404 Dick This is an accomplishment based renewal of the principal
investigator's long term studies of abyssal peridotites. The principal
investigator will study the harzburgite-dunite complex drilled at the Hess Deep
by the Ocean Drilling Program Leg 147, the composition of the East Pacific Rise
mantle from rocks dredged from fracture zones, determine a North Atlantic
melting trend from dredges peridotites, and continue studies of abyssal
plagioclase peridotites. ***
