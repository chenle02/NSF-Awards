"Slickensides" are surfaces of weakness formed in stiff clays as a result of
large shear displacements - on the order of 50 mm to 250 mm - concentrated on a
discrete surface of sliding. Platy clay particles become aligned parallel to the
surface of sliding, resulting in the formation of a smooth surface with shear
strength that is much lower than the strength of the adjacent clay through which
the slickensided surface forms.

As a result of this low shear strength in comparison with the adjacent clay,
slickensided rupture surfaces are likely loci of displacements during
earthquakes. However, there have been no studies of the behavior of slickensided
surfaces when subjected to the rapid cyclic loading that occurs during
earthquakes. As a result, engineers must rely on assumption and judgment when
estimating strengths for seismic deformation analyses, and these vary
considerably among practicing engineers. For example, for one particular project
in northern California, the difference of opinion regarding the shear strength
that should be used resulted in recommendations for stabilization of the slopes
that differed in cost by a factor of ten. At present, there is no way to
determine whether one of these designs was dangerously inadequate, or the other
was wasteful overkill.

The broader impacts of this research program include opportunities for
undergraduate and graduate students to participate in the laboratory experiments
at Virginia Tech, and for freshman through senior-level students to observe the
centrifuge experiments at UC Davis, and to work as assistants in preparing the
centrifuge models. Both UC Davis and Virginia Tech have very active programs to
recruit minority students to participate in research through the Minority
Opportunities for Research in Engineering at UC Davis, and the Office of
Minority Engineering Programs and coalition with Historically Black Colleges and
Universities at Virginia Tech. The project also involves an active collaboration
with Dr. Binod Tiwari of Niigata University, who has considerable experience in
the types of experiments involved and will spend time at Virginia Tech and UC
Davis, which will help to establish closer relationships between researchers in
Japan and in the United States.
