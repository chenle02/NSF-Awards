0335625&lt;br/&gt;Williams, Philip J.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas Program
award will provide support for a dissertation research project for Ms. Julia
Albarracin under the direction of Dr. Philip J. Williams, University of Florida,
Gainesville. Ms. Albarracin will work in Buenos Aires, Argentina with Dr. Luis
Bogado Poisson on the study of market and non-market factors in Argentina
immigration policy from 1973-1999. They will use statistical analysis, in
combination with qualitative research, to study Argentina, a country that,
despite being a major receiver of immigration, has been understudied and will
produce immigration research beyond the North Atlantic. This will provide new
insights on the impact of economic, cultural and international factors on
immigration policy outcomes while paying attention to state decision-making
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
