The University of California Riverside Nematode Collection (UCRNC) is one of
the largest museums of economically important plant parasitic nematodes in the
world, with 13,000 vials of bulked specimens and nearly 150,000 specimens
mounted on 32,000 slides for microscopic examination. The collection is used by
scientists from throughout the world, studying nematodes for research in many
disciplines including agriculture, ecology, genetics, taxonomy, evolution, and
invertebrate zoology. The collection conserves original specimens from
descriptions of new species, voucher specimens as a record of previous research,
and specimens from worldwide surveys which provide insight into the diversity of
nematodes. Since nematodes are one of the most abundant and diverse
multicellular organisms, since they frequently serve as a convenient model for
research in fundamental biology, and since in some developing countries plant
parasitic forms are the limiting factor in agriculture, efficient museum
resources are essential. Previous NSF support provided convenient accessible
fireproof storage and reliable updating of records through computerization of
UCRNC, but funding was only adequate for storage and updating of records for
two-thirds of the collection. The present proposal is to extend these
improvements to the remainder of the collection and allow secure storage which
will accommodate modest growth (3000 additional slides). Computerization of
records will not only allow quick access of available material but will provide
for careful monitoring of loaned specimens and cross-indexing according to
species, host, geographical area, preparation technique, date of collection or
preparation, taxonomic category, literature reference and other parameters.
Computerization of UCRNC will also provide a model for efficient cataloguing of
other museums. A common format for similar nematology collections will allow
eventual storage of records of several collections on a single computer for
widespread accessibility of the combined data.
