9416760 Johnson This study will determine whether areas of concentrated damage
to houses, roads and other structures can be ascribed to areas of localized
ground deformation along buried faults during the January 17, 1994 Northridge
earthquake. Preliminary investigations have identified zones of fracturing in
the vicinity of Tampa Avenue and Balboa Avenue. Details of ground deformation
will be assessed with pre- and post-earthquake ground surveys and aerial
photographs. measurements of changes in length of lines between manhole covers,
fire hydrants, etc. will be used to prepare a detailed, two-dimensional strain
grid map. The results will indicate whether the localized damage in the stud
areas after the Northridge event was due primarily to ground deformation, or to
some other mechanism such as shaking in valley fill, and will thus help in
evaluating the seisin hazard of other areas of the Los Angeles basin that
contain buried faults.
