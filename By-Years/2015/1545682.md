The Cognitive Development Society seeks to promote the attendance of young
scholars from groups traditionally underrepresented in the field at its 2015
meeting taking place October 9-10 in Columbus, OH. The award will support travel
awards to students, post-docs and young investigators from underrepresented
groups. To promote networking and professional socialization for these awardees,
funds will also support a new mentoring program to ensure a positive and
productive conference experience for the young scholars.

The mentoring program will match each young scholar with a more experienced
scholar in the field, one with similar research interests. Through an organized
meeting at the start of the conference with their mentors, mentees will have the
opportunity to forge new professional relationships and broaden their academic
network. The young scholars will also be promoted at the conference by being
acknowledged during an awards ceremony. Mentors will also support their mentees
by attending the young scholars' presentations. These activities are intended to
ensure that attending the CDS 2015 conference is a positive and productive
experience for young scholars from traditionally underrepresented groups, and to
increase the likelihood that attending the conference will yield a positive
impact that endures beyond the conference itself.
