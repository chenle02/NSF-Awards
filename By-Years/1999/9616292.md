This starter grant award to Arizona State University supports the research of
Professor Karl S. Booksh. The research addresses a multivariate optical
methodology for quantitation employing a scanning acousto-optic tunable filter.
The method optically constructs and integrates a multivariate regression vector
with the filter. Thus, quantitation requires accessing a single channel detector
only twice, eliminating the need for an expensive multichannel detector and
minimizing the effect of read and thermal noise on quantitation. Initial
applications of the methodology are quantitation of benzene homologues in
natural waters by fluorescence spectroscopy and quantitation of xylene isomers
in benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene mixtures. The research is an
advance in instrument design and data analysis bringing new power to the field
of optical measurements for chemical analysis. Many applications are possible,
particularly in petrochemical analysis.
