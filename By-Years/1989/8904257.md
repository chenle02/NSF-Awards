Paleozoic plate reconstructions rely on apparent polar wander paths for
continental blocks as determined by paleo- magnetic records from strata in
stable cratonic areas. By comparison of paleomagnetic records from different
blocks, latitudinal separations can be determined. Currently, due to the
widespread presence of younger overprints, a large and tectonically important
gap exists in the mid Paleozoic APWP record of the Early and Middle Devonian of
North America. To fill this gap and to avoid overprints (commonly associated
with magnetite), a sampling program for fossiliferous limestones and red
dolomites that outcrop between Iowa and the Northwest Territories of Canada will
be conducted. Results should help establish a reliable APWP for cratonic North
America for this interval.
