Jochen Autschbach of the State University of New York at Buffalo is supported by
a CAREER award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program within
the Division of Chemistry for research involving the theoretical calculation of
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) parameters. The influence of the chemical and
physical environment, the prediction of structure-specific magnetic response
properties, and the structural and electronic origins of nonlinear chiroptical
effects are all being investigated. It is expected that the measurement of the
tensorial character of NMR parameters and absolute shielding scales for heavy
nuclei by experimentalists will be improved by this research. The project is
having a broader impact not only on the experimental investigation of NMR
properties but in the educational setting, specifically through the development
of textbook-level descriptions of structure-response relationships. In addition,
a piece of software is being developed that will be freely downloadable to
members of the scientific community.
