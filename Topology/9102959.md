This project concerns the symmetry groups of shift dynamical systems and smooth
manifolds. Ideas from algebraic K-theory are applicable to each area and form a
common theme between them. The investigator will continue to study the algebraic
and homological properties of symmetries of one-dimensional sub- shifts of
finite type (SFT's), sofic, and other shift dynamical systems. These systems
arise in a number of contexts, including dynamics, information theory, and
statistical mechanics. Their symmetries are often called invertible or
reversible cellular automata. He will also study similar questions for higher
dimensional Markov shifts and their symmetries. The classic Alexander polynomial
of a knot in three- dimensional space is closely linked to the algebraic
K-theory group K1. Recently, other polynomial invariants have been found for
these knots, starting with the work of Vaughan Jones. Pseudo-isotopies and
diffeomorphisms of manifolds in a wide range of cases (including knot
complements) have invariants involving the algebraic K-theory group K2. The
investigator will examine whether it is possible to define new invariants of
diffeomorphisms of knot complements and other 3-manifolds in analogy with the
new knot polynomials. The commonality of method here is surprising. A deep and
highly evolved algebraic theory, K-theory, is to be brought to bear upon
symmetry questions which are very far apart in appearance. On the one hand are
subtle topological questions about knots. On the other hand are subtle
combinatorial and statistical questions about infinite strings of symbols. The
latter application has already borne substantial fruit.
