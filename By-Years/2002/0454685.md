This project will examine the behavior of the ring current under different solar
wind conditions and during different phases of the solar cycle. The mechanisms
by which solar wind energy is coupled into the magnetosphere will also be
examined. Data from ground-based magnetometers as well as data from in situ
spacecraft measurements will be utilized to characterize the status of the ring
current. This will allow an improved understanding of the dynamics of the ring
current, particularly during different phases of a magnetic storm. The work will
be performed at the University of Texas El Paso (UTEP), a university that has
traditionally served an under-represented minority (Hispanic) in scientific
research. The grant will fund students working on Master's theses as well as a
number of undergraduate research projects. It is likely that one or more of the
graduate students will go on to earn a Ph.D. in space physics or a closely
related field. The project will also develop space-science-focused Peer
Instruction concept questions. These questions will be collected and
disseminated via the NSF-supported Project Galileo website. By disseminating the
results through Project Galileo the material will effect physics education not
only at UTEP but at many other institutions as well.
