The Drew Saturday Science Academy Summer Camp will be a (4) week residential
SMET enrichment activity for (16) minority middle school students in south
Central Los Angeles. The goal of the program is to increase and improve the pool
of qualified minority students pursuing science, math, engineering, and
technological educational pathways. Program objectives include: 1) Increasing
the number of students successfully completing algebra and geometry; 2)
Improving the analytical reading and critical thinking skills of these students;
3) Involving parents by increasing their awareness of what students need to
succeed in SMET Careers; 4) Improve computer literacy; 5) Demonstrating
knowledge of exploratory research modalities; and 6) Demonstrate increased
awareness of science, math, engineering and technological career opportunities.
This will be accomplished using the themes of space, flight and aeronautics in
hands-on labs. Using the approach it is anticipated that students will be more
inclined to continue on the SMET educational pathway. ***
