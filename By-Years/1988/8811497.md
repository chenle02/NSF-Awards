A major long range goal in the study of muscle contraction is to explain the
physiological responses of muscle fibers in terms of the kinetics and energetics
of the interaction of actin and myosin. The proposed work will approach this
goal by measuring the mechanics of contraction of single permeable skeletal
muscle fibers under a variety of conditions. These data will be used to refine
models of the complex chemomechanics of the contractile interaction. Our
previous work has characterized the effect of ligands on the shortening of fast
skeletal fibers. An extension of this approach to slow muscle and to lengthening
of fast and slow fibers will produce new data defining the interaction of MgATP
and other ligands with the contractile proteins. Additional correlations linking
muscle physiology to the biochemistry of the acto-S1 interaction will be
determined by comparing the response of active fibers to the kinetics of the
acto-S1 interacton using a series of different nucleotides modified at either
the base or the ribose ring. In an extension of previous studies, using recently
developed methods, studies originally performed at 10 degrees C will be
performed at more physiological temperatures. Preliminary results show that the
response of the fibers to alterations in MgATP or pH may be quite different at
higher temperatures. Together the data obtained in the above studies will lead
to a more detailed model of the energetics of the cross-bridge states involved
in substrate binding and in product release. The results of this research will
contribute to our understanding of the basic biochemical mechanisms underlying
muscle contraction.
