Rock magnetic studies have entered a new phase of high- sensitivity analysis,
in which it is possible to unravel the physics of magnetism at the level of
single magnetic grains. The PI will do a suite of experiments to study magnetic
domain behavior and hysteresis loops of single particles, using the magneto-
optical Kerr effect and an alternating force magnetometer. The two primary goals
of this work are: 1: To determine whether the behavior of a large assemblage of
particles is well-represented by he behavior of an average grain making up the
assemblage. 2. To extract microphysical data that are critical to understanding
the hysteresis behavior of single particles.
