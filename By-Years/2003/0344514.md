PI: Charles Locurto Title: Individual differences in mouse cognition

This work is inspired by one of the most often studied aspects of human
cognition: If human subjects are given a battery of cognitive tasks, the almost
universal finding is that all the tasks correlate positively. That is, subjects
who do well on one task tend to do well on others. This consistency suggests
that a general mechanism or small set of common mechanisms may underlie
different forms of cognition. That possibility, in turn, has given rise to
numerous experimental efforts to locate the fundamental process or processes
that underlie these positive correlations. These experiments ask whether that
same finding of positive correlations across cognitive tasks is true in
nonhumans. Mice were chosen at the outset of this work because one of the long-
term goals is to identify the genes that underlie any correlations that are
found. They are the ideal model through which to study the genetic foundations
of individual differences in cognition. The studies completed to date indicated
that as the nature of the cognitive tasks and motivational systems used in this
work have been made more diverse, the results have less and less resembled the
common finding in humans of a general mechanism. The results at this junction
appear more congenial to a modular rather than to a general-process
interpretation. Instead of one robust general mechanism, the results in mice
suggest that different and independent processes underlie performance on
different tasks. These results have far-reaching implications. One of the
central issues in the field of comparative cognition has always been the
relationship between humans and other animals. What makes us unique? What do we
share with other species? If a general mechanism is evident in humans but is
absent in animals, this distinction may prove as important as the distinction
inherent in the long-standing controversy concerning whether animals and humans
differ with respect to linguistic abilities.
