The project will provide a new examination of postwar American science by
focusing on the national laboratory system. The national labs continue to occupy
a central place in the American scientific landscape. This project will examine
the path they have traveled and how it was chosen. Specifically it will focus on
the history of the national laboratory system during the tenure of the Atomic
Energy Commission, in order to shed light on the implications of systemicity and
the negotiation of research programs among the labs. The project will integrate
two approaches. An overview will place the national laboratory system in its
historical context, describe its evolution, and address general issues about the
system. Within this overview, three case studies will exemplify the workings of
the system for different aspects and different periods. In particular, the case
studies will shed light on the implications of systemicity and the negotiation
of research programs among the labs.
