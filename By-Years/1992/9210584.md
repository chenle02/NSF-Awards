This proposal is to examine the role of regulation of gene expression by
progestins, and to determine the importance of a third class of progesterone
receptor protein (progesterone receptor protein C) interactions with two
previously identified receptors. The progesterone receptor C may have a negative
regulatory effect on receptors of the A or B class, by combining with them and
then reducing their responses to progestins. The C receptor protein appears to
be missing one of the two zinc fingers possessed by the A and B proteins, but
contains other features of these proteins, allowing mixed dimers to form. The
start site of transcription will be determined; a putative site (met 595) has
been identified by the P.I., but needs to be further characterized. %%%
Progesterone is a steroid hormone which binds to intracellular receptors and
affects gene expression in both males and females. The mechanism of this
regulation is not known. Two types of receptor have been described; this
proposal deals with a third type, which may have a negative interaction with the
first two types. Its production from cDNA and its interactions with the A and B
class of progestin receptors will be investigated.
