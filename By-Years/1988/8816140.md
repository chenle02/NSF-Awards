Strong arguments support the view that interactions of matter with a
supermassive black hole give rise to the diverse phenomena associated with
active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, the details of these interactions are
poorly understood. Theoretical research aimed at augmenting our understanding of
the microphysics of accretion onto black holes, jet formation, and the processed
responsible for spectrum formation in AGNs will be carried out. Using analytic
and numerical techniques, the following will be studied: 1) the thermal states
of gas in the central engines of AGNs and their effects on the production of AGN
spectra; 2) the roles of electron-positron pair creation and other high energy
processes in the production of AGN spectra; 3) the effects of radiation drag on
the hydromagnetic acceleration of relativistic jets and winds; and 4) the
radiative signatures of jet formation. Through carrying AGNs, and facilitate the
interpretation of observations.
