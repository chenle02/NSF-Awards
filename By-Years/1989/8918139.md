This research project is devoted to the study of the physical properties of
amorphous and multilayered metallic alloys. The experimental techniques to be
employed are resistivity measurements, especially low-temperature magneto-
resistivity, and X-ray diffraction. The samples to be studied will be thin films
prepared by magnetron sputtering. The research objectives are: 1) to test
current theories of electron motion in disordered conductors; 2) to investigate
the electron transport properties of compositionally modulated thin metallic
films; 3) to increase the general understanding of electron scattering processes
in solids.
