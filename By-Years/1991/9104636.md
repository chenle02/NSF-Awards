Professor Kaminker will investigate a number of problems: (i) the use of
operator algebras and cyclic cohomology in the index theory of elliptic
operators, (ii) the leafwise Toeplitz extension on a foliated manifold, (iii)
the theory of higher eta invariants which will be applied to obtain information
about algebraic K- theory, (iv) cyclic cohomology and elliptic boundary value
problems, and (v) secondary invariants for commuting n-tuples of operators.
These problems all involve Hilbert space operators and their relation to the
geometric properties of manifolds, the higher dimensional analogues of surfaces.
Elliptic operators play a large role in this work. Such operators occur in many
of the partial differential equations of applied mathematics and physics.
