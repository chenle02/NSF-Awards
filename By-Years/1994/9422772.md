The preservation of biodiversity is widely recognized to be an important
national aim. Yet, very little actual help is available, even at a high level of
abstraction, to guide policy makers towards the goal of optimally preserving
biodiversity in a world of limited budgets. It is not even clear how to give a
quantitative description of what policy makers are actually doing in practice.
The main objective of this study is to create a normative and descriptive
framework for analyzing the economics of biodiversity preservation. On the
normative side, the goal is to construct a cost-benefit methodology that can be
used to rank priorities among biodiversity preserving projects. The basic
ranking criterion is a specific formula that, for the case of endangered
species, combines an appropriate measure of "distinctiveness" with direct
utility, change in survival probability, and cost. A rigorous justification for
this ranking criterion is provided by a straightforward optimization model. On
the descriptive side, the goal is to combine a number of biological and economic
data sets to investigate econometrically the "revealed preference" behind
spending on endangered species. Some very preliminary results seem to indicate
that the "visceral" direct utility factor is far more important than the more
"scientific" factors of distinctiveness, survival probability, or cost. ***
