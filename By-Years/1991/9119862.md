This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will aid in
purchasing a state-of-the-art high energy, multi-sector, tandem mass
spectrometer in the Department of Chemistry at the Emory University. The
research studies to be performed include investigating structures of
polyoxometalates and the chemistry of radical cations, structures of unusual
peptides and peptides from enzymatic cleavages of proteins, structures of
synthetic and unknown naturally-occuring sphingoid bases and related
biomolecules (e.g., glycosphingolipids), and structures of synthetic lipids and
host molecules. One investigator is investigating fundamental aspects of gas-
phase ion chemistry and is developing methods in analytical mass spectrometry.
Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details
and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic
and organometallic molecules. The range of tandem-mass spectrometic analysis
affords the chemist one of the most powerful tools available for the
characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this capability in mass
spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier research in many
fields of chemistry.
