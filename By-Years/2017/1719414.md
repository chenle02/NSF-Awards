Implementation projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, and assess strategies that can lead
to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students
receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening
STEM education and research. The project at Fisk University seeks to establish
the foundation for building STEM student success. The goal of the project is to
prepare students to contribute in an enduring way to new knowledge as a result
of more competitive preparation for graduate school and
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities that are part of this project are:
increasing students' deeper learning and successful transition to advanced
courses by supplementary instruction into General Biology and College Algebra
courses; increasing student confidence and competence in quantitative and
computational approaches related to the biological sciences; and increasing
enriched faculty-mentored undergraduate research opportunities across the STEM
disciplines assured by intentional quantitative and computational integration
into courses and faculty research collaborations. The activities and strategies
are evidence-based and will inform further efforts by the institution to
strengthen STEM undergraduate education.
