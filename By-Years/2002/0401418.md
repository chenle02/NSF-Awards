Dr. Cruz is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to
carry out a program of research and education at the American Museum of Natural
History in New York City. Using the recently launched SIRTF space telescope, Dr.
Cruz will search for the coolest, lowest-mass brown dwarfs known as Y dwarfs.
Also, she will explore the detailed characteristics of M and L dwarfs using a
statistically complete sample culled from the 2MASS database.

Dr. Cruz will also lead the effort to implement programming at the AMNH that
will foster gender and ethnic diversity in science at all educational levels.
She will develop a program that will customize AMNH's exiting interactive
science programs to satisfy requirements for a new Girl Scout badge program in
space and science. Dr. Cruz will also develop activities focused on the career
development of women and minorities in science and will participate as a mentor
in research programs for high school and undergraduate students.
