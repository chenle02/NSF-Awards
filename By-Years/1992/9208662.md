Long-term evolutionary adaptation to temperature will be measured
experimentally in the bacterium Escherichia coli. Originally the founding
experimental line (the ancestor) was maintained at 37 C. Subsequently, groups of
replicated lines were obtained after 2000 generations of exposure to 32 C, 42 C,
and a daily alternation between them, as well as control lines which were
maintained at 37 C. These experiments will determine the mechanisms by which
each of these groups adapted to their respective temperatures. Measured
variables will include changes in synthetic and transport capacities, stress
resistance, and population growth performance. Lines will also be selected at
higher (&gt;42 C) temperatures to determine whether the upper thermal limit can
be extended and the correlated changes responsible for increased temperature
tolerance. The research proposes to address the following questions: --How
rapidly can biological systems respond evolutionarily to environmental change?
--Does prior evolutionary history in one environment condition or predispose
ability to adapt to novel environments? --Does adaptation to a particular
environment proceed by similar mechanisms or are there as many solutions as
adaptive events? Specific issues addressed by this research include the rate and
limits of adaptation in diverse thermal environments, the extent of trade-offs
during adaptive evolution, the effect of historical environment on further
adaptation, the concordance of mechanistic adaptations during evolution in
similar environments, and environmental effects on mutational processes.
