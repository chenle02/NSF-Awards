ABSTRACT CHE-9319400 PI: Trogler Inst: U of Cal San Diego With this grant, the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports research
on reactions of carbon disulfide and carbonyl sulfide relevant to their behavior
in the atmospheric sulfur cycle by Dr. William C. Trogler of the Chemistry
Department, University of California at San Diego. Photoinduced oxidation with
molecular oxygen, solution hydrolysis reactions including photochemistry, and
catalytic oxidation by metal oxide components of aerosols will be investigated.
Carbonyl sulfide, a regulated emission product, is an impurity in refinery and
synthesis gas which can cause technical problems as a catalyst poison. Carbon
disulfide is a neurotoxic byproduct of the production of rayon and carbon black.
The fundamental chemistry of these atmospheric gases will be better
characterized in order to understand the atmospheric sulfur cycle. In addition,
their role in the production of stratospheric sulfate aerosols, which effect
solar reflectivity and have been linked to global ozone depletion, will be
examined.
