9224660 Ozsoyoglu SDB: Scientific Database Research for Polymers and Materials
Engineering Needs This is the first year funding of a four-year continuing
award. This research project develops a system for managing data generated by
fracture study experiments in Polymers and Materials Engineering. The experiment
data produced by materials engineers is large and has several data types that
include summary data, image data, spatial data, and temporal data obtained by
applying differing amounts of multiaxial stresses to materials at different
times. The types of queries on the experiment data include statistical queries,
matching queries, mapping queries, and temporal queries. The project involves
integrating technologies from spatial and object-oriented databases,
computational geometry, and image processing. New data structures, data models,
query languages and query processing techniques that enable efficient storage
and retrieval of data are designed. And a prototype scientific database
management system is developed and tested. Such an integrated data management
environment will benefit the researchers in polymers and materials engineering
disciplines. Furthermore, the essential principles abstracted in this project
can be used for data management in other disciplines. ***
