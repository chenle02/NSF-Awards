9453026 Fuhrman The Consortium for Policy Research in Education (CPRE) proposes
to study the relationship between the Urban Systemic Initiatives (USI), the
Statewide Initiatives (SSI), the Goals 2000 Initiatives, and other state reforms
in selected states. The primary purpose is to "map" the substantive, policy
between NSF supported activities and the larger context of state, local and
federal initiatives, including Goals 2000. A related purpose is to advance
understanding of how ambitious educational improvement initiatives can best
navigate and enhance city-state relationships.
