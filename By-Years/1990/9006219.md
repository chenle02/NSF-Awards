With this award the principal investigator will continue his numerical analysis
of scalar hyperbolic equations in one space dimension, in order to derive
improved error bounds and to extend his techniques to systems of such equations
in higher space dimensions. In particular, he will employ Besov space
approximation theory to develop an improved regularity theory for scalar
conservation laws that is applicable to moving mesh numerical methods. He will
also attempt to extend moving mesh finite element methods to systems of
equations by providing a theoretical justification for some practical moving
mesh algorithms in current use. There are many methods available today for the
numerical solution of a single partial differential equation in one space
variable, but only a precious few of these methods can be used to solve systems
of such equations in more than one space variable. One reason for this is that
many methods lack a solid theoretical foundation. With this award the principal
investigator will continue developing theoretical justifications for certain
numerical schemes in the hope that better schemes for higher-dimensional systems
can be found.
