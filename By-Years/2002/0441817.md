This project investigates the areas of harmonic analysis and wavelets concerning
the mathematical theory of multi- dimensional wavelet expansions. One of the
fundamental problems of the subject is how to construct higher dimensional
wavelet bases with desired characteristics, e.g., wavelets with good time-
frequency properties. These areas of research have seen significant progress due
to the contributions of I. Daubechies, R. Coifman, and Y. Meyer, along with many
others. However, the majority of research has been concentrated on isotropic
theory, leaving many questions involving non- isotropic wavelet theory
unanswered. The proposer will investigate this theory of non-isotropic wavelets
from three directions. The first is to study non-isotropic analogues of the
standard function spaces associated with expansive dilations. In particular, to
examine characterization by wavelet expansions of Calderon-Zygmund operators
associated with non-isotropic dilations. The second is to construct orthogonal
wavelets with good time-frequency localization for large classes of non-
isotropic expansive dilations. The third is to identify non- isotropic expansive
dilations for which the construction of well-localized wavelets is impossible.

More generally, this proposal represents work on wavelet analysis which is a
powerful technique in harmonic analysis. This technique has produced wide-
ranging applications to signal and image processing, such as the JPEG 2000 image
compression system. It is expected that further research on multi- dimensional
non-isotropic wavelets will continue to produce many other contributions in pure
and applied mathematics.
