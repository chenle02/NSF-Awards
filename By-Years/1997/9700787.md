Stembridge 9700787 The proposer intends to continue his research into the
applications of combinatorial methods to algebraic problems, and conversely, the
use of algebraic methods in combinatorial enumeration. The specific topics
include the study of pattern avoidance and enumeration of reduced expressions in
Coxeter groups, permutation characters arising in the cohomology of the toric
variety of a Weyl chamber, use of the group algebra of the symmetric group to
study immanant inequalities, and the study of generating functions for
generalized tableaux associated with partially ordered sets. In addition, the
proposer intends to continue developing free software to assist research in
these areas, and in particular, to develop a new version of a package for
working with root systems, Coxeter groups, and characters of semisimple Lie
algebras. This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the
goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete
collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is
extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design of large
networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of
algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this
makes use of combinatorial research.
