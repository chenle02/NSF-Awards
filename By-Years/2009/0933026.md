This Ethics and Education in Science and Engineering award to Michigan
Technological University (MTU) and the University of Texas-Pan American
(UTPA)will deliver ethics education to STEM graduate students using Web 2.0
technologies (blogs and wikis), mediated by content experts and delivered
through the university library. Web 2.0 technologies offer two benefits compared
to traditional classroom or programmed online instruction: they are
asynchronous, which will enable graduate students, particularly those with
English as a second language and demanding schedules, to participate in a
relaxed and reflective manner, and they support an active, collaborative
learning process to develop understanding of complex ethical concepts. In the
first two years of this project, intellectual property and copyright experts
will develop a web-based content library and engage diverse student teams at MTU
in ethical problem-solving through online conversation and collaborative
writing. In the third year of the project, the design will be replicated at
UTPA, which is an Hispanic Serving Institution. A goal of the project is to
demonstrate how university libraries can partner with offices of research
integrity to improve responsible conduct of research (RCR). The infrastructure
developed for this project - content library, exemplar problems, blogs and wikis
- can be expanded to cover a full range of RCR issues. Moreover, there is
potential to scale the infrastructure for asynchronous ethics education to
multi-university consortia with a distributed network of content experts
creating a community of practice in ethics education facilitated by university
libraries.
