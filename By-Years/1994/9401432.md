94-01432 Geisler This project is the first phase of a comprehensive national
study of federal laboratories which will identify the main variables that
influence the actual transfer of technology from the laboratories to industrial
companies. Specifically, the study focuses organizational and managerial
factors, in combination with factors related to technical capabilities and
attitudes and orientation of researchers and managers in federal laboratories.
These factors will be classified as "barriers" or "facilitators" to the transfer
process, and their level of importance in influencing the successful transfer
will be established the research significance is in the study's approach which
combines organizational factors with attitudinal and technical characteristics
of researchers considered key factors in the successful transfer of technology
to industrial companies. The practical significance is in the incorporation of
the findings from this study into the decision making process of the
laboratories and industrial companies, as well as other federal agencies
involved with technology and federal laboratories. The methodology includes the
selection of a sample of researchers and managers from federal laboratories. In
phase 1 questionnaire will be mailed to the sample and the results analyzed. In
phase two a sample of industrial companies will be selected and interviews
conducted with corporate R & D executives to assess the level of success of
transfer of technology from the federal laboratories to their companies.
