9514150 Ganezer In this RUI proposal Professor Ganezer requests support for the
study of solar neutrinos at an experiment known as Super-Kamiokande. This
project will provide a unique opportunity for an ethnically diverse group of
students to participate in a state-of-the-art experiment that is of major
interest in Physics and Astronomy. ***
