This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made to Dr. Regina Liu
of the Department of Statistics, Rutgers University. Dr. Liu will continue her
work on three topics: multivariate data analysis via data depths, a unified
theory of resampling, and robust estimation based on trimming. The NSF Faculty
Award for Women recognizes the high quality of the awardee's record in teaching
and scholarship as well as potential for continued significant contributions to
scientific research, the academic profession, and the education of future
scientists. Dr. Liu will continue to work in several areas of Statistics, in
particular in multivariate data analysis and resampling techniques. Particularly
noteworthy is her initiative in organizing a series of regional conferences
involving participants from academics and industry.
