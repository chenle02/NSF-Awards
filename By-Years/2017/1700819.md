This project addresses problems of fundamental interest in the field of
algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest fields in
mathematics, as people have attempted for a very long time to use algebraic
tools to understand problems in geometry, and at the same time it is a field
that has seen some of the most outstanding modern developments and connections
with areas of pure and applied science. This project will connect parts of
algebraic and complex geometry that have previously been quite disjoint; in
particular, it uses new tools (called Hodge modules) to classify geometric
shapes and singularities. This approach will generate numerous projects for
doctoral students. The PI will continue to be involved in outreach activities,
like work towards creating a better environment for women in mathematics through
his involvement in the Graduate Research Opportunities for Women (GROW) program
at Northwestern. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the PI will continue to
apply the theory of mixed Hodge modules to concrete problems in complex and
birational geometry. He will pursue the development of the theory of Hodge
ideals associated to divisors on smooth varieties, and its applications. This
has been completed for reduced divisors, but significant new ideas will need to
be brought into play in order to obtain a similar picture for Hodge ideals
associated to Q-divisors or ideal sheaves. While Hodge ideals associated to
reduced hypersurfaces are already a generalization of certain types of
multiplier ideals, once this program is achieved, Hodge ideals will provide an
enhancement of the theory of multiplier ideals in full generality. Consequently,
one hopes for applications that reflect this. In recent work the PI gave
applications regarding the singularities of theta divisors, and of hypersurfaces
in projective space or toric varieties. In addition to further applications
along these lines, the PI will use the proposed extensions to study Fujita-type
problems, especially regarding the very ampleness of adjoint linear series, and
also problems in local algebra. The PI has also been involved in applying the
theory of Hodge modules to the study of families of smooth projective varieties,
e.g. hyperbolicity questions in the sense of Viehweg. He will extend this study
to families of singular varieties, especially those that appear in the theory of
moduli of higher dimensional varieties, perhaps using those Hodge modules that
extend variations of mixed Hodge structure. Finally, the PI will also continue
working towards the classification of subvarieties with minimal cohomology class
on principally polarized abelian varieties.
