9405696 Bowring Prior research in the Proterozoic of Arizona and New Mexico has
resulted in a hypothesis that, after initial accretion, the proterozoic orogenic
belt remained stable from 1.7 Ga to 1.4 Ga, with isotherms moving through the
rock very slowly, allowing extensive diffusional loss of argon from various
minerals, preserved as extreme gradations from cones to rims. An alternative
hypothesis of partial resetting by heat from younger intrusions does not fit
well with the geologic history, pattern of metamorphism, petrologic aspects of
re-metamorphism or known volume of plutons, but remaining an attractive
alternative. The project will attempt to test these alternatives in a field and
geochronological program. The project offers a strong opportunity to study
thermal evolution of newly formed continental lithosphere and to unravel how
stable cratonic geotherms are attained.
