To support various product engineering applications efficiently, product models
need to be represented with higher- level geometric entitles, from which
meaningful engineering information can be extracted. The objective of this
project is to develop a representation scheme for product models based on form
features. The intent is to provide a product model to support various product
engineering activities through a central form feature decomposition that
possesses intrinsic advantages applicable to a wide range of manufacturing
process design activities. The central form feature decomposition is to be
obtained by automatic recognition of form features using a convex decomposition
called Alternating Sum of Volumed with Partitioning. Geometric domain of product
shapes that the feature decomposition covers is extended to support practical
parts by exploiting local rounding operations. The product model scheme to be
developed must serve as the core of the integration of product engineering, from
design to manufacturing.
