Networking hardware has undergone dramatic changes in recent years.
Traditionally, network switches leveraged a fixed set of rules describingpac
ket-forwarding behavior, tailored to a small number of standard and widely-used
protocols. Today's state-of-the-art switches can run custom programs, enabling
new applications. Rather than being baked into the hardware, this behavior can
be changed and updated on-the-fly---networks are becoming increasingly
programmable. At the same time, programmable networks pose new challenges for
security and privacy. When switches were largely limited to static behavior,
switch behavior was designed and implemented by hardware&lt;br/&gt;vendors. As
devices become programmable, network programmers will produce networking
software more frequently and in greater quantity. These programs can be highly
intricate, potentially leading to more security vulnerabilities and privacy
violations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has two main technical goals: (1)
Evaluate security and privacy threats to programmable networks before they
become widespread, and (2) Design&lt;br/&gt;actionable mechanisms for detecting,
mitigating, and defending against such threats. The project consists of three
main research thrusts. The first thrust focuses on implementing secure and
privacy-preserving algorithms, including constructions from cryptography and
differential privacy, on programmable switches. The second thrust will develop
static analyses and dynamic enforcement mechanisms to guarantee information-flow
properties for a single programmable switch. Finally, the third thrust considers
security and privacy issues in distributed applications, which are implemented
across multiple programmable switches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
