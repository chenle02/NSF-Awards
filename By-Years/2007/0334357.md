Two data streams, Fe-Boltzmann lidar temperature data and balloon sounding data
are used to characterize the Antarctic atmosphere from 0 - 110 km. The research
goals are to develop thermal climatology in the Antarctic during the next three
years, to investigate Polar Mesospheric Cloud climatology relative to known
Arctic conditions, and to investigate gravity wave behavior in the Antarctic
mesosphere. Inter-comparisons of data from Rothera Antarctica (67.5o S) are
compared with and integrated with other Antarctic stations and with the TIMED
satellite to develop a global description of the polar mesosphere for model
constraint. The lidar and balloon programs are logistically and financially
supported through an international collaboration with the British Antarctic
Survey.&lt;br/&gt;
