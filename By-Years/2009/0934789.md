This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) proposal from PI
Chittaranjan Ray of the University of Georgia will support U.S. students'
participation in hypothesis-driven research centered on successful operation of
riverbank filtration (RBF) systems for water supply. RBF has been practiced for
over a century in Europe, and it is being used more often in the U.S. as cities
use RBF to receive filtration credits for pathogen removal under EPA
regulations. The U.S. students will collaborate with German teams led by Thomas
Grischek of the University of Applied Sciences in Dresden and Paul Eckert of the
DÃ¼sseldorf Waterworks. In each year over a three year period, four American
students, working with German researchers and students, will learn about
riverbank filtration (RBF) through an eight-week summer education and research
activity in Germany where RBF is used for water supply. The key focus of the
study will be on gaining an understanding of the processes involved in RBF and
how river dynamics (scouring and clogging) and water temperature changes can
affect the quality and quantity of water pumped. Recruitment efforts will be
made to recruit female students and under-represented minority students from key
collaborating institutions as well as from the University of Georgia.
