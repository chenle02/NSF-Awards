McCormick 9521625 The principal investigator and his colleagues organize the
seventh Copper Mountain conference on multigrid methods. Numerical methods for
solving a differential equation usually begin by imposing a grid on the region
where the equation holds. From the differential equation, algebraic equations
are then developed; their solution represents the qolution of the differential
equation. The accuracy of the approximate solution commonly is measured by the
fineness of the grid. Multigrid methods are numerical methods for solving
partial differential equations that systematically exploit the relationship
between approximate solutions on different grids to arrive at a solution whose
accuracy is consistent with the finest grid but for considerably less work. The
methods are often dramatically more efficient than others. Research in the past
dozen years has extended the methods to a broad range of problems of
considerable practical import in engineerine, manufacturing, materials, physics,
and fluid dynamics.
