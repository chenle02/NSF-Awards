This S-STEM project provides scholarships and support to a diverse cohort of 32
low income Biomedical, Chemical and Environmental Engineering (BCEE) students at
the University of Cincinnati's College of Engineering and Applied Science (CEAS)
who pursue either a research preparation or an entrepreneurship focus. The
project aims to prepare a diverse groups of students to excel in a rapidly
changing, technology-driven world as future faculty, engineers, and technology
managers in educational institutions, existing companies, as well as leaders in
starting new, technology-based companies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
offers BCEE S-STEM scholars four tracks: 1) a MS-ACCEND degree program, in which
students earn both BS and MS degrees in engineering; 2) a new Graduate School
Preparation track to prepare students earning a BS degree to enter MS and PhD
programs; 3) a MBA-ACCEND program, in which students earn both BS and MBA
degrees as well as a Graduate Certificate in Entrepreneurship; and 4) a new
Professional Preparation track in which students earn a BS degree and a Minor in
Entrepreneurship to prepare them for entrepreneurial activities after
graduation. The project implements four strategies to support and prepare its
scholars: cohort building, career driven education, networking, and a defined
pathway to graduate school. An E-Portfolio tool, previously developed at the
CEAS, is used to track student performance and participation and to identify
students who need early intervention. The tracks serve as models for programs
seeking to incorporate research methods and discovery-based education to improve
retention of students in dual-degree programs (BS-MS and BS-MBA), integrate
research training into undergraduate engineering education, and streamline
acquisition of the skills needed for technical and entrepreneurial innovation.
