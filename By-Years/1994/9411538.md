9411538 Soltis Graduate student Joanna Schultz, under the supervision of faculty
adviser Pamela Soltis at Washington State University, is studying two related
genera in the phlox family Polemoniaceae, Leptodactylon and Linanthus. The two
present opportunities to contrast alternative processes of speciation in plants,
either sympatric/parapatric through polyploidy (whether following hybridization
or not) and allopatric, usually through dispersal and isolation of small
peripheral populations. Morphological and molecular evidence, the latter
including extensive data from chloroplast DNA and from protein isozymes, will be
acquired to infer phylogenetic relationships among species and to assess likely
routes of origin by analyzing patterns of genetic variation in closely related
species. Robust phylogenetic analysis of closely related species, based on
combined morphological and molecular evidence, provides the strongest test cases
for assessing the relative importance of contrasting mechanisms of plant
speciation, whether through polyploid evolution (usually involving hybridization
of sympatric congeners) or through geographic speciation (allopatric
divergence).
