Dr. Thirumalai has been selected as a Presidential Young Investigator for the
period 1987-1992. Although he is a relatively young scientist, the research
completed during his graduate and postdoctoral years provides an excellent
backgroung in mathematical physics, chemistry and quantum mechanics. It is
expected that Dr. Thirumalai will establish a major theoretical research program
in the area of simulating dynamic properties of materials. In addition, the
research to be carried out will focus on other problems of importance to
contemporary chemistry such as (1) understanding specific structural transitions
in molecules such as DNA and (2) understanding the dynamics of supercooled
liquids and glasses.
