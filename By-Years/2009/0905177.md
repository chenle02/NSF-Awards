Concurrency-related vulnerabilities are pervasive in modern computing systems.
Concurrency exploits include time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) race
conditions in file systems, attacks on signal handlers, and evasive malware that
uses concurrency to escape sandboxing mechanisms. As processors feature ever
more parallelism, and computers process more of our sensitive data, defending
against concurrency attacks is a key challenge for the coming decade.

The first goal is to protect legitimate applications from concurrency attacks
when they access system resources (e.g., prevent TOCTTOU attacks on file
accesses and exploitable race conditions in signal handlers). The objective is
to provide application programmers with mechanisms and policies for
synchronizing access to system resources so they can avoid unintentional
vulnerabilities.

The second goal is to provide strong confinement of untrusted code in the
presence of concurrency, i.e., blocking intentionally malicious behavior.
Today's malware abuses concurrency mechanisms to bypass and circumvent
containment mechanisms like reference monitors and system call wrappers.
Providing robust system support for containing malicious code is a critical
challenge in intrusion detection and prevention.

Modern computing systems fundamentally depend on concurrency for their
performance and functionality. Making sure that concurrency is used securely is
essential for building a trusted cyber infrastructure. This research will have a
significant impact on the practical development of secure software, and enable
security-critical applications to realize the performance benefits of today's
highly parallel systems.
