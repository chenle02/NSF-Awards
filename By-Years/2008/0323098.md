This project will create the Learning Center to assist ITEST projects, both
Youth and Comprehensive, in achieving their goals. It provides help in
implementing best practices and building on achievements to produce knowledge
that can be shared among projects and with the broader community. The center
offers each ITEST project support with planning, implementing and evaluating. It
models sophisticated IT practices, provides technical assistance, engages
grantees in action research, increases opportunities, and disseminates research
and models through networks in both the formal and informal
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project goals are as
follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. To provide technical assistance opportunities
and leverage lessons learned into knowledge. This includes selecting four topics
each year for online dialog with experts. It includes efforts to address the
special needs of women, minorities, and underrepresented
populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. To tighten the research/practice cycle and
promote data-based decision making. This includes studying the effects of IT
exposure and training in different environments and at different points in its
life span.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. To create a national presence for ITEST as a
primary source for information on IT in STEM. This includes outreach to more
than 10,000 practitioners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. To build grantee capacity to
use technology as a tool for learning and working and to lead others. This
includes web-based resources, collaboration, data sets and other
expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
