Florida A&amp;M University and Florida State University are collaborating to
conduct a five-year program which will directly involve 120 exemplary minority
engineering undergraduates enrolled in chemical, civil, electrical, industrial
and mechanical engineering curricula. Participants will 1) collaborate on
faculty research and perform research-oriented industrial internships, 2)
receive academic advising and mentoring by faculty researchers and professional
mentoring by prominent minority scientists, and 3) receive academic enrichment
and enhancement in preparation for graduate study. Participants will have the
opportunity to present the results of their research at technical conferences.
Program activities guide participants from the pre-college level to successful
entry into graduate research programs. Participants receive graduated stipend
supplements (in addition to any other scholarships which they are receiving)
which are scaled from $111/month for first year students through $333/month for
fifth year students. Successful completion of the program activities will result
in the acceptance into an completion of graduate research degree programs by 85%
of program graduates and acceptance into doctoral research programs by 40% of
program graduates. These results will be achieved in an extremely cost-effective
manner. Annual project costs average $3700 per participant; cumulative project
costs are $11,638 per participant. Total personnel costs are only 26% of the
budget; senior personnel costs are 2.3% of the budget. Annual cost sharing by
the College is 46% of the funding requested from NSF.
