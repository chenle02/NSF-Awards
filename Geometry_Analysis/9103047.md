The principal investigator will study the algebraic structure of twistor
spaces, the construction of Kahler Einstein metrics and application of Kahler
reduction. The methods to be employed are a combination of differential geometry
and algebraic techniques. A twistor space is a complex three dimensional space
associated to a self-dual Riemannian four dimensional manifold. The principal
investigator will study those twistor spaces associated with the connected sums
of complex projective planes. The principal investigator will also study the
construction of Kahler Einstein metrics on spaces admitting a one parameter
group of symmetries. The general theory of relativity is set in spaces in which
curvature is proportional to stress. These spaces, called Einstein manifolds,
arise in many branches of mathematics and it is useful to know when a given
space has the structure of an Einstein space. The principal investigator will
study this question as well as the structure of other spaces which arise in
mathematical physics.
