This research is concerned with the development of a systematic approach to the
study of analytic and geometric properties of random fields. Special emphasis is
placed on Gaussian and stable random fields such as the Brownian sheet, stable
sheets and additive Levy processes. The investigators wish to continue their
study of precise quantitative connections between the aforementioned random
fields and the theory of capacities, as well as potential theory for general
Markov type random sets. They believe that these connections will yield detailed
analytic and geometric information about the random fields in question. Amongst
other things, two long-standing open problems are emphasized: one on the
potential theory of the Brownian sheet, and the other in the theory of random
coverings. The investigators also plan to develop and advance canonical
techniques for fractal and multifractal analysis of a large class of
multiparameter Levy processes, as well as the Brownian sheet. They expect these
techniques will, in turn, be useful in studying complex random fields and
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gaussian and stable random fields considered
in this project play a prominent role in many areas of pure and applied
mathematics, statistics, mathematical physics, medical imaging, ecology,
geology, geophysics, oceanography, hydrology, as well as mathematical finance.
This research is concerned with developing and introducing various analytic and
geometric tools that will lead to a better understanding of geometric problems
for random fields, as well as help promote their future
applicability.&lt;br/&gt;
