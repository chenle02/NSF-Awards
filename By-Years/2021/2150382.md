This renewal REU Site program will recruit 10 undergraduate students to come to
the University of Maryland at College Park where they will work for 10 weeks on
team research projects with mentors. The students will be offered a variety of
research projects and will also be given a strong voice in the creation of their
own projects. Several will develop new techniques and analyses of machine
learning (ML) systems, which use probability and statistics to find patterns in
data. Others will use cryptography to build secure systems. Research projects in
following topical areas will be offered: Cryptography and Security; Fair
Allocation; Trustworthy Machine Learning; and Neural Networks and Finance. These
projects broadly focus on combining theory and practice and students attending
the program will leave it with the ability to look at a real world problem and
apply theoretical techniques to solving it. &lt;br/&gt;There will be a special
effort to recruit students in the program from non-research-focused schools and
from traditionally underrepresented groups. The PIs plan several recruiting
trips (in person or on zoom) to such schools to attract such students. This
program will give many of the students a chance to do research, which they
otherwise would not have. This program will prepare all of the students for
graduate school. Social activities include trips, hikes, panel discussions about
professional development, and other planned interactions with other REU
students, current graduate students, and faculty&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
