The 21st International Conference on Biochemical and Molecular Engineering (BME
XXI) will be held in Mont Tremblant, Quebec. July 14-18, 2019. The theme of the
BME XXI conference is Emerging Technologies in Tomorrow's Products and
Processes, and it will be organized under the auspices of the Engineering
Conferences International (ECI). This international conference will bring
together established researchers, young investigators, private sector scientists
and engineers as well as graduate students to assess the present and chart the
future of the field of biochemical and molecular engineering.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the conference will be on
microbial consortia (microbiome), systems metabolic engineering (systems biology
to synthetic evolution), and emerging technologies (optogenetics and
epigenetics) in combination with (protein engineering, process development, and
scale up. One of the workshops, on Entrepreneurship, will highlight case studies
from entrepreneurs around ideas/concepts that drive successful startups and
business solutions. Another workshop, on Biochemical Engineering Education, will
address important issues relating the industries need for a workforce trained in
certain engineering areas, and academia's ever increasing focus on techniques to
analyze Big Data/Modeling. The outcome of the meeting will be summarized by a
report that will highlight opportunities and new directions in the area of
biochemical and molecular engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being
co-funded by CBET (CBE program) and MCB (CDF and SSB
programs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
