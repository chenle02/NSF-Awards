The Cosmic Dawn, when stars first illuminated the Universe, is one of the most
exciting frontiers in astronomy. These first generations of luminous objects
likely differed significantly from nearby galaxies. While their vast distance
from us has so far prevented telescopes from observing them, new facilities are
now under construction that hope to probe these first generations of objects in
the next several years. This project will develop and publicly release a new
theoretical model of these objects, which will link many of their newly
observable properties in a coherent framework amenable to modern statistical
analyses. The PI will also develop a variety of online materials describing the
fascinating astrophysics of this era to the public, including animations,
tutorials, and a downloadable application based on some of his
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance our understanding of the
Cosmic Dawn through several related efforts. First, the PI will develop a new
set of "semi-analytic" galaxy formation models tuned to the earliest phases of
normal galaxy formation in our Universe's history. The models will use
physically motivated star formation and feedback prescriptions to explore the
wide range of astrophysics that may be relevant during this era. Second, he will
improve the treatment of photon absorption in fast simulations of the
reionization era, which is essential to model that process accurately. Finally,
he will connect these new theoretical models to a wide range of observables,
including galaxy measurements and low-frequency radio investigations of the
reionization process, using a parameter inference
code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
