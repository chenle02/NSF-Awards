This award will enable a group of physicists under the direction of Professor
Rufus H. Ritchie of the University of Tennessee at Knoxville to collaborate with
Professor Fuminori Fujimoto of the University of Tokyo, Japan in a study of the
dynamic interactions of electrons and ions with condensed matter. The study will
be carried out at both theoretical and experimental levels in complementary
programs in the U.S. and in Japan. In the U.S., the theoretical work will be
based on a quantum mechanical, many-particle, self-energy analysis of the
interactions of electrons and swift ions with matter. The experimental effort
will focus on the study of dynamic processes by the new technique of scanning
tunneling microscopy. The Japanese theoretical study will focus on quantum many-
particle properties of charged particles in collision with electrons and ion
cores in passing through condensed matter. The concurrent experimental program
will consist of studies of particulate channeling and ion interactions with
solids, with emphasis on electronic transitions in the solids and on the
projectile. An understanding of the interactions between energetic particles and
condensed matter is of significant practical importance in many areas of modern
physics, including for example, surface diagnostic physics, radiation physics,
molecular ion structure determinations, and accelerator-based atomic physics.
Dr. Ritchie's group at the University of Tennessee and Dr. Fujimoto's group at
the University of Tokyo bring extensive and complementary expertise and
equipment to bear on this research project.
