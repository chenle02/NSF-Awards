This project is the result of 7 years of planning and work by members of the
science and mathematics departments to produce a change in the science education
of non-science-majors. Two years ago, the faculty of the College of Liberal Arts
and Sciences voted to modify the curriculum to increase the core science
requirement to include a capstone course in science called Science and
Technology Today. This multidisciplinary integrated science course has been
designed to use current topics in science, multimedia computers, existing
international collaborations, Internet, cooperative learning techniques, and
laboratory exercises to provide a new science experience for students. The new
course depends on in-class use, by students working in pairs, of multimedia
computers and instructor-controlled laser disk textbooks with liquid crystal
display monitors and overhead projection to student work areas. The pilot
section of the course has been given with such encouraging results that the
details have been written and submitted as a paper to the Journal of College
Science Teaching. Through this project, the department has acquired the
necessary multimedia equipment, computers, and laser disk players, to support
the full implementation of this new course, which can be taken by 400 students
per year.
