The objective of this research is to establish the potential of nano-patterned
ultrathin epitaxial graphite for low-power, nanometer-scale electronic devices.
The research is inspired by the exceptional electronic properties of carbon
nanotubes, and the realization that these essential properties are shared by all
nanographitic structures. Rationally patterned planar graphite (or graphene - a
single atomic layer of graphite) structures have advantages over nanotubes in
that connections between devices can be accomplished in a single lithographic
step. The research approach is to 1) Produce extended defect-free multilayered
graphene, 0.3--3 nm thick, on silicon carbide substrates; 2) Develop patterning
methods; 3) Establish electronic and transport properties of extended films and
defined structures; 4) Develop chemical modification (doping) methods; 5)
Demonstrate simple devices; and 6) Establish methods to integrate with Si-based
electronics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Energy conservation and mobile
operation demand that future electronics focus on low power and high-density.
Graphite-based electronics holds the potential for large-scale integration of
ballistic (dissipationless) devices that could satisfy these needs. This program
provides in-depth training for Ph.D. students in nanoscience/engineering, and
research/education opportunities at several levels. Through Georgia Tech
programs designed by education professionals, high-school teachers can be hosted
in research laboratories. U.S. undergraduates can participate in the research
through two NSF-REU programs (with additional opportunities available in
Georgia). Contributions to courses within Georgia Tech's Nanoscience and
Technology program will reach a wider audience. Finally, a focus on recruitment
of underrepresented groups into nanoscience and engineering will be
maintained.&lt;br/&gt;
