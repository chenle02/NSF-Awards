An atomic absorption spectrophotometer with furnace atomizer is essential for
ultra-micro elemental measurements in three different research projects. It will
be used to determine metal content (particularly zinc and iron) in hippocampal
slices. The objective is to investigate the relationship of tissue metal content
to neuronal damage in the brain during exposure to oxidative stress. Another
project will use this equipment to measure sodium and potassium concentrations
in nanoliter samples of tubular fluid from neonatal rat kidneys. The
measurements will be used to assess the role of atrial natriuretic factor in
water and electrolyte homeostasis in the immature rat. For the third project,
the atomic absorption spectrophotometer will also be used to determine sodium
and potassium concentrations in nanoliter samples of renal tubular fluid. The
role of neurohumoral factors, particularly dopamine, regulation of sodium
excretion in neonatal rats will be examined. The atomic absorption
spectrophotometer and graphite furnace atomizer offers the unique capability of
measuring the content of various metals and ions in extremely small samples of
tissue and fluid at a reasonable cost.
