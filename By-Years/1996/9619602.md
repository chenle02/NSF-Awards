Dr. Robert C. Kerber and other members of the Chemistry Department at the State
University of New York at Stony Brook are being supported to establish a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period
1997-99, ten undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively
engaged in basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry
-- biological, inorganic, organic, physical, and theoretical. Activities
integrate chemistry students with summer research students in other disciplines.
Participants are recruited both regionally and nationally, with emphasis placed
on students who would not otherwise have the opportunity for a research
experience.
