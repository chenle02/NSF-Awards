The objective of the program is to complete the analysis (and release) of maps
of the southern half of an all sky radio (5 GHz frequency) intensity and
polarization survey. This will aid in the removal of contaminating foregrounds
from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) studies and will also provide information
about our Galaxy's Interstellar Medium (ISM) and magnetic fields. Broader
impacts include training of students in instrumentation, international
collaboration with students, and a broad outreach program targeting audiences
from a variety of age groups and cultural backgrounds. Members of the proposing
team play an important role in the development and execution of these
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The C-Band All Sky Survey (C-BASS) is a radio
survey at 5 GHz of the entire sky in total intensity and linear polarization,
with resolution of 0.73 degrees, sensitivity of about 0.1 mK rms, and minimal
corruption by instrumental systematic errors. The award will allow C-BASS to
fulfill its primary goals of characterizing emission mechanisms of the ISM,
determining an all-sky template for polarized emission from the Galaxy, and
allowing for more accurate separation of intrinsic CMB signals from foreground
emission, thus enabling CMB polarization experiments to realize their full
potential. CMB polarization is being measured from space by the Planck
satellites, and by several current and future ground-based and balloon-borne
experiments supported by NSF, NASA, DOE and other agencies.
