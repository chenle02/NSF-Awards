This work is funded through the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research
and Education (POWRE) program as a Visiting Professorship activity. The
investigator will study various model equations for water waves. Based on the
investigation of the Boussinesq systems which describe bi-directional waves in a
nonlinear dispersive media, the investigator will study theoretically and
numerically the generalized systems which include one or more of the following
factors a) the external forcing which come from the bottom topography and the
surface pressure. b) more accurate (higher-order) systems; c) weakly two-
dimensional uni-directional waves (KP-equations); with or without external
forcing. d) weakly two-dimensional bi-directional waves, with or without
external forcing.
