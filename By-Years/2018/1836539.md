This project advances knowledge through its contribution to I-Corps Sites
Instructors at universities across the nation by creating a consistent training
approach to enhance quality of the I-Corps experience among the 99 funded
I-Corps Sites. The I-Corps South Node will leverage its extensive experience
training National and Regional Instructors in the lean methodology to minimize
inconsistencies among Sites teams' preparation level for participation in a
National Cohort. Consistent teaching of the I-Corps methodology across the
ecosystem of Teams, Regional and Sites programs will lead to increased
intellectual consistency from instructors at all levels. As a result, teams will
have more success in the translation between Sites and other programming levels,
including Regional cohorts and the Teams program as well as the likelihood for
success in advancing the I-Corps concepts into the private sector. The formation
of an Instructor Academy for Sites standardizes the training among Sites
instructors, resulting in an increase in consistency among the instruction
provided to Sites teams. The proposed pilot project to address and alleviate the
inconsistencies in instruction among Sites, thereby increasing translation
between the Sites and Teams programs. The Georgia Tech I-Corps South Node and
has the potential to establish new norms in both instruction quality and the
expectations Sites teams have before pursuing National I-Corps
Teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
