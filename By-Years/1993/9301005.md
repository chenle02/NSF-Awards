The objective of this project is to research the earthquake- caused hazardous
materials incidents that Japan has experienced, the root cause of those
problems, and the solutions developed as a result. The data obtained will be
analyzed and compared to information that is available on U.S. earthquakes,
especially the Loma Prieta Earthquake. Japanese codes and regulations that are
specifically aimed at reducing earthquake-caused hazardous materials incidents
will be identified. Organizations and regulatory bodies that are responsible for
overseeing implementation of hazard reduction measures will be identified, and
their specific role examined. The detailed information that is available in
Japan, combined with the information on the technical solutions developed in
Japan, will be of value to U.S. researchers and safety professionals interested
in hazardous materials issues. Based on the analysis, recommendations for hazard
reduction efforts and future research will be formulated. An annotated
bibliography and a computerized data base of Japanese earthquake-caused
hazardous materials incidents, a compilation of solutions developed, and a final
report will be published.
