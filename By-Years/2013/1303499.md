The objective of the proposed collaborative research is to develop a
plasmonically enhanced optical&lt;br/&gt;ring resonator (PEORR) sensor array for
unlabelled biomolecule detection at the single molecule level.&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed hybrid sensor synergizes microfabricated ring resonators and
nanofabricated plasmonic&lt;br/&gt;nanostructures. It takes advantage of the
excellent sensing resolution associated with the ring resonator&lt;br/&gt;and
the tremendously enhanced sensitivity arising from the plasmonic nanostructures
to achieve single&lt;br/&gt;molecule detection, and of the carousel effect from
the ring resonator for efficient capture and transport of&lt;br/&gt;biomolecules
for sample enrichment and expeditious detection.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Detection and study of biomolecules at
the single molecule level allow to probe and&lt;br/&gt;characterize molecules in
unprecedented detail. Traditional single molecule detection relies primarily
on&lt;br/&gt;fluorescence microscopy, which requires sophisticated instruments
and complicated dye labeling&lt;br/&gt;processes that may adversely affect a
molecules functionality.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The
proposed project will be carried out synergistically by the terms from the
University&lt;br/&gt;of Michigan and the Polytechnic Institute at New York
University. Graduate students will be&lt;br/&gt;trained in interdisciplinary
science and will work in each of the two labs through an exchange
program.&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will be paired with graduate students
to obtain hands-on experience. Videos on&lt;br/&gt;Youtube will be jointly
created to publicize the research findings. Finally, the PI will work with local
non-&lt;br/&gt;Ph.D. granting colleges to develop a summer program for their
students to conduct research in the PI's&lt;br/&gt;lab at the University of
Michigan.
