This project is mathematical research in operator theory, a subject that had
its origins in quantum mechanics (where operators on Hilbert space are used in
place of scalars to represent physical quantities), but that has long since
acquired a vigorous life of its own. Operators interact with one another in a
much richer way than do scalars, and individual operators carry a great deal of
structure (spectrum, numerical invariants such as index, and so forth) whose
elucidation is a perpetual challenge to the subject. Part of Professor Fialkow's
research deals with spectrum and index for so-called elementary operators, which
are linear combinations of left and right multiplications. The main thrust here
is to recover information about the given elementary operator in terms of
multivariable spectral data from the pieces of which it is composed. Another
aspect has to do with quasisimilarity, two operators being quasisimilar if they
are intertwined left and right by a pair of injective transformations with dense
range; the objective is to characterize the operators that are quasimilar to the
unilateral shift.
