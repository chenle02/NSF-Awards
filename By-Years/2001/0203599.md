The research focuses on two areas of short-pulse laser plasma interactions;
first - pulse wavelength tuning using a fs-laser produced semiconductor plasma
and a 'clean' test of the proposed Superradiant Amplification (SRA) of a fs-
laser pulse in a plasma. A semiconductor plasma composed of electron-hole pairs
will allow the PI to avoid some of the difficulties that have plaqued recent
work on this topic.
