Electronic and magnetic interactions in the presence of disorder provide for a
wide variety of collective effects at low temperatures. They propose to study:
(i) The Mott-Hubbard transition from the antiferromagnetic insulator to the
correlated metal, both in the limit where Coulomb interactions alone dominate
and where the effects of electron interactions and disorder are comparable.
Experiments at milliKelvin temperatures above, below, and at the metal-insulator
transition should help deconvulate these competing effects. (ii) The insulating
properties of transition metal and rare earth oxides, where a description in
terms of both electronic and magnetic glassiness appears to be most appropriate
at low temperatures, and (iii) The correlation-enhanced metallic properties and
the anisotropic superconducting order in heavy fermion compounds.
