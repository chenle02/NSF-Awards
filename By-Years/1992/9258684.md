Eisenberg 9258684 This is the third year base award and the second year
matching award of a five year NSF Young Investigator (NYI) grant. The aim of
this project is to develop an empirically and theoretically motivated framework
for the design of powerful, expressive software applications that integrate
programming languages and direct manipulation interfaces. The programming
environments for these applications will be designed to be learnable, domain-
specific (or "domain-enriched") and interactive. The stategies for combining
language and interface constructs will emphasize opportunities for creative
symbiosis. Sample applications will include those for the domains of physics,
mathematics and graphics design. The long term goals of this project include
empowerment of the end users of applications by providing them with the
capability for interactive programming.
