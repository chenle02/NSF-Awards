The PI plans to continue the operation of the cosmic ray neutron monitors at Mt.
Washington (Po=1.24 GV) and Durham (Pc=1.41) and to continue studies which
relate these ground based cosmic ray observations to near Earth cosmic ray
telescope data (E &gt; 70 MeV) from the IMP series of spacecraft and similar
data at large heliocentric distances from the Earth acquired from Pioneer 10 (at
53AU in August 1991), Voyager 1 (at 45.7 AU, latituded 32o) and Voyager 2 (at 33
AU). Using these data they will study the following: 1) The interplanetary
cosmic ray radial and latitudinal gradient; 2) Comparison of instantaneous and
time-shifted integral E &gt; 70 MeV radial gradients; 3) Evaluation of the
heliospheric termination boundary, its location and its effects on cosmic rays;
and 4) the association of Forbush decreases and interplanetary magnetic field
disturbances.
