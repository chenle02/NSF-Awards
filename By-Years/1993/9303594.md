A collaborative and cross-disciplinary research program at the University of
Michigan and California Institute of Technology will be carried out to
investigate the physics and chemistry of the fast processes and flows which
occur in the conduits and near the vents of erupting volcanoes. Experimental
simulations of volcanic eruptions will be carried out at small scale with
systems which duplicate the velocities and accelerations generated during
eruption by bubble growth and magma fragmentation. The apparatus consists of a
test cell which exhausts into a tank which can be evacuated. Preliminary results
show that the simple system CO2-H2O exhibits a variety of eruptive styles,
ranging from explosive eruption, to violent bubbling and degassing (but no
eruption), to quiet exsolution with occasional bubbling. This work will be
continued in three directions: (1) experimental simulation under a variety of
controlled conditions, varying such parameters as viscosity, surface tension,
diffusion coefficient of CO2, chamber shape, pressure, etc., (2) theoretical
study of scaling laws for extrapolating experimental laboratory results to
natural magmatic systems; and (3) development of methods for observing and
quantifying the mechanism of fragmentation.
