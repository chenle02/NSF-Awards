The Workshop and International Conference on Representations of Algebras (ICRA
XIX) will be held at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in
Trieste, Italy, on July 21-31, 2020. This award will provide support for junior
US based participants attending the meeting. The ICRA is an important biennial
meeting in this subject that takes place every other year in countries all over
the world. In 2016, the ICRA was held for the first time ever in the United
States of America and has inspired many young researchers in the US to focus on
representation theory of algebras and related topics. The meeting will consist
of two parts: a four day workshop, and a five day conference. The workshop will
have six speakers who each give a series of three lectures on a recent
development in the field or a related area. The conference will consist in
eighteen fifty-minute plenary lectures, in addition to a number of thirty-minute
lectures which will be held in parallel sessions. The expected number of
participants is two-hundred and fifty. The award will be used to support travel
and lodging of US-based participants who are at an early stage of their career.
Topics to be covered at the conference include quiver representations,
Auslander-Reiten theory, homological properties, tilting theory, stability
conditions and wall crossing, preprojective algebras, Hochschild cohomology,
geometric methods in representation theory, cluster algebras, tensor categories,
homological conjectures in commutative algebra, as well as methods from data
analysis such as persistent homology. More information about the ICRA can be

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
