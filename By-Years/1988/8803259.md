Rukhin will work on adaptive statistical procedures which are relevant when
probabilities of large deviations are used as a performance criterion. In a
hypothesis testing situation, Rukhin plans to obtain conditions for the
existence of an adaptive test, i.e., a test which is fully asymptotically
Bahadur efficient for any fixed value of an unknown nuisance parameter and such
that the test is independent of this parameter value. The form of the adaptive
test statistics will be derived, and their behavior for moderate sample sizes
will be explored. Similar questions will be investigated in the problem of
estimating a vector parameter in the presence of an infinite-dimensional
nuisanceparameter. Recurrent classification procedures will be studied and
improved reliability quantile estimators will be obtained. This work in the
field of statistics focuses on solving problems that will adapt hypotheses
testing procedures to information as it accummulates. Success on these problems
will contribute to the knowledge of how to optimize the performance of
scientific experimentation.
