The purchase of a high field, variable temperature Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Spectrometer has enhanced the undergraduate research and instruction at Southern
Oregon State College. With beyond the study of simple proton spectra. The
instrument is incorporated into laboratory courses in Organic, Inorganic,
Analytical, Biochemistry, and Advanced Organic to provide extensive
opportunities for students to become familiar with the operation of the
instrument, interpret spectra, and understand the significance of FT-NMR to
current chemical methodology. The undergraduate research program is greatly
impacted by the extended capabilities of such an instrument. Some of the
projects affected are: Cyclopropenes as Allene Synthons, Chromium and Manganese
Complexes containing Diisocyanide Ligand Bridges, Asymmetric Epoxidation of
Chiral Vinyl Silanes, and Structure Elucidation of Unusual Compounds from
Lichens. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of
funds.
