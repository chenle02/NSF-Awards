The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities is joining the existing
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Pharmaceutical
Processing Research established at Purdue University with affiliated sites at
the University of Connecticut and the University of Puerto Rico. The University
has established expertise and industrial connections in several areas of
pharmaceutical processing. This application stresses the fundamental
understanding, at the molecular level, of the effects of processing on critical
quality attributes of pharmaceutical products and in minimizing validation
requirements through improved process monitoring.
