This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this project is
to provide an improved fundamental understanding of the atmospheric aging cycle
of organic aerosol derived from biogenic terpenoid and reduced organic nitrogen
compounds through laboratory reaction chamber experiments on secondary organic
aerosol (SOA) growth and processing. Key semi-volatile species that are direct
precursors to SOA will be identified and SOA yields quantified for a wide
variety of known biogenic and anthropogenic atmospheric emissions. A unique
combination of online soft-ionization (photoelectron resonance capture
ionization, PERCI) aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS) with gas chromatographic
analysis will be used to directly measure the transformation of representative
volatile terpenoid compounds to the aerosol phase. Similar experiments will
investigate the sequestration of reduced nitrogen by organic aerosols and
develop a more fundamental understanding of how this sequestration impacts SOA
aging and growth as well as the role SOA has in the transport and deposition of
reduced nitrogen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, the results from this work
will provide detailed chemical mechanisms, product branching ratios, and SOA
yields under a variety of atmospherically relevant oxidant mixtures, for a
variety of compound classes, concentrations and relative humidities. This
knowledge will be of interest both to a broad chemical audience regarding mixed
phase chemical reaction mechanisms and also to the atmospheric community in
terms of quantifying oxidative gas to particle transitions, a highly uncertain
area of the field of atmospheric chemistry.
