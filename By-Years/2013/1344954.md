The goals of this research are three-fold: (1) To develop new approaches for the
simulation of human limb control; (2) To develop new approaches for optimizing
prosthetic limb control, capture energy during walking, and store that energy to
lengthen useful prosthesis life; and (3) To develop a prosthesis prototype. In
order to accomplish these high-level goals, the following specific objectives
will be pursued: (1) Study both able-bodied gait and amputee gait in our human
motion lab; (2) Develop mathematical models for human motion control to provide
a foundation for artificial limb control; (3) Develop electronic prosthesis
controls; (4) Develop new approaches for optimizing prosthesis design parameters
based on computer intelligence; (5) Fabricate a prosthesis prototype and test
the prototype in a robotic system; (6) Conduct human trials of the prosthesis
prototype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will
lead to new methods for optimizing complex, inter-related subsystems, such as
those that are characteristic of prostheses. The human leg operates by
transferring energy between the knee, which absorbs energy, and the ankle, which
produces energy. The new prosthesis design that results from this research will
mimic the energy transfer of the human leg. Inter-related engineering systems
are typically designed and optimized independently of each other. This results
in designs that are overly conservative, that do not interact optimally, and
that limit performance, adaptability, and robustness. This research will develop
integrated optimization algorithms that consider the inter-dependence of related
subsystems (for example, hardware, software, and control). Current knee
prostheses do not restore normal gait, and this contributes to degenerative
joint disease among amputees. This research will develop new design and
optimization approaches that will allow prostheses to perform more robustly, to
perform closer to natural human gait, and to last longer between battery charges
than current prostheses.
