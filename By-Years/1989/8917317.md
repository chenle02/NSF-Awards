The research planned in this proposal will address the question of why black
mother-only families and their offspring are more likely to experience long term
welfare dependence. The investigator is proposing to look at the way in which
internal family dynamics interact with stressors in the environment among a
group that is presently being referred to as the underclass. The objective of
this study has major theoretical implications, because it will address the
current controversy over what social, economic, and environmental mechanisms are
responsible for the persistence of welfare dependence. The investigator feels
that the findings from such a study will facilitate the development of more
social and clinical interventions and policy prescriptions for unmarried black
mothers with children living in areas of concentrated poverty. As a prelude to
preparing a full proposal, the investigator plans to engage in an intensive
review of the subject area, consult with experts in the field of study, and
enroll in courses in quantitative methods.
