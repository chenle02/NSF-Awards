The word constructionism is a mnemonic for two aspects of the theory os science
education underlying this project. From constructivist theories of psychology we
take a view of learning as a reconstruction rather than as a transmission of
knowledge. Then we extend the idea of manipulative materials to the idea that
learning is most effective when part of an activity the learner experiences as
constructing a meaningful product. Specifically a set of new materials will be
developed for learning science in elementary schools. The materials use a new
cut across science, organizing many traditional concepts under the heading of
motion science, information science and color science. The materials will be
designed to make better use of the level of computers presence that is now
becoming common in schools. The design of the new materials pays special
attention to the role of affective, cultural and gender-related facets of
learning science. The materials will be developed in an inner city public school
in Boston and evaluated in a number of test sites at associated schools in
several states for dissemination to schools covering the full range of socio-
cultural variation in American education.
