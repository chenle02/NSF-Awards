This proposal is for partial funding of the 22nd Southeastern Analysis Meeting
(SEAM). The meeting will be held from the morning of March 2 through noon March
5, 2006, at the University of Florida as a highlight of the mathematics
department's special year in Probability and Analysis. The University of Florida
will provide facilities, cover local organizing expenses, and provide
significant funding. National Science Foundation funding will be used as partial
support for participant travel expenses. Priority will be given to graduate
students, postdocs, members of underrepresented groups, and younger faculty.

The purpose of SEAM is to disseminate and exchange the latest ideas and
developments in operator theory and functional analysis while encouraging the
participation and professional development of junior members of the operator
theory community. The program will consist of plenary talks by eminent
mathematicians and parallel sessions of contributed papers by younger
participants. There will also be two special sessions | one on non-commutative
measure theory and the other on quantum field theory and functional analysis
whose programs will consist of invited talks by leading scientists and
contributed papers by participants.
