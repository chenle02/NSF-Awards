The research is designed to illuminate the psycholinguistic processes involved
in implementing long-distance dependencies during language production. Such
dependencies constitute a considerable theoretical challenge, since the abstract
structural knowledge required to reliably format the discontinuous elements does
not straightforwardly mesh with the articulatory requirement of incremental,
word-by-word production. The dependencies to be explored are, primarily, number
agreement between subjects and verbs, and, secondarily, number agreement between
subjects and subject anaphors. Because verb agreement in English may call on a
range of information about number from the nonlinguistic message, from the
lexicon, from the morphology, and from other sources, it offers many
opportunities to examine the transmission and interaction of information during
language production. Conversely, because it exhibits strict syntactic
conditioning , it offers opportunities to observe constraints on the
transmission and interaction of information. Predictions about the nature of
information transmission and the types of constraints likely to operate are
derived from an approach to production developed by Garrett (1975, 1988) and
elaborated by others (Bock, 1987a; Lapointe, 1985; Lapointe and Dell, 1989;
Levelt, 1989). The experiments employ agreement-error elicitation tasks inn
tandem with time pronunciation tasks to explore the nature of the number
information used in the agreement operation, the nature of subject
identification and maintenance operations, and the processing demands of
agreement implementation.
