The RESTORING THE EARTH television series will be presented by the Restoring
the Earth organization in association with South Carolina Educational Television
and James Lipscomb Inc., a television documentary producer. RESTORING THE EARTH
is about the greatest challenge facing our species today: restoring our ailing
Planet to health. The story is told in five, hour-long documentary programs
designed for initial release on public television and later use in classrooms.
This series brings viewers an intimate look at the struggles and triumphs of men
and women engaged in the science and technology of environmental restoration,
amidst the diversity and glory of the natural world. RESTORING THE EARTH is a
hopeful look at our environmental condition, showcasing success stories and good
tidings, while enhancing public scientific understanding of the looming threats
to life on Earth. The unifying theme is environmental renewal - the healing of
damaged resources and the re-creation of healthy ecosystems from the wreckage of
forests, rivers, prairies, wetlands, and wildlife. The series also shows how
urban areas are being ecologically redesigned. Each program is self- contained
and can be presented alone or as part of the series. The programs are about
restoring rivers and streams (Program 1), restoring wildlife (Program 2),
healing lakes and rebuilding wetlands (Program 3), restoring forests, mines, and
prairies (Program 4), restoring the air, stabilizing the climate, and building
ecologically sound cities (Program 5). The programs include stories such as,
"River Revival," "The Prairie Makers," "Predator's Return," "The Marsh
Builders," "Floodplains Aflame," "Streams Reborn," "Lake Revival," "Quiet
Mines," "The Toxic Temple," "Wetlands Regained," and "Tomorrow's Cities." The
RESTORING THE EARTH television series highlights humanity's capacity for
repairing environmental damage to the Earth. Each episode will relate what has
been done, what is being done, and what can be done to solve current
environmental problems and restore the Earth.
