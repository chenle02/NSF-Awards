This two-year award will support a collaboration between John Tsitsiklis at MIT
and Professors Costas Courcoubetis and Manolis Katevenis of the University of
Crete and the Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas (FORTH) in Greece.
The collaboration will focus on performance analysis, congestion control, and
pricing in high- speed integrated services communication networks. The PI will
also collaborate with Professor Psaraftis of the National Technical University
of Athens on vessel routing under uncertainty. The PI brings to the
collaboration expertise in the development of approximate dynamic programming
methods, and the Greek counterparts bring methodological expertise from their
extensive involvement in cutting edge projects in pricing in ATM networks and
design of ATM switches. The objective of the research is to develop clean and
insightful formulations of key problems in this area and to proceed with an
analytic or computational solution.
