9502069 Dong This project is on research to better understand cell adhesion
under flow and cell motility. The aims of this research are: (1) to develop the
experimental capability to elucidate the cellular processes of adhesion and
motility and their related biological behavior, (2) to develop the theoretical
capability to derive satisfactory comparisons of the model predictions with
experimental results and to obtain the mechanistic parameters affecting cellular
processes, and (3) to establish a foundation for an integrated cellular
engineering research program. Cell adhesion and motility are two intimately
related biological processes that affect the course of the inflammatory process
and the metastasis of cancer cells. ***
