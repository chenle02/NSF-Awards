Irving Epstein and Anatol Zhabotinsky of Brandeis University are supported by
the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to carry out experimental and
computational research in nonlinear chemical dynamics, focusing on creating and
understanding a variety of new phenomena involving different aspects of pattern
formation in reaction-diffusion systems. Four areas will be explored. First, the
behavior of oscillating chemical reactions in water-oil-surfactant
microemulsions will be examined, utilizing a new flow reactor configuration and
a wider range of reactions and surfactants. Next, external light source
perturbation will be used to probe Turing patterns, standing waves, and cluster
patterns in the chlorine dioxide- iodine-malonic acid reaction, to seek new
forms of resonant behavior and to study the facts of growth on pattern
formation. As well, efforts will be undertaken to develop a systematic
understanding of "chemical optics," the behavior of various types of chemical
waves involving reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference. Finally,
new systems for pattern formation studies will be developed, including (a)
oscillators involving calcium ions, (b) pH oscillators that oscillate in closed
as well as open systems, (c) simple enzyme-based oscillators, and (4) the
platinum-catalyzed reaction of hypophosphite ion with certain manganese species.
Research outcomes will have potential applications to biology, catalysis, and
information processing. As well, these phenomena are aesthetically appealing,
and demonstrations and presentations can interest a wide range of scientific and
lay audiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pattern formation in chemistry is a central
problem in modern macroscopic chemical kinetics. Reaction-diffusion systems
constitute the most convenient analog models for pattern formation in
neurobiology, catalysis, and ecology, and are useful for information processing.
These phenomena involve global feedback and/or the propagation of chemical waves
through nonuniform media.&lt;br/&gt;
