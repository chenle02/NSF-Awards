This project will integrate studies of magnetic reconnection with educational
procedures for both undergraduate students and graduate students on the subject
of reconnection. Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process the converts
magnetic energy to into heat and high speed flows in many natural and artificial
plasmas. It plays an essential role in the physics of the Earth's magnetosphere,
the interaction of the magnetosphere with the solar wind, the solar corona, the
interstellar medium, molecular clouds and accretion disks. In addition it also
plays an important role in laboratory fusion experiments. This project is a five
year plan that will examine questions about the role of plasma instabilities on
3-D reconnection; the role of strong gradients, weak magnetic shear and finite
collision frequency on the reconnection rate; the role of reconnection on small
scale turbulence; the experimental signatures of reconnection; and comparison of
model/simulation results to observations of reconnection in systems such as the
Earth's magnetopause. All these scientific investigations will be integrated in
undergraduate and graduate physics courses. This project will aid in the
establishment of the Dartmouth Computational Plasma Physics Facility.
