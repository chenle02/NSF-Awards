This project develops materials for computing in and out of the classroom for
engineering dynamics. The project uses simulation and animation for the teaching
of kinematic and kinetic phenomena. The materials developed are highly
transportable due to the universal nature of the course matter covered. The
authors have shown that it is feasible to perform these animations with
inexpensive PC/AT-class hardware and that workstation-class hardware is not
required.
