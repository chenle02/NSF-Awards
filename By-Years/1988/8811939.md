Description: This project provides support for travel and living expenses for
Dr. Pervez Hoodbhoy, Department of Physics, Quaid-I-Azam University (QAU)
Islamabad, Pakistan to participate in a research project with Dr. John W. Negele
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge. The project will be in the
area of Nuclear Chromodynamics, the role of quarks and gluons in determining the
structure and properties of atomic nuclei. The MIT physics group has taken the
lead in attacking the challenging task of unravelling the quarks structure of
nuclei. The efforts are concentrated on development of nucleon models,
calculation of elastic scattering form factors, direct excitation of quark and
color degrees of freedom, direct measurements of quark momentum in very high
energy deeply inelastic electron scattering, and creation of abnormal states of
hadron matter to detect their momentary existance. The QAU group is also deeply
interested in this approach. Scope: The MIT - QAU collaboration has started, and
there already exists one paper in the area of Nuclear Chromodynamics written by
Hoodbhoy and R.L. Jaffee of MIT. Further work at QAU resulted in more
publications. It is likely that this collaboration will benefit both teams and
lead to significant results in addition to building a viable scientific research
capability in theoretical nuclear physics in Pakistan, as envisioned in the
Science in Developing Countries Program.
