9532038 Sottos This award supports experimental and theoretical research on the
characterization of small scale smart materials. These materials are used in
micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS). a unique micro-interferometric
technique and the photoelastic method will be used to measure local deformations
from internal actuations or external loads. Results of these experiments will
then be used to evaluate existing smart material models for use at this smaller
scale. Special attention will be given to the effects of residual stresses
induced during processing and poling of these materials. ***
