The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be a technology enabling 3D printing of
high-performance materials. A rapid and versatile ability to fabricate 3D parts
that are lightweight, heat-resistant, biocompatible, and chemically inactive
would yield improved manufacturing capabilities across a range of potential
commercial applications, such as medical devices, implants, dental materials,
automotive parts, aircraft, and spacecraft materials. This project will advance
the development of new materials for the 3D printing
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I
Project will advance a technology based on a new chemical reactivity recently
discovered for producing high-performance plastics and composites. This unique
catalyst-resin system will be developed for use in 3D printing. The photoredox
catalyst will be redesigned for efficient curing, within seconds per layer
without a need for solvents. The resin systems will be formulated for rapid
crosslinking, low volatility, and high-resolution 3D printing. Finally, the
complete catalyst-resin combination will be optimized for use with commercial
vat photopolymerization 3D printing equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
