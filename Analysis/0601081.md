Spectral Properties of Ergodic Schroedinger Operators

Abstract of Proposed Research Svetlana Jitomirskaya

This project is to study spectra and localization type effects for ergodic
Schroedinger operators and the study of anomalous absolutely continuous spectrum
and anomalous quantum transport in the quasiperiodic and Anderson model-type
settings. It is also planned to study several models related to Bloch electrons
in constant and/or random magnetic fields. The project involves the continuing
development of non-perturbative methods both for the proofs of localization and
other related properties as well as for the study of absolutely continuous
spectrum. Other important objectives are the study of issues related to Cantor
spectra of quasiperiodic operators, it's occurrence, prevalence, and scaling
properties, and the development of smooth (rather than analytic) methods.

The proposed research investigates the anomalous spectral and diffusive
properties of quasiperiodic and other deterministic and random structures. This
is basic research on the fundamental properties of disordered systems that serve
as models of systems with impurities. Quasiperiodic operators provide central or
important models for integer quantum Hall effect, experimental quasicrystals,
and quantum chaos theory. The development of the rigorous theory is expected to
contribute to the understanding of all three phenomena, and in particular, may
lead to finding new materials with desired physical properties. Disordered
systems are also used in modeling many other micro and macro effects: from
quantum localization to earthquakes. The proposed topics include studying
properties of both highly and weakly disordered systems of Quantum Mechanics
that demonstrate certain anomalous behavior.
