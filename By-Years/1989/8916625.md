The primary objective of this proposal is to examine the hypothesis that
chemotactic factors are elaborated in the normal peritoneal cavity and govern
the migration of cells into and out of the peritoneal cavity. In preliminary
studies this hypothesis has been experimentally supported by the finding that
peritoneal fluid isolated from non-stimulated mice was effective in stimulating
cell motility in vitro. To further explore this hypothesis, approaches will be
used that will facilitate the isolation, concentration, and purification of
chemotactic factors from the peritoneal fluid of non-stimulated animals so that
specific components can be evaluated in one of several proven chemotaxis
migration assay methods (blind-well assay method). In this study factor(s) that
are chemotactic for cells of the normal peritoneal cavity will be isolated,
purified by gel filtration, and assayed. Rabbit antisera against the chemotactic
factor(s) from the normal peritoneal cavity will be prepared. This project is
directed toward understanding the biochemical factors regulating the behavior of
migratory cells in the peritoneal cavities of normal animals. Biochemical,
immunological, in vitro migration assays, cell culture and electron microscope
methods will be applied to this important fundamental problem.
