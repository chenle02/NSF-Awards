This proposal outlined two novel but "intelligent" applications of the
piezoelectric phenomena in ceramics and ceramic composites. One utilizes the
piezoelectric effect in the detection of stresses and cracks in monlithic
ceramics and ceramic composites. It will also prevent cracking and crack growth
as a result of the piezoelectrically generated compressive forces. the other
application utilizes the piezoelectric effect to produce forces, either
compressive or tensile, on fiber-matrix interfaces in order to modify the fiber-
matrix interfacial shear strenths in the ceramic composites. Special tape-
casting and laminating technique will be used to produce the monolithic BaTiO3
ceramics and the uniaxially-reinforced sapphire fiber BaTiO3 matrix composites.
This proposed program will provide fundamental understanding of the synthesis of
"intelligent" ceramics and ceramic matrix composites and their properties. %%%%
This program outlined two "intelligent" applications of the piezoelectric
phenomena in ceramics and ceramic matrix composites. One uses the piezoelectric
effect to detect stresses and cracks and to use the piezoelectrically generated
forces to prevent cracking and crack growth. The other uses the effect to
produce forces on the fiber-matrix interfaces and to modify shear strengths
through them. Special tape-casting and laminating technique will be used to
produce the BaTiO3 ceramics and uniaxially-reienforced sapphire fiber BaTiO3
matrix composites. This study will provide fundamental understanding of the
synthesis and "intelligent" ceramics and ceramic matrix composites and their
properties. Potential commercial applications can be enormous and wide-ranged
into many industrial sectors.
