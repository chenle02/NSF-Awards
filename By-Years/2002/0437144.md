This international collaborative project provides support for US students and
researchers and the European network will provide similar support for their
students and researchers. The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Membrane Applied Science and Technology (MAST) will provide any additional
support needed by the students for their projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
participation of the MAST Center will involve several
components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) The MAST Center will perform two research
projects that will be linked to the EU network&lt;br/&gt;2) MAST Center students
will perform some of their research at EU network facilities&lt;br/&gt;3) The
MAST Center will provide access to European researchers to use equipment and
facilities&lt;br/&gt;4) European PhD students can perform some of their research
at MAST&lt;br/&gt;5) US students and researchers can access the resources of the
European network&lt;br/&gt;6) MAST researchers will participate in the annual
technical meetings for the network&lt;br/&gt;7) MAST researchers can develop
interactions that can lead to collaborative projects.&lt;br/&gt;
