Analyses of light stable isotopes in bulk organic matter and major compound
classes are widely used by organic geochemists to assess the origin and thermal
maturity of fine-grained sedimentary rocks. In the last five years, it has
become possible to determine the carbon isotopic composition of individual
organic compounds using instruments with a gas chromatograph coupled to an
isotope mass spectrometer. Application of isotope ratio monitoring of individual
compounds (IRM/GC-MS) to a wide range of geological problems is beginning to
emerge. PIs will utilize IRM/GC-MS for a direct comparison of the isotopic
composition of lipid biomarkers (organic molecular fossils) between soft tissues
and organic matter within mineralized tissues of bivalve shells. Both living
shells and fossil shells will be surveyed. If sufficient quantities of lipids
can be extracted from shells and if lipids from the shell mimic the isotopic
composition of the mantle tissues, then it should be feasible to use shell
lipids for studies of molecular paleontology and paleoecology.
