NeTS-NR: Efficient and Localized Broadcasting in Ad Hoc Wireless Networks

Abstract

Collective communication represents a set of important communication functions
that involve multiple senders and receivers. Broadcasting is one of the
fundamental operations and has extensive applications, including the route
discovery process in reactive routing protocols, naming and addressing, and
dense mode multicasting. Due to the broadcast nature of wireless communication,
blind flooding of the broadcast message may cause serious contention and
collision, resulting in the broadcast storm problem. This project studies the
challenge of efficient and localized broadcasting in ad hoc wireless networks by
offering a generic framework that can capture many existing localized broadcast
algorithms and, in addition, some efficient solutions can be derived from this
framework. This research has six thrusts: (1) Provide a more generic framework
for deterministic and localized broadcasting in ad hoc networks, including
constructing consistent views. (2) Derive cost-effective broadcast schemes from
the framework. (3) Reduce excessive broadcast redundancy through energy-
efficient design,. (4) Explore the use of broadcasting as a basic building block
to support other types of collective communication. (5) Ensure broadcast
coverage with controlled redundant transmission without solely relying on
ACK/NACK. (6) Integrate different components and fine tune the system through an
empirical study based on a set of well-defined quantitative performance metrics.
The new framework can easily integrate other objectives such as energy-
efficiency and reliability. The results of this research will provide guidelines
for efficient and localized algorithms for a wide range of applications. This
research will also exploit and contribute to theoretical studies in graph theory
and distributed algorithms.
