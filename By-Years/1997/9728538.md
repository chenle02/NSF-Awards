This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
studies of high-density quark and gluon systems, which are produced in high-
energy hadronic and heavy ion collisions. The collaboration involves Alfred
Mueller of Columbia University and Dominique Schiff and Gregory Korchemsky of
the University of Paris, Orsay. The investigators propose to study the
interaction of very high-energy quarks with the dense system in order to
understand better the role of quark and gluon jets as probes of hot quark-gluon
plasma. In the hadronic case, they will study how unitarity comes about in high-
energy, hard collisions. The US investigator brings to this collaboration
expertise on high-energy interaction of particles in nuclei. This is
complemented by French expertise in finite temperature QCD (quantum chrome
dynamics), probes of quark-gluon plasma, and high-energy scattering. The project
will advance fundamental understanding in theoretical, high-energy, particle
physics.
