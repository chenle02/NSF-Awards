In this project funded by the Americas Program of the Office of International
Science and Engineering, Philip S. Ward and Alexander Wild will provide a
taxonomic revision and phylogenetic analysis of the Neotropical ant genus
Linepithema Mayr 1866. This project is a collaborative effort with John A.
Kochalka at the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural in Paraguay. It involves
field work in the center of diversity for Linepithema in southern South America,
museum visits to examine important myrmecological collections and type specimens
in South America and Europe, and development of DNA sequence data to be used in
phylogenetic reconstruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Linepithema is an extremely
important invasive ant, and the Argentine ant L. humile is highly successful and
one of the most damaging invasive pest ants worldwide. A proper taxonomic
treatment of this group is required for its correct identification and potential
management through bio-control. The results of the project will be posted on the
Internet and will be accessible to a very broad audience. On a broader scale,
this study should help provide a more rigorous understanding of the nature of
invasive species as a whole. The field work abroad will provide an international
experience that will enhance a graduate student's training.&lt;br/&gt;
