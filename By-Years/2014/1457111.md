The quality of infants' social experiences over the course of development
affects most aspects of their developing self. One of the biggest contributors
to infant social experience is the mother. This is especially true in coping
with stressful situations. Mothers' ability to regulate their own emotions and
behaviors in stressful situations influences infants' ability to regulate their
own stress reactions. This project aims to explore this relationship by
introducing a moderate stressor experimentally to both mothers and their
infants. Of interest is how maternal stress affects maternal self-regulation,
infants' regulation, and the subsequent interaction between the two. To address
this question, 160 mother-infant dyads will be randomly assigned to one of two
stress conditions, maternal stress or non-stress. To begin, all dyads will first
participate in typical face-to-face play to assess individuals' and dyads'
baseline behavior and physiology. Next, depending upon condition, mothers will
hear either infant distress cries (maternal stressor) or positive vocalizations.
Then, infants will be stressed using a standard approach called the Face-to-Face
Still-Face paradigm in which the adult remains still and non-reactive while
facing the infant. This project will assess whether the induced maternal stress
predicts maternal, infant, and dyadic stress reactions during and following the
infant stressor. Raising a child in today's fast-paced and often chaotic society
can prove daunting for most mothers. This project will introduce a reliable,
innovative approach to manipulating maternal stress in an effort to better
understand differences in maternal stress regulation. Results from this project
will better inform intervention strategies by helping to identify mothers who
are more vulnerable to stress and who, as a result, engage in less healthy
stress regulation interactions with their infants thereby compromising the
infant's capacity for healthy emotion regulation and social development.
