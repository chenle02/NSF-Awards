In this first application to NSF by a recent Ph.D., Dr. Douglas Erwin proposes
a phylogenetic study of a difficult group of Paleozoic gastropods, using
traditional characters supplemented with morphometric analysis. The family
Subulitidae are an important group in that they display a mosaic of primitive
and advanced characters. The proposed research would use a microcomputer-based
image analysis system to measure subtle morphological features, and then convert
these measures into discrete characters for phylogenetic analysis. New
systematic procedures will result, along with a better understanding of the
systematics and evolution of a pivotal group of gastropods. This project is an
ambitious attempt to use morphometric analysis to define characters for
reconstructing ancestor- descendant relationships. Developing such a set of
procedures would have wide impact on systematic practices in essentially all
groups of organisms. The potential implications of such procedures are broad and
highly significant.
