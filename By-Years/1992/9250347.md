The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a 300-MHz Fourier- transform nuclear
magnetic resonance spectrometer capable of rapid determination of 1H and 13C NMR
spectra in an undergraduate setting. This instrument is allowing the exploration
of most of the new NMR techniques, such as APT, DEPT, COSY, NOE and HETCOR, now
used to determine molecular parameters. The availability of a variable
temperature module is allowing dynamic properties of molecules to be studied.
The equipment is being used extensively in seven undergraduate courses in
organic, inorganic, physical, and biochemistry and in faculty-supervised
undergraduate research projects during the academic year and summer to achieve
significant improvement and development of the undergraduate course sequence. In
addition, faculty at area high schools are gaining hands-on experience on the
instrument, and faculty and students at two neighboring colleges are using the
instrument.
