9315211 Conti The major objective of this project is to develop and test
strategies for reducing costs of the delivery of PET services, i.e., to lower
the cost of diagnosis, while maintaining both the quality of, and access to, PET
services. A detailed cost analysis of the cost of PET services at current levels
of efficiency, and for newly- proposed alternative operational and
organizational configurations, will be prepared, as will paradigms which
optimize the utilization of the equipment and supplies. The cost analysis is to
be prepared using financial data from several institutions and will be compared
to the actual experience at the University of Southern California. ***
