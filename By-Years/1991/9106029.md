The Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Virginia will
purchase graphics workstation equipment which will be dedicated to support
research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several
research projects, including in particular: Computational Aspects In
Stabilization Theory For Large Flexible Structures; Solution of Finite Element
Equations on Multiprocessor Architectures; Mathematical Modeling- Scientific
Computing Physical Systems- Dynamical Phenomena; Severe Edge Effects and Simple
Complementary Interior Solutions for Thin-Walled Anisotropic and Composite
Structures.
