Dr. John Arnold, Chemistry Department, University of California - Berkeley, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division to study the interactions of the heavier group 12
elements with metals. This largely synthetic chemistry project targets the
design of chalcogenate ligands that will stabilize specific metal-chalcogen
interactions and the use of these ligands to prepare a range of chalcogenate
compounds. Analogs of metal alkoxides and thiols will be prepared with
chalcogenolate moieties, -Se-R and -Te-R, whose `R` groups are designed to yield
molecular species with stable metal-selenium or -tellurium bonds. The reactions
and mechanisms of these compounds will be systematized. There are a number of
advanced electronic materials which are based on metal-selenium and -tellurium
systems. Selenium and tellurium chemistry, however, is not yet well understood.
This project aims at the preparation of new types on metal compounds that
contain stable metal-selenium and -tellurium bonds and at systematizing the
chemical behavior of these linkages. By knowing the typical reactions of M-Se
and M-Te bonds, new routes to electronic materials may be designed.
