This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
Syracuse University. The focus of the project is to study linguistic practice in
a North Indian village within discourses of everyday social interaction, and in
the context of verbal performances The speech of different caste members in the
village as well as more specialized performers will be analyzed to discover and
report on the logic of linguistic interpersonal negotiation in Hindi. Methods
will include participant observation and careful recording of verbal
interactions and performances. The fundamental question is to understand how
people select or reveal through their linguistic forms their social position
with respect to the other member of the conversation. This research will advance
our understanding of how language situates a person in a social field of
interaction. By analyzing the discursive tools and frames in which members of
this culture appreciate artistic forms and reveal differences in status, this
case study will help advance our general understanding of how people's discourse
constructs as well as reflects their social reality.
