National Council of Teachers of Mathematics The National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics will conduct a two-year project to produce and disseminate the
PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS FOR TEACHING MATHEMATICS. This is the companion to the
CURRICULUM AND EVALUATION STANDARDS FOR SCHOOL MATHEMATICS (CESSM), which has
become a milestone in the history of school mathematics. These two sets of
standards represent NCTM's comprehensive and carefully articulated plan to
provide direction for the reform of school mathematics in the United States. The
Professional Standards will consist of three components: standards for teaching,
standards for professional development, and standards for evaluation. Production
and dissemination are modeled after the successful patterns used for CESSM,
including the highly effective review process that vests ownership with the
entire NCTM membership. This is a special Teacher Enhancement project in that it
includes no direct work with participants. The National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics has contributed an amount equal to 99% of the National Science
Foundation request.
