The University of Redlands is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000
bit per second line through the University of California at Riverside and the
CERFNET mid-level network. The connection enables the school's faculty and
students to communicate and collaborate with the international scientific and
educational community, and to access network resources such as libraries,
databases and supercomputers. This award funds part of the costs for two years.
