With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting Professor John
Protasiewicz of Case Western Reserve University to prepare conjugated main group
element compounds to investigate how the identity of the heavier elements
influence their photophysical properties (light absorption and light emission).
This work focuses on the synthesis of compounds with group 15 elements such as
phosphorus, antimony and bismuth. The investigation of conjugated systems allows
the design of new materials that display unusual fluorescence and
phosphorescence properties, which can aid the design and development of
materials with potentially high impact in the energy, display, and lighting
industries. Professor Protasiewicz will integrate the research and educational
components of this project by working with a UNCF-Merck funded postdoctoral
fellow, under the auspices of the university's the Leonard Gelfand STEM Center,
to carry out a series of outreach and STEM activities to promote diversity in
the sciences. Graduate and undergraduate students will receive education and
training in interdisciplinary areas.

In this research, new methods will be developed for the synthesis of conjugated
main group compounds. As the electronic structure of conjugated materials is
highly tunable by synthetic manipulation, a range of photophysical and redox
properties will be accessed. This research will facilitate the design of
materials that are photo- and electro-luminescent. Their individual electronic
properties will be investigated and characterized, with particular attention to
materials of potential interest for OLED and photovoltaic applications. Organo-
bismuth compounds may offer materials that are phosphorescent and that are less
toxic, sustainable, and more economical than related compounds having heavy
transition metal elements. A number of heterocyclic compounds feature unusual
main group-carbon double bonds. Photo-physical properties will be correlated
with structural and theoretical results.
