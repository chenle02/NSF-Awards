*** 9712200 Potter This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer project will
investigate the intrinsic properties of a new phosphor material. There is a
critical need for efficient low voltage phosphors for the continuing development
of field emission displays (FED) to compete effectively with entrenched active
matrix liquid crystal displays (AMLCDs). The proposer has recently developed a
new low voltage blue cathodoluminescent phosphor as a thin film as well as a
proprietary FED. Elevated temperature, and therefore expensive substrates, are
required to integrate this new phosphor into the display device. To permit
integration at lower temperature on less expensive substrates, such as glass or
plastic, the new phosphor material will be synthesized utilizing ceramic
techniques and then deposited using rf sputtering, which is a low temperature
process. Process parameters will be optimized for low voltage cathodoluminescent
efficiency and maximum luminosity. Detailed analysis of the new material will
enable the incorporation of dopants that will provide spectral responses
suitable for full color displays. Establishing viable processes to incorporate
the phosphor into FEDs will lead to the Phase II objective of fabricating the
proposer's FED in existing integrated circuit (IC) foundries. A wide variety of
display technologies including field emission, electroluminescent, vacuum
fluorescent, and surface conduction electron emitter display products. ***
