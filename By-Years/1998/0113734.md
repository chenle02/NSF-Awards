This award is to partially fund the symposium "Biodiversity: the interface
between systematics and conservation" held 23-27 June, 2000, in Bloomington,
Indiana, at the joint meetings of the Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB),
Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE), and the American Society of
Naturalists (ASN), as well as the Association for Tropical Biology (ATB). this
symposium is co-sponsored by the SSB and ATB. It will bring together researchers
from a wide variety of fields related to biodiversity and conservation to
discuss the relevance of systematics to their research and to evaluate various
techniques that make use of systematic and taxonomic data. The topic is timely
because of the increasing recognition of the importance of systematic data in
conservation biology, and the wealth of new methods available for using
systematic data in this context.
