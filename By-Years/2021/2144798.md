Today, privacy sensitive personal data is everywhere. Collecting and performing
analytics on large amounts of personal data has become widespread and is
intrinsic to the functionality of a rapidly growing number of apps and services.
While desirable from a functionality perspective, this now popular computing
paradigm raises unprecedented security and privacy concerns. A key research
challenge is to design protocols for secure and private computation that can
scale to these massive volumes of data. The focus of this project is to develop
such protocols by combining techniques from secure multi-party computation,
sketching algorithms, and differential privacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make
secure computation scale to massive inputs, it is necessary to develop protocols
with costs (i.e., computation and communication) sublinear in the input size.
This project combines advances in all three of the areas mentioned above to
achieve this goal. First, the project studies the privacy properties of
sketching algorithms and develops algorithms well suited to secure multi-party
computation. Next, the project will study the necessary modification to make the
resulting protocols robust to malicious users and inputs. Then, it will consider
how the approximate nature of sketching algorithms impacts the privacy of the
resulting computations and leverage differential privacy to ensure that
individual privacy is maintained. Finally, the project combines these approaches
to instantiate protocols for real-world applications. The results of this
project will enable new secure and privacy-preserving computations for large-
data applications such as machine learning and network measurement.
Additionally, the project will result in research opportunities and new course
materials for graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
