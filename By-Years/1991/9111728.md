This project will use a three-dimensional motion measurement and analysis system
to determine and display gait patterns exhibited by humans under normal daily
activities. The equipment, which will be funded partially through this grant,
consists of four subsystems: 1) a video image analysis system, 2) a data
acquisition subsystem, 3) a computer workstation, and 4) a force analysis
subsytem. This equipment will enable an experimental Biomechanics Laboratory to
be established in the department of Mechanical Engineering. Among the research
projects that will be performed are a study of the influence of load carriage on
the biomechanics of walking gait, the design analysis, construction, and
evaluation of polyaction knee orthoses, the response of trunk muscles to static
and dynamic physical task performance, the influence of load and the method of
load carriage on the kinetics and kinematics of stair ascent and descent, and
the locomotor characteristics of those with degenerative joint disease.
