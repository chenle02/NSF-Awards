This is a Conference grant award to provide partial travel assistance for five
postdoctoral fellows and graduate students to attend the International Meeting
on Gap Junctions, to be held on June 9-13, 1991 at Asilomar Conference Center,
Pacific Grove, California. This will be the fourth in a series of major
comprehensive meetings on gap junctions to be held since 1984, and the most
recent since 1989. The field of gap junctions has expanded enormously in the
past two years, and therefore this meeting is timely and important.
