The proposed research program is directed at determining the global geometry of
the open magnetosphere and its connection to the ionosphere. The program will
build on much of the proposing team's prior work as well as related work of
others. Four programmatic elements are: 1. analyses of IMP 8 plasma and field
data to specify and document the open geometry of the tail; 2. comparisons of
these results with global MHD simulations to test simulation applicability and
to extend the description of the open geometry to the full magnetosphere; 3.
comparisons of both observational and simulation results with appropriately
constructed, multi-component superposition models to elucidate the magnetic
topology of the open geometry at higher resolution than obtainable with the MHD
model; and 4. extend the LLBL-ionosphere coupling model of Siscoe, Lotko,
Sonnerup, and Maynard to incorporate the new geometry. A focusing objective for
the stated program, to determine the global open geometry of the magnetosphere,
is to ascertain explicitly the 3- dimensional geometry of the topological
separatrices of the magnetic field, of which there might be several sets of
distinct topological types. This will be done for various orientations of the
interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), including northward, which perhaps poses
the greatest challenge. Locating these topological features relative to the
geometry of the main structural elements of the magnetosphere will bear directly
on answers to the following questions: Where are the sites of magnetic
reconnection at the magnetopause and in the tail? How do they fit within the
global geometry? What is the geometrical distribution of the open and closed
regions on the 3-D magnetospheric boundary: The answer to this last question
bears directly on the question of the spatial relationships between the dayside
cusp, the low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL), and the plasma mantle, and on the
question of whether the LLBL is open or closed.
