A mercury intrusion porosimeter is purchased. The instrument is used to measure
pore sizes in porous or granular materials by forcing mercury under pressure
into the material. Since mercury does not wet the surfaces, there is a simple
relationship between pressure and pore sizes which can be used to calibrate the
instrument. The porosimeter will be used to study pore size in concrete and to
relate the pore size to durability. Another project will relate the pore size of
cement pastes with strength. Research will be carried out correlating pore size
with properties of bricks, coal, soils, and porous polymers.
