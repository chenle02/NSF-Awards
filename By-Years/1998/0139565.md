New hybrid inorganic/organic materials with open-framework structures and
improved properties based on various multifunctional linkers will be
synthesized. The emphasis on transition-metal - multifunctional linker systems
will lead to new open-framework compounds with new structures and novel
properties. For example, the borophosphate group, a multifunctional "linker"
with borate and phosphate functionalities, is a novel species that acts
similarly to the aluminophosphates in some compounds, but brings unique
structural features in others. Envisioned for this project is further
utilization of such capabilities by using analogies with known open-framework
compounds where various templates, transition metals, and synthetic conditions
will be systematically studied. Other multifunctional linkers to be investigated
include di-phosphonates, carboxy-phosphonates, and phosphonated a-aminoacids to
provide various coordination modes to the transition metal centers as well as
different functionalities to the solid. Students involved with this project will
acquire valuable skills in structure characterization, property measurements and
novel synthetic techniques. Their training in cutting-edge research methodology
is emphasized. %%% Inorganic/organic hybrid materials have significant potential
for applications in molecular separation and sensing, ion exchange, and
catalysis in the petrochemical industry and for chemicals production. The
technological impact of the latter will be in improvements in chemical
processing and, subsequently, an increase in energy-use efficiency. The
educational aspect of the program is aimed at teaching undergraduate and
graduate students not only in particular lab techniques but also in general
understanding and appreciation of solid state chemistry. Training in these areas
will make these chemists highly competitive for employment in universities and
in chemical industry.
