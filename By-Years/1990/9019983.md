This grant supports research activities which will address a wide range of
issues in nuclear physics. Measurements of the asymmetry in the beta-decay of
mirror nuclei will test the Conserved Vector Current hypothesis. Other
measurements of the beta-asymmetry/electro-polarization correlation will test
aspects of the Standard Model for the weak interaction. Intermediate energy
electron scattering experiments will give information on the electric and
magnetic form factors of the neutron, electromagnetic properties of 3He, and may
give evidence of color transparency in collisions with high momentum transfer.
