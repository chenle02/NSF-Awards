Polyamines are small charged molecules found in all living cells and required
for cell growth and proliferation. The specific functions carried out by
polyamines in the cell are poorly understood, but their properties strongly
suggest that they interact with nucleic acids. This proposal is to carry out a
systematic study of the interaction between polyamines and chromosome
components, including DNA, nucleosome core particles, nucleosomes,
oligonucleosomes, and "long" chromatin. It is known that the interaction between
polyamines and nucleosomes or nucleosome core particles is considerably more
complicated than a purely electrostatic interaction and that polyamines can
cause a conformational change in nucleosome core particles. Future studies will
extend the work with thermal denaturation and circular dichroism, to larger
chromatin components, and will introduce two new methods for studying the
interaction at all levels, namely "footprinting" with hydroxyl radicals, and
photoaffinity labeling. The study is particularly focused on the effect of
polyamine acetylation because preliminary work has confirmed the possibility
that this process may be important in the dymanics of changing chromatin
structure, possibly coordinated with histone acetylation. The use of
photoaffinity labeling to probe the distribution of polyamines in vivo will also
be investigated. While the function of polyamines in the cell is currently
unknown, their ubiquitous distribution suggests some fundamental role in
maintaining gene structure or function. The results of this study on polyamine
interactions should aid materially in developing a testable model for their role
in cell metabolism.
