This is the first year of a three-year continuing Research Initiation Award. The
research aims to develop a new kind of adaptive machine for the orientation and
presentation of small parts in a manufacturing assembly system. Such machines
have the potential for a large impact in manufacturing, especially in small-
batch manufacturing in the context of agile manufacturing systems. The research
explores the fundamental science of automation required to build such a machine,
including development of appropriate methods for reasoning under uncertainty,
machine learning methods for design of feeder track reorienting devices, and
methods of automated planning for design of new feeder tracks. The ideas will be
tested on a prototype software-programmable parts feeder for laminar parts,
based on vibratory bowl feeder designs.
