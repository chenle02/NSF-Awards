This proposal will bring twelve undergraduate students for a ten week session
at Syracuse University in the summer of 1992. At least seven will be from
locations external to Syracuse University. The program will combine the
resources of the Syracuse Center for Computational Sciences, the Northeast
Parallel Architecture Center, the Department of Physics, and the School of
Computer and Information Science. A particular effort will be made to attract
women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. The areas from which the
projects will be selected include the following: parallel computing software and
algorithms, pattern recognition and computer vision, neural networks,
optimization problems, virtual reality, computational condensed matter physics,
statistical mechanics, nonlinear dynamics, and use of computers in education.
