0339561&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
Project entails development of a &lt;br/&gt;novel on-chip electronic encoding
bead-array detection system for simultaneous &lt;br/&gt;multiplexed detection of
pathogenic agents. This technology will offer a quick and highly
&lt;br/&gt;sensitive identification method for pathogens or toxins. Most current
systems for the fast &lt;br/&gt;detection of pathogens are based on fluorescent
dye labeling and optical detection of the &lt;br/&gt;signal, which are prone to
photobleaching and are likely to fall short when multiplex &lt;br/&gt;detection
is required. This new electronic encoding and chip-based system is highly
flexible&lt;br/&gt;and can be used for direct detection and identification of
whole pathogens, toxins or DNA/RNA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The method will have a
broad impact on a number of bioanalytical fields because it will be capable of
rapid, highly sensitive and multiplexed identification of pathogens or their
toxins. The proposed research will have broad impact and applications in
molecular diagnostics, and detection of infectious disease and biological
agents. The applications will range from the detection of pathogens and
biological warfare agents in environmental, agricultural and medical samples to
infectious disease in clinical, molecular diagnostic and forensic applications.
