This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
photonic devices based on novel rare earth-aluminum oxide (REAl) glass. These
devices exploit electronic transitions in rare earth doped and co-doped glass
that potentially enable efficient laser action at wavelengths from 480 to 2250
nanometers (nm) when pumped by inexpensive diode lasers. Phase I will focus on
the feasibility of devices having emissions at 1480 nm and possibly 1300 nm
emission for telecommunications applications. The behavior of 480-490 nm
emissions will be characterized with a view toward use in optical data storage
applications. Phase I will also synthesize and characterize doped rare earth-
aluminum oxide glasses, and establish protoype device performance. Measurements
on the rare earth doped REAl glasses will include the spectral absorption
coefficient at the pump wavelength, fluorescence cross section line shape, slope
efficiency, fluorescence lifetime, single pass gain, and IR transmission.

Potential commercial applications include small laser or optical amplifier
devices to extend the fiber telecommunication bandwidth for use in high-density
optical data storage devices.
