While significant progress has been made recently in color image- analyzed
microscopy, considerable intervention by a skilled microscopist is still
required for visual classification of cell types. An accurate, rapid
classification method could significantly improve the automation of color image-
analyzed fluorescence microscopy for estimating plankton cell size and biomass
and could benefit environmental managers and policy makers concerned with the
quality of coastal and estuarine waters. This project will investigate an
automatic classification technique which mimics human visual classification. A
multilayered perception neural network on color image features will be trained
to perform this classification in real time. The image data will be obtained
from whole water plankton samples from estuarine, coastal and oceanic
environments which have been prepared using standard techniques in image
analyzed fluorescence microscopy.
