The objective of this research project is to develop and analyze next generation
stochastic simulation methods for the models found in biochemistry. Such models
include gene regulatory networks, neural networks, and models of viral infection
and growth. Specifically, the two main research topics considered are the
efficient computation of expectations and the efficient computation of
parametric sensitivities. The mathematical focus of the project will the
development of Monte Carlo estimators that are unbiased, yet orders of magnitude
more efficient than the current state of the art. To achieve such efficiency,
novel coupling procedures, sometimes used in conjunction with the multi-level
Monte Carlo framework, will be employed in both project areas.

Due in part to the appearance of new technologies, most notably fluorescent
proteins, there is now a large literature demonstrating that the fluctuations
arising from the effective randomness of molecular interactions can have
significant consequences, including a randomization of phenotypic outcomes and
non-genetic population heterogeneity. In such cases, stochastic models, combined
with both analytical and computational tools, are essential if they are to be
well understood. The problems that will be addressed in this project often form
the bottleneck in computational experiments in systems biology. Hence, the
research will make possible many realistic modeling and simulation scenarios
that are beyond the range of existing techniques. As the relevant models include
those for both gene networks and viral growth, this project plays a role in
improving long-term human health by greatly improving the predictive power of
such models.
