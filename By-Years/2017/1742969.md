NSF large facilities are major science and engineering research platforms that
serve whole research communities. Cyberinfrastructure (CI) comprises advanced
computing, data and software infrastructure, networking, related cybersecurity,
and related training and workforce development -- all also designed to broadly
serve the research community. NSF facilities are increasingly depending on CI --
including that within a facility as well as existing CI resources and
capabilities located outside the facility. This award supports the conduct of a
National Science Foundation Large Facilities Cyberinfrastructure Workshop in
Alexandria, Virginia on September 6 and 7, 2017. The workshop has the overall
goal of enabling direct and synergistic interactions among the NSF large
facilities community and the cyberinfrastructure (CI) community to jointly
address the CI needs and sustainability of existing and future large facilities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objectives of the workshop include developing a common
understanding of current and evolving large facilities CI architectures, design
and operational practices, issues and gaps; and identifying common CI
requirements, solutions and opportunities for interoperability and sharing
elements across facilities. Desired outcomes include disseminating practices
that can aid future large facilities in developing and sustaining CI; enabling
CI developers to most effectively target facility needs; exploring means for
continuing and sustaining the community conversation and activities initiated at
the workshop; and generating input that can inform future NSF planning for CI-
related programs. The report from the workshop will be publically posted, and
this activity is anticipated to have broad impacts in advancing the needs of
large scale science and engineering research.
