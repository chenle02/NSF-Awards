This proposal would partially support the travel of 50 scientists to attend the
XIth International Symposium on Comparative Endocrinology to be held near
Malaga, Spain from May 14 to May 20, 1989. The symposium will integrate all
areas of comparative endocrinology, from unicellular organisms up to and
including mammals while covering all aspects from the molecular to the
organismic level. The symposium is intended to assure the active participation
of younger scientists and intends to serve as a forum for the formation of an
International Federation of Comparative Endocrinologists. Two satellite symposia
associated on the aquaculture of teleosts and the reproduction of cyclostomes
will follow. The symposium is open to everyone interested and has been announced
in the scientific journals. The proceedings will be published within 3 months of
the meeting. Four hundred to five hundred participants are expected from more
than 40 nations, with 150 U.S. scientists expressing an interest. Travel funds
will be used to support the travel of junior as well as senior scientists with
appropriate regard for the support of women and minorities. This international
symposium will allow the meeting of scientists from around the world to exchange
ideas in a timely fashion on the endocrinology of diverse species, a topic of
great importance to the area of biodiversity.
