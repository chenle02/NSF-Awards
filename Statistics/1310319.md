Rapidly advancing medical imaging technologies are producing massive amounts of
complex imaging data, and are imposing unprecedented demands for new statistical
methodology. The investigators aim to integrate advanced statistical modeling
with modern computational techniques to address some most challenging questions
arising from medical imaging analysis. The investigators propose a novel
statistical framework and develop accompanying theory and algorithms for tensor
regression, i.e., regression with image covariates that are in the form of
multidimensional arrays / tensors. They study a variety of regularization
schemes in the context of tensor regression to stabilize estimation, improve
risk property, and reconstruct sparse signals. They also develop methodology
within the tensor regression framework for scientific applications including
brain region and connectivity pattern identification, imaging based disease
diagnosis, and multiple imaging modalities analysis. The project offers a
systematic solution to a family of imaging data problems, and also provides a
new class of statistical regression methods.

One of the most intriguing questions in modern science is to understand human
brains, both those of general population and those with neuropsychiatric and
neurodegenerative disorders. Advanced medical imaging technologies provide
powerful tools to help address the question, producing imaging data of
unprecedented size and complexity. The investigators aim to develop a host of
novel statistical methods, theories, and highly scalable algorithms for the
analysis of massive medical imaging data. The proposed research is expected to
make significant contributions on two fronts: timely response to the growing
needs and challenges of neuroimaging data analysis, and development of an
utterly new and broad statistical framework and the associated methodology that
contributes to the advance of the statistical discipline.
