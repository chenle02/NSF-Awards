This award supports travel and living expenses for 8 to 10 US advanced students
to participate in a near-surface volcano-geophysics field camp on Montserrat.
The purpose of the field camp is to train these students in the use of advanced
geophysical equipment in the study of active volcanic terrains. The request for
student training takes advantage of an existing US0-NSF and UK-NERC sponsored
effort to understand the science and hazards of the relatively silisic volcanic
system on Montserrat. The student training is further being organized so as to
take advantage of the advanced volcano-geophysics and near-surface
enivornmental-geophysics field camp that will be run on Montserrat by J. Neuberg
(Leeds University, the UK). As a result, there will be no costs for renting or
transporting heavy geophysical equipment to this island volcano. It is also
anticipated that the results of the field camp will be used in planning the
installation of the geophysical observatories that are part of the NSF/NERC
sponsored science program on Montserrat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational
purpose of the field camp will be two fold: (1) to demonstrate the techniques
and value of 3D geophysical surveying and data in active volcanic geology, and
(2) acquaint a large group of students with the scientific objectives and
research possibilities of the Montserrat progrm. The student fieldwork and data
analysis include advanced training in modern geophysical investigation methods
and extensive interactions between industry, government, and the universities
involved in the Montserrat science program.
