There is a strong interest across the U.S. to understand how students enter,
exit and persist in pathways toward science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) degrees and careers. However, we still do not have a very
strong understanding of how students enter into STEM, how they persist and why
they follow certain paths to a degree or career in these technical fields. This
study proposes to add to our knowledge of how students proceed in two key areas:
high school course taking and the higher education to career transition.
Additionally, the project seeks to create data tools that will make it easier
for educators, researchers and policymakers to visualize pathways and identify
groups of individuals pursuing specific paths and to share key findings with the
public through a simple interface and intuitive visualizations. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The research will use data on students and the workforce collected by
the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the National Center for
Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES). These datasets will be used to
identify current and past trends in high school student course-taking patterns
and allow for making a prediction about the number of students who will pursue
STEM in college and university based on these patterns. By using nationally
representative data collected by the federal government to investigate these
issues across groups based on age, sex, minority status and disability status,
the results will provide the ability for critical comparisons of differences in
pathways and highlight possible opportunities for intervention. The completed
data tool modules will be made available and maintained as part of the NSF-
funded Sci2Tool. &lt;br/&gt;
