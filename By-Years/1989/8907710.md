One senior investigator will analyze spectral and symplectic invariants of
Hamiltonian actions by Lie groups. In related work, a second senior investigator
will study a new pseudo-differential calculus of operators and inverse
scattering. Working with these two geometers, a post doctoral investigator will
study the Connes-Getzler formalism and Connes' Chern character for non-
commutative algebras. Work will proceed on a variety of geometric and analytic
problems which arise from the study of inverse scattering. This theory is used
to interpret reflected signals. In seismology, inverse scattering is used to
reconstruct the shape of oil or water reservoirs. Other applications include
sonar, radar, and X- ray crystallography.
