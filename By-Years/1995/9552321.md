Essex Community College is implementing new curricula and pedagogical methods
in several mathematics and computer science courses with the objective of having
students adopt a more active role in the learning process. A classroom
laboratory of Macintosh computers and additional student demonstration stations
with projection devices for regular classroom use will be used to replace the
lecture method by classroom and/or laboratory activities, for problem-driven
experimentation and discovery in a wide variety of mathematics and computer
science courses. Learning styles beneficial for female students will be
emphasized, including use of cooperative learning groups, as 60% of ECC students
are female. The department has prepared to adopt the Harvard Consortium calculus
curriculum in all sections as they are offered, beginning with Calculus I. The
NSF-funded Math Modeling/Precalculus Reform Project will be adopted in
experimental sections, while control sections will continue to use a traditional
precalculus curriculum. Use of a CAS will enable exploration of realistic
problems, reduce emphasis on hand manipulations, and provide a visualization
tool. NSF-funded Project Chance materials will be incorporated into statistics
and mathematics for liberal arts courses. Students in mathematics for elementary
education majors will explore NCTM standards-based materials, including
technology appropriate for middle school algebra. Two new introductory computer
science courses, in multimedia technology and Internet resources, will be
offered. These and several existing computer science courses will be taught in a
stimulating multimedia environment to increase student motivation, and also
encourage use of, and develop familiarity with, computer technologies among
students who depend upon the college for their computing experiences.
