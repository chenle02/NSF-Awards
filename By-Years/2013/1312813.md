RAPID: Observations of physical impacts following Hurricane
Sandy&lt;br/&gt;Robert Weiss, Jennifer L Irish, Virginia Polytechnic Institute
and State University, EAR-1312813&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Hurricane Sandy
made landfall near Atlantic City on October 29th 2012. Sandy was classified as a
Category I hurricane; however, a non-tropical weather system merged with Sandy
and created a unique situation that resulted in catastrophic damage along the
shores of New Jersey and New York. To this end, the record surges produced by
Hurricane Sandy resulted in record damages in built and natural environments in
New York and New Jersey. Hurricane Sandy provides the unusual opportunity to
observe and collect information for the purpose of comparing sedimentary
deposits resulting from storms versus those originating from recent tsunamis.
PIs will focus on New Jersey and New York due to the magnitude of the impact and
severity of the damages. In the reconnaissance surveys PIs will measure flood
elevations and inundations of the storm surge, which are similar data collected
during tsunami reconnaissance field surveys. This is important in designing
protective infrastructure for either or both and for deciphering in the
stratigraphic record whether there is a key signature for distinguishing tsunami
from storm deposits. This interdisciplinary RAPID proposal will also integrate
quantitative descriptions of the flooding zone from an engineering and
geoscientific perspective with qualitative information from governmental
entities.
