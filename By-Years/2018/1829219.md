This NSF I-Corps Site at the University of Massachusetts Amherst engages STEM
faculty and students in a robust training program in early-stage technology
commercialization and entrepreneurship. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are
NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and
support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the
marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking
opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their
work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps
Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the
National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and
investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF I-Corps Site at the University of
Massachusetts Amherst introduces the Lean Launchpad methodology and facilitates
customer discovery experiences in accord with the NSF's Innovation Corps program
while connecting participants to industry and venture development resources.
Diversity and inclusion considerations are integrated into both recruitment and
curriculum, with the goal of broadening and nurturing the participation of
females and underrepresented minorities in STEM entrepreneurship. The Site's
goals are to increase campus startups and other innovation outcomes, improve and
enrich the existing campus innovation infrastructure, and provide economic
development and jobs to the cities and rural areas of Western
Massachusetts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
