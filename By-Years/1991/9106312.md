Since about 1985, extremely efficient and nonconservative methods have been
developed for the analysis of robust stability of control systems subject to
parameter variations. However, there are no synthesis procedures available at
all. On the other hand, H-infinity control theory has a well-developed synthesis
procedure. This theory, however, is highly conservative when applied to the
parametric stability problem. In this proposal we intend to develop synthesis
procedures for control problems containing parameter uncertainty. A promising
opening is given by recent results (obtained by the PI's) proving that the
extremal stability margins (including H-infinity margins) occur on certain
manifolds derived from Kharitonov's theorem. This link suggests that H-infinity
(and other classical synthesis methods) might be intelligently tailored to give
nonconservative synthesis procedures for parameter variation problems. This will
form the main area of our research. We expect the results of this research
project to have an impact on the analysis and design of control systems arising
in many applications.
