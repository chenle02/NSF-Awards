This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The use of the basic principle of conservation has led to
accurate and reliable mathematical models of the physical world. Such models,
known as conservation laws, together with the related models such as Hamilton-
Jacobi equations, display rich features in solutions and therefore continue to
challenge the computational scientists. The primary objective of this CAREER
proposal is to make several important steps towards the development and
applications of high order accurate methods for solving these nonlinear
equations. Discontinuous Galerkin methods will constitute the core methodology
of this effort, this is due to their great flexibilities and capabilities in
accurately and reliably simulating complicated problems. The project will
comprehensively cover the algorithm design, analysis, implementation and
applications.

The success of the proposed research will have direct impact on the efficient
and robust modeling of problems in areas as diverse as optimal control, image
processing, computer vision, astrophysics, space physics and energy physics. The
resulting ideas and methodologies will bring new components to reliably simulate
nonlinear problems and complex systems arising in science, physics and
engineering. Besides training graduate and undergraduate students in conducting
research in computational science, mentoring women students in mathematics, the
proposed educational and academic activities will also enhance interaction and
collaborations among regional research groups.
