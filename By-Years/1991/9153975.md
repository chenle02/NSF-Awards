COSMIC VOYAGE will be the first film in IMAX to survey the whole universe. Its
main objective is to convey to a broad museum audience the enormous range of
space and time scales spanned by the universe, and to locate our familiar human
place in this context. The film's centerpiece will be a continuous "cosmic zoom"
extending from the largest observable structure of the universe down to the
subnuclear realm, a guided tour across some 42 orders of magnitude. This will be
followed by a similar excursion through the dimension of time, from the first
instant of the Big Bang to the present day some 15 billion years later. The film
will take special care to explain the utility and importance of "orders of
magnitude". It will indicate the observational basis underlying our description
of the physical world. The narrative will emphasize the continuity as well as
the open- ended nature of the scientific enterprise over a wide range of
disciplines (cosmology, high-energy physics, astronomy, geology, chemistry and
biology), and it will integrate the whole into a coherent picture of the
universe. COSMIC VOYAGE will communicate this material in ways that are
scientifically accurate and instructive, as well as visually absorbing and
entertaining. The overall aim is to produce an unparalleled film about the
universe that is both beautiful and powerful.
