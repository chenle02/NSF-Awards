9508044 Wong The PI will perform an experimental program to determine the
evolution of permeability and porosity with brittle failure in rocks under
triaxial pressure conditions. The anisotropy of permeability will be determined
during cataclastic flow in low-porosity crystalline rocks and porous clastic
rocks. Confocal scanning microscopy will be used to image the 3-D complexity of
pore geometry and damage. Percolation and network models will be used to
simulate the hydraulic transport models. All these results plus acoustic
emission data will be used to establish dynamical links between evolution of
permeability and micromechanics of failure in crustal rocks. ****
