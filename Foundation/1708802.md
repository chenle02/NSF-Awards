Model theory is a branch of mathematical logic which studies classes of
structures by understanding what can be expressed about the structures in first-
order logic. Besides being an interesting subject in its own right, model theory
has had major impacts on almost every other branch of mathematics. In this
project, we focus on applications of model theory to operator algebras, that is,
various subalgebras of the algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space that
are closed under adjoint and are closed in various topologies. The union of
model theory and operator algebras has already proven to be fruitful and we plan
on continuing the emerging evolution of model-theoretic methods in operator
algebras. We also plan to continue our work in using nonstandard analysis to
solve questions in diverse areas of mathematics, including infinite-dimensional
Lie theory, topological graph theory, and combinatorial number theory.
Nonstandard analysis takes advantage of idealized elements to replace limiting
processes and offers new insights into difficult problems.

The study of operator algebras originally began as a rigorous mathematical
formulation for studying various phenomena in quantum physics. A Hilbert space
is a space consisting of vectors that can be added and multiplied by scalars and
for which a notion of angle makes sense. An operator on a Hilbert space is a
continuous transformation of the Hilbert space that respects the addition and
scalar multiplication; operators can themselves be added and multiplied and
there is also a notion of an adjoint of an operator, which in some sense is akin
to taking a matrix and taking its transpose. An operator algebra is a collection
of operators on a Hilbert space that is closed under addition, scalar
multiplication and adjoint and is closed under taking limits in a suitable
sense. Understanding the properties of various kinds of operator algebras and
attempting to classify them has been an important venture in functional analysis
for over half a century. In this project, we propose to continue the use of
techniques from logic to study operator algebras and their model-theoretic
properties, that is, the properties they possess that can be expressed in
logical terms.
