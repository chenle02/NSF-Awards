The project is establishing a calculus computing laboratory of 30 microcomputers
using the software package Mathematica. This laboratory is being integrated into
the curriculum by replacing portions of traditional calculus courses with
modules written in the form of Mathematica notebooks. Mathematica notebooks are
electronic text in which all calculations and graphics are alive and may be
modified and re-executed. At least one class per week is being held in the
calculus laboratory where students use Mathematica as a central tool in learning
calculus. The curriculum is being modified to reflect the new approaches to
calculus as a result of the graphics, computer algebra, and programming
capabilities of Mathematica. This project creates a new generation of calculus
labs where the emphasis is moved from working traditional homework problems and
small projects to the understanding of calculus itself. The result is classes
that attract and hold students' attention by exciting students and allowing them
to explore Mathematics in ways not previously possible.
