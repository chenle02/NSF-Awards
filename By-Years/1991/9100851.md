Environmental heterogeneity may influence the amount of additive genetic
variance in traits relevant to performance in a novel environment. This can
affect the potential of a population with a given history to track environmental
change and to adapt to a new environment. The proposed experiments will measure
the effect of environmental heterogeneity on traits under selection by the
feature of the environment that is being varied. Liriomyza trifolii, a dipteran
leafminer, will be used as a model system in this three phase program. In phase
1, a genetically variable base population of L. trifolii will be established. In
phase 2, replicate subpopulations of the base population will be subjected to
either uniform or heterogeneous host plant conditions for 20 generations. Then
the genetic variances and covariances in each replicate subpopulation for
characters related to fitness on a novel plant will be measured. In phase 3,
replicate selection lines from each treatment subpopulation will be initiated on
the novel plant. Responses to selection on the novel plant will be measured for
all lines and compared among the environmental heterogeneity treatments in order
to test the effects of population history on evolutionary dynamics. After 10
generations of natural selection on the novel plant, genetic variances and
covariances in fitness components will be re- measured. Net selection imposed by
the novel plant on these populations during the selection period will be
calculated. Qualitative predictions about the evolutionary dynamics of
populations with different histories of environmental heterogeneity when faced
with a new environment will be tested.
