The main focus of this theoretical work is on pion- nucleus scattering
(elastic, inelastic, charge exchange) at energies near the delta-resonance. It
will explore the possible outcomes of hadronic experiments that may be acheived
with future meson facilities. In addition work will be done on di-lepton
production in heavy ion collisions and the production of high-spin hadrons in
future proposed intermediate energy reactions.
