Proposal: 9357130 PI: Therien Professor Michael Therien of the University of
Pennsylvania is the recipient of this NSF young Investigator Award from the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program. He has launched
his career by developing a new synthetic strategy for preparing substituted
porphyrins, by using the method to obtain a wide variety of donor-acceptor
molecules based on porphyrins, and by using these molecules to explore the
electronic coupling between the two centers. Under the present grant he will
exploit these molecules in order to assess the relative importance of hole
versus electron tunneling, to measure coupling through "weak" links such as
hydrogen bonds, to probe the significance of quantum beats in ultrafast electron
transfer, and to develop catalysts for alkane oxidation. %%% Reactions in which
an electron transfers from one site to another are among the most intriguing,
significant, and at the same time apparently simple that can occur in biological
systems. In such systems electron transfer can take place over long distances,
and then the intervening medium assumes an important role. By designing
molecules in which electron transfer can be forced to flow through specified
linkages, fundamental and general questions can be answered regarding the
control that these linkages exert. Such molecules will be constructed on the
basis of porphyrins, which are molecules that are widely found to participate in
biological electron transfer. The results will illuminate the details of
porphyrin chemistry, develop the theoretical understanding of electron transfer,
and provide synthetic catalysts for industrially significant reactions.
