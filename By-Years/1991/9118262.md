This award provides funding for the acquisition, storage and distribution of
seismogram data at the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia
University. The project will include collection of analog film chips of
seismograms from the international Worldwide Seismographic Station Network and
the development of new software for the distribution and analysis of seismogram
data. The data are an important archival source for much research in earthquakes
and seismic tomography and will be made available rapidly and efficiently to a
broad spectrum of U.S. and international research seismologists.
