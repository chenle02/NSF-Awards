On Learning Technologies: A Center for Collaborative Research in Learning
Technologies - Planning Proposal Texas A&amp;M University has been awarded
$50,000 for a period of 08 months to provide support for planning to develop a
proposal for a Center for Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies (CRLT)
at Texas A&amp;M. The Center would serve as a major focal point for on-going
research projects, and would provide leadership and administrative support for
large scale collaborative projects involving interdisciplinary teams of
researchers and participants from a multiplicity of locations and backgrounds.
The Center would also provide for the dissemination of research and newly
developed technologies, and serve as a link to the telecommunications and other
related hi-tech industries, working actively with private industry to
commercialize successful technologies for their introduction into the classroom
of the 21st century.
