This project concerns characterizations of geometries related to the Lie
incidence geometries in terms of local hypotheses on points and lines. The first
part concerns geometries whose basic planar unit is an affine plane. The second
part concerns extending the point-line characterization theory to affine and
other non-spherical Lie incidence systems. The research in this project involves
the interplay between finite dimensional geometry and the actions of groups of
transformations on these geometries. This work has implications for the
structure theory of finite groups, for algebraic coding theory, and for finite
geometry.
