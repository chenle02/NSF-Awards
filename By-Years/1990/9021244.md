Skilled movements are thought to be produced by adding together in series a
number of simpler movements. In the case of skilled movements of the hands and
fingers, simultaneous movements of both hands are often involved. This project
to be conducted by Dr.John Soechting will use the movements of the hands and
fingers during typing as a model for the way in which complex, bimanual
movements can be derived by putting together a sequence of simpler movements. In
typing, these simpler movements are the individual keystrokes and the movment
sequence is the series of keystrokes that generate a word or a phrase. The
motions of the hands and of the fingers will initially be described for single
letters typed in isolation. Then the process of how such individual movements
are put together in series will be studied by asking subjects to type words in
which only two letters are typed by one hand and all other letters are typed
with the other hand. Finally, by changing the location of the keys on the
keyboard and forcing typists to relearn the keyboard layout, the processes by
which movement sequences are learned will be studied. This research will
contribute to understanding how individual motor acts are integrated to form
coordinated series of movements.
