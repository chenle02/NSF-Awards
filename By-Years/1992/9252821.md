This is a proposal to investigate how female and minority college students have
come to know mathematics. Students will participate in a series of interviews
that will focus on attitudes and beliefs about mathematics, previous
mathematical experiences, how students deal with difficulities and problems in
the learning of mathematics, how students relate mathematics to the real world,
and how students communicate about mathematics. Results of these interviews will
be used to understand patterns of student learning and how these patterns can be
applied to instructional processes.
