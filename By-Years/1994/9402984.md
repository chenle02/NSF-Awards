9402984 Hochstaedter In this project the PIs will investigate the relationship
between rift-related and arc-related volcanism behind the volcanic front of Izu
arc using a combination of field studies and geochemistry. In these arcs rift
and cross- chain arc volcanism occur at similar distances from the slab and
overlap in eruption ages. The PIs will also sample the across arc seamounts in
the Izu region. They wish to analyze the samples for trace elements and
isotopes. They argue that by studying arc magmas further away from the trench
region they can get a much better handle on the nature of the wedge mantle. They
will also be able to determine whether the invasion of an enriched mantle
component is a prerequisite to rifting. ***
