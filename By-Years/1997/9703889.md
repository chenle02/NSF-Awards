The field research outlined in this proposal is designed to assess the potential
of the last unexplored region of Africa's Great Rift Valley for augmenting our
knowledge of human origins. Extensive archeological and fossil evidence for
human evolution has been found in and adjacent to the Great Rift Valley in
Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia. A research team from the University of
Florence has already found a partial fossil human skeleton in the Eritrean Rift,
associated with abundant fossil animal remains. No doubt, further clues,
necessary for a fuller understanding of humankind's past will be located in the
Eritrean Rift Valley. Due to a 30-year-long conflict in the Horn of Africa,
access for field work in Eritrea has been impossible. The research outlined in
this proposal will be conducted in collaboration with the Eritrean Ministry of
Mines, Energy and Water Resources, as well as the National Museum and the
University of Asmara. These organizations are eager to develop manpower and
explore the Eritrean Rift Valley for fossil and archeological information
relevant to human evolution. Information gathered in this initial reconnaissance
will permit us to identify specific sites for in-depth survey, collection and
excavation in subsequent field seasons.
