A representation theorem is a formal device which shows us that, if a set of
consequences of a theory obeys certain formal constraints, then this set of
consequences can be embedded in a broader theory in a way which is unique up to
a specified range of transformations. Representation theorems have played an
important role in theories of measurement, in theories of probability, and in
theories of the structure of spacetime. There have been numerous attempts to
derive important philosophical consequences from the existence (or non-
existence) of representation theorems. Some who advocate the relationist
position in the theory of spacetime believe that relationism stands or falls
with the possibility of proving a representation theorem. Some nominalists
believe that representation theorems are essential to their eliminativist
program. Professor Sklar will examine under this research grant many of the
important philosophical issues which need careful explanation here. How are
representation theorems related to more familiar arguments from simplicity of
science? Are special modal notions necessary in the eliminativist programs which
rely on representation theorems? How is the instability of representation
theorems under change of theory relevant to an evaluation of their philosophical
importance.
