9353950 Hughes A two-week summer workshop focused on undergraduate faculty
enhancement in the area of computer networks. Sixteen computer science and
engineering faculty from small colleges/universities (priorities were given to
minorities) were exposed to state-of-the-art developments in computer networks,
with emphasis on LANs, WANs, and high-speed networks. During a typical day of
the workshop, time was equally divided between discussions on network concepts
and theory, and laboratory assignments involving various implementations of
protocol and network designs. Each participant was required to maintain a
complete notebook consisting of network lessons and laboratory assignments for
possible use in future network courses at his/her home institution. Michigan
State University network facilities, including the Computer Science Department's
High-speed Networking Research Laboratory, were available to participants for
workshop related activities. As a follow-up of the proposed project, a quarterly
newsletter is available to participants via e-mail. Participants attended an
annual professional meeting (e.g., Computer Science Conference) and have the
opportunity to share experiences. Experts on computer networks were available to
participants throughout the workshop. This workshop follows a successful model
of a similar NSF computer network workshop, funded for the 1991 summer and
received extended support for the summer of 1992. ***
