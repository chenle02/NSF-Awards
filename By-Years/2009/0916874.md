Due to the importance of uncertain data for a large number of applications,
there has been significant recent interest in database support for uncertain
data. Existing work in this area includes new models for uncertain data,
prototype implementations, and efficient query processing algorithms for
specific types of queries. Despite the recent efforts, several important aspects
of uncertain data management remain unexplored. This project addresses two of
these areas: Query Optimization and Support for Non-Relational Operators.

The first goal is about efficient execution of uncertain data queries. As with
traditional data, efficient execution is necessary for ensuring the viability of
uncertain data management systems. However, due to the complications of ensuring
correct results, and the need for CPU-intensive operations over probability
distributions, the goal is critical and challenging. In this project, automatic
query optimizations are developed, through query rewriting rules that involve
probability threshold operators, corresponding access methods, and cost
estimation functions.

The difficulty of handling uncertainty when dealing with non-relational
operators has been expressed in many domains. The project aims to advance the
capability of tracking the exact impact of uncertain inputs as data is processed
by arbitrary programs, leveraging advanced techniques from the area of program
analysis. A key problem with traditional Monte Carlo based solutions lies in
correctly identifying independence in the output of Monte Carlo simulations.
Data lineage tracing, which identifies the set of inputs used to compute an
output value, is used to address the challenge. Furthermore, a program
dependence tracing based approach is devised to trace the propagation of
uncertainty during execution of arbitrary binary code. The technique does not
rely on Monte Carlo simulations, and does not require access to source code or
domain knowledge.
