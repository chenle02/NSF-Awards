With this award from the Chemical Catalysis Program, Professor Clark R. Landis
from University of Wisconsin at Madison will advance the state-of-the-art of
catalysis through the design and synthesis of novel organophosphine compounds,
3,4-diazaphospholanes. Efficient, selective, and atom economical transformations
catalyzed by chiral transition metal complexes represent a critical technology
for cost-effective and environmentally-benign synthesis of chiral
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products. This project addresses the
intellectual challenges of (1) creating chiral catalyst environments with
diverse collections of functional groups using modular and bead-based syntheses
(2) understanding how enantioselectivity and activity are controlled in
hydroformylation reactions and (3) implementing enantioselective catalysis by
organic chemists at both the bench and industrial plant scales through extension
of enantioselective hydroformylation to new substrate classes, reaction
conditions, and the incorporation of enantioselective hydroformylation into
multistep syntheses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the scientific impact
this work will support the competitiveness of U. S. chemical and pharmaceutical
industries through the development of efficient, low-waste processes and through
the training of undergraduate and graduate students for careers in science,
technology, and engineering fields.
