This project involves a variety of topics. Those concerning regular finitely
presented graded noncommutative algebras include the investigation of these
topics: (1) the correspondence between algebras of dimension 3 and automorphisms
of elliptic curves, (2) the dualizing module, (3) the discovery, with the aid of
a computer, of some new algebras of dimension 4 having two generators, (4) the
constructability of the condition that an algebra be finite and of rank n over
its center, and (5) the classification of those algebras via almost split
sequences and via tilting equivalences. In geometry, the projects include the
investigation of these topics: (1) the multiple-point theory of maps via the
Hilbert scheme, (2) the structure and autoduality of the relative compactified
jacobian, (3) the classical enumerative geometry of smooth plane cubics, (4) the
Halphen intersection ring of a symmetric variety, (5) the degeneration of the
tangent space and Whitney stratification, (6) the positivity of the coefficients
of Kazdan-Lusztig polynomials via intersection homology and the geometry of
Schubert varieties (7) the stratum of the miniversal deformation space of a
2-dimensional hypersurface singularity as the hull of Wall's EF-functor, (8) the
study of surfaces as projections, as subvarieties of 3-folds of small degree,
and as the carriers of important double structures, and (9) the study of
L-functions of certain elliptic curves over function fields via crytalline
cohomology. This project concerns research on a variety of topics in algebraic
geometry. After a long period of dormancy, this area of mathematics has
flourished with problems that are centuries old being resolved. The results of
this research will be of interest to many different areas of mathematics.
