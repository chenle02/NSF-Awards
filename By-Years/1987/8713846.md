Insightful characterizations of the power of various machine self- reference
principles, both in the context of universal programming systems and clocked
systems, are sought with an eye to determining what use is self-knowledge (for
programs). It is expected that machine self-knowledge is useful for machine
self-modification (learning). Characterizations or strong sufficient conditions
are sought especially for those self-reference principles which are
algebraically well- behaved. Conditions are sought for validity of the principle
that, if there is no self-referential counterexample to a proposition, the
proposition is true. A rigorous mathematical solution is sought to the problem
of why machine self-reference proofs lay bare an underlying, simplest reason for
the theorems they prove. In the context of machine learning theory the P.I. is
studying the effects of imposing complexity and succinctness constraints on
final programs and grammars learned, the power of (formal) language learning
machines if they converge on a small, uniformly, bounded, finite number of
grammars, and the relationship of these and other matters to separability by
sets enumerable by effective procedures which, in effect, change their "minds"
finitely often. The tradeoffs between complexity of subrecursive text and speed
of the inference progress are being investigated. In relatively small community
applying recursion theory in computer science the P.I. is regarded as a leading
figure.
