Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) communications systems are limited by
multiple access interference (MAI). Multiuser detection accomplishes MAI
cancellation by exploiting the knowledge of all users' signatures. Due to the
complexity of the optimum multiuser detector, various sub-optimum detector
structures have been considered. In this study a novel structure termed DC^3 for
adaptive multiuser detection of asynchronous users, which is simple in that it
does not require duplication of the hardware, as optimum detectors require. To
handle errors in relative delay estimation, a special adaptive decorrelator
called the 'bootstrap decorrelator' is utilized. Performance of the bootstrap
decorrelator under different fading environments with different unknown delays
is analyzed and convergence and stability questions are treated. Performance of
the DC^3 receiver as a whole is also studied, in a realistic communications
environment.
