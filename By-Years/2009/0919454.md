Scripps Institution of Oceanography proposes to support technical services on
four research vessels, all operated as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. Ships to be supported
include R/V Revelle, R/V Melville, R/V New Horizon and R/V Sproul. As part of
their basic operations they will provide one (Sproul, New Horizon) or two
(Revelle, Melville) technicians on each seagoing research project to support
basic services, including multibeam sonar operations, and they will maintain,
calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use
research instrumentation. They also propose to provide several elements of
specialized support for investigators, with separate charges. Specialized
support requested for 2009 includes 1) reference quality hydrographic support,
2) seismic reflection profiling and related mitigation of impacts on marine
mammals, 3) management of the service contract and maintenance for HiSeasNet
(Internet connectivity at sea from research vessels) for UNOLS vessels using
C-band or Ku-band service for 7x24 access to satellite-based ship-shore, and 4)
support of CTD operations on USCG Healy. The budget in this proposal is for the
first year of a 3-year continuing grant.
