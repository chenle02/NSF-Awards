East African pastoralists exploit livestock in a variety of different
environments, all characterized by drastic seasonality. Pastoralists adjust to
seasonality in food supply by temporally exploiting different species of
livestock, by moving livestock and people, and by adjusting human population to
available resources. This study is predicted on the hypotheses that (1) patterns
of pastoral food procurement are aimed at achieving energy homeostasis under
pressure of environmental variability and that (2) this goal of energy
homeostasis requires different strategies in different ecosystems. These
propositions will be tested by comparing food procurement patterns among three
groups, the Rendille and Turkana of northern Kenya and the Borana of southern
Ethiopia. The Rendille herd camels in a dry area, the Borana exploit cattle in
mesic mountains, while the Turkana (in an intermediate environment) exploit five
species of livestock. Dr. Kathleen A. Galvin will use field data and literature
sources to assess the success of these human groups in maintaining energy
balances on a seasonal basis despite fluctuations in food supply. A simulation
model will be used to compare and integrate energetics data from these pastoral
populations. The project will elucidate interactions between environment, human
strategies and ecosystem energetics within the framework of systems ecology and
ecological anthropology. The host institution for the one-year postdoctoral
fellowship activity is Colorado State University.
