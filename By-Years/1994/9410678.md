ABSTRACT CTS-9410678 California Institute of Technology P.I.: Anthony Leonard
This equipment will permit the establishment of a state-of-the-art scientific
visualization laboratory. The principal goal is to provide a high speed link
between a Paragon parallel computer and SGI workstations. This will allow
visualization and postprocessing of the large data sets produced by the parallel
computer. This facility will support several on-going research projects
including: studies in vortex dynamics of turbulence, analysis of dynamical
systems with several degrees of freedom, studies of vortex-based model of
turbulence fine scales and calculations of hypersonic flow of chemically
reactive gases.
