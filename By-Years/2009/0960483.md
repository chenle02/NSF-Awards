Digital Natives is a term used to describe individuals who were born after 1980
and who have lived their entire life in the presence of easy access to large
scale data networks via the Internet, easy access to computing through personal
computers, and wide spread communications via cellular phones. These Digital
Natives are entering college and rapidly joining the US workforce. Understanding
how they view their life goals and objectives will have a profound impact on the
way we educate them and how they can be integrated effectively into society.
This award provides travel support travel for US participants to a research
workshop on Digital Natives. The workshop will take place at KAIST (Korean
Advanced Institute for Science and Technology) in Daejeon, South Korea, 4-6
November 2009.

The workshop will characterize our current understanding of Digital Natives and
their potential impacts on culture, commerce and society at local and global
levels. Interactions in the workshop will serve to frame a research agenda that
could serve as a basis for future proposals that study the phenomena around
Digital Natives in depth. The workshop will foster opportunities to exchange and
share knowledge among invited thought leaders and facilitate identification of
leading researchable questions to help satisfy knowledge gaps that will be
identified through the workshop. The workshop will expose participants to an
internationally diverse set of perspectives on intellectual topics around
Digital Natives. This diversity will broaden and strengthen the intellectual
capabilities of US researchers who attend the workshop.
