Recent progress in the use of artificial neural networks (ANN's) as subsystems
in control systems, in Japanese laboratories as well as by American researchers,
has been based on the enhancement of these systems with system concepts from the
brain, notably the cerebellum. This research project will assess the progress of
Ann-based control system design, especially for robotic systems, which
incorporates neurophysiological concepts and suggest new directions for future
development. Improved applied control systems should have adaptive components to
achieve high levels of sophistication and performance. Algorithms with
neurological plausibility will be considered for implementation as ANN's. These
will relate to intelligent neural network technology as it exists in the United
States, Japan and elsewhere. It is expected that this assessment will identify
the current directions of research as indicated in the literature. It is
important to suggest new directions which are relatively undeveloped but offer
considerable promise. Clearly, additional neuroscientific based subsystems can
be identified from the literature. These subsystems and learning techniques can
be developed and mathematically modeled for computer simulation to be studied
for use in ANN control systems. These enhanced ANN designs will be applied to
robotic control, in future work, in an effort to substantiate, and enhance the
progress made to date (Miyamoto, Kawato, Setoyama & Suzuke, 1988).
