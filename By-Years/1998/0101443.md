This project combines the benefits of two national initiatives in the sixteen
Wisconsin Technical College System districts to advance the teaching and
learning of common manufacturing concepts in technician education using the
power of online multimedia resources. The NSF-ATE TECH SPAN project has
developed a common manufacturing curriculum isolating twelve core competency
clusters that cut across over forty manufacturing/engineering related technical
degree programs. The Wisconsin Online Resource Center, a FIPSE-LAAP project
focused on a general education digital learning library, builds web-based
learning objects that are designed and linked to a competency driven curriculum.
This NSF-ATE project is adapting this Center framework to create a manufacturing
digital library, and multimedia-based chunks of learning are being designed that
stimulate and accelerate student understanding of core concepts. In addition, a
post-associate degree advanced technological certificate in emerging industrial
practices of integrated cellular manufacturing is under development using an
associated learning object collection in the digital library. Secondary
teachers, prospective teachers in industrial technology, and community-based
trainers of disadvantaged women and minorities are being trained in Center
resources to inspire the next generation of manufacturing technicians.
