Ecologically healthy urban landscapes, including wetlands and natural areas, can
help maintain water quality, water quantity, and biodiversity and fulfill human
social and aesthetic needs. However, some of the functions we desire urban
wetlands to perform can impair the ability of these urban wetlands to perform
other desired functions well. This project will establish partnerships among
public agencies, educators, and interdisciplinary teams of scientists from three
regions of the US to summarize the state of our knowledge of wetlands in the
urban landscape, and propose directions for future research. A product of this
research will be improved understanding of complex relationships among wetland
functions, as well as an understanding of social systems and community
characteristics of urban areas in which wetlands are included and valued in the
urban landscape. This knowledge may assist planners in efforts to achieve
optimal functioning of urban wetlands and natural areas at a landscape scale.
