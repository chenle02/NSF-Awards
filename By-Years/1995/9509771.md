$5,000-12 mos. Workshop: Smart Machines and Education: Perils and Promise This
is partial funding for a workshop that is bringing together participants from a
variety of disciplines that share an interest in how artificial intelligence
(AI) and cognitive science might serve as an enabling technology for learning.
Additionally, some of the participants are interested in using what we have
learned about intelligence itself (some of this from AI and cognitive models on
computers) to build machines that support the learning process. Education is
fast ceasing to be a child's preparation for adulthood and is becoming a
lifelong process. Certainly, computers and communication will be at the center
of this evolution. But beyond merely providing the interface, testing, and
delivery component, what role can the specific `intelligent` capacities built
into a machine play? This will be the central question that underlies the
meeting's sessions on intelligent machine interaction, adaptivity, individual
and group process es, and embedding of smart machines in the social milieu. The
workshop is intended to help build disciplinary bridges and establish research
and development agendas.
