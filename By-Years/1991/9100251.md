In this project the principal investigator will work on establishing the
multisummability of formal power series that are the solutions of algebraic
differential equations. The notion of multisummability is a generalization of
the concept of Borel summability. Recently W. Balser gave a simple
characterization of multisummability of formal power series. The principal
investigator will employ these ideas of Balser along with the asymptotic
calculus of Gevrey to study the structure of solutions of nonlinear algebraic
differential equations. The study of the properties of solutions of systems of
algebraic differential equations is of interest for its own sake and for the
light it sheds on a number of problems in algebra and analysis. Around the turn
of the century mathematicians like Poincare and Painleve were able to provide
formal series solutions to several broad classes of differential equations. This
work led in turn to advances in asymptotic calculus, since it showed that very
often divergent series solutions are as good as or better than convergent series
solutions. In this project the principal investigator will apply some of the
latest results on divergent series to study the solutions of nonlinear algebraic
differential equations.
