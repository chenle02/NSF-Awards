The combustion of two fuel droplets travelling along parallel trajectories is
analyzed by a combined analytical-numerical method. The conjunction of heat and
mass transfer equations will yield flame fronts in this complex fluid dynamic
interaction. Convection and radial flow fields will be included. The knowledge
of droplet group behavior is important for nearly all practical applications, in
particular near their injector or free surface origin. A better understanding
would make fuel/air mixing patterns much more amenable to predictive methods.
