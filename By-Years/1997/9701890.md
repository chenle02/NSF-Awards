9701890 Arulanandan This action is to support an international
workshop/conference to discuss progress toward, and research needs for,
mitigating the deterioration of the Nation's infrastructure resulting from
exposure to earthquake hazards, from the viewpoint of ground motion and ground
failure. The focus is on the contributions of the NSF- funded VELACS project
(Verification of Liquefaction Analysis by Centrifuge Studies), the applications
of the VELACS concepts to practice, determining additional research needs, and
disseminating this information. A previous international workshop held at the
University of California, Davis, in February 1992, also addressed this topic.
Since then, numerous contributions have been made to the field of geotechnical
earthquake engineering, and some limited applications to engineering practice
have been achieved. The objectives of this workshop/conference are: 1) to
evaluate the progress that has been made in the past four years in the areas of
verified numerical procedures, site characterization to obtain insitu properties
for use in numerical procedures, and application of verified numerical
procedures in engineering practice; and 2) to determine the research needed to
make further progress. This workshop/conference is expected to lead to further
advancements in the field of geotechnical earthquake engineering.
