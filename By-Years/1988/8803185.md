Professor Schuller will study the properties of thin superconducting films to
better understand the superconducting mechanisms and to provide for improvement
of these properties. The experiments will use the sputtering and molecular beam
epitaxy (MBE) techniques to grow polycrystalline, textured, and epitaxial films
of high temperature oxide superconductors. The composition, compositional
uniformity, and structure will be determined using a number of surface
techniques including ion milling, Auger, x-ray photoelectron, and ion scattering
spectroscopies. Physical properties such as magnetotransport, superconducting
temperature, critical currents, and magnetic field response on isolated high
temperature superconducting films and films in proximity with other materials
will be examined. Special care will be taken in the preparation of the materials
with regard to choice of substrate, post-preparation heat and oxygen treatment.
