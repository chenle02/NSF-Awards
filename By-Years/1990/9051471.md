Data measuring and collection techniques presently used in the Materials Science
Teaching Laboratory are replaced by a modern microcomputer driven system. The
nucleus of the system consists of three microcomputers which will collect,
handle and display experimental date on-line. Labview software will be
purchased. This software permits the configuration of an unlimited variety of
"virtual instruments" which can be configured to measure, record, indicate,
graph or control any desired experimental parameters. Many of the current
experiments will require modest equipment modifications in order to generate
digital rather than analog output. The computers will allow many groups to work
simultaneously. In addition to computerizing the collection of traditional
mechanical property data it is proposed to do the same for much of the
microstructural data which is also a vital part of materials science. This
modernization will more accurately reflect the challenging and dynamic nature of
materials science today.
