This award partially supports the PI, the two Co-PIs, 12 invited speakers, and
14 postdocs, graduate students, or younger faculty in attending a workshop on
macromolecular modeling at the Konrad Zuse Center on the Free University campus
in Berlin. The conference will run from May 6-9, 1997.The workshop will bring
together researchers from Europe, Israel, and the United States, and from the
fields of chemistry, biology, biophysics, mathematics, and computer science. The
themes of the workshop include advanced time stepping, quantum-classical
molecular simulations, free-energy and ensemble calculations, structure
determination, protein folding, and electrostatics. By emphasizing the
participation of young scientists along with a select group of invited speakers,
the workshop will provide a forum for presentation of the most recent
discoveries, and lay the groundwork for future United States-Europe
collaborative projects.
