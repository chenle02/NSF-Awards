The PI proposes to investigate oxygen atom reactions on dust and ice surfaces
characteristic of particles in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT).
Atomic oxygen is the most abundant reactive species in this altitude range, and
its reactions on and with surfaces may contribute significantly to the chemistry
in the MLT. Ice particles present in the mesosphere are observed as noctilucent
clouds (NLCs), polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs), and polar mesospheric summer
echoes (PMSEs). The initial reaction to be studied is the heterogeneous
recombination of atomic oxygen on ice under conditions representative of the
mesosphere (80-90 km) -a phenomenon suggested by recent rocket measurement of
atomic oxygen profiles during NLC events. Other heterogeneous reaction schemes
suggested in the literature that involve oxygen atom reactions with hydrogen
molecules, oxygen molecules, and ice surfaces will then be explored.

This proposal was submitted by the PI, Dr. Jochen Marschall, for James E.
Boulter, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Colorado, Boulder.
