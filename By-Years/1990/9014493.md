Sensory capabilities can be measured quite precisely by an experimental
approach called psychophysics, in which the subject reports whether or not a
particular stimulus signal is detectable. Most psychophysical work on human
subjects involves visual or auditory stimuli. A variety of precisely quantified
stimulus parameters can be varied, and the subject's threshold for detection
measured or computed as a probability of correct response. This Accomplishment
Based Renewal will investigate a class of psychophysical tests called adaptive
procedures, with the goal of improving the efficiency of such tests, which
otherwise can require very large numbers of stimulus presentations to obtain
reliable results. Many of the new techniques make specific assumptions about the
nature of the sensory processes. This work will test these assumptions to see if
they are valid, and to see if the new methods may substantially improve the
measurement efficiency. Results will have impact on visual and auditory science,
and on related areas of work on signal detection processing, and sensory
psychology.
