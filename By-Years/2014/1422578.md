The objective of this proposal is to provide users of multiple, possibly mobile,
devices with storage systems that provide strong consistency guarantees for
replicated data. When users access their data through multiple devices it is
important that data updates made through one device are reflected in the data
viewed through others. The project will study and implement consistency and
consensus protocols to enable these guarantees for individuals and collaborative
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work includes several major components
including the definition, validation, and parameterization of a user model; the
definition of a system structure allowing strong separation of layers while
ensuring key system properties; and the design and optimization of new
protocols. The potential audience for this work includes users of online storage
systems and related stand-alone tools for replicating work across multiple
devices.
