Improved graphic visualization techniques are needed to enhance the performance
and productivity of power system operations dispatchers. Critical information
must be presented to the dispatcher in sufficient detail and clarity to enable
fast assessment of, and proper response to a developing situation on the utility
system. A future energy management system has been proposed. The organization of
this system will be developed using expert-systems techniques and a high-order
knowledge base to prefilter and declutter sensory data for presentation to an
operator. This approach will include incorporating visualization of simulation
data techniques to available, real-time data. The required software and graphics
hardware required for this interactive display system will be proposed; a trial
system will be evaluated. Results of this study will be demonstrated at a future
workshop.
