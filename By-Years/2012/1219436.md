A request is made by the University of Washington to fund additional and
replacement instrumentation for the R/V Thompson, a 274? general purpose, global
class research vessel, and R/V Barnes, a 66-foot coastal research vessel, both
operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
research fleet. These platforms provide facilities for conducting oceanographic
research funded by the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies.
The instrumentation they propose to acquire will provide operational flexibility
to projects that are embarked upon both vessels, will address some deficiencies
noted during the fall 2011 NSF vessel inspections, and will increase their
capacity to do useful science and data collection during transits between funded
cruises.. In order of priority, they propose to purchase the following:

1. Anritsu MS2821B spectrum analyzer $13,487 2. Mystaire FE-2620 ductless fume
hoods (2 each) $8,951 3. McLane large volume in situ samplers WTS-LV04 (4 each)
$129,558 4. Oceansciences Group underway CTD $79,258 5. SBE911plus serial uplink
modifications and upgrade (3 each) $15,319 Total $246,573

Broader Impacts: The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion
two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its
shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research
projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research
program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use
instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
