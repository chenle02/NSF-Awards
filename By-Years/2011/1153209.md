This is workshop travel award to facilitate the PI's and CoPI's participation in
an international series of workshops and meetings to be held in Ryazan and
Vologda, Russia in August 2011. Participation is by the invitation of Russian
academicians who are interested in establishing an agenda for future
collaborative research projects that focus on the scholarship of "Russian
America." The applicant accurately states, "Despite the close historical ties
between Siberia and Alaska, there has been little collaborative archaeological
and [social] historical work to explore Russian heritage in these arctic/sub-
arctic regions." Participation in this workshop is critical to strengthening the
US and Russian academic ties necessary to succeed in establishing an
international research agenda for deeper scientific research on the Russian
American period, which is a formative period in the social and political
development of Alaska.
