The Whitney Laboratory, a research institute of the University of Florida
located on the Atlantic coast, will provide research training for undergraduate
juniors and seniors in cell and neurobiology using marine animals as models.
Eight faculty members will train twelve students throughout the year in modern,
experimental techniques of anatomy, biochemistry, pharmacology and
electrophysiology for which the facility is exceptionally well equipped. The
students will live on the campus of the Laboratory, have access to all
facilities, and will become full partners in the ongoing research efforts of
their faculty advisors. Their independence will be encouraged, and they will
receive full credit for their work in publications. In addition to their
practical research training, the students' intellectual growth will be
stimulated through participation in the Laboratory's regular seminars, and
through a special series of research discussions provided by each member of the
faculty.
