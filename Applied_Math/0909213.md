The principal investigator and her colleagues organize a workshop for
industrial math problems. The format follows one introduced by Oxford University
applied mathematicians in 1968, which has been replicated frequently in the UK,
Canada, Europe, and in various other countries (there are 8-10 such workshops
each year). The format consists of an initial presentation of a number of
problems by industrial scientists/engineers. The audience is then organized into
small groups to work separately on each problem for 3-4 days. An oral reporting
session concludes the week, followed by a written report on each problem some
weeks later. The participants in the workshop consist of from 30-40 graduate
students and about 30 faculty, and with an expectation of at least 6 problems
from industry this means that each problem is worked on by 10 applied
mathematicians. The workshop is preceded by a student modeling camp which
follows a similar format except each problem is presented by a faculty member.
Some of these problems may have been partially addressed by the faculty
presenter, others not, and the aim of the camp is to bring the student
participants into the culture of intensive group work, and to give them
confidence in starting the week when ALL the participants start on NEW,
practically-important problems knowing that their experience and hard work will
prove fruitful.

Apart from a substantial record of success in providing answers to the problems
(this is catalogued at a web-site where e-prints for 250 individual reports from
recent workshops are available in many, quite diverse, application areas), there
are multiple goals for the event: establishment of closer connections between
industrial and academic scientists; education of students and faculty about the
requirements of industry in the use of mathematics; training of students in
group participation projects (the norm in industry), and the experience of
working alongside faculty and joining in the ups and downs of intensive work
where progress is measured by an industrialist in need of a result. Problems
committed to the workshop include one from a semiconductor company for modeling
current flow in a new design nanoscale transistor, and two from bio-tech
companies, one relating to a medical device that has unwanted internal
vibrations and the other needing statistical modeling for micro-array analysis.
