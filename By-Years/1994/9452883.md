The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a 200 MHz FT-NMR to provide
undergraduates across the chemistry curriculum with hands- on experience with an
instrument that plays a pivotal role in modern experimental science. Among the
experiments being undertaken in organic, analytical, physical and biological
chemistry laboratories are T1, T2, T1p, measurements, experiments using INEPT,
DEPT, APT techniques and 2-dimensional NMR. The instrument is also being used in
the active undergraduate research program.
