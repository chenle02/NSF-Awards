Abstract ATM-9423233 Ou, Hsien W. Columbia Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory
Title: The Theory of the General Circulation of the Atmosphere The proposal id
submitted for consideration as Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER)
because it contains noval ideas that need to be tested and which, if proven
true, would significantly enhance our understanding of the climate. The proposed
research continues the development of a climate theory based on an hypothesis of
Lorenz (1960) that the turbulent wind velocity is the maximum allowed in the
earth's atmosphere. As turbulence efficiently mixes properties that are
conserved with fluid motions, it is further hypothesized that the earth's
climate may approach the maximally mixed state characterized by a minimum number
of degrees of freedom. To test this hypothesis, the theory thus seeks to derive
this climatic state that is consistent with balance requirements imposed by
fundamental conservation laws. The proposed research here constitutes the part
of the theory that derives the atmosphere structure. Although this structure may
not be uniquely determined without full closure of the system, it is
nevertheless demonstrated that, even without such considerations, the model
atmosphere is sufficiently constrained that it resembles the observed
atmosphere, including its division into dominant air masses and the distribution
of the zonal mean wind. The theory thus provides a plausible explanation of the
general circulation of the atmosphere that is logically closed, i.e. essentially
free of empirical constraints.
