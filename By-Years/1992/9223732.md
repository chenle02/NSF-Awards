Chien The selection of good routing algorithms in multicomputer networks is
necessary to prevent deadlock, avoid hot spots, and maximize performance. This
project establishes a framework for selecting routing algorithms, which consists
of four parts: 1. selection of deadlock-free algorithms with varying degrees of
adaptiveness; 2. a set of analytic models of router speeds based on switch and
buffer delay measurements; 3. an empirical study of network traffic patterns to
determine the need for adaptiveness in routing; and 4. a set of techniques for
extending routers to meet requirements such as fault tolerance and in-order
message delivery.
