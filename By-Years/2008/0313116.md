The proposed research will attempt to provide the necessary conceptual tools
(languages and architectures) that will allow signal representation to bridge
the gap between bits - the traditional unit of information of signal processing
and compression researchers - and objects - the traditional unit of information
for software developers and programmers; develop the software tools that will
allow integration of media data to modern software applications with minimal or
no additional effort by the part of the programmer and develop undergraduate and
graduate courses that will be offered to both Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science students, providing an integrated approach that will allow
object-oriented and bit-oriented principles of data representation to become
combined. As a result, a fundamental barrier in the educational background of
Electrical Engineers and Computer Scientists will be eliminated, opening up a
wider range of possibilities for the development of media-oriented applications.
