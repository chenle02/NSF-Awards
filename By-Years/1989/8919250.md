This planning grant is to serologically differentiate and/or identify the
factor(s) from already established interleukins, r-interferon and tissue
necrosis factor. The P.I. will try to accomplish this objective through the use
of monoclonal and/or polyclonal antibodies to these established factors in
neutralization assays against the lysophospholipid-induced factor(s). The
specific aims are to: 1) Determine the effects of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)
and /or polyclonal antibody to interleukin-l (IL-l) and IL-4 on the activation
of macrophages by macrophage pro-activating factor (MPAF) derived from lyso-pc-
or DDG-treated B cells. 2) Determine the effects of MAbs and/or polyclonal
antibody to IL-l to IL-7 on the activation of macrophages by macrophage
activating factor (MAF) derived from MPAF-sensitized T cells. 3) Determine the
effect of MAb and/or polyclonal antibody to r-interferon on the activation of
macrophages by MPAF and MAF. 4) Determine the effect of MAb and/or polyclonal
antibody to TNfa on the activation of macrophages by MPAF and MAF.
