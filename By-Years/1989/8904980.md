It is proposed to continue research on three topics: the application of the
Fermion Dynamical Symmetry Model (FDSM) to collective motion in nuclei,
including deformed nuclei: The development of more efficient shell model codes
for nuclei and the non-relativistic quark model: and finally, baryon-baryon
interaction on the quark model.
