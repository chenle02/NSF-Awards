Intellectual Merit. A vast number of microbial secondary metabolites have been
shown to have antimicrobial properties. The biological functions of these
molecules can be complex and reflect the highly complex relationships in which
microbes engage. This project focuses on agrocin 84, a bacteriocin, produced by
the soil bacterium Agrobacterium radiobacter strain K84. Agrocin 84 targets the
plant pathogenic bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which induces tumors in
the plant. Agrocin 84 acts a molecular ?Trojan Horse? by mimicking a plant
tumor-derived substrate, and thus gaining access to the interior of the cell,
where it is processed into a toxin, TM84. TM84 is a potent inhibitor of leucyl-
tRNA synthetase, (LeuRS), an essential enzyme that catalyzes the condensation of
a leucine to its cognate tRNA and is responsible for the correct translation of
the genetic code. Interestingly, the bacterial source of the toxin,
Agrobacterium radiobacter, survives by having an alternative synthetase, AgnB2,
that is resistant to TM84. The aims of this project are: to determine how TM84
inhibits LeuRS and to determine the basis for AgnB2 resistance to TM84. The
research has the to reveal novel insights into the protein translation machinery
and to expand understanding of how microbes
interact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The project has a major
educational goal of increasing underrepresented minority participation in the
field of biochemistry. This will be achieved by early exposure of high school
and undergraduate students to the science of biochemistry, research experience
in the laboratory, and mentorship through programs incorporating lectures,
seminars and hands-on research experience in the field of biochemistry. Graduate
student training and mentoring will be integrated throughout the research and
education plans to enhance professional and scientific development.
