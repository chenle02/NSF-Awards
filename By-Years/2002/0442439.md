&lt;br/&gt;The project's workshops make mathematical literacy a more welcome and
indispensable part of the two-year college curriculum in the United States. A
goal is to create a mathematically literate society ensuring a workforce
equipped to compete in a technologically advanced global economy. In the
workshops, math and non-math faculty across the disciplines create, evaluate and
modify projects that incorporate mathematics across disciplines. As a result,
community college students throughout the nation are offered opportunities to
deepen and reinforce the mathematics they learn in their math classes as well as
understand its greater importance and application in their lives. Half-day
regional workshops, four-day summer or winter institutes and traveling workshops
support faculty, nationwide, in integrating mathematics into their curricula. A
website supports a network of two-year college faculty involved and interested
in the project and publishes classroom tested material. The project heightens
awareness among two-year college faculty of the important role two-year colleges
play in creating a numerate society. The project also creates and disseminates
exemplary projects and courses that integrate mathematics into all disciplines
and offers a support system for community colleges integrating math across the
disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
