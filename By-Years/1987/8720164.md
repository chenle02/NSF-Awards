The Division of Emerging Engineering Technologies (EET) and other Divisions in
the Engineering Directorate of the National Science Foundation (NSF) will
sponsor a series of expert workshops. NSF has historically held such workshops
to identify emerging engineering technology areas, discuss progress in currently
funded technology areas, and for other similar purposes. A number of these
workshops will be specifically designed to elicit the views of the scientific,
engineering, and business communities to assist in the task of identifying
emerging engineering technologies that may be candidates for new funding
initiatives within the Engineering Directorate. This award is to provide
administrative and logistic support for the tasks associated with the timely
conduct of these workshops and related activities. Work to be performed under
this award includes: (1) arrangements for and conduct of meetings and symposia,
(2) preparation and editing of papers and reports, and (3) the creation and
maintenance of mailing lists and other related data.
