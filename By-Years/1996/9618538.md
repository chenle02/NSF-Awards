Gary, Dale AST 9618538 The Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) Solar Array
provides a unique capability for imaging and spectroscopy in a broad range of
microwave frequencies. The array will be used by investigators at a number of
institutions to study the physical parameters of the solar atmosphere, with
particular attention to conditions in active regions and the temporal and
spatial development of solar flares. During the grant period, the facility will
be upgraded to include two new antennas which will effectively double the
baseline for imaging and double the spatial resolution in the east-west
direction. Upgrades to the data acquisition system will increase observing time
by 40% and provide a more responsive analysis system for users, including those
accessing data remotely. ***
