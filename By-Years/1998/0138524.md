Abstract

Wai Kiu Chan

This grant supports the research of the principal investigator and his
colleagues on the arithmetic theory of integral quadratic forms and related
topics. They will work on the representation theory of positive definite
quadratic forms, the almost strong approximation properties of simply connected
algebraic groups of compact types, and the classification of quaternary
quadratic forms with improper automorphism groups by their degree two theta
series.

Quadratic forms are homogenous polynomials of degree two in many variables. This
research concerns the number theoretic problems which arises from deciding which
integers can be values of the quadratic forms when the variables are replaced by
integers. It falls into the area of number theory which is among the oldest
branches of mathematics. Nowadays, quadratic forms and other kinds of number
theory become indispensable tools in communication sciences, data transmission
and processing, construction of error correcting codes, and cryptography in
information technology.
