ACM MobiCom conference is the leading international conference on mobile
computing and wireless networking. It invites research contributions addressing
the challenges in the area of mobile computing, from the perspective of
networks, wireless and mobile systems, algorithms, and applications. The
conference features a high-quality technical program, with an acceptance rate of
around 10% out of around 250 submissions. It has a single-track session, which
offers significant opportunities for individual and small groups that foster
technical and social interactions among a diverse set of participants. MobiCom
is also an international conference that stimulates exchanges between various
international research communities.

This award will help increase the representation and participation of United
States-based students at the conference by providing 20 travel grants. By
creating new opportunities for graduate students, especially those from under-
represented groups, to attend a high-quality conference, this award will benefit
the students by giving them an opportunity to interact with world-class
researchers, inspire them to try new research directions, providing mentoring
opportunities, as well as the chance to seek out internships and post-doctoral
positions which will help the students advance in their research career.
