This grant provides three years of continued partial support for the operation
and maintenance of the Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement Laboratory (PRIME Lab)at
Purdue University as a multi-user national facility for the geosciences and
ancillary fields. Support for this Facility allows geoscientists access to
specialized capabilities of the accelerator mass spectrometer and chemical
preparation facilities at PRIME for the measurement of the very low-level
cosmogenic nuclides 10Be, 14C, 26Al, 36Cl, 41Ca, and 129I for chronological
and/or tracer studies. The Facility is currently developing techniques for other
analysis of other rare isotopes with application to meteoritics and other
fields. Funding provides minor salary support for PI faculty members,
professional and technical staff members; maintenance support for the AMS
system, including replacement parts; and expendable supplies for the chemistry
laboratory. Additional operating expenses (about 50%) are derived from Purdue
University, charges for sample measurement services, and research grants to the
PI?s. The measurement of cosmogenic radionuclides by accelerator mass
spectrometry (AMS) continues to support novel research in Earth surface
processes and Quaternary geology, hydrology and glaciology which rely on surface
exposure age dating, erosion rate estimates and isotopic tracer techniques for
quantification of process rates. PRIME lab continues to be one of the only AMS
labs worldwide that offers measurement and application services for AMS
radionuclide systems other than radiocarbon and is currently the only laboratory
that offers full service, chemical preparation through AMS measurement. PRIME
Lab PIs continue to develop new AMS chemical separation and dating techniques
and maintain actively funded research and research training programs that
involve application of these radionuclides to a variety of geoscience problems.
