9500331 Buium Professor Buium will work in arithmetic geometry specifically
problems in Diophantine geometry. He will use techniques from differential
algebraic geometry to study Lang's conjecture, the semi-abelian case of Mazur's
conjecture as well as relationships between the abc conjecture and logarithmic
Kodaira dimension. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic
geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number
theory and geometry. Professor Buium's research even includes a component coming
from classical analysis. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful -
having recently solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many
consequences are new error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both
modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
