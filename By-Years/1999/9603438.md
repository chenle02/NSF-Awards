This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in plant
molecular biology between Julian T. Schroeder of the University of California at
San Diego and Raoul Ranjeva of the University Paul Sabatier in Toulouse, France.
The award provides travel support to Dr. Schroeder and a graduate student. The
objective of the research is to improve knowledge of the mechanism by which
calcium influx is triggered in plant cell signaling. It adds an international
dimension to an existing NSF grant and takes advantage of the U.S. and French
investigators' complementary expertise.
