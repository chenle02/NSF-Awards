Examination of the recordings of strong-ground motions induced by the October
17, 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake suggests that non- linear amplification effects
occurred at sediment sites above the acceleration level of 0.3G - a phenomenon
with very important implications in earthquake engineering. The objective of
this research program is to examine the possibility that non-linear site effects
occurred, and the associated mechanism underlying the phenomenon.
