This project provides two image analysis stations in order to enhance all
engineering laboratory classes. Each station will be equipped with a CCD video
camera, a 13-inch video monitor and an 80386 processor-based microcomputer with
a frame grabber card and a super VGA monitor. The stations add additional
dimensions to laboratory experiments in civil, mechanical, chemical and
electrical engineering classes through the instant analysis of images. Image
analysis is used with experiments to determine such things as sieve analysis of
fine and coarse aggregates, percent of solids in activated sludge, and true
stress curves in tensile tests. Image analysis is further used in studies
utilizing the metallurgical microscope, in counting the droplets in air, and in
determining Poisson's Ratio during tensile testing.
