The proposal will allow for the purchase of eight physiology laboratory
stations. Each station will consist of an IBM PC, dot matrix printer, hardware
(stimulator, cables, electrodes, etc.) and software to demonstrate muscle
physiology (physiogrip), reflex arc physiology (flexicomp), electrocardiography
(spirocomp) which will use the students as laboratory subjects.The project will
allow us to expand and improve our coverage of physiology in the laboratory. It
will also allow us to reinforce the physiological principles taught in lectures.
Perhaps most importantly we will achieve these goals without the expense, animal
housing, and ethical problems inherent in traditional animal (frog and turtle)
based laboratory procedures.
