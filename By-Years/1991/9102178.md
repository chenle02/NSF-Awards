A summer school on equatorial physics emphasizing the role of tracers will be
held during June, 1991 at URI. This will be focused on, but not limited to,
participants in the JGOFS and TOGA programs. A major goal is to familiarize
investigators who do not appreciate the unique dynamics near the equator.
