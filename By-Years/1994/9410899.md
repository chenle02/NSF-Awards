This research is on exploring algorithms for 3-D mechanical component
arrangement that derive from successful strategies in use for 2-D VLSI problems.
The research approach is to develop the critical connections and extensions
between the core geometric synthesis algorithms in 2-D VLSI layout and 3-D solid
modeling that will yield efficient mechanical shape synthesis tools, which
support productivity and rapid exploration of novel 3-D component arrangements.
Basic stochastic optimization techniques, shape representations, and
optimization-control techniques are being used to: * Arrange 3-D mechanical
components (extending VLSI placement strategies); * Route tubes, cables and
wires in three dimensions (extending VLSI routing strategies); * Algorithms for
designing to meet criteria such as; vibration, thermal, space constraints,
component balance, manufacturing, maintenance, accessibility, and human factors
(extending linear analysis methods from circuit design); * Support rapid
redesign of families of products.
