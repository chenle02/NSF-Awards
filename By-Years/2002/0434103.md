SUNY Buffalo State College, in conjunction with the Buffalo Public and Niagara
Falls School Districts and the Erie1, Erie2, Genesee Valley, and Orleans-Niagara
Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES), has established the NSF-
Noyce New Math and Science Teacher Partnership of Western New York. The project,
which builds on an existing NSF STEM teacher preparation program, is designed to
address the shortage of math and physics teachers in New York's high needs
schools by increasing the number of preK-12 teachers who are both certified and
well-qualified to teach in these fields. Noyce scholarships are being used to
recruit and foster the development of new STEM teacher candidates through a
variety of paths of entry into teaching. These include traditional baccalaureate
degree options and graduate degree programs that facilitate alternative
certification for students with STEM degrees as well as cross-certification in
physics for current STEM teachers. A specific objective of the project is to
recruit and support underrepresented and minority populations into the teaching
professions. In return for receiving financial support, participants commit
themselves to teach for two years in high needs districts for each year of
scholarship support.
