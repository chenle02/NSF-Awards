Objective:

The objective of this program is to co-design circuits and algorithms for
compressive/low rate wideband receivers that are robust to the non-idealities
that arise with the large interferers that will be encountered in sensing and
communication applications. The program thus provides two transformative
perspectives: (1) solving the interference problem in wideband applications
using compressive sensing approaches, and (2) broadening the theoretical basis
for compressive sensing to include systems with weak nonlinearity.

Intellectual merit:

The intellectual merit is centered around two thrusts that combine circuit and
matched compressive sensing approaches: (1) By combining observations on
circuits (devices are linear for small amplitudes) and compressive sensing
(randomized subsampling is an effective acquisition approach for frequency-
sparse signals), the project is designing nonlinearity-aware analog-to-
information converters that select samples that preserve linearity in the
measurement process; (2) By combining prior knowledge on the communication
environment (characterizations of common interferers) with algorithmic tools for
interference cancellation, the project is designing demodulator sequences and
matched recovery algorithms that account for the nonlinearity of the analog-to-
information converter and enable DSP-based interference cancellation.

Broader Impacts:

The broader impacts of this project include innovations that enable much more
efficient use of the very valuable communication spectrum. Specifically, it
affects the critical interference problem for wideband systems and the direction
of the emerging field of compressive sensing. It impacts numerous applications,
ranging from emerging cognitive radios to environmental sensing systems.
Finally, the project includes an integrated program of active educational
engagement at levels ranging from K-12 to graduate school.
