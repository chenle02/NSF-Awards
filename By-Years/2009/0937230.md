NSF and the Andrew Mellon Foundation are teaming to support Richard Van Duyne,
Northwestern University, and Marco Leona, New York Metropolitan Museum of Art,
will co-chair an NSF Workshop on Chemistry and Materials at the Interface of
Science and Art. At NSF the workshop will be sponsored by the Divisions of
Chemistry (CHE) and Material Research (DMR) and by the Office of International
Science and Engineering (OISE). This workshop will engage a diverse group of
established investigators from academia, museums, government laboratories, and
leading international laboratories who work on chemistry and material science
aspects of art conservation science. The objective of the workshop is to discuss
the challenges and opportunities for chemists and material scientists in the
field of art conservation science and propose mechanisms to meet these
challenges. The workshop discussions will be widely disseminated to the
scientific community through reports and symposia.
