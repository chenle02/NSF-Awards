This is an investigation of the trace constituents in arctic aerosols, using the
Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) technique. The technique is
extremely sensitive and powerful, capable of determining the concentration of
about forty elements, including many environmentally crucial ones such as
aluminum, zinc, arsenic and antimony that are present in very low
concentrations. The project will make use of 700 filtered samples obtained on
Ellesmere Island over an eight-year period. The occurence of arctic haze, the
general term for aerosol concentrations in the lower troposphere, reaches a
seasonal maximum in late winter when it becomes widespread through the arctic.
The variation is the result both of seasonal differences in the northward
transport, and in the removal process through wet and dry deposition.
Multivariate factor analysis, cluster analysis, and source contribution
functions, combined with air mass trajectories will provide advective patterns
that will refine our understanding of the transport mechanism and atmospheric
pathways from the source regions to Ellesmere Island, and allow the
investigations of trends in the relative composition of the arctic aerosol trace
constituents.
