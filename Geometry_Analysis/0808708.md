Equations satisfied by theta functions, on commutative and non-commutative tori,
are to be developed, with special attention to their modular properties and to
stratifications of the Jacobian theta divisor. Specifically, the modular aspect
of Kleinian functions is proposed to be connected with the solution of
polynomial equations in one variable (in analogy with the role of hyperelliptic
thetanulls in Hermite's solution of the fifth-degree equation), and with
equations of isomonodromy, with prospective applications to mirror symmetry.
Modular reproducing properties (Hecke-type actions) are to be studied in
connection with dispersionless hierarchies of KP and Toda type, for which the
main open question is the construction of a Frobenius-manifold structure, with
prospective applications to an analytic theory for Hurwitz spaces over curves of
genus greater than one. Related projects of postdoctoral mentoring character
(projective connection over moduli spaces of rank-2 bundles for curves of genus
3 and related dualities) are to be conducted long-distance.



The theory of special functions came to life through the strong symbiosis of
mathematics and physics that pervaded the work of the masters of analysis and
geometry in the nineteenth century. An extraordinary revival of the connection
between mathematics and physics came about in the late 1970s, triggered by the
discovery of integrable hierarchies of partial differential equations. This gave
rise to intense activity on both classical and novel questions of modularity
(the dependence of a function on its governing geometric object, e.g., a curve),
the main focus of this proposal. The analysis of modular functions is to be
applied geometrically to stratifications of commutative and non-commutative
tori, through classical and quantum theta functions. A widespread feature in
this area is that of "strange dualities" between geometries: several modular
interpretations are proposed, with consequent applications to systems of
practical interest. In a nutshell, this proposal is aimed to giving a notion of
quantum integrability of a new kind, starting with a theory of the quantized
functions and ideally progressing toward unification of physical models.
Students and postdoctoral fellows are to be involved in the projects and
participate in workshops and activities of interdisciplinary kind.
