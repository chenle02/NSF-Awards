Thirty sophomore and junior high school students will participate in a two-week
residential program designed to accomplish four objectives: (1) teach
fundamental principles involved in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and
psychology, (2) explore research in one discipline in depth, (3) achieve
understanding of ethical considerations scientists face, and (4) explore career
options in the sciences. Activities will include lectures, laboratory exercises
and involvement in on-going faculty research. Follow-up activities will include
student presentations based on their Young Scholars workshop experience to
students and teachers in their home schools.
