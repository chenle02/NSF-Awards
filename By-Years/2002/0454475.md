0454475&lt;br/&gt;Agnew&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is improving methods
for analyzing Earth deformation recorded by&lt;br/&gt;strainmeters and by
permanent GPS arrays including those of the Plate Boundary&lt;br/&gt;Observatory
component of EarthScope. To improve the calibration of
borehole&lt;br/&gt;strainmeters, existing data is being analysed to provide
different models for&lt;br/&gt;strain coupling, and tools and methods for
general use. New methods are being&lt;br/&gt;developed to estimate strain
changes from displacements measured by GPS, and to&lt;br/&gt;examine sources of
noise, and of possible geophysical signals, in such data.&lt;br/&gt;These
methods will use statistical descriptions that allow for
temporal&lt;br/&gt;correlation and non-Gaussian behavior. The results from
existing GPS networks&lt;br/&gt;are being compared with calibrated strainmeter
measurements around the San&lt;br/&gt;Francisco Bay area, at Parkfield, in Los
Angeles, and at Yucca Mountain. One&lt;br/&gt;result is to help create a
community of strain-data users, in training students&lt;br/&gt;and providing
analysis tools.&lt;br/&gt;
