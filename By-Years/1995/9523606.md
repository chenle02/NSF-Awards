The North Carolina Supercomputing Center (NCSC) will work with the National
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and with the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (LLNL) to prototype the use of parallel-capable, self-describing data
models in coupling the components of a climate model. This work would build on
the disciplinary expertise of NCAR and LLNL in climate modeling and parallel
computing, and on preliminary efforts at LLNL and NCSC using object-oriented
technologies to build interdisciplinary modeling frameworks. Using these
approaches can be a very powerful means of reducing simulation model complexity.
Coupling the atmospheric, ocean, and ice components of a climate models is an
excellent application. Present coupling strategies are fairly complex and
somewhat ad hoc. Using appropriate abstractions, one can separate the science,
the algorithms used for coupling, and the parallel data and task decompositions
more cleanly, resulting in a more portable, maintainable, extensible, and
comprehensible model. It is believed this can be done without unduly sacrificing
efficiency. This award is made under the USGCRP Methods and Models for
Integrated Assessments.
