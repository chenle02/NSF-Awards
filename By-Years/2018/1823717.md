Thermokarst lakes that form when permafrost thaws and subsides are common
features in Arctic regions. Recently, these lakes have been identified as
providing a key pathway for methane release to the atmosphere. However,
quantifying these fluxes has remained elusive. The purpose of this project is to
connect direct observations of lake methane gas emissions, local geophysical
mapping of these emissions, and regional-scale satellite-based observations, to
improve the quantification and scaling of methane gas release from Arctic thaw
lakes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapid and non-invasive ground-based geophysical
measurements will be taken to describe thermokarst lake methane emissions,
develop relationships between lake expansion and methane emissions, and then use
Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery to scale the results to large regions. The
synergy of direct, geophysical, and remote sensing measurements will provide
linked, multi- scale observations not previously available. The outcomes of this
work have implications for understanding global carbon budgets, Arctic
engineering, and the development of environmental monitoring methods.
Furthermore, this research will provide additional validation to the Ground
Penetrating Radar and Synthetic Aperture Radar methods, benefit their respective
development fields, and encourage more widespread application of these methods
across the Arctic. This project includes outreach efforts to local communities
that will result in summaries of the scientific results for general
dissemination. Graduate and undergraduate students will be mentored throughout
the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
