Dr. Campins at the Planetary Science Institute of SAI Corporation will use this
grant to continue a study of the properties of the nuclei of Earth-approaching
comets. This study involves a new observational approach which proved very
successful in recent work on Comets Neujmin 1 and Arend-Rigaux. These
observations will yield size, albedo, color, approximate shape, and rotational
characteristics of the nuclei of seven comets. Knowledge of the physical
properties of comet nuclei for a large sample of comets will allow general
conclusions to be drawn about the processes that create these properties, about
the relationship between comets and other minor bodies in the Solar System, and
about the role that comets play in the cratering processes on planets.
