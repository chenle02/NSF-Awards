This research plan consists of two themes. The first is concerned with
investigations into the structure theory of injective-like objects in the
category of operator spaces, and involves the theory of contractive projections
on real or complex C*-algebras. The second is a study of linear and nonlinear
representations of the Lorentz group with an eye towards finding physically
meaningful models in mathematical physics. The link connecting these two
objectives is described in the following paragraph.

Since the pioneering work of Jordan, von Neumann and Wigner in the 1930s, Segal
in the 1940s and 50s, and Alfsen-Shultz-Stormer in the 1970s, Jordan algebras,
and more recently Jordan triples, have been used as a model for the study of the
state spaces of quantum mechanics. On the other hand, contractive projections
have played a key role in the structure theory of Banach Jordan triple systems,
and those which are completely contractive give rise to injectives in the
category of operator spaces (also known as quantized Banach spaces). The PIs
plan to study the fine structure of contractive projections on operator spaces
in order to gain a better understanding of their role in operator space theory,
as well as their role, together with Jordan structures, in quantum mechanics and
relativity.
