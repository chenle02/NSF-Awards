This project is a feasibility study on applications of some new mathematical
models for laminated plates and shells. The company aims to create software that
implement these models in commercially viable packages. At present the analysis
and design of laminated composites is based on highly simplified and therefore
inaccurate models. The software produced under this project will be of interest
to practicing engineers as well as to materials scientists.
