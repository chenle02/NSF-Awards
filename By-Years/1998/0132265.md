EAR-0132265&lt;br/&gt;Kurz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide partial
support for Dempsey Lott in the Isotope Geochemistry Facility at Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), under the guidelines for Phase II technician
support in the EAR Instrumentation and Facilities Program. Lott will have
responsibility for maintenance, training, and technical support associated with
the WHOI noble gas and thermal ionization mass spectrometers, under the
supervision of Dr. M. D. Kurz. The laboratory has specialized in helium and neon
isotopic measurements in seawater, groundwater, and a variety of rocks and
minerals, for a diverse set of scientific programs. Active projects include
mantle noble gas measurements from the Hawaiian Scientific Drilling Project
(Mauna Kea volcano) and submarine lava flows from various locations (ocean
islands and ocean ridges), helium-3 surface exposure dating from surficial
Galapagos lava flows, and surface exposure dating from various glacial deposits
(Western USA, Patagonia, Antarctica). An important goal of the proposed research
is to expand measurement capabilities to the heavy noble gases, which will
involve some technique developement. Specifically we will utilize a newly
designed stainless steel cryogenic trap that performs significantly better than
conventional (charcoal) traps, and will have applications to many aspects of
noble gas geochemistry. The technical expertise of Lott will help make the noble
gas measurement capability accessible to many researchers at WHOI and also the
broader U.S. earth science community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
