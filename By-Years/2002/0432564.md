0432564&lt;br/&gt;Coles&lt;br/&gt;This award supports planning for a proposed
international course related to the economic and environmental aspects of
sustainable practices in organizations. Students will gain international
experience while studying issues of global responsibility. The course would take
place at Indiana University and at the Berufsakademie in Mannheim Germany. The
PIs will also use the current funding to investigate establishing connections
with other institutions in Europe and in Taiwan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The course
will be motivated by the role that sustainable design and processes have claimed
in engineering, technology, and business. Students will learn about sustainable
design, development, processes, and practices in a global context, with exposure
to international research methods and business
practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current funding will allow the PIs to work
out the details necessary to submit a proposal to NSF's Office of International
Science and Engineering under its Developing Global Scientists and Engineers
solicitation (NSF 04-36).&lt;br/&gt;
