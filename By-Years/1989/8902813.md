This is a group project to investigate interdisciplinary aspects of problems
relating to coordinating the activities of autonomous agents. It researches a
variety of issues arising in computer science, electrical engineering,
economics, and operations research. Some of the problems are purely theoretical
and typically use techniques of discrete and combinatorial mathematics. Some
require computational experimentation. And some of them model the practices and
tasks of real organizations. The problems have a common thread, and this project
will develop a precise common language, so that the work on one problem will
have an impact on the others. In each problem, there is a group of
processors/persons who are to perform a common task. A designer is to chose a
coordination scheme that specifies for each person/processor the computations
and the communicating that must be performed at each of a sequence of points of
time. The designeer wants the scheme to be efficient with respect to several
cost measures. The costs may include communication time, computing capacity,
distance from correct task fulfillment, and the capacity to control actions. To
make this research a group venture, a continuing seminar on coordination
problems is conducted and advanced graduate students are involved. The project
goal is to exploit the different techniques and perspectives of the disciplines
involved to advance knowledge concerning the central problem of how to
efficiently coordinate activities involving inputs, processes and decisions of
several separate agents.
