The principal investigator will analyze interrelated problems concerning
hyperbolic dynamical systems and compact Riemannian manifolds of negative
curvature. Specifically, he will investigate the classification,
differentiability, and regularity of stable and unstable foliations. Other
directions of research include investigations of rigidity and regularity of
global invariants with respect to external parameters. This project involves
three areas of mathematical research. Dynamical systems is study of the path of
points under repeated iterations of a continuous mapping. Ergodic theory studies
the long term behavior of most of the points under many iterations. Riemannian
geometry describes the nature of the space in which the points reside;
quantities such as curvature are used in the description. The principal
investigator will analyze several problems which stem from attempts to apply
theories from all three of these areas.
