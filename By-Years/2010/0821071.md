The Departments of Mathematical Sciences and of Computer Science at Kent State
University will purchase&lt;br/&gt;a high performance parallel cluster computer
to enhance the research and educational activities in&lt;br/&gt;the area of
applied mathematics and scientific computing at both
departments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific computing has become an
important investigation tool in many areas of science and
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;High performance computing on large parallel clusters is
routinely required for many research and&lt;br/&gt;application problems. The
Departments of Mathematical Sciences and of Computer Science at Kent
State&lt;br/&gt;University have research areas which include&lt;br/&gt;parallel
numerical algorithms for solving boundary value problems for partial
differential equations,&lt;br/&gt;iterative solution methods for large linear
systems of equations, iterative methods for the computations of&lt;br/&gt;a few
eigenvalues or singular values of a large matrix, solution of large-scale ill-
posed problems, image&lt;br/&gt;processing, simulation and analysis of liquid
crystals, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cluster computer will contain
one master node and 12 computation/visualization nodes
connected&lt;br/&gt;through a high speed InfiniBand network in a single rack.
Each computation node contains 4 processors&lt;br/&gt;(two 2.8GHz dual-core AMD
CPUs) with dual PCI-E graphics cards and 32GB of RAM. This
high&lt;br/&gt;performance computing environment will provide sufficient
computing support for high-quality research&lt;br/&gt;activities in the area of
applied mathematics and scientific computing at both departments.&lt;br/&gt;
