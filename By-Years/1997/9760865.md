*** 9760865 Jones This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will address contamination in environments surrounding sites of petroleum
exploration, production, refinement, and storage. Bioremediation techniques have
been used to remove hazardous chemicals from the environment; however,
monitoring these sites is hindered by expensive and time consuming techniques
required to obtain necessary sensitivity and specificity. For example, gas
chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GCMS), capillary zone
electrophoresis (CZE), or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) have
been used to monitor environmental exposure, and various methods of microbial
activity and biomass assays have been used to monitor remediation processes.
GCIMS, CZE, and HPLC require expensive instrumentation, extensive operator
expertise, and laboratory analysis removed from the site of contamination.
Microbial activity or biomass assays are time consuming, and specificity for the
microbe of interest is not reliable. Phase I will explore a novel optical fiber
sensor that has the potential for environmental monitoring in areas of petroleum
activity and its in a chemical and biological sensing platform. Biological and
chemical sensors are expected to yield high-resolution, low-cost, multi-target
systems for applications in 1) environmental monitoring, 2) drinking and
wastewater monitoring, 3) large scale, high-speed testing in the medical field,
4) chemical analysis, and 5) intelligent monitoring of advanced materials
processing. ***
