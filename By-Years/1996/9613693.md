This proposal requests support to continue investigations of the interaction of
the solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere. Heikkila challenges the most
widely accepted model of energy and momentum coupling which is the Dungey
reconnection model later updated by Cowley and Lockwood. While Heikkila agrees
that a connection between geomagnetic field lines occurs, he challenges the
physical reasoning behind the present reconnection paradigm. The requested
support would permit Heikkila to continue analysis of data, develop a
collaboration with a computer simulation team to further test his concepts and
attend scientific meetings.
