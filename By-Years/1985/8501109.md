The FCC's fundamental purpose is to provide a common base for technical studies
by those federal agencies that are responsible for the design, construction, and
operation of federal government facilities or for construction-related research.
The FCC will undertake advisory studies dealing with such subjects as
preliminary planning of federal facilities, the development of an integrated
computer system for construction data, the state of the art of "intelligent"
building concepts, and construction change orders. In addition, FCC consulting
committees will assemble information on the experiences, policies, and practices
of federal agencies regarding quality control of federal construction projects,
the use of non-traditional methods of procurement, and new methods of
maintaining facilities.
