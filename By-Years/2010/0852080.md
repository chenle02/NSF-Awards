Funds are provided to support the U.S. contribution to a collaborative program
with Norwegian investigators to sample the extinct Aegir Ridge, followed by
onshore geochemical analyses and geodynamic modeling. Norwegian co-PIs have
extensive experience in geophysical field work and geologic sampling in this
region and will provide ~10 days of ship time as well as the necessary equipment
to dredge the exposed scarps of the Aegir ridge axis. Major- and trace-elements
studies, as well as isotope (Pb, Nd, Hf, Sr) analyses will be performed and 3D
numerical models of continental rift-hotspot interaction will be developed which
will define the physical conditions needed to explain the data, including
quantitatively testing of the possible geologic
scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides training for students and
promotes international collaboration.
