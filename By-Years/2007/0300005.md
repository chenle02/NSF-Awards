AST 0098717&lt;br/&gt;Majeed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Tariq Majeed, at the
Southwest Research Institute, will analyze the newly released electron density
data from Jupiter taken by the Galileo spacecraft. Dr. Majeed will modify
existing models to allow more realistic calculations of the density distribution
of each of the 14 vibrationally excited levels of molecular hydrogen in their
ground electronic state. The model will use the neutral temperature structure
and composition measurements from the Galileo ASI probe. Dr. Majeed will also
study the effects of the vertical drift of plasma, induced either by electric
fields or neutral winds, on the distribution of the measured ionospheric
electron densities. Such dynamic effects can influence the ionospheric structure
by moving the location of the electron density peak. The modified version of the
model will be used to interpret the newly released Galileo data.
