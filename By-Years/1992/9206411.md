This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics research by a group
at the University of Kansas in collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported
scientists. The group conducts research at CESR, the Cornell electron- positron
colliding beam accelerator, studying electron- positron interactions with the
CLEO II detector. They will study bottom quarks and tau leptons, the heaviest
fundamental particles yet discovered. The properties of the third family of
quarks and leptons in the Standard Model of elementary particles are almost
entirely determined by the work of the CLEO group at Cornell.
