This award supports participation in an international symposium at Rice
University in Houston, Texas, held June 25-29, 2018, entitled "A Symposium on
Optimal Stopping." The symposium is designed both to bring participants to the
frontiers of research in the mathematical theory of optimal stopping as well as
to stimulate further research. The event aims to encourage young U.S.
researchers to pursue research in optimal stopping and offers the opportunity to
more senior researchers to consolidate their experiences and to form fresh
research collaborations. In addition, the meeting will develop future avenues
for research that should benefit researchers working in the fields of:
mathematical and numerical analysis (partial differential equations, partial
integro-differential equations, boundary value problems, free boundary
problems); financial and insurance mathematics (particularly exotic option
pricing in semimartingale markets and credit risk); statistics (particularly
sequential testing, quickest detection, and optimal prediction); and physics
(particularly two-phase problems including obstacle problems and problems of
melting and solidification).

The symposium encompasses six themes: 1) The connection between optimal stopping
problems and free-boundary problems in mathematical physics; 2) Methods of
solution for optimal stopping problems, in particular nonlinear methods; 3)
Applications of optimal stopping to American type options, credit risk, and game
theory; 4) Applications of optimal stopping to sequential testing, quickest
detection, regularity problems, detection of hidden targets, and optimal
prediction; 5) Nonlinear and constrained optimal stopping; and 6) Connections of
optimal stopping to stochastic control and to statistical inference for
stochastic processes. Keynote speakers include S. Asmussen (Aarhus University),
N.H. Bingham (Imperial College London), S. Jacka (University of Warwick), I.
Karatzas (Columbia University), G. Peskir (University of Manchester), P.
Salminen (Abo Akademi), D. Siegmund (Stanford University), and N. Touzi (Ecole
Polytechnique). More information is available on the conference webpage:

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
