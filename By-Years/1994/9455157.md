This project involves developing modern physical chemistry laboratory
experiments during a three week faculty workshop for 16 participants. Each
participant will be asked to present to the workshop an outstanding experiment
from their home institution, provision having been made in advance for the
material needs and apparatus. Participants will then develop in pairs two new
experiments with write-ups for use in their home institutions, which will be
presented to and tested by the whole group. It is expected that experiments
involving modern instrumentation (e.g. lasers and computers), easily
transportable experiments, experiments involving biochemical materials, and fast
kinetics will be developed. These new laboratory exercises will be field tested
during the following academic year by at least four of the
participants'institutions, and presented at a symposium organized by the project
director at a national ACS meeting. Commercial publication of the products will
also be explored.
