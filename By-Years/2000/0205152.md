Modeling the Social and Technical Processes of Interorganizational Information
Integration

This grant will develop and test dynamic models of information integration in
multi-organizational government settings. Three questions will be addressed: 1)
What are the critical factors and processes involved in integrating information
across levels and agencies in government? 2) How do the factors and processes
vary for different types and degrees of integration? and 3) Can the process of
integration be modeled in ways that improve understanding of information system
development and of inter-organizational collaboration? Two policy areas in
particular will be featured; law enforcement and environmental protection. Both
areas include a full range of functions across Federal-State-Local levels of
government and both areas have efforts underway to bridge those levels. The
project will combine perspectives from organizational behavior, computer and
information science, and political science, and will use system dynamics
modeling and social processes modeling.
