9411990 Abel This grant supports a Joint US-Russia Workshop on Ocean and Oceanic
Atmospheric Technology Research on "Techniques and Capabilities for Ocean
Observations, Measurements of Environmental Change, Resource Assessment, and
Sustainable Development" to be held in Moscow. The US side will be led by Dr.
Robert Abel of the New Jersey Marine Science Consortium at Stevens Institute of
Technology. The workshop provides for an exchange of technology information on
techniques and capabilities, and for the development and application of this
technology for specific projects of mutual interest in ocean observations,
measurements of environment change, and for resource assessment and sustainable
development. The researchers will focus on: (1) Advances in Ocean Survey
Technology; (2) Sensors/Instrumentation Systems; and (3) automated, unmanned,
untethered undersea vehicles and robotics capability. The workshop will increase
the technical knowledge base and identify areas for cooperative engineering
research in advanced ocean technology where, historically, a major portion was
developed under military auspices. This project in biological and critical
systems fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling leading experts in Russia and the United States to combine
complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence. ***
