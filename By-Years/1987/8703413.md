The principal investigator will continue his study of the structure of smooth
4-dimensional manifolds using techniques from geometry and analysis. At the
heart of this investigation will be the classification of the homotopy types of
closed smooth 4- manifolds. Gauge theoretic methods pioneered by Simon Donaldson
were the original impetus for much of this work. In its marriage of theoretical
physics, geometry, analysis, and topology, it is one of the most dramatic cross-
disciplinary developments of recent years.
