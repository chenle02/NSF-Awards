Previously published work on the effect of agitation on cultured animal cells
has concentrated either on the macroscopic effects on percent viable, growth
rate, or antibody productivity, or on the aspects of turbulence that correlate
with these cellular responses. In this proposal the focus is on the cell itself,
and in particular the balance it maintains between internal and external
concentrations of calcium, sodium, potassium, and hydrogen. The steady state and
dynamic responses of intracellular ion concentrations to various levels of
agitation will be measured using a custom built high speed ratioing fluorometer.
Energy related variables such as ATP and NADH levels, specific consumption rates
of glucose, glutamine, and oxygen, and production rate of lactate will be
determined also. GAP-A3 hybridomas, CHO, and BHK-21 cells will be used. The
independent variables to be evaluated include agitation speed, impeller design,
physical properties of the medium, dissolved oxygen concentration, and external
concentrations of the ions of interest. This work will investigate some of the
basic cellular responses to agitation, yet also consider practical modifications
to culture conditions to control those responses.
