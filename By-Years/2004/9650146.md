This project enhances our ability to teach molecular and cellular aspects of
biology in the following five courses currently offered in our program:
genetics, cell biology, plant morphology and evolution, microbiology, and
developmental biology. Students are able to analyze cellular organelles,
identify unknown microorganisms with greater accuracy, study antigen-antibody
interactions in greater depth, and learn more about the molecular aspects of
development. Project instrumentation also allows for new investigations into
nuclear composition, analysis of cellular membranes, genetic fingerprinting of
plants and animals, and exploration of the use of microorganisms in
biotechnology. In addition, there is a significant, qualitative shift in the
laboratory component of our major program by introducing molecular
methodologies.
