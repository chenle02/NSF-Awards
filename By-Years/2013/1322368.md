Legal processes shape people's experiences of significant economic challenges.
Professional assistance is differentially available to people. Professional
assistance may allow people to engage legal processes more effectively; it can
be variable by place, area of law, and time. Legal assistance may not make a
difference because the legal problems themselves are too substantial and are too
deeply tied to ongoing problems. Alternatively, legal assistance may improve
outcomes for people because assistance allows better negotiation of legal
processes. This project will examine the how legal processes work for clients in
one type of case. By only examining one type of legal problem, the project will
allow the investigator to draw conclusions about legal effectiveness in a way
that would not be possible were the project to focus on multiple kinds of legal
problems.

The project will develop a unique dataset on cases, including contextual
information concerning economic characteristics of places, that will be useful
to researchers in the future. In addition, the project will contribute to
training in the social sciences for both the investigator and a student who will
be trained on the project.
