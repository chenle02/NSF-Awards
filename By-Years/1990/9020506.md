This award supports analytical and numerical investigations into the topology
of the large scale structure of the universe by one of the leading groups of
cosmologists in the world. Computer algorithms developed to measure the topology
of volume distributions of galaxies, sky maps, and pencils beam surveys will be
applied to new observational surveys as well as to very large scale numerical
simulations. These studies are designed to help understand the nature of large
scale structure and the initial conditions that produced it.
