This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
navigation grade chip-scale, low cost, rugged MEMS gyroscope sensor based on a
matched resonance tuning fork architecture. In contrast, present day navigation
grade gyroscopes are mechanical, fiber optic or ring laser systems that are very
bulky, expensive and prone to failure over time. The goal of the Phase I project
is to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept design by increasing the
understanding of and addressing the various loss mechanisms in the device. The
specific objectives include demonstrating the effect of (a) architecture design
scaling and optimization (b) improvements to the mechanical quality factor and
(c) development of methods for temperature compensation and management. In Phase
I, these technical areas will be explored in order to demonstrate feasibility
and the commercial potential of the design to achieve navigation grade
performance.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will enable the
manufacturing of high reliability, chip scale MEMS gyroscopes suitable for
inertial systems capable of gyrocompassing. The research will greatly impact the
development of devices for commercial, military, and homeland security markets.
Specific gyrocompassing applications include high accuracy advanced survey tools
for oil/gas exploration, and construction industries, defense systems, and
navigation systems. In addition, this fundamental technology could enable new
emerging inertial based navigation market opportunities where size, weight, cost
and power are extremely critical factors such as micro-robots, small unmanned
aerial systems and personal navigation.
