This dissertation research award will support a graduate student in
anthropology to study the movement of the "pink collar" sector of the
information processing industry from urban centers in the U.S. to off-shore
regions of the Caribbean, and the impact of these shifts on Barbadian women
incorporated as data processors and North American workers who face possible job
losses. Methods include participant observation and structured interviewing, in
Barbados and in the US, of executives in the data processing firms, political
leaders, and workers. Data form a sample of 50 Barbadian women will be compared
to a comparable number of US data processors with respect to their life-and
work-histories. This research is important because the restructuring of AMerican
industry is a significant fact of modern life, and studies which shed light on
what this means for workers on both sides of the fence -- the developing
countries receiving jobs from the US and the American workers facing changed
labor markets -- can help inform social policy aimed at ameliorating social
problems.
