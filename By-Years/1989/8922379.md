This project concerns fundamental mathematical questions in harmonic analysis.
Among the principal research directions will be the study of multidimensional
convolutions with measures supported on curves. The object is to expand on E.
Stein's observation that the convolution of singular measures with functions in
Lebesgue spaces may result in functions in related Lebesgue spaces. This
research will focus on those measures concentrated on smooth curves. The entire
question of convolution along cuves has its roots in the theory of
differentiation of integrals, which in turn is a formulation of integral
solutions of partial differential equations. A second line of investigation will
focus on obtaining sharp Sobolev inequalities for non-elliptic, constant
coefficient differential operators which reflect the symmetry of certain
orthogonal groups. Sobolev-type inequalities are crucial in obtaining existence
results for partial differential operators. They form a class of inequalities in
which the norm of a function is dominated by the norm (possibly a different
norm) of its gradient. Two particular cases will be addressed in this work, the
classical wave operator and the Klein-Gordon operator.
