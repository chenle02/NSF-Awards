The goal of this project is the development and application of topological and
analytical methods useful for the study of existence, multiplicity, and
stability of solutions of nonlinear nonautonomous differential equations. The
fact that the equations are forced or have temporal dependence complicates them
considerably. Differential equations with forcing model a wide variety of
phenomena that occurs in everyday life. Problems with nonlinearities near
resonance are very complicated and require very sophisticated mathematics to
give qualitative information.
