Major advances in technology have made it possible to monitor rapid changes in
intracellular ion activities in living cells. the technique involves first
loading cells with fluorescent dyes specific for different ions (Ca , H , Cl ).
Changes in ion concentration are then measured by monitoring fluorescence from
the cells maintained inside the cuvette of a spectrofluorometer. this basic
technique involving a population of cells can be extended to analysis of single
cells with the appropriate hardware and microscope. Reconstruction of a
digitized image by a mini-computer allows 2 and 3-D analysis of cells undergoing
changes in ion concentrations. Currently, at Wright State University, there are
as many as eight independent investigators using related fluorescent techniques
and sharing time on a single instrument. The available instrument has certain
drawbacks as well as being heavily used. However, enough significant preliminary
data has been obtained to prompt five researchers to request funds under the
Instrumentation Program to purchase another spectrofluorometer with dual beam
excitation, photodiode array detection, single cell (microscopic) and imaging
capabilities. The research proposal of these five investigators involve the
measurement of calcium, pH, and chloride in diverse cell types, including
astrocytes, vascular smooth muscle, and human diploid fibroblasts. In addition,
the requested spectrofluorometer will be used for studies involving membrane
fusion such as that which occurs during exocytosis or viral invasion.
