The University of the Pacific will offer twenty-five students a three week
intensive residential lecture and laboratory course on genetic engineering.
There will be strong emphasis on the laboratory methods of modern molecular
biology, as well as the career opportunities resulting from this new technology.
Students also will be exposed to the ethical and social issues associated with
this technology. Participants will be entering seniors in high school. Six of
the fifteen class participants will be invited to continue working full time in
the biochemical research laboratory of the Principal Investigator for an
additional five weeks.
