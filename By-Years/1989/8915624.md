This work is an ongoing experimental research program designed to provide data
on the variables controlling the mechanical behavior of partially molten systems
within the crust. The specific problem to be investigated is the production of
granitoid melts by ultrametamorphism of metasediments, and it is expected that
the results will provide a new dimension to the interpretation of field
occurrences of migmatites and granites. A primary objective is to determine how
the amount and composition of melt produced varies with temperature, pressure,
and the bulk composition of the staring material. Experiments designed to
investigate the melting behavior of layered metasediments are also planned and
the implications of all experiments for metamorphic temperature and pressure
will be evaluated.
