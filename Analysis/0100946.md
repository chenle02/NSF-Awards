This proposal is about the study of some asymptotic problems in Fluid Mechanics
and Gas Dynamics. Asymptotic problems arise when a dimensionless parameter
epsilon goes to zero in an equation describing the motion of some type of fluid
(or any other physical system). Many mathematical problems are encountered when
we try to justify the passage to the limit, which are mainly due to the change
of the type of the equations, the presence of many spatial and temporal scales,
the presence of boundary layers (we can no longer impose the same boundary
conditions for the initial system and the limit one), the presence of
oscillations in time at high frequency .... In this Proposal, the PI intends to
study (among other problems) the hydrodynamic limit of the Boltzmann equation,
the compressible-incompressible limit,



These asymptotic problems allow us to get simpler models at the limit, due to
the fact that we usually have fewer variables or (and) fewer unknowns. This
simplifies the numerical simulations and improves our understanding of the
prevailing phenomenon when the parameter is small, in fact, instead of solving
the initial system, we can solve the limit system and then add a corrector.
