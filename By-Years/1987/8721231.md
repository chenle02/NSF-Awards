This award is to continue research on the role of information in the auction of
off-shore oil and gas leases. Under the previous award, the investigators have
assembled a detailed data set of off-shore lease auctions from 1954 through
1969. A preliminary statistical analyses of these data has been conducted, and
the authors have studied the existence and influence of asymmetric information
in lease auctions on bidding behavior. This award will extend the data set of
off-shore lease auctions through 1980. In addition, these data will be analyzed
in several new contexts. A detailed, econometric study will be undertaken of the
participation and bidding decisions by firms for wildcat tracts, the formation
of bidding consortia among firms, and the influence of post-auction information
on exploratory drilling decisions. Alternative auction procedures will also be
investigated. This project is important because it will provide a better
understanding of the role of information in off-shore oil and gas-lease
auctions.
