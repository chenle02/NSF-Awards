This award will provide partial support for a research workshop on Banach space
theory to be held at the Universidad de los Andes (ULA) in Merida, Venezuela,
January 6-17, 1992. The U.S. organizer is Bor-Luh Lin, of the University of
Iowa; the Venezuelan organizer is Jorge B. Vielma, ULA. The workshop's aim is to
stimulate cooperative research and the exchange of ideas between senior and
junior participants, as well as between U.S. and Venezuelan mathematicians. It
also would provide an opportunity for establishing future cooperation between
institutions of the two countries. The workshop will focus on several important
areas of Banach space research, such as the local theory and the study of
geometrical properties of these spaces, the study of extreme structures of
bounded closed convex sets (a focus of Banach space theory in the last 25
years), the existence of nice equivalent norms and minimal sets in Banach
spaces, and other topics in which the geometry of Banach spaces has found many
important applications. Workshop participants will also discuss applications of
Banach space techniques to analytic functions, nonlinear analysis, partial
differential equations, and fixed point theory.
