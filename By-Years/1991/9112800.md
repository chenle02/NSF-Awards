Gardner The cyclostationarity property of communications and telemetry signals
enables the generation of spectral lines with appropriate nonlinear
transformations, and renders fluctuations in distinct spectral bands
statistically dependent. The frequencies at which spectral lines can be
generated are directly related to the separations between dependent spectral
bands, which in turn are directly related to carrier frequencies, keying rates,
pulse rates, and so on, in the signal. These inherent properties of
cyclostationary signals can be exploited to great advantage for numerous tasks
in signal processing. The objectives of this research are: 1. to investigate new
cyclostationarity-exploiting methods for identifying the kernels in the Volterra
series representation of time-invariant and multiply-periodic time-variant
nonlinear systems; and 2. to further develop the recently introduced cyclic
temporal and spectral moment and cumulant theory of higher-order
cyclostationarity, with application to designing higher-order spectral-line
generators for signal detection and identification, and for signal parameter
estimation and synchronization.
