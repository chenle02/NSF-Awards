This award to Dr. Joan S. Valentine of the Chemistry Department, University of
California at Los Angeles, is made by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Program. It supports work in three related areas: model
intermediates for the reactions of non-heme monooxygenase enzymes; organic
cofactors required by dioxygenase enzymes; and the synthesis and
characterization of metalloporphyrin peroxo complexes of iron and chromium,
which may model intermediates in the activation of dioxygen by heme-containing
monooxygenase enzymes. In the first area, Dr. Valentine will study the role of
Fe-cyclam and related complexes in olefin epoxidation reactions with hydrogen
peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides, and organic peracids. In the second study,
benzolylformate complexes of iron and tetrahydropterin complexes of iron and
cobalt will be synthesized and investigated. %%% The overall goal of the
proposed research is to design catalysts for oxygenation reactions, and in the
process better understand the mechanism of biological dioxygen and monooxygen
activation.
