We propose to develop novel techniques and methodologies for distributed smart
camera networks through an integrated exploration of distributed algorithms,
embedded architectures, and software synthesis techniques. We will develop new
architectures and tools that are designed to tackle modern video processing
algorithms. The algorithms will leverage distributed architectures for efficient
implementations. We will investigate a series of complex smart camera algorithms
drawn from surveillance and biometrics applications. Specifically, we will be
investigating efficient implementations of algorithms for self-calibration of
distributed cameras, view-synthesis using image-based visual hulls, and human
identification using face and gait.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Networks of
distributed cameras are an emerging enabling technology for a broad range of
important information technology applications, including surveillance,
biometrics, and smart conference rooms. By having acces to scenes from multiple
directions, such networks have the potential for complete views than single-
camera systems. This contributes to increased robustness and generality of
algorithms. However, this distributed nature, coupled with the inherent
challenges associated with real-time video processing, greatly complicates the
devlopment of effective algorithms, architectures and software.&lt;br/&gt;An
integrated research program inclduing video, design tools, and embedded system
architecture is required to understand how new generation of&lt;br/&gt;smart
camera hardware can be best utilized.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
