With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Carpenter at Cornell
University is investigating fundamental organic dynamics using theoretical and
experimental chemistry. The theoretical portion deals with calculation of
molecular trajectories in an effort to to determine the lifetimes of reaction
intermediates. The hypothesis is that short lived species may have kinetic
characteristics which are new and not adequately described by existing theory.
In the experimental portion of the investigation, the principal investigator is
testing this hypothesis using pericyclic systems with isotope labeling and
supercritical fluid media. Stereoselectivity of reaction products is the
preferred end point analysis for testing the new concept. In order to generalize
the use of chemical reactions in a rational way, it is necessary to understand
the reaction pathway in detail. While the chemical community has had a paradigm
for many organic reactions, this proposed work challenges these traditional
concepts and has preliminary data to support the new concepts. If successful,
this investigation could have profound significance for understanding of
chemical reactions.
