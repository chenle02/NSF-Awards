This grant provides support for a conference entitled "Beneficial Use of
Recycled Materials in Transportation Applications) to be held November 13-15,
2001 in Washington, DC. The primary sponsor of the conference is the Federal
Highway Administration through the Recycled Materals Resource Center (RMRC) at
UNH. The conference will focus on research and policy topics related to the use
of different types of recycled materials (e.g. asphalt pavement, reclaimed
concrete, tires, contaminated soils, coal ash, slags, foundry sands, municipal
solid waste ash, construction and demolition aggregates, glass, shingles and
compost) in the highway environment (e.g. pavements, embankments, flowable fills
and appurtenances). The conference will bring together educators, students,
researchers and practitioners interested in research and policy associated with
recycled materials use in the transportation sector. &lt;br/&gt;A special issue
of a research journal, or a book, will be published containing peer-reviewed
papers from the conference. Another outcome will be a research needs white paper
to be published with the conference papers. This white paper will also be
distributed to interested Federal and state agencies. ***&lt;br/&gt;
