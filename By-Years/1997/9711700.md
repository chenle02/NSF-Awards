9711700 Webb This is a seismic study of Axial volcano and the central JdF ridge
using 16 OBSs and 4 OBHs deployed over an 8-month period. Data from earthquakes
recorded during this time will be used to investigate the crust building process
on the central JdF (1) by using the temporal and spatial patterns in seismicity
and fault-plane mechanisms to infer along and across-axis variations in the
stress field and to investigate the thermals tructure fromt he depth of the
brittle-ductile transition, and (2) by using the travel times from a subset of
the events to perform a tomographic inversion for the 3D velocity structure of
Axial volcano.
