J. F. O'Hanlon 9509254 Particle travel support will be provided to four invited
speakers and four US graduate students to an interdisciplinary workshop on
particle formation and transport in plasmas, particularly weak ionized plasmas.
The meeting will promote synergy between several research areas, including
aerosols, astrophysics, particles in plasmas for materials synthesis an
semiconductors manufacturing. The workshop will be organized in collaboration
with the NSF-sponsored Center for Microcontamination Control at the University
of Arizona, and will involve participants from industry. Research leaders in the
respective field from other countries (including Australia, Russia, Japan,
France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland) will constitute about half of the
participants at the meeting. The workshop proceeding will be printed and
distributed to those interested. ***
