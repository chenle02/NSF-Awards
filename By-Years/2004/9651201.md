This project has four major objectives: (1) to improve the laboratory
experience of the students in general, analytical, and environmental chemistry
by providing an atomic absorption (AA) spectrometer for trace metal analysis--
this instrument enables the department to give students practical experience
working with a powerful analytical tool on problems that have great intrinsic
interest; (2) to provide broader opportunities for upper-level biology and
environmental science students conducting field and laboratory research; (3) to
enhance the scope of senior research projects, making possible more quantitative
studies and encouraging the development of collaborative projects; and (4) to
provide an important instrumental resource that enriches the experience of
students participating in an environmental internship program, working in
cooperation with the Portland Water District, the Maine Department of
Environmental Resources, and nearby communities.
