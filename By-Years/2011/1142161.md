With this award, researchers from three U.S. institutions will focus on
exploring and understanding near-Earth?s space environment (geospace) through
the coordinated use of multiple data sets, including both a variety of
individual spacecraft and strategically located ground observatories. Because
those parts of the Earth?s magnetic field that reach farthest out into geospace
intersect the ground at high latitudes, arrays of ground magnetometers and
auroral imagers have long been a valued means of monitoring processes in remote
parts of the magnetosphere. The ground stations used in this project are key
links in arrays of ground-based ionospheric and magnetospheric observations in
both the Arctic and Antarctic regions. In conjunction with data from other
instruments located at these sites, with other Antarctic arrays of automated
instruments, and with both low-altitude and high-altitude satellites, these
instruments have played and will continue to play a significant role in the
studies of geospace phenomena including solar wind?magnetosphere interactions
and geomagnetic storms and substorms. Taken together, search coil instruments at
these stations make it possible to study the entire range of ultra-low frequency
(ULF) variations, from Pc 1 and Pi 1 pulsations down to Pc 5 pulsations,
magnetic impulse events, sudden impulses, and substorm bays, with high
sensitivity. The analysis efforts associated with this project will involve, and
are highly suitable for, research training of both undergraduate and graduate
students, and build on currently strong programs of faculty and student
research.
