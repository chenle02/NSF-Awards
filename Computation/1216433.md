The vast majority of the solid materials used in engineered systems are
polycrystalline. They are composed of many single crystals joined together by a
three dimensional network of internal interfaces called grain boundaries. In
many cases, the performance and integrity of a material are determined by the
structure of the grain-boundary network. Examples of such materials are nano-
twinned copper whose strength is dominated by coherent twin boundaries; fine-
scale interconnects in microelectronics whose resistivity is dominated by grain
boundaries. While these material present extremely attractive properties, the
fundamental mechanisms that underlie them are poorly-understood thus presenting
a challenge to further development. Efforts to meet this challenge have led to
new directions of research in experiment, theory, modeling and simulation. The
goal of this work is to develop the mathematical tools and its software
implementation and to provide a toolbox for extracting these material properties
based on experimental data. The investigator and his colleagues will achieve
these goals using inverse problem formulations in conjunction with recently
developed experimental technique - The High Energy Diffraction Microscopy (HEDM)
- to identify energy and mobility in materials ubiquitously used in
applications. Grain boundary energy and mobility, which are defined on a five
dimensional space, are the physical parameters that govern the evolution of
grain boundaries under thermal loading where the most acceptable model is the
Mullins equation. The advent of the HEDM technique opens new possibilities for
probing the evolution of polycrystalline materials and will enable us the direct
calculation of grain boundary velocities. This in conjunction with inverse
problems governed by Mullins equation will lead us to accurate estimates of both
energy and mobility. The mathematical techniques that we use in this work
include Optimal Transport, Numerical solution of PDEs and Optimization
Techniques for solving the inverse problems.

This work deals with novel mathematical and computational approaches for
meeting important challenges in materials science. In particular, understanding
microstructure evolution under mechanical and thermal loading. Microstructure
affects materials reliability and failure and is strongly dependent on physical
parameters - the energy and mobility. We will develop techniques for accurate
identification of these properties in materials of engineering applications.
This is pivotal for better design and reliability of electronic, structures and
combustion components. These studies will pave the road to deal with response to
thermo-mechanical loading in polycrystalline materials. The applications of
these results will have broader impact in essentially all the other branches of
engineering where mechanical loads occur (bridges, cars, planes, MEMS devices,
prostheses), as well as the study of geological materials.
