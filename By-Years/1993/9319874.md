9319874 Bradley This project will support a travel grant program for the 1994
International Congress of Mathematicians to be held in August 1994 in Zurich,
Switzerland. The Congress, which is held every four years, is a meeting of
mathematicians from all over the world. The American Mathematical Society will
administer the program, which will culminate in the selection of a group of
mathematicians from the United States who will receive awards providing partial
support for their travel to this meeting. ***
