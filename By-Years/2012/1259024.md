A summer school and conference on Hodge theory will be held at the University of
British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada) from June 10-20, 2013. This award will
support 30 US participants at various stages of their careers. The 24 invited
speakers are leading experts in aspects of complex and arithmetic geometry,
algebraic cycles, and representation theory, which are in the early stages of a
synthesis around the study of period mappings and generalized period domains.
The conference will accelerate this process and give graduate students and
recent Ph.D.'s an opportunity to enter an emerging discipline.

In its simplest form, Hodge theory is the study of periods -- integrals of
algebraic differential forms which arise in the study of complex geometry,
number theory and physics. Its difficulty and richness arise in part from the
non-algebraicity of these integrals. What algebraic structure they do have is
recorded by symmetry groups called Mumford-Tate groups, and according to the
Hodge conjecture (and its variants) should be explained by the presence of
objects called algebraic cycles. The conference will serve to disseminate recent
progress on both of these fronts, create new interdisciplinary collaborations,
and train the next generation of Hodge theorists.
