Algebraic objects are often perceived as complicated and mysterious. In
combinatorial representation theory one seeks simpler ways to represent them in
order to understand, organize and apply them to other subjects. This project
deals with tensor products of representations, which is a way to combine
representations. The main problem that the project seeks to understand is how to
decompose tensor products into sums of simpler representations. One can think
about it as the problem of recovering individual signals from a mixture of
signals. The tensor product decomposition is a difficult problem but also very
important, because it shows up in many fields, including algebraic
combinatorics, complexity theory, and statistics, and has applications in
medicine, computer vision, physics, chemistry, and fast matrix
multiplication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental open problem in combinatorial
representation theory is to describe in the decomposition of the tensor product
the multiplicities of two irreducible representations of the symmetric group;
these multiplicities are called Kronecker coefficients. The problem of finding a
combinatorial interpretation for these coefficients has been labeled as one of
the "main problems in combinatorial representation theory." The PI and
collaborators have been able to connect the Kronecker coefficients to the
partition algebra. This connection led to the discovery of the "universal
characters" of the symmetric group, which are symmetric functions that
specialize to characters of the symmetric group when evaluated at roots of
unity. These symmetric functions connect several difficult problems in
combinatorial representation theory and will lead to the resolution of several
of these problems.
