This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
provides continued support to Dr. Gregory H. Robinson of the Chemistry
Department, University of Georgia, for investigation of the coordination
chemistry of aluminum compounds containing Al-Al bonds. The synthetic approach
to the target molecules--novel organometallic alanes--will require preparation
of anionic aluminum dimers containing a hydride bridge and bulky aryl ligands by
alkali metal reduction of diaryl aluminum hydrides. Preparation of the diaryl
aluminum hydrides will be based on the synthetic route to analogous gallium
compounds. In addition, attempts will be made to achieve the desired products
using a template based on bis(aluminumdichloride). Organometallic compounds of
aluminum have been prepared only recently, and unlike other members of the Group
III family, boron and gallium, few molecules containing a multiple aluminum
atoms are known. Preparation of compounds of this type presents a synthetic
challenge, but also may lead to compounds with novel properties since other
members of this family have become important in the manufacture of electronic
materials
