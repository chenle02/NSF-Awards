This research will be in algebraic geometry, especially the study of
geometrically defined subvarieties of moduli spaces of curves, hypersurfaces,
and abelian varieties, and of more general period spaces, and applications to
period maps. In particular they plan to extend their analysis of the geometry of
discriminant loci for families of hypersurfaces to mappings and families of
algebraic cycles. One principal application will be to the study of the Hodge
problem for one cycles on projective threefolds and two-cycles on abelian
varieties.
