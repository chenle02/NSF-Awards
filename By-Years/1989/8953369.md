Only a small fraction of American high school students today take physics.
Recognizing this, a partnership of University professors, high school teachers,
and industrial scientists and engineers will develop teaching materials and
strategies to enhance secondary-level physics education through the integration
of mathematical and technological applications into the curriculum.
Instructional materials needed to accomplish this will be defined, developed,
field tested in a number of cooperating school districts, and disseminated.
Materials developed will include suitable laboratory experiments. High school
physics, mathematics, and technology teachers will work together on the project
to insure that materials will appropriately interrelate these course areas and
meet the needs of students across a broad spectrum of the secondary student
population. Industrial scientists and engineers will participate fully in the
preparation of the materials; they will help define pertinent examples of
current technology, provide access to industrial laboratories and other
facilities, and share insights on future directions of technological
development. Cost sharing by the partners will total 70% of the NSF funding.
