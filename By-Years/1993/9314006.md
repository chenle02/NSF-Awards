9314006 Kurz In this project the PI proposes a multiprong approach involving
measurement of He, Sr, Ndf, Pb isotopic ratios of oceanic basalts in order to
characterize ages and spatial extent of heterogeneities in the oceanic mantle.
An important strategy proposed is to obtain olivine/glass partitioning values
using laser fusion technique. He also intends to acquire new data on
stratigraphically controlled samples form the Hawaiian volcanoes and from
Galapagos and other OIBs. ***
