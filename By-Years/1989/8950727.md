This project incorporates a 200Mhz FT-NMR into laboratory instruction at the
undergraduate level. This instrument is used in the Organic Chemistry as a tool
for structure determination. The Physical Chemistry course employs the
instrument for kinetic measurements and the variable temperature option is used
for the determination of Arrhenius activation parameters. Organometallic
reactions occurring on the NMR time scale are studied in the senior level
Inorganic Chemistry course. Students in Polymer chemistry study chain branching
and tacticity of chain-growth polymers. In Organic Structure Determination,
students use routine 1H and 13C capabilities as well as powerful two dimensional
techniques for structure elucidation. Undergraduate chemistry majors make
extensive use of this instrument in research projects under the direction of the
chemistry faculty. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal
amount of funds.
