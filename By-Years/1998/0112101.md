The Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) database project consists of comparable cross-
sectional microdata on the composition of households and the structure of their
incomes for 25 industrialized economies as of January 2001. It has also added
labor force survey data for 16 nations under another subtitle, the Luxembourg
Employment Study (LES). LIS is one of the (if not the) leading examples of an
interdisciplinary, cross-national, cooperative data infrastructure which
supports research that leads to important policy relevant insights. The plans
for the next three years include several improvements in database management
(more sophisticated electronic access system; better on-line documentation;
fifth wave of data for 2000; new surveys of the labor force); in research
(inequality, poverty, gender studies); in training (annual LIS workshops in the
United States, in Europe and elsewhere); in continuing to set new international
standards for income distribution statistics; and in developing purchasing power
parities for income distribution studies; and in providing US users with more
direct access to the other nations' LIS surveys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the
past 17 years, the LIS project has demonstrated its feasibility and usefulness
as an internationally sponsored and researcher-lead database infrastructure
project. The vast majority of its support, and all of its "core" operations, are
funded by an international consortium of 16 nations and 22 funders such as the
U.S. National Science Foundation. Because electronic access to LIS is, by design
and intent, free once a privacy pledge is signed, users treat it as a "public
good" which provides benefits at little or no direct cost to them. Hence, "core"
funding is always a crucial issue. And so this proposal for core funding from
the United States, like the proposals to the other 15 nations, is vital to the
continued future of the LIS project. &lt;br/&gt;
