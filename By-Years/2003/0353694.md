The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Canisius College will host an
eight week summer research program. Minority and women are strongly encouraged
to apply. Eight undergradute students will work in two teams on related projects
investigating combinatorial properties of graphs and groups through specific
examples. The goal is to produce original research results that can be submitted
for publication to a mathematics journal or presented in conferences in
mathematics. A secondary goal is to create tutorial&lt;br/&gt;reports that will
provide a foundation for future student research.
