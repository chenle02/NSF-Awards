The research is to investigate a cognitive engineering based approach which
incorporates user's (operator's) cognitive characteristics into the interface
design of decision support systems (DSS) for troubleshooting advanced
manufacturing systems. The objectives are (1) to verify operator's task-related
knowledge model which is derived from a cognitive theory of human knowledge
systems; (2) to evaluate usability of a theory-based interface of DSS which is
designed through integrating operator's knowledge model and advanced human-
computer interaction technology (direct manipulation). Three experiments will be
conducted to test hypotheses on three aspects of operator's knowledge model:
structure, content, and control strategy. An additional experiment will be
conducted to compare usability of the theory-based interface to that of a
conventional interface of DSS. The research will enhance the understanding of
operator's supervisory control behaviors and lead to a design model for the
interface of DSS.
