With support from a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, a search will be
conducted for evidence that there exists a regime of very large Reynolds numbers
in which turbulence characteristics differ from those below this regime. Both
existing boundary layer turbulence measurements, and new data from a large
Reynolds numbers fully developed pipe flow experiment to be built, will be
searched for this evidence. Focus is on differences between the two conjectured
regimes in the coupling of fluctuations very near the wall and those further out
into the flow. Discovery of changes in turbulence characteristics at very high
Reynolds numbers would contradict the commonly held view that turbulence
characteristics become more universal as Reynolds number increases. This would
impact the construction of predictive turbulence models and improve their
accuracy and utility for various engineering systems.
