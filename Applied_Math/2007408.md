The project is devoted to studying various spectral phenomena arising in
mathematical physics and areas of novel material science that have been enjoying
increased interest recently, among them photonics, carbon nanostructure, and
topological insulators. For such problems, it is important to study the spectral
properties of several operators, such as the Schr√∂dinger and Dirac operators, as
well as operators on quantum graphs. When dealing with crystalline matter, the
operators are usually periodic (possibly perturbed by impurities) with respect
to appropriate crystalline groups. Many novel materials and meta-materials, such
as graphene, graphynes, carbon nanotubes, topological insulators, photonic
crystals, and thin dielectric or electronic structures require such studies,
which turn out to be challenging and involve high-level and diverse mathematical
tools. The results of the project will significantly benefit the active area of
novel materials and meta-materials that carry a high promise of technological
revolution, including topological insulators, carbon (and other) nanomaterials,
slowing light media, and nano-scale electronics. The results will be
disseminated in publications in research journals, research presentations
nationwide and internationally, taught in graduate level classes, and addressed
in a monograph. The project will address a number of problems in several
interconnected areas. These include: dispersion relations and spectra, crucial
for understanding the properties of crystalline matter; thresholds effects,
including a model of ?slow light? media; Morse indices and nodal patterns,
aiming at further developing a recent discovery of this connection; thin open
book structures, addressing models of branching thin surface-like media; frames
of Wannier functions in the presence of topological obstructions (as in
topological insulators) and gap absence; and analytic properties of Fermi and
Bloch varieties in discrete and continuous cases. The project will lead to
further development of mathematical techniques important for novel material
science, condensed matter physics, photonics, and chemistry.
