This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will develop a cost-
effective commercial method for production of fully dense structural ceramic
parts of complex shape directly by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis
(SHS) reaction under pressure using the Electroconsolidation process. Many
already developed high-performance ceramic materials are not used because of the
high cost to fabricate components. The use of SHS to make parts offers
considerable opportunity to reduce costs if dense, shaped parts can be made
directly from reactant powder mix. Electroconsolidation is a newly developed
process for low-cost pressure-assisted densification that is uniquely capable to
meet this requirement. The project will determine the technical and economic
feasibility of employing Electroconsolidation for making dense silicon carbide.

The commercial benefit if successful, would be products made from high-
performance materials such as carbides, silicides, and carbo-nitrides could
become more economical to produce.
