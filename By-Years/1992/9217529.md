This award will support the travel of U.S. advanced graduate students and
postdoctoral researchers to a U.S.-Sweden workshop to be held in conjunction
with a special year (1993) in mathematical physics at the Mittlag-Leffler
Institute, Djursholm, Sweden. The workshop will concentrate on three main topics
in mathematical physics: quantum mechanical many-body problem; problems arising
in solid state physics; and asymptotic methods. Peter D. Hislop of the
University of Kentucky and Anders Melin of the Lund Institute of Technology in
Sweden will jointly organize the workshop seminars. The young American
researchers will be able to attend the workshop for a period of two months each
and will be joined by a cohort of Swedish advanced graduate students and
postdoctoral researchers. Prominent American, Swedish and European
mathematicians, who have contributed significantly to the field, will
participate in the workshop seminars, thereby providing a unique opportunity for
young researchers to advance their understanding of current research themes and
develop their research and future collaborations.
