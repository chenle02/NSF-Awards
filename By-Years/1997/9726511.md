9726511 BOHS Molecular Phylogenetic Studies in the genus Solanum (Solanaceae)
Lynn A. Bohs The tomato family (Solanaceae) is one of world's most economically
important plant groups, and many of these species have been introduced
throughout the world from the Americas. Familiar members of the family include
the tomato, potato, and eggplant, as well as other minor food crops and tobacco.
Certain species are sources of foods, ornamental plants, and medicinally
valuable or poisonous alkaloids. Solanum, one of the largest genera of any plant
family, has about 1500 species throughout the world, but species are most
numerous in the New World tropics. Solanum exhibits a remarkable diversity in
morphology, biochemistry, reproductive systems, and dispersal patterns that make
it ideal group for evolutionary studies. Because the understanding of the
classification and evolution of Solanum is very limited, the ability of
agriculturists and scientists to utilize species of economic and scientific
interest is hindered. Dr. Bohs will use two molecular data sets, one from the
chloroplast genome and one from the nuclear ribosomal DNA, to examine
evolutionary relationships across the taxonomic spectrum of the entire genus.
This study will arrive at a classification framework that can be used to guide
more detailed studies at lower taxonomic levels. Questions concerning
biogeographic patterns, breeding system evolution, and fruit morphology and
dispersal will be examined in a phylogenetic context. A field trip to Bolivia is
planned to collect unusual and poorly known representatives of Solanum that will
enhance our knowledge of morphological evolution and species diversity in this
large and important genus.
