The goal of this project is to create a sophomore-level undergraduate course
introducing students from a wide variety of backgrounds to the principles and
results of linguistic semantics. The heart of this course is a software
"workbook" that presents the material in an interactive, graphic environment.
The course and workbook address various aspects of meaning, including its
relation to word and sentence form (morphology &amp; syntax), its relation to
systems of mental representation (cognition), and the interaction between
meaning and use. The goals of the course are to reveal to students the complex
internal system of internal rules and principles that underlie our abilities as
native language speakers, to let them experience some of the intellectual
excitement that comes with discovering such principles and struggling to
formulate them in a precise way, and to encourage them to explore the computer
as a model of how we, as human beings, think and understand. The results of this
work will be of significant value in introducing undergraduates to the
principles of scientific reasoning, in reaching students not otherwise
considering science majors or extensive science electives, and in helping to
foster interest and interdisciplinary exploration in the cognitive sciences.
