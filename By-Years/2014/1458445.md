Part 1&lt;br/&gt;This proposal plans to carry out low-frequency radio
measurements of cosmic magnetism through a collaboration between Arizona State
University and the German Long Wavelength Consortium. Each year, the program
will fund two first-year graduate students and five advanced undergraduates, who
will carry out research with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), a remarkable new
European radio telescope. Due to its sensitivity, resolution, and frequency
coverage, LOFAR will allow for intergalactic magnetic field measurements orders
of magnitude better than previously possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part
2&lt;br/&gt;Magnetic fields thread the Universe, setting the criteria for star
formation in galaxies, controlling the evolution of galaxy clusters, and
altering the intergalactic medium from which all galaxies formed. Yet very
little is known about their properties.&lt;br/&gt;LOFAR is the first of a new
generation of telescopes that operates in the extremely low frequency range
between 10 and 240 MHz. Magnetic fields are primarily detected by their
interactions with cosmic rays, and only telescopes at these low frequencies,
which&lt;br/&gt;correspond to low cosmic ray energies, are able to make
sensitive measurements far away from cosmic ray sources and out in the depths of
intergalactic space. With this remarkable new tool, the projects carried out by
IRES students will help to open a new window on the magnetic universe. On galaxy
scales, they will probe the connection between star formation and magnetism and
the origin of the magnetic fields that surround galaxies. On galaxy cluster
scales, they will probe the unknown physics of the hot&lt;br/&gt;intracluster
medium and the evolution of the synchrotron emitting bubbles found within it. On
cosmic scales they will uncover the magnetic properties of the web of gas that
connects all galaxies. Together they will be filling in a key piece of the
fundamental question: what is the structure of the Universe on the largest
scales?
