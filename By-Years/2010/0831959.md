Morgan State University and Baltimore City Public School System (BCPSS) are core
partners for the MSP-Start "BRAIN-STEM" project which is building the necessary
institutional infrastructure, in both the university and the school system, to
implement activities that integrate mathematical and biological concepts in a
manner that can be incorporated into high school mathematics and science
courses. From a content perspective, they are focusing on discrete mathematics
and genomics as material that is interesting, engaging, and at an appropriate
level for success. They are conducting a needs analysis in the BCPSS by
collecting and analyzing student achievement and teacher characteristic data in
grades 9 - 12 math and science. They are using these results in designing a
project that addresses the content and pedagogical needs of Baltimore City
Public School System (BCSS) life sciences and mathematics teachers through the
use of integrated problem-based learning that incorporates standards-based
mathematics instruction and inquiry-based science instruction. Furthermore, they
are using their evaluation outcomes as the basis for developing a full MSP
Targeted Partnership proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Morgan State University is a
public, coeducational university which primarily serves students from
underrepresented minority backgrounds. Baltimore City Public School System
(BCPSS) serves over 87,000 students in urban and non-urban settings in
Baltimore, Maryland, including 37 different high schools. About 75% of the
school age children in the Baltimore City Public School district are African
American.
