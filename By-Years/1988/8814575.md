Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most versatile tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award from the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation program will help the Department of Chemistry
of New Mexico State University to acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. The
areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include: 1)
Dynamics of Charge Localization in Photocatalyst Complexes 2) Synthetic Peptides
and Organic Sulfur and Selenium Molecules 3) Synthetic Applications of Electron
Deficient Nitrogen Intermediates 4) Generation and Reactions of Chemoselective
Nitrenes 5) In-Situ Characterization of Modified Electrode Surfaces 6) Studies
in the Conformational Changes in the Respiratory Protein, Hemerythrin.
