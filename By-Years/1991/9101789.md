This project provides funds to support participation of scientists from U.S.
research institutions in the XVIIth International Conference on the Physics of
Electronic and Atomic Collisions (ICPEAC) to be held in Brisbane, Australia,
July 10- 16, 1991. Applications for support are solicited and evaluated by a
committee composed of U.S. members of the ICPEAC General Committee. Particular
attention is given to applications from students and from scientists who do not
have major research support from which they could obtain the necessary travel
funds. This biennial conference deals with two-body interactions between ions,
atoms, molecules, electrons, positrons and photons, and with interaction
energies ranging from subthermal to millions of electron volts. The subject
matter relates both to fundamental physics, and to technologically significant
issues.
