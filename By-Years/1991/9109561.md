The main objective of this project is to collect and analyze primary data to
investigate gender differences in the tenure patterns of academic economists
over the last two decades. Academic success, and the underlying mechanisms
through which it is achieved, is significant because of the value of
understanding employment in a well-defined labor market which requires immense
investments in human capital and is dominated by long-term contracts. Employers
and employees have heterogeneous characteristics, thus both engage in search to
obtain or continue job-worker matchings. Given the recent focus of critical
public debate on the state of the educational system and its role in future
productivity gains, understanding the role of gender differences in academic
labor markets is of great consequence. This project documents differences in the
promotion process by measuring differences in the distribution by gender across:
(1) fields of specialization; (2) ranks of employing and degree- granting
academic institutions; and (3) publications patterns (by rank of journal, type
of publication, and co-authorship patterns) and, second, analysis of data on
mentoring, networking, and collaborating, all of which are frequently suggested
to be important contributors to academic success. New data on interrupted labor
supply due to family responsibilities will be collected for women. The planning
period would be used to (1) determine availability and cost of collecting data
to define an appropriate sample; (2) design, test, and evaluate a trial survey
instrument for data on interrupted labor supply; and (3) prepare a NSF grant
proposal.
