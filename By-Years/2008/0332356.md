FHWA / NSF Workshop on Imaging and Simulation of&lt;br/&gt;Concrete Structure
(Nano to Mesoscale)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There
have been a number of recent developments in the state of the art of digital
imaging and computational methods in the field of concrete and asphalt materials
science. The advancement of these areas is largely due to the novel application
of digital imaging techniques (i.e. synchrotron microtomography, crack
tomography) to the study of infrastructure materials, and to the rapid increase
in computer processor capacity and availability. This computational power has
facilitated the advancement of a number of computational techniques (i.e. damage
mechahnics, micromechanics, stochastic simulation) that were unavailable a few
years ago. Both the experimental and computational techniques have matured to
the point where a cohesive research plan would be beneficial to the academic
community as the methods continue to develop and become interdependent. This
workshop will provide a forum for the leaders in these research areas to meet
and discuss recent advancements as well as to provide a forum to discuss
appropriate goals for the further development of this
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
