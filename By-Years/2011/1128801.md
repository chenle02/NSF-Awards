Accurate and reliable, high-resolution seafloor bathymetry is essential to many
aspects of oceanographic research. Global bathymetry is also used in many areas
outside of the scientific community including: K-1 teaching of earth science and
seafloor geography; undergraduate-level earth science and plate tectonics; law
of the sea; US Naval operations; mineral exploration&amp;#894; planning of
fiber-optic cable routing and general interest by the public. The global
bathymetry map derived from satellite gravity by Sandwell?s group is now so
widely used that it has become the public ?face of the deep? displayed by Google
Earth. Over the next 3 to 5 years, a wealth of new marine gravity data will be
provided by three currently operating satellite altimeters CryoSat, Jason-1, and
Envisat. This project has the aim of using the new data to improve the accuracy
of the global marine gravity field by at least a factor of two and in some areas
a factor of four. Given the very wide use of satellite-derived bathymetry, the
broader impacts of this work are both evident and profound.
