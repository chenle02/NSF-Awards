This Small business Technology Transfer Phase I project is to develop a novel
Fullerene-Silica hybrid material system that exhibits multiple functionalities
as part of a device heterostructure. The end goal is to develop a high-
performance scalable non-volatile memory using a gate stack including a silica-
fullerene double tunnel junction. The findings from this research work have the
potential to help overcome scaling roadblocks in a > 20B$ flash memory industry.
The tunneling barrier can be further modified to create beneficial resonant
tunneling effects that can boost the ratio of retention and program time. The
expected result from this Phase 1 project is the extension of geometrical and
voltage scaling of Flash memory by using engineered fullerene molecules in the
gate stack. A quantitative model will be built for design optimization in terms
of memory characteristics.
