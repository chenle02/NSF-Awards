The purpose of this proposal is to develop methods that use observations about
consumer demands to infer properties of consumer preferences. These new methods
will require fewer restrictions on the structure of consumer preferences and
their utility representations than previous studies have imposed. This research
is important because the use of these new approaches will allow researchers to
avoid assumptions beyond those directly implied by economic theory and,
consequently, to avoid errors that result when models entail possible
misspecifications. The project will consider consumers' choices from finite sets
of alternatives. For example, from observations on consumer's choices among
various means of transportation, it will be possible to study and infer the
utility they attach to various attributes, such as time and cost, of alternative
means of transportation. In contrast to previous studies, the utility functions
and their distribution in the consumer population need to satisfy only weak
conditions.
