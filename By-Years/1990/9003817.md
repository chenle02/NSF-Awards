The synthesis of phosphatidylcholine in plants has been thought to occur
primarily through phosphorylation of choline, followed by conversion to
CDPcholine, and then transfer of a phosphatidate group to the choline to give
the final lipid product. An alternate pathway has been proposed which involves
three sequential methylations, utilizing S- adenosyl-L-methionine, of the amino
group of phosphatidylethanolamine. Recent research has indicated that in some
tissues, such as castor bean endosperm, the choline produced from a commonly
assumed precursor, L-serine, may not be available for phosphatidylcholine
synthesis. In addition, evidence now is available that in several tissues
phosphatidylethanolamine does not act as a substrate for methylation, unlike the
case in yeast and mammalian tissues. Thus, either plants differ in some respects
from yeast and mammalian systems in the exact pathways of methylation and their
regulation, or some aspects of the methylation scheme have not been detected and
examined in these other systems. The goals of this proposal are to examine these
newly described initial methylation enzymes in detail, to try to determine a
source of choline for the nucleotide (CDP- derivative) pathway (and for
regulation of the functioning of the methylation pathway), and to continue our
investigations into the enzymes of the nucleotide pathway. We will characterize
the methylation enzymes, work on their purifications, and test for regulation
through allosteric and/or membrane-enzyme interactions as well as
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Various plant organs, particularly leaves and
roots, will be tested for a capacity to synthesize and export choline or
choline-P. Phospholipids are important components of membranes of all living
organisms. They play crucial structural and metabolic role; yet their pathways
of synthesis are incompletely known, especially in plants. This project affords
the opportunity to elucidate important pathways of phospholipid synthesis and
regulation in a model plant system.***//
