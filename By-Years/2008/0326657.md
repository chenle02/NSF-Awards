Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CMS 0326657&lt;br/&gt;J. Qu&lt;br/&gt;Georgia
Tech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for US
participation at the International Symposium on Macro- to Nano-mechanics of
Materials - an area very essential and timely for the engineering mechanics
communities to make use of modern technologies in mechanics and materials.
Topics such as designer's materials, nano particles, thin-films, smart
materials, bio-materials, nanomechanics are to be included. The Symposium site
is located at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. &lt;br/&gt;
