The objective of this project is to develop a continuous production
manufacturing process for folding flat sheets into complex three dimensions
patterns that uses a novel material flow based upon mathematical symmetry. The
investigation will involve machine design and construction, and a careful
analysis of the mathematical theory of the material folding mechanisms. Previous
exploratory research has demonstrated that metal, polymer and paper sheets can
folded into doubly periodic surfaces by folding techniques alone, and
established the matematical theory to explain the folding process for one class
of DPFs and to extend these methods into practical algorithms describing the
explicit facet geometry and vertex locations. The focus of this project is to
describe mathematically how the material transforms into the intricate three
dimensions patterns inside the main roller system of the machine, complete with
the knowledge of the migration and instating of fold creases, to enable us to
streamline the manufacturing process for rapid and high quality production of
these versatile folded structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The interdisciplinary
effort linking mathematics and engineering will benefit education in both areas
with numerous opportunities for advancement of manufacturing integration and
applied mathematics exploration. &lt;br/&gt;
