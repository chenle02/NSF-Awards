This project investigates a number of topics concerned with high performance
algorithms, with particular (but not exclusive) emphasis on parallelism.
Specific topics include: (1) The design of optimal speed up algorithms from
PRAMs. (2) Models of computation that capture critical features of real parallel
machines. (3) The design of efficient algorithms in these new and emerging
models. (4) Data structures and information representation for algorithms in
general, both sequential and parallel.
