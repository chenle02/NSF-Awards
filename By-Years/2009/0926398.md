The project develops a portable training model that school districts can
implement themselves in order to train teachers on using the customization
service to plan and augment their classroom instruction. The project will use
Denver Public School teachers and professional development personnel in the
design and provision of this training. A mixed-method study protocol is used
that combines passive data collection via instrumentation with both quantitative
and qualitative research methods. The customization service is instrumented to
collect detailed data on teachers' use of system features and NSDL resources.
The use of the customization service helps teachers to increase their use of
NSDL resources and to develop their pedagogical knowledge and skills for: 1)
identifying appropriate NSDL resources for classroom use, 2) evaluating the
utility of resources for improving student engagement, and 3) evaluating the
utility of resources for addressing specific learner needs (customizing for
knowledge, skills and interest).
