Support is provided for the Committee on Ground Failure Hazards Mitigation
Research organized by the National Research Council in 1983. The Committee's
tasks are to: define nationwide research needs and priorities in ground failure
hazard mitigation research, assist in coordination of research activities,
develop mechanisms for communication within the research community and user
community in order to accelerate the application of improved technologies for
mitigating ground failure hazards, and facilitate the exchange of information
between the United States scientific and technical community and counterpart
communities in other countries.
