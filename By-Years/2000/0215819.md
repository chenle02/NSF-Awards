This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project will develop a
novel microchip chemical analyzer that incorporates a new nanomaterial that
performs both separation and detection of small quantities of chemicals and
biochemicals. Phase I demonstrated feasibility by incorporating a proprietary
nanomaterial in 20- by 50-micron channels etched in a glass microchip and
performing chemical separation and surface-enhanced Raman spectral analysis of
several test chemicals. Phase II will complete development of the microchip
chemical analyzer by designing reproducible plastic microchip cards that fit
into an integrated micro-fluidics and Raman system. Development will include the
following chemicals: p-aminobenzoic acid, phenyl acetylene, adenine,
acetaminophen, secobarbitol, cocaine, and related
metabolites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The microchip analyzer will have broad
commercial value to the agricultural, biotech, chemical agents, environmental,
medical and pharmaceutical industries. Specifically, the microchip is being
designed to measure drugs and metabolites in body fluids to aid clinical trials
of new drugs, assist dosage control of chemotherapeutic drugs, and diagnose drug
overdose.&lt;br/&gt;
