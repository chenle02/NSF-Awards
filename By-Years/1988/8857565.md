This research by a Presidential Young Investigator is focused on the mechanics
of suspensions, polymer solutions, and other flows involving a material with
interior microstructure. The research is both theoretical and experimental.
Methods will be utilized which come from the diverse fields of fluid dynamics as
well as statistical physics. The hydrodynamic influence on internal material
structures, such as suspended particles, oriented polymer molecules, or bubbles,
will be investigated.
