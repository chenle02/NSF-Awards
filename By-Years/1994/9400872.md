9400872 Larusson The research entails applying elements of function theory in
several complex variables combined with Hodge theory to investigate the
geometric and convexity properties of covering spaces of complex manifolds.
Also, the existence of bounded holomorphic functions on Riemann surfaces with a
large group of automorphisms will be investigated. The research has potential
applications to other areas of mathematics including algebraic geometry and
number theory. ***
