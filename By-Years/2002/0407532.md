0407532&lt;br/&gt;Rose&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one-year award will support a
dissertation enhancement project of Matthew Fleenor, a student in the Department
of Physics and Astronomy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He
will work with Professor Marinus van de Weygaert at the Kapteyn Astronomical
Institute at the University of Gronigen and Prof. Melanie Johnston-Hollitt at
Leiden Observatory, University of Leiden, both in The Netherlands.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Fleenor's research will probe the dynamical and
morphological characteristics of the Horologium-Reticulum Supercluster (HRS) to
evaluate whether the hierarchical merging picture of structure formation
accurately predicts the variety and kinematics of substructures present. Mr.
Fleenor will benefit from training by experts in related fields: i) the
integration of non-optical (particularly radio) observations as a means of
interpreting the dynamic and kinematic state of localized regions, and ii) the
comparison of the observational datasets with cosmological-scale computer
simulations. &lt;br/&gt;
