DMS-9985994 Fintushel/Wolfson

This award will provide support for featured speakers and graduate students to
attend the 2000 Great Lakes Geometry Conference. The objective of the conference
is to describe recent advances in the areas of geometric analysis,
4-dimensionsal topology, and enumerative algebraic geometry. This will be the
second year of the conference, which is a collaborative effort of the geometers
and topologists at the University of Wisconsin and Michigan State University. An
additional goal of the conference is to bring together at the conference a large
number of graduate students in geometry and topology from throughout the
midwest.
