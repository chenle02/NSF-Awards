9732302 Bachas The University of Kentucky will continue a Research Experience
for Undergraduates (REU) site in its Center for Membrane Sciences. Undergraduate
students will be recruited from Kentucky colleges and universities that serve
the economically underprivileged Appalachian regions of the state. Students will
participate in research addressing various aspects of polymeric membrane
materials and thin films. In addition, REU participants will attend weekly
seminars and will participate in regional undergraduate research conferences.
%%% The REU site, with a regional focus whereby undergraduates will be recruited
from the state of Kentucky, will provide a research experience on an emerging
technology to students who would not normally have access to a research
environment. ***
