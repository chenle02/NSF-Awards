This research is on the basic behavior of HgTe-CdTe. The HgTe-CdTe superlattice
is a new microstructure which has recently been made by molecular beam epitaxy
(MBE). Initial theory and experiment indicate that it has unusual fundamental
properties such as a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition and two-dimensional
behavior. The structure is also expected to be useful as an infrared detector,
with advantages over the widely used alloy HgCdTe. Infrared (5-400 cm)
spectroscopy and magnetospectroscopy will be used to probe fundamental band
structure, transport, and optical properties. A metalorganic chemical vapor
deposition (MOCVD) supperlattice growth process will be initiated and
structural, middle infrared, and dc measurements will be carried out to
characterize HgTe-CdTe as a detector material.
