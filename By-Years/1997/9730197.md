The aim of this research is to develop statistical models for the analysis of
subjective experience data as obtained in self-report, ecological momentary
assessment, and experience sampling studies. The purpose of these studies is to
investigate emotions, cognitions, or behavior over time within the context of a
person's everyday routine. The measurement of subjective experiences as they
unfold over time in relation to actual occurrences of events raises a variety of
fundamental modeling issues that will be addressed by this research. The
investigator will develop autoregressive random coefficient models for
multivariate discrete-valued data. These models will be used to investigate (a)
how subjective experiences (e.g., pleasant and unpleasant emotions) interact
over time, and (b) how individual differences (e.g., personality traits)
moderate interactions among subjective experiences. These applications will be
instrumental for developing and testing psychological theories about the
temporal nature of subjective experiences.
