Jekell 9418223 The object of this proposal is to study thoroughly the
determination of geoid profiles as well as vertical gravity gradients based on
airborne vector gravimetry (specifically, derived from measurements of the
horizontal gravity components) using a combination of satellite and inertial
positioning instrumentation. This investigation will be accomplished using
statistical error analyses and evaluations of existing and upcoming horizontall
gravity component data sources. The assessment will be a function of limitation
in instrumentation, surveying procedures, and data processing techniques and
will be aimed at demonstrating the suitability of airborne vector gravimetry for
a multitude of geodetic, geophysical, and geologic applications that would
benefit from improved geoid and vertical gradient information. ****
