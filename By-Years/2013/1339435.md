The goal of the project is to develop an industrial engineering curriculum that
provides students with multiple exposures to sustainability concepts in order to
develop both the passion and the skills to integrate industrial engineering
tools and methods with sustainable practices. The project team is revising
undergraduate core industrial engineering courses to add an emphasis on
environmental and social consciousness and sustainable practices, identifying
critical issues in sustainable development that will be integrated into the
curriculum, developing modules containing new learning material and case studies
customized to fit within each industrial engineering course, and developing a
new stand-alone course on sustainable development. The evaluation effort, under
the leadership of a university-wide evaluation unit, is using student and
faculty surveys, focus groups, and assessments of student products to monitor
progress. Dissemination is being accomplished through website postings,
conference papers, journal articles, and faculty development workshops. Broader
impacts include the dissemination of the instructional material and graduates
that have a social and environmental awareness and the skills to contribute to a
more sustainable future.
