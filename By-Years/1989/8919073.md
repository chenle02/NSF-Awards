A versatile high-resolution atom-probe field ion microscope with special
features for in situ experiments which are not available on commercial
instruments will be fabricated. The in situ features are: (a) vapor deposition;
(b) ion irradiation or implantation; (c) oxidation of metals to create metal
oxides -- i.e., metal oxide/metal interfaces; (d) electron irradiation of metal
oxides to create point defects via electronic mechanisms; and (e) pulsed laser
desorption. A group of four primary researchers will undertake research problems
centered on the question of the relationship of chemical composition to the
structure of an interface on a nanometer to subnanometer scale (&lt;1 nm).
