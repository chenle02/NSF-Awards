Traditionally, access controls have been used to restrict users to limited views
of available data. Although early access control models were devised for
structured data, they are being extended to deal with XML data. Access controls,
however, are not always sufficient to secure complex information environments.
Threats may come, for example, from incorrect categorization of information or
users, derivation of inferences from legally obtained data, unauthorized
exchanges of information between users, and combining data obtained from
different internal sources.

This proposal will use a complementary approach to current access control
mechanisms based on checking data not before they are extracted from data
sources, but when they are released across a gate representing a critical
security boundary. The checking process is not based simply on
source/destination addresses as in current firewall systems, or on simple
``dirty word'' matching as in current filtering software, but on a deeper
content analysis based on release constraints.

In order to achieve this objective, a comprehensive framework is required that
takes into account the different formats outgoing data can have, the complexity
and diversity of release control rules, and the necessary support for the
security officers in the definition and management of these rules. A major
characteristic of this approach to separate the specification of critical data,
called the controlled items, from the way it is matched against any outgoing
information. Technical problems involved in the definition of such a framework
include (i) the specification of appropriate formalisms to represent controlled
items and matching rules, (ii) the automatic derivation of controlled items from
access control rules and their integration with controlled items provided by
security officers, (iii) the computation of complete and minimal representation
of controlled items and matching rules, and (iv) the design of efficient
matching algorithms that are capable of dealing with different matching rules
and data formats.
