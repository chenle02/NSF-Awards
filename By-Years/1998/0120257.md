A recent analysis of data acquired viewing the Earth limb edge-on from the space
shuttle has demonstrated that the present model of the nightglow emission is
incomplete. The observations were made by the Arizona Airglow Experiment (GLO).
It uses a new technique referred to as "hyperspectral imaging" in which vertical
profiles of all of the prominent nightglow emissions are recorded
simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests support to continue
the analysis of archival data with the main purpose of providing a more
appropriate nightglow model. A review of all present model parameters will be
undertaken. That will be followed by static and finally dynamic representations
of nightglow condition. The GLO data archive is extensive. Many conditions have
been observed that will be used to constrain the model process.
