Could condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration exerts a profound influence on
the earth's atmosphere by directly affecting cloud albedo. As a first step
toward developing the needed parameterization of cloud microphysics for global
questions such as the effect of marine aerosol or air pollution on cloud albedo,
it is essential to test the internal consistency which must exist between
aerosol microphysics, nucleation theory, and direct measurements of CCN
concentrations. The objective of this planning grant is to develop the protocol
for such a test. The planning period will be used to investigate and evaluate
such topics as: experimental verification of the relationship between size,
composition, and CCN concentration for particles containing mixtures of
insoluble material, soluble salts, and organic compounds; measurement of droplet
growth rates in supersaturated environments, including the effects of organic
films; comparisons between nuclei activated in CCN counters and nuclei which
have been activated in real clouds. Sensitivities required in the measurements
will be modelled and compared with typical instrumental accuracies.
