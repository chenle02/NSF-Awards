This project was designed to introduce the use of the Fourier transform infrared
technique into all levels of the chemistry program at the institution . Through
the project, a Fourier transform Infrared Spectrometer was purchased and is used
for the identification, analysis, kinetics, and the teaching of molecular
dynamics. The system introduces students to the use of computer integrated
instrumentation, database searching, and computer- assisted data manipulation. A
number of new experiments have been included in junior and senior level
laboratory courses. FTIR has improved the content of laboratory courses in
General Chemistry as well as in Organic, Analytical, Physical, and Biochemistry.
It has made possible the integration of Physical Chemistry with Instrumental
Analysis. In addition, it has complemented ongoing research projects and opened
up new avenues of research at time when the department was encouraging
independent study by juniors and seniors. The acquisition of the instrumentation
is helping the department meet its goals of requiring independent research for
all undergraduate chemistry majors, and reaccreditation by the American Chemical
Society. The institution has contributed to the project in an amount equal to
the NSF funds.
