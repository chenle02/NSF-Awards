This project focuses on problems at the interface of algebraic geometry and
number theory, concerning connections between global geometric invariants of
algebraic varieties and rational points. Among specific problems to be addressed
are: effective computations of Brauer-Manin obstructions on K3 surfaces, the
study of potential density of rational and integral points on higher-dimensional
varieties over number fields and function fields, and the study of their
asymptotic distribution. One of the key issues is the investigation of rational
curves on these varieties and their deformations.

Arithmetic geometry studies integral solutions of polynomial equations in
several variables with integral coefficients from a geometric point of few. One
of the simplest questions is: find rectangular triangles with all three sides
integers. This leads to the study of rational points on a circle of radius 1.
Higher-dimensional geometric objects display a very high degree of complexity;
finding and describing rational points on them poses tremendous theoretical and
computational challenges. Advances in arithmetic geometry have important
applications in the area of information transmission and storage, cryptography
and graph theory.
