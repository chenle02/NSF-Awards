Direct Extremum Control (DEC) is a useful tool for analyzing model algorithms
in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The purpose of this research is to
investigate the feasibility of using DEC as a component in designing and
analyzing practical algorithms for large-scale CFD computations. Particular
attention will be given to the development of a multi-dimensional version of
DEC.
