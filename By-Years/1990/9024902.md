Drs. Patrick Thaddeus and Carl Gottlieb will continue a program of laboratory
astrophysical research on reactive molecules that are constituents of
interstellar gas and circumstellar shells. They will carry out spectroscopy of
carbenes, carbon-chain and other new radicals, silicon molecules, metal
carbides, and of the vibrationally excited states and isotopically substituted
species of known reactive molecules. The investigation will be made with an
improved nonresonant double-pass millimeter-wave spectrometer. The whole subject
of reactive molecules of astrophysical interest is in a period of explosive
growth. Building on recent detections of SiC, SiCC, highly vibrationally excited
SiO, and the cumulene carbenes H2CCC and H2CCCC, the investigation will
emphasize surveys of discharges about 50 GHz wide in frequency. From initial
surveys made in this laboratory, many new reactive species are expected. There
are also plans to extend the range of the spectrometer farther into the far
infrared and to construct a nonresonant multipass spectrometer which may result
in a significant increase in sensitivity.
