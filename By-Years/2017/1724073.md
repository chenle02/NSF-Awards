This award will support student attendance at the 32nd Annual Computational
Complexity Conference (CCC), in Riga, Latvia, July 6 to 9, 2017. The field of
computational complexity forms the backbone of theoretical computer science. The
conference aims to foster research in all areas of computational complexity
theory, studying the absolute and relative power of computational models under
resource constraints. The search for efficient algorithms has important
ramifications in many areas of business, technology, and science. Complexity
theory has helped with our understanding of fundamental difficulty underlying
algorithmic issues and in turn has been able to motivate algorithm design for
some of the most challenging computational problems.

This award will provide partial support to approximately 10 students to attend
this top conference in the area of complexity theory. Efforts will be made to
support students from under-represented groups and geographic diversity among
students will be taken into account. The award will encourage and facilitate the
student participation in this top-tier computer science conference. It will
contribute towards attracting more under-represented groups to computer science
research giving students an opportunity to engage in the important technical,
professional, and social ex-changes that CCC fosters.
