This work is concerned with designing an experimental prototype for a robot
sensor-based navigation system for an arm manipulator operating in an
environment with unknown obstacles. The motion planning part of the system will
be based on the algorithms of dynamic path planning (DPP). The sensor system of
the arm manipulator consists of dozens of active infra-red proximity sensors
covering the whole body of the arm. This forms a kind of aura similar to that
provided by the hairs on the leg of an insect. Within the radius of its
sensitivity, the sensor system allows the arm to feel the obstacle it is
approaching, to identify which points of its body are the closest to the
obstacle, and to use this information to maneuver around the obstacle. The work
on the sensory modules is already underway; the first results indicate that the
system can be made sufficiently sensitive and immune to the variation in object
reflectivity and ambient lighting. The proposed work covers a period of three
years and consists of the development of the multi-sensor "skin" of the arm,
including its control scheme, integration of the sensor and the motion planning
subsystems, and extensive experimental work on the arm motion planning.
