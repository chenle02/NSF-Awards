9711186 Ozgokman This project is to conduct a numerical study of the Gulf Stream
separation. The objective is to explore the joint dynamics of the separation
mechanisms and to investigate how the stability of the Gulf Stream separation is
achieved. This will be done by progressively incorporating different mechanisms
and analyzing their cumulative impact on the Gulf Stream separation.
