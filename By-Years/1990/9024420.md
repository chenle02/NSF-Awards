This award from the Office of Special Projects will enable the participation of
seven distinguished U.S. chemists in the International Conference on Chemical
Science in Development which will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the
Institute of Chemistry, Ceylon and which will be held May 14-18, 1991 in
Colombo, Sri Lanka. The conference will deal with both academic and applied
aspects of inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry. Chemistry has an
important role to play in underdevloped and developing countries. Problems of
food, clothing, shelter and health are frequently at the fore in such countries.
Chemical sciences and industries play a major role in attacking problems in all
of these areas. Sri Lanka already has developed a tradition in chemistry. This
special symposium will bring together and foster interactions among scientists
from many countries in the region.
