This project will supply shipboard scientific support equipment for the research
vessel RIDGELY WARFIELD, operated by the Johns Hopkins University, Chesapeake
Bay Institute, and dedicated to use in support of ocean science research. The
Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment
deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. This
Program provides support for such items as deck equipment including winch
systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational
equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point
the location of research sites, communication equipment including radio
transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data
communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting
scientists to and from data retrieval sites. The Project Directors, Dr. James D.
Ebert and Bruce K. Cornwall are fully qualified to direct this project having
had considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of
shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution to install a block
for improved CTD wire monitoring, and a new radar to replace an obsolete and
defective one.
