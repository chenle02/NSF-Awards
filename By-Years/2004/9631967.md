9631967 Walker This work will involve the molecular cloning and characterization
of the R-mb complex of maize. The organization of the complex as a whole will be
determined through the production of derivatives of the R-mb complex that have
lost one or more genes through unequal crossing over. The number, identity and
expression of each individual gene of the complex will be determined. The
specific regions of the complex involved in paramutagenicity will be determined
and a more limited structural characterization of a diverse collection of R
geographic alleles will be made. Undergraduate students will be introduced to
basic biological research by working on the described projects. %%% Epigenetic
inheritance, nuclear inheritance that is not based on DNA sequence, has been
recognized in all of the eukaryotic kingdoms. To approach the question of why
certain genes are subject to epigenetic regulation while others are not, the
structures/sequences of epigenetically regulated genes must be determined. The R
paramutation system of corn is ideal for an analysis of this phenomenon because
the important components have been localized to the R locus itself and there are
a diverse set of alleles with different phenotypes available. Detailed
structural analysis of the paramutable R-r complex suggest that a small region
of only about two kilobases out of 200 kb is involved in the paramutation
process. ***
