This award provides funding for the Canada-US summer (Centre de Recherches
Mathématique) school on "Spectral theory and applications," to be held at
Université Laval, in Québec City, CA from July 4 to July 14,
2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in
Analysis, especially in the fields of elliptic differential equations, quantum
mechanics, and computational spectral theory. A number of distinguished
mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference. The award
gives early career researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented
groups, researchers not funded by NSF a chance to attend and participate in this
conference. The organizing committee will strive to make this funding
opportunity known to target groups through a number of different activities.
