This project studies public support for democracy in Germany as democratic
institutions spread throughout the recently reuni- ted country. It constitutes
the first nation-wide opinion survey conducted after the December, 1990, all-
German elections. These data will be combined with data from surveys in March,
1990, and from the late 1940s to estimate and assess a model of deter- minants
of pro-democratic attitudes. Some factors whose impact will be assessed are the
political structure of opposition parties, historical factors, indirect
influences from West to East, economics, political socialization, and
nationalist or neutralist sentiments. Data collection will be by the Institut
fur Demoskopie, and the project involves a high degree of coop- eration between
American and German social scientists.
