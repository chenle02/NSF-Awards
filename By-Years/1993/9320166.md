9320166 Davis Engineers sometimes claim that their status as employees denies
them the autonomy necessary to be true professionals. The purpose of this
research is to provide a framework for answering the question whether and when
engineers have enough autonomy in the workplace to act as professionals. To
provide this framework, the research will bring recent philosophical analysis of
moral autonomy to bear on the question of professional autonomy, will draw
relevant material from earlier work on the autonomy of engineers in the
workplace to examine the conditions for professional autonomy there, and will
sketch programs of empirical research that might build on these results to
answer questions about the actual professional autonomy of engineers. The
research aims to develop a position on professions and autonomy that can pass
three tests: It must be consistent with working in a large organization; it must
be empirically testable: and it must be useful in evaluating whether different
kinds of work organization will impede or enhance professional autonomy. This
research contributes to three fields, the sociology of engineering, the
philosophy of professions, and engineering ethics. A better developed conception
of professional autonomy may help with other practical questions in the ethics
of engineering and science. Current conceptions of moral autonomy applied to the
workplace do not help us to understand either the moral implications of
professional constraints or the general consistency of corporate organization
and professional responsibility. Because the proposed project would help us to
understand engineers in context, it should contribute as well to overall
understanding of what engineers do. Results will be disseminated through
presentations and articles. ***
