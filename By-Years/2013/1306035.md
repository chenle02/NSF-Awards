Objective: The objectives of this program are to investigate fiber lasers that
support new pulse evolutions in their cavities, and to use the knowledge gained
to demonstrate practical instruments with unprecedented
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit is
in understanding of new nonlinear waves. The field of ultrafast science has been
built on lasers based on formation of solitons, pulses that balance phase shifts
with anomalous group-velocity dispersion. In the last few years, pulse-shaping
based on nonlinear gain and loss, in normal-dispersion media, has been
introduced. This approach is transformative as it counters two decades of
conventional wisdom regarding the generation of light pulses. Lasers with self-
similar propagation of light pulses in their gain media exhibit new phenomena,
such as the existence of local nonlinear attraction in a laser. The self-similar
evolution opens new routes to lasers with very low noise and to lasers that
generate pulses that contain only a few cycles of
light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impacts are the
demonstration of useful (and eventually commercial) instruments with new
capabilities for energetic, ultra-short light pulses. These instruments will
expand the field of ultra-fast science and will bring short-pulse capabilities
to new arenas such as medical clinics. Students will gain experience ranging
from theory and numerical simulations to technical aspects of fiber optics and
knowledge of applications of ultra-short light pulses. The research on fiber
lasers will be coupled to undergraduate and graduate laboratories. Participation
in activities sponsored by 4-H will expose rural students to science and
technology.
