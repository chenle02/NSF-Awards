This project addresses issues of fundamental reform in the physical chemistry
curriculum via advanced integration of liquid- and solid-state nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) experiments. A comprehensive suite of NMR laboratory exercises
(initially targeted within the physical chemistry laboratory) builds in level of
sophistication from simple liquid-state measurements through static, magic-angle
spinning (MAS), and cross-polarization MAS solid-state experiments. Alone, or in
concert, these experiments provide multiple layers of instructional merit from
basic structural characterization to important physical chemistry concepts.
Since not all instructional programs have solid-state NMR capabilities, we
develop and market schematics and construction materials for a low-cost ($2500)
static 2H probe that is compatible with existing liquid-state spectrometers.
Deuterium NMR line shapes are sensitive to molecular motion and serve as
excellent instructional aids for topics such as methyl rotors. For educational
materials we include fully supported multimedia presentations of the basic
concepts of liquid- and solid-state NMR and complete step-by-step instructions
for each experimental exercise. We use the assessment strategies developed and
supported by the Penn State Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching to
gauge the strengths and weaknesses of these tools. In terms of intellectually
merited outcomes, we provide an integrated series of authentic experiences,
using NMR as a unifying theme, connecting theory, concepts, and research. More
broadly, tools are designed for vertical integration into organic and
instrumental analysis courses at PSU. Additionally, during this initial phase,
we seek partner institutions to implement the material during future full-scale
development.
