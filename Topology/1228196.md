Abstract

Award: DMS 1228196, Principal Investigator: Matthew Ando

This project will support travel to the conference "Strings and automorphic
forms in algebraic topology" at the University of Bochum in August 2012. The
title refers to the intersection between string theory, number theory, and
homotopy theory which began with the study of elliptic cohomology in the 1980s.
In the last ten years the areas of significant progress have broadened
considerably, involving many new research topics. For example, Behrens and
Lawson have introduced generalizations of topological modular forms, using the
Shimura varieties which play an important role in the Langlands conjecture. For
another, the spectacular progress in higher category has led to a much better
understanding of quantum field theory and the String 2-group, which are
intimately but still mysteriously related to the geometry of elliptic
cohomology. The conference will bring together researchers and graduate students
working in these areas, to facilitate the sharing of results, the establishment
of new collaborations, and the training of the next generation of researchers in
this area.

The roots of the fields which this conference brings together--String theory,
number theory, and algebraic topology--are far apart, and their interaction via
elliptic cohomology has, in the best tradition of interdisciplinary research,
led to spectacular advances in algebraic topology in the last twenty-five years.
One of the appealing features of the subject is that it consistently attracts
excellent new researchers from different areas of mathematics and physics, and
those new researchers bring exciting new points of view. In the last five years,
some of the exciting emerging research teams are based in Europe. The conference
will bring together current leaders and new researchers, enabling interaction
and cross-fertilization of ideas among a broad group of mathematicians. The
project will support travel and participation by US-based mathematicians,
especially graduate students and recent PhDs, to help them become involved in
this exciting area of research.
