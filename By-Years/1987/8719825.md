The proposed research is concerned with both optimal design and optimal control
of networks of queues. A major theme is the development of models for systems
that do not meet the criteria for product-form probabilities, in particular, for
systems in which buffer capacities are finite and/or service-time distributions
are neither exponentially distributed nor independent from one queue to another.
Research on optimal design and control of networks of queues is in its infancy.
The analytical and numerical difficulties are formidable. Building on the
Principal Investigators previous research, a primary focus of this work will be
on efficient numerical computations, approximate solutions, and the evaluation
of sub-optimal design and control schemes of a simple form. Queueing networks
exist in manufacturing, computer/communications, traffic flow, and multi-level
logistics systems. This research relates directly to the design and control of
such systems.
