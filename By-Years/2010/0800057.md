This grant provides funding for the investigation of theory and computational
strategies for solving dense mixed integer programming (MIP) problems. Prior
work has focused on sparse MIP problems, but in many applications of MIP
technology, the MIP models are often dense. The research will investigate the
facial structure of the independent set polytope via the construction of high-
dimensional conflict hypergraphs. Specifically, various structures such as
hyper-cliques, hyper-odd holes, hyper-odd antiholes, hyper-webs and hyper-
antiwebs will be identified on the conflict hypergraph, and valid inequalities
and facet-defining properties will be derived. To investigate the complexity,
there will be an analysis on the ranks of the cutting planes associated with the
hypergraphical structures. For computational strategies, the research will
generalize a separation algorithm for identifying odd holes in hypergraphs,
develop fast heuristics for generating the hyper-cliques, and implement the
associated cutting planes within a parallel cutting plane and branch-and-cut
environment to gauge their effectiveness and performance.

If successful, the results of the research will advance the frontiers of
knowledge in integer programming in several areas. First, it will lead to
fundamental theoretical advances. Second, from a computational standpoint, it
will offer new directions of research related to separation strategies for
hypergraphic structures. The research will also have an impact in several
application areas. Dense MIP problems arise naturally in many medical
applications, including constrained discriminant analysis for medical diagnosis;
brachytherapy cancer treatment; and medical imaging. The ability to solve the
associated MIP problem instances will help to advance the medical frontiers. The
research will also lead to advances in finance and business, including market-
share problems, and the wide range of applications that involve classification
(constrained discrimination), such as credit lending prediction, market trends,
and consumer preference prediction.
