This research will explore a broad class of recursive robust estimation
procedures. Recursive procedures are important when it is too expensive to store
all of the previous data and when real-time estimates are required. Update
procedures can provide good approximate estimates at lower costs. The particular
problem to be investigated relates to abrupt changes in parameters of static or
dynamic models that arise in many areas. This type of problem is called jump,
failure, or fault detection in engineering and in quality control, and as
detection of model instability or change point analysis in statistics and
econometrics. Much of the past work assumes an underlying Gaussian distribution.
The principal investigator will explore more resistent recursive procedures.
