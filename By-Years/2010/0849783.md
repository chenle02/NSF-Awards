The College of Arts and Sciences (CAS), the School of Marine and Atmospheric
Sciences (SoMAS) and the Department of Technology and Society (DTS) at Stony
Brook University is to establish an S-STEM project, which over the four years of
support, is to provide scholarships for a minimum of 104 students.&lt;br/&gt;DTS
is to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the project. &lt;br/&gt;In
addition to the financial support the project is to make available to
participants a network of advising, mentoring and other academic support from
the extensive DTS support network (STEM Smart) that has been developed over more
than a decade. &lt;br/&gt;Students are to be selected through a competitive
application process from the pool of economically disadvantaged students that
apply to the university and advanced students who are already matriculated at
the university. &lt;br/&gt;A committee of representatives from the university
composed of members from the offices of admissions, financial aid and the
departments within CAS, SoMAS and DTS is to meet once a year to select
students.&lt;br/&gt;
