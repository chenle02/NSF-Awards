The research objective is to enable one to systematically design hierarchical
algorithms for data compression that outperform sequential data compression
algorithms. The methodology first involves finding hierarchical algorithms that
yield good theoretical performance in compressing sufficiently large data sets.
Then, computer experiments shall be performed in which hierarchical algorithms
selected on the basis of theory are tested versus sequential algorithms in
compressing archival test and image files. Hierarchical data compression
algorithms based on string rewriting systems, wavelets, and iterated function
systems shall be principally considered. This development of hierarchical data
compression theory and practice may have significant impact on the development
of personal communication technology.
