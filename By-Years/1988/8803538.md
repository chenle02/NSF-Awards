Theoretical models have been developed to predict thermal structure of
accretionary prisms, using boundary conditions largely determined from marine
investigations of modern examples. It is unclear if clements of the primary
thermal regime can be recognized in ancient accreted sediments. The aim of this
research is to determine whether the late Mesozoic Franciscan Complex of
California retains a primary accretionary thermal structure or whether the
thermal structure has been overprinted due to the passage of the Mendocino
triple junction or to other heating events. A program of vitrinite reflectance,
X-ray diffraction of clays, fluid inclusion geothermometry, stable isotopes and
fission-track measurements will be integrated with the results of detailed field
mapping of mesoscopic structural fabrics and vein geometries. These data will
provide important constraints on theoretical models for the thermal evolution of
accretionary complexes in general.
