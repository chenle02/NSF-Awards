ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project would work with teachers who are
involved in the RSI reform. It would provide professional development
opportunities to the teachers in the RSI schools, and would develop a
sustainable leadership component for the central Appalachian region. These
activities are strongly aligned with the goals of the RSI project. The
professional development offered to teachers would be heavily content-oriented,
with some pedagogical training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
