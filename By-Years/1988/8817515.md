The Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JOGFS) of the spring bloom in the North
Atlantic will begin in 1989. This study will be conducted along longitude 200W
from the beginning of April through August. The significance of this first U.S.
GOFS experiment revolves around the large biological signals in the plankton and
the hypothesized importance of these large signals to the overall yield of the
system. This is a Level-1 component of the U.S. contribution to JGOFS for the
measurement of primary production during the processes-oriented cruises of the
North Atlantic Experiment. Primary production measurements will be conducted in
situ, using metal-clean techniques.
