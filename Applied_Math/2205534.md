The project investigates optimal transportation of stochastic processes, that
is, how to relate probability measures (i.e., the laws of stochastic processes)
in a certain cost-optimal way. Amplified by computational advances, optimal
transport theory has become an indispensable tool for far-reaching applications
in non-parametric high dimensional statistics, image recognition, machine
learning and calibration problems in mathematical finance. The project will
advance research in the theory of optimal transport of stochastic processes. A
special emphasis will be placed on applications to mathematical finance, such as
martingale optimal transport and time-dynamic utility optimization problems. The
derived theory will lay the basis for advances of numerical routines and novel
indicators of model uncertainty, which will help to prepare decision-makers for
worst-case scenarios.

This project especially focuses on the adapted Wasserstein distance and entropic
regularization of optimal transport, which is the method of choice for computing
optimal transport problems in high dimensions. The first part of the project
investigates a convex duality result and a first-order approximation result for
time-dependent robust optimization problems and a characterization of their
worst-case optimizers. These results are then applied to quantify model
uncertainty in robust portfolio optimization and Davis pricing, machine learning
of time-dependent distributions and hedging in financial markets. For each of
these problems, closed-form expressions are derived and these are implemented
numerically. The second part of the project investigates stability of
Schroedinger potentials -- the dual optimizers of the entropic optimal transport
problem -- via a strong compactness result and approximation techniques.
Furthermore, necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of calibrated
martingale measures with finite entropy are derived on the basis of a reference
model and marginal distributions derived from market prices, as well as a
characterization of the optimizers of the martingale optimal transport problem
with entropic penalization.
