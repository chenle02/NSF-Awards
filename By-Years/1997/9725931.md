Research is proposed that can make an important contribution to the question:
Do neutrinos have mass? The answer to this question is important to our
understanding of our Sun and other stars, which are prolific emitters of
neutrinos, to cosmological questions about the existence of dark matter, thought
to make up must of the universe, and to particle physics in understanding the
relationship of the neutrino to other elementary particles. If neutrinos have
mass, the known three types of neutrinos can oscillate, one into another, given
enough time- depending on their energy. In this case the produced neutrinos have
sufficient time to oscillate, traveling 730 km. through the earth from Fermilab
to a detector equipped mine (Soudan) in Minnesota.
