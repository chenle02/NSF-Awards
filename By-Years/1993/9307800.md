This effort is to support various activities related to the National Center for
Education Statistics (NCES) Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System
(IPEDS) in order to promote data compatibility between agencies and improve the
quality of data. The NCES, IPEDS data will provide the National Science
Foundation (NSF), an essential portion of the statistics needed to give a
comprehensive base of knowledge on undergraduate education. IPEDS is a system by
which data are collected from all institutions and educational organizations
whose primary purpose is to provide postsecondary education. IPEDS collects much
of the information that is needed from baccalaureate or higher institutions, and
it is the only source of comprehensive data from two-year award institutions.
This current proposal will allow the Foundation to acquire at an early date,
edited detailed data for each postsecondary institution.
