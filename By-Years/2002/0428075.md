Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0428075&lt;br/&gt;Joel
Burdick&lt;br/&gt;Caltech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop basic
theory, algorithms, and experimental demonstrations of networks of autonomous
mobile sensory platforms. Mobile sensor units enable a sensor network to
transiently focus on events or locations that might be interesting or important
while at the same time maintaining awareness of the overall environment.
Particular focus on tasks where mobile sensory-motor platforms operate in human
environments and interact with human operators. The consideration for theory and
algorithms include: (1) use mobility to improve network performance; (2)
facilitate the interaction between sensor networks and humans; and (3) improve
the ability of networks to detect learned categories or events. New unsupervised
learning methods will form the basis for object and event detection. We will
demonstrate our methods on the Caltech Multi-Vehicle Wireless Testbed (MVWT), an
experimental testbed at Caltech consisting of fan-driven and wheeled vehicles
operating in a common environment endowed with a variety of sensors and
communication schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project supported under
the Sensors Initiative NSF 04-522.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
