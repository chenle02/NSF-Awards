9304674 Carter This is a project to adapt X-ray crystallographic phasing
methods based on the theoretical work of G. Bricogne and apply them to protein
structure determination. The immediate goal is to complete the structure of the
monoclinic form of tryptophane synthetase using maximum entropy extrapolation
and phase permutation to generate new phases and symmetrization by a known six-
fold noncrystallographic redundancy to refine them. The expectation is that
noncrystallographic symmetry averaging, together with techniques cited above
represent sufficient potential phase information to solve the structure ab
initio. %%% This proposal deals with advanced computational methods for solving
crystal structures using maximum entropy methods. In particular, these studies
involve the crystallographic phasing problem, especially involving deficient
data sets and may lead to eliminating the need for isomorphous replacement
methods. These methods will be applied to solve the structure of monoclinic
tryptophanyl-t-RNA synthetase. ***
