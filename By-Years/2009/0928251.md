The outputs from neuronal systems adapt following a change in a stimulus,
through a variety of mechanisms acting on different timescales. Many systems
show a rapid form of adaptation through which stimuli are encoded relative to
the context within which they were presented. This form of context-modulated
coding is ubiquitous through sensory and higher-level systems, and may support
the ability of the nervous system to efficiently encode complex natural stimuli.
Experiments have shown that this form of gain control occurs both in neural
systems and in single neurons in the cortex. On longer timescales, neural
systems show a decrease of activity after long exposure to a constant stimulus.
It is proposed that this behavior is a reflection of intrinsic neuronal dynamics
that may contribute to the efficient coding of the slowly-varying stimulus
envelope. This project will further develop the hypothesis that these slow
dynamics may reflect the system's ongoing estimate of the changing statistical
characteristics of the input. The mechanisms for these adaptive behaviors will
be pursued with a combination of theoretical analysis and simulation of
realistic neuronal models. The project's goal is to elucidate the mathematical
basis of fundamental neural mechanisms for the efficient encoding of time-
varying signals and reveal optimal strategies for sampling and representing
complex natural environments. This work examines neural coding mechanisms that
apply to multiple sensory and higher brain systems and will help to develop a
language and methodology that can translate across these areas. The
interdisciplinary nature of the work will provide training opportunities for
undergraduate and graduate students crossing over from mathematics and physics
to biology. The project includes the development of a summer course for advanced
high school students.
