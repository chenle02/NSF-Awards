This award is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Cluster in the
Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Division of Chemical,
Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Engineering Biology Research Consortium, or EBRC, aims to be the leading
organization bringing together an inclusive community committed to advancing
synthetic biology to address national and global needs. Synthetic biology
encompasses an important set of tools and technologies to continue to build and
strengthen the national bio-economy. EBRC supports and promotes the vision and
goals of the United State synthetic biology community by providing the future
vision for synthetic biology, bringing together industrial and research
communities, catalyzing leading-edge research and education programs. In
addition, EBRC is establishing training resources for synthetic biologists, and
promoting and engaging in dialogue about synthetic biology among policy makers
and other members of the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports the
development of a national-scale research roadmap for the field of synthetic
biology in the United States to ensure the nation's continued international
leadership in this critical area. Working with a diverse group of leading
academic and industrial scientists from across the country, EBRC is developing
and publishing a roadmap for the continued advancement of the field of
engineering biology, with a focus on technical developments over the next
decade. The project also addresses non-technical needs such as education and
training, that are required to continue to advance the scientific field and
ensure the nation's leadership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
