9512763 Bower This award provides three years of support for the annual
Computation and Neural Systems meeting. The meeting brings together experimental
and theoretical neurobiologists along with engineers, computer scientists,
cognitive scientists, physicists and mathematicians interested in understanding
how biological neural systems compute. Equal emphasis is placed on experimental,
model-based and more theoretical approaches to understanding neurobiological
computation. Speakers include both senior scientists as well as young
scientists. This meeting is an important venue for introducing new computational
techniques to the neuroscience community and for the formation of new
collaboration in this relatively new highly interdisciplinary field. This award
provides travel costs of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students and young
faculty without grant support. It is the creative energy of new young scientists
that will generate new theory in this field.
