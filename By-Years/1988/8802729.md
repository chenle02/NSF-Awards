This research is concerned with application level performance modeling of
parallel machines consisting of a large number of processing elements (PE's)
connected in some regular structure. The PE's may also have access to some
shared resources via a separate interconnection network. It is assumed that
disjoint portions of the PE network can be used simultaneously for solving
different subproblems. The modeling considers several important aspects of such
machines including contention for PE substructures, contention for shared
resources such as global memory, blocking due to data dependencies between
subproblems, synchronization delays between processes working on a single
subproblem, and some issues relating to the optimal design. The main goal of the
research is to develop practical techniques for designing and tuning large
parallel machines that are coming of age.
