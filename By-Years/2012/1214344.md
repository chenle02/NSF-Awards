This award funds the research activities of Professors K. Becker, M. Becker, and
E. Sezgin at Texas A&M University.

This research project addresses fundamental aspects of string theory and also
explores connections to other areas of physics such as high temperature
superconductivity. The first set of projects deals with string perturbation
theory and the construction of D-brane effective actions. The results of such
work could also be used to check the consistency of models of particle physics
obtained from string theory. Another topic to be investigated concerns the
application of string theory to condensed matter physics, specifically high
temperature superconductivity. Other topics to be investigated include conformal
field theories beyond two dimensions, as well as the development of remarkable
higher-spin extensions of Einstein gravity and their holographic descriptions.

The research described in this proposal is envisioned to have significant
broader impacts. Beyond the interdisciplinary nature of this research,
stretching from high-energy physics to condensed-matter physics, these impacts
also include the training of graduate students working towards their Ph.D.'s and
the training and mentoring of postdoctoral fellows who will be directly involved
with the research funded under this award.
