In computer-aided design (CAD) systems that have been installed, the problem of
converting existing paper drawings into an equivalent electronically-stored form
within the CAD system has proven difficult to resolve. CAD systems would be much
more effective if there existed an automatic method to convert the many existing
drawings into electronic forms, in which the information on the original
drawings was not lost. Research is in progress to create a system that would
digitize a drawing then interpret the information stored on the drawing. A
computerized expert system will be created to perform this task. For each
application field, the expert system will use rules and knowledge about drawings
in that particular field to translate the data into a usable form. Vexcel
strategies will be developed that will result in an acceptable throughput rate
at an acceptable error rate--both essential requirements for any commercial
system.
