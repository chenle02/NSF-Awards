****Technical Abstract**** This CAREER grant supported by the Division Materials
Research aims to have a crystal growth of new and perfect topological
insulators/superconductors and exploration of Dirac surface state of the
perfectly grown topological insulators (TIs). It also aims to integrate research
in experimental condensed matter physics and development of a unique physics
educational program at Missouri University of Science and Technology (S&T). New
methods will be used to grow perfect bulk insulating TIs and to fabricate large
surface-to-volume ratio of TI nanowire arrays. These perfect topological
materials are necessary for Dirac surface current detection which is important
for both new physics exploration such as studies of Majorana fermion and axion
electrodynamics, and technological applications such as spintronic and quantum
computing devices. Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, Aharonov-Bohm effect and
Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak interference on the perfectly grown TIs will be
performed to estimate surface Dirac electron effective mass and decay length.
Surface resistivity measurements under magnetic fields up to 45 T will then be
carried out for the investigation of fractional quantum Hall effect which is a
big quest in the field concerning the role of interactions and strong
correlations in topological states of matter.

****Non-Technical Abstract**** Topological insulator (TI) is a new quantum
material which has insulating property in its bulk but has high conductivity of
electrons on its surface. This surface conducting state is predicted to be a
solution for future computing technology. However, surface transport
measurements are challenging due to the imperfections of the current existing
TIs. A new synthesis technique that utilizes a reduced confining reaction space
will be applied to grow perfect bulk insulating crystals in order to permit
surface current detection. This electronic transport detection of the surface
electrons or the surface Dirac state is necessary for heat dissipation-less
spintronic devices where electron spin manipulation can be performed by
interfacing a perfect TI and a superconductor for potential fault-tolerant
quantum computing applications. Besides, TIs can act as a bridge to bring
together high energy and condensed matter physicists to search for long-sought
particle such as the Majorana fermion i.e. a fermion which is its own anti-
particle and an intermediate particle for electric and magnetic field
interactions called the axion which could provide a clue to the mystery of dark
matter in cosmology. This CAREER grant also helps to integrate the material
synthesis in solid state physics course taught in S&T and to present physics
shows targeted to local K-12 students.
