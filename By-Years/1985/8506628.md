This research effort has demonstrated that, except for very special cases, the
'self-tuning regulator' will not converge to the optimal. Despite this, it has
been shown that if the order of the controller is large enough then one can
still obtain self-tuning to the optimal. This work yields insights into the way
in which a system needs to be parameterized in order for it to be controlled by
the class of adaptive algorithms called 'self-tuning'.
