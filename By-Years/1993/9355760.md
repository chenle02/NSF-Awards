9355760 Baumann The Bay Beach Wildlife Sanctuary requests $58,414 from the
Informal Science Education Program of the National Science Foundation to infuse
an environmental education message with innovative approaches to visitor self-
instruction, through the two elements which comprise our Communities and
Connections in the World of Nature project. This $364,097 project is an
ambitious attempt to introduce and involve BBWS visitors with the fascinating
interactions of life which hold all living communities together. Fine and coarse
grain examination of 11 ecological concepts (e.g., habitat, human impacts,
energy flow, etc.) central to these interactions is achieved through a creative
blend of innovative public programs, museum-style interactive exhibits, engaging
graphics and habitat-oriented live animal displays. Specifically, NSF funding
will allow BBWS to: 1) Develop and conduct participatory educational programs
(Jr. Naturalist/ages 5-8, Jr. Ecologist/ages 9-12) that introduce ecological
themes and concepts to families and school groups. 2) Develop and produce a 180
sq. ft. computer-based interact exhibit (Habitat Puzzle) that encourages
visitors to explore ecological concepts of habitat composition in depth.
