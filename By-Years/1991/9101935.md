Professor Stuart Schreiber. Dr. Porco intends to continue research at the
Research Institute of Scripps Clinic under the sponsorship of Professor Chi-Huey
Wong. Dr. Porco's postdoctoral training will provide him with skills in enzyme
manipulation, carbohydrate synthesis and antibody-antigen recognition. Longer
term, he plans to design and generate catalytic antibodies for oligosaccharide
cleavage. %%% The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an
important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
