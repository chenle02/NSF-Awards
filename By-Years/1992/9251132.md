Students in the Electrical Engineering department of the City College of CUNY
are learning about wireless digital communications in a newly established
laboratory. They study the performance of digital modulation techniques in
various fading environments and focus on techniques and environments that they
specify. The laboratory equipment enables the students not only to observe
modulation techniques, but also allows them to create their own experiments and
answer their own questions to self posed problems requiring their active
participation. These laboratory problems are similar to those encountered in the
booming wireless communication industry and in some related topics of graduate
studies.
