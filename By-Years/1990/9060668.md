We have proposed a method to reduce the size of a compact x-ray lithography
machine used for etching the next-generation high-density computer chips. A high
gradient electron accelerator powered by a relativistic klystron is used in
place of the conventional linac as an injector to a superconducting synchrotron
radiation ring to produce intense x-rays. Recent experimental results have
demonstrated that electrons can reach the same final energy in a much shorter
section of the high gradient accelerator than the conventional linac. The
proposed machine is therefore much smaller than the conventional x-ray
synchrotron machines. The compact machine enables manufacturers to utilize high-
energy, high-intensity x- rays to produce various high-density computer chips in
a factory environment. In Phase I of this research, we will perform conceptual
studies for the injection system, and will consider the related physics and
engineering issues for combining the relativistic klystron high gradient
accelerator (RK/HGA) and the superconducting synchrotron radiation ring (SSRR)
into a single x-ray production machine. Particular consideration will be given
to the compatibility of the extremely short pulses produced by the RK/HGA and
the macropulses required by the SSRR, to the preservation of electron beam
emittance, and to tradeoff studies of various kicker magnet configurations in
order to ensure efficient transfer of the beam from the RK/HGA to the SSRR.
