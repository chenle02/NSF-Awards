ABSTRACT EEC-9528718 Beattie Environmental concerns have made it necessary to
develop technologies that will permit wide-spread environmental biomonitoring-
microbial population dynamics during biodegredation of industrial or municipal
wastes, biological effects of exposure to toxic chemicals in the environment,
and the presence of beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms in soil, water,
air, food, and agricultural products. This award provides funding for a planning
meeting that will study the potential for obtaining enough industrial support
for the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston to become an additional
university research site of the University of Tennessee's Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Measurement and Control. The expanded research
agenda will address the biological aspects of analytical instruments, process
control, ecosystem surveillance, environmental monitoring and micro-system
technologies.
