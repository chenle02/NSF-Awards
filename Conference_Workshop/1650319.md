This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Midwestern
Workshop on Asymptotic Analysis" that will be held at Indiana University-Purdue
University Fort Wayne on October 7-9, 2016.

This conference focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the
fields of approximation theory, potential theory, complex analysis and applied
analysis. A number of distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and
speak at this conference. The award gives early-career researchers, researchers
who are members of underrepresented groups, and researchers not funded by NSF an
opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing
committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups.
