This project includes organization of a workshop to be conducted by NSF with
support from WTEC, Inc. for a preliminary assessment of U.S. and international
activities in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). This topic has been
identified as a focus of a potential NSF/ENG study. The purpose of the workshop,
to be held in summer of 2001, is to gather facts and opinions from experts in
the U.S. research community on how this area of research should be defined for
the purposes of such a study and to provide an overview of U. S. and
international R&D activities within this scope. The information presented in the
workshop will be distilled into a report to NSF.
