The dynamics of DNA, the molecular basis of life, are being studied by Dr.
Schurr He has an almost unique expertise in combining theory and experimentation
using many different experimental tools. The experiments involve physical
studies of DNA conformations that are of substantial interest and importance to
others in the field. Several different physical techniques will be used in
concert to define the parameters of the system. This combination represents a
more thorough approach to the study of nucleic acid conformation and dynamics
than is commonly encountered.
