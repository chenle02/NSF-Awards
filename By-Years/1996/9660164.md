*** 96-60164 Connolly This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
will develop computational methods for dynamically recomputing the solvent-
accessible molecular surface as the molecule changes its conformation. The
solvent-accessible molecular surface has been defined by Fred Richards of Yale
University to be a smooth envelope surrounding a protein molecule. It has been
found to be useful in studying protein-protein and drug-protein binding. Current
methods for computing this surface recompute the entire surface even if just
some of the atoms move. Recomputing the surface for just the region that has
changed would result in a great savings in computation time and would allow a
user of an interactive molecular display system to alter the protein
conformation and watch the surface be recomputed in near real time. Applications
include (a) protein homology model building, (b) site-specific mutagenesis in
protein engineering, and (c) crystallographic structural uncertainty, where
there are several possible orientations of a surface amino acid side chain. ***
