This international travel award to Oak Ridge Associated Universities provides
support that will enable a diverse group of twenty-five U.S. graduate students
to attend the annual meeting of Nobel Laureates in Lindau, Germany, in 2004,
2005, and 2006. Since 1951, Nobel Prize winners and students in chemistry,
physics, and physiology or medicine have met annually in Lindau, Germany. Each
year an international group of more than 400 students is invited to attend the
weeklong meeting. The program includes formal lectures in the mornings and the
remainder of each day is set aside for the students to meet informally with the
Nobel Laureate scientists, as well as with their fellow students from around the
world. Together with another twenty-five-member cohort supported by the U.S.
Department of Energy, this grant brings to fifty the number of graduate students
in the U.S. delegation that will participate in these meetings. The objective of
this program is to motivate participating U.S. students toward excellence in
their chosen careers through their exposure to and interaction with Nobel
Laureates and fellow students from around the
world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this international travel
activity and NSF support of it include the likely catalytic impact on the
participating students' scientific career development, the potential for
initiating career-long international scientific interactions, and the
opportunity to promote diversity at multiple levels among the student
participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
