This grant will enable students to attend the Logic Mentoring Workshop (LMW
2017) which will be co-located with the International ACM/IEEE Symposium on
Logic in Computer Science (LICS) to be held in Reykjavik (Iceland), June 2017.
LICS is one of the premier conferences in computer science, dedicated to the
advancement of the logic and semantics. The purpose of Logic Mentoring Workshop
is to provide mentoring and career advice to early-stage graduate students, to
attract them to pursue research careers in the area of computer-aided
verification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attending a conference can be a
transformative experience for young researchers. It exposes them to cutting-edge
research and can help them make connections to other students and senior
researchers in the area. The funded students will attend LICS, a top conference
where they will learn about current research problems and interact with leaders
in the field, and the LMW workshop which will focus on mentoring and career
advice specific to early-stage graduate students who aim to pursue research
careers in the area of computer-aided verification.
