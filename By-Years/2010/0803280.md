Spurred by financial scandals and privacy concerns, governments worldwide have
moved to ensure confidence in digital records by regulating their retention and
deletion. The goal of this project is to develop and explore a database
management system (DBMS) architecture that supports a spectrum of approaches to
regulatory compliance, thereby extending the level of protection afforded by
conventional file-based compliance storage servers to the vast amounts of
structured data residing in databases. The key challenge of this work is to
provide compliance assurances for the DBMS, even against insiders with super-
user powers, while balancing the need for trustworthiness against the
conflicting requirements for scalable performance guarantees and low cost. The
resulting architecture provides tunable tradeoffs between security and
performance, through a spectrum of techniques ranging from tamper detection to
tamper prevention for data, indexes, logs, and metadata; tunable vulnerability
windows; tunable granularities of protection; careful use of magnetic disk as a
cache and of secure coprocessors on the DBMS platform and compliance storage
server platform; and judicious retargeting of an on-disk encryption unit.

This work enables compliance laws to be applied to business, government, and
personal data now stored in databases, increasing societal confidence in such
data. A new web course on compliance data management will raise the computer
science community's awareness of compliance issues and will help train a new
generation of professionals cognizant of these challenges and solutions. The
software prototypes and technical papers describing them will be disseminated
through the project's web site http://web.crypto.cs.sunysb.edu/cdb/
