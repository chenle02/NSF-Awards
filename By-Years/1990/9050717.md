A method suitable for the measurement of heat release rates of both large-and
small-scale fires has evolved during the past decade. This method, known as
oxygen consumption calorimetry, has advantages over traditional calorimetric
methods, which rely on the measurement of sensible energy, a difficult task in
open systems. Oxygen consumption calorimetry requires only that products of
combustion be collected and their composition and flow rate measured. This is a
significantly easier task, but it does require sophisticated gas analysis
equipment. The instrumentation requested here will permit the completion of a
small-scale oxygen consumption calorimeter. This calorimeter, modeled after the
Cone Calorimeter developed at the Center for Fire Research of the National
Institute of Standards and Technology, will permit undergraduate students to
perform a wide range of state-of-the-art fire measurement experiments for both
laboratory assignments and independent research project. It will be possible to
demonstrate the factors influencing the dynamics of fires within structures and
the quantitative methods to measure and characterize these factors.
