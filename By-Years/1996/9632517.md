This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, focusses on the interaction of low energy polyatomic ions with
adsorbate covered metal surfaces. During the tenure of this thirty-three month
grant, Professor Luke Hanley and his students at the University of Illinois at
Chicago will seek to develop an understanding of the surface induced
dissociation of polyatomic ions for application in analytical mass spectrometry,
and to investigate the deposition of energy into multilayers of adsorbates. A
tandem quradrupole mass spectrometer with an ultra-high vacuum scattering
chamber, developed recently by Professor Hanley under NSF grant CHE- 9220393,
will be used in these studies. This research combines experimental and
computational methods to study the interaction of low energy polyatomic ions
with adsorbate covered metal surfaces. A detailed understanding of polyatomic
ion-surface collisions is important to the development of surface induced
dissociation (SID) as a sample introduction technique in bioanalytical mass
spectrometry. Such an understanding is also important to the development of
surface modification methodologies that are widely used in materials processing.
