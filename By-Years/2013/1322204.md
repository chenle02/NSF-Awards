The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program in the
Division of Chemistry supports this project which provides support for the
attendance and oral presentations of Assistant and Associate Professors from US
Universities at the 8th International Symposium on Supramolecular and
Macrocyclic Chemistry (ISMSC-8) to be held in Arlington, Virginia, July 7-11,
2013. The conference features a mixture of oral presentations, short talks and
poster talks, and poster sessions covering a wide scientific area of interest to
the supramolecular chemistry community. The intellectual merits of the proposal
are inherent in the presentations of the participants which are grouped into
theme sessions in the areas of complexity, assemblies, molecular machines and
mechanical effects, functional crystals, polymers and materials, supramolecular
chemistry of biology, surfaces and interfaces, and supramolecular catalysis. The
theme session promises to stimulate discussions on the current challenges and
barriers in the topic areas. Finally, a special issue of the journal
"Supramolecular Chemistry" will be published based on research from the
conference participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The significance and broader
impact of the conference are manifold. The participants in ISMSC-8 are diverse
with respect to country of origin, gender, academic level, and area of
expertise. The interactions between scientists of diverse background catalyze
new (inter)national collaborations which expose student co-workers to different
cultures and scientific viewpoints. For the US based Assistant and Associate
Professors for whom funding is requested, this is an opportunity to present
their research to leading experts in the field. Interactions between senior and
junior faculty members lead to the establishment of informal mentor-mentee
relationships that impact the future development of research in supramolecular
and macrocyclic chemistry.
