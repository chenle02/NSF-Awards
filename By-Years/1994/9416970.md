9416970 DeHaemer This award implements a plan for the Japanese Technology
Evaluation Center and the World Technology Evaluation Center (JTEC/WTEC) to
conduct twelve studies of foreign R&amp;D to establish benchmarks to help focus
U.S. R&amp;D. The research will be done by expert panels that will visit foreign
laboratories, and present their findings in workshops and in technical reports.
Three methods will be used as appropriate, (1) the standard approach that
JTEC/WTEC has used in previous grants, and two new methods that will provide
greater flexibility: (2) mission-directed studies on behalf of government
agencies that must satisfy a limited set of objectives and meet a short time
constraint, and (3) state-of-the art reviews with subjects and delegations
proposed by the scientific community.
