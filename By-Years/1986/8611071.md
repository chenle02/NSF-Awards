The September l985 Mexico earthquake clearly demonstrated that the dynamic
properties of the foundation material have a significant effect on the behavior
of building systems. The purpose of this project is to develop computational
methods and microcomputer programs which will allow engineers to conduct
earthquake response analysis of buildings, including the site amplification
effect. The methods of analysis are verified by detailed studies of buildings
which have been damaged in Mexico City. Vibration tests are conducted on one
building before and after repair and the results are compared with computer
analysis. The TABS program developed at Berkeley is modified to include a new
foundation model and used for several structures selected in which the
foundation properties are known. Results of analysis are compared with observed
behavior during the Mexico earthquake. Foundation modeling guidelines are
developed which can be used for other sites. Finally, the site-response program
is transferred to the MS-DOS microcomputers.
