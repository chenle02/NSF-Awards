The PI will work on several problems in commutative algebra that are centered
around local cohomology theory, the homological conjectures, and the theory of
tight closure. The PI will continue work on the conjecture that local cohomology
modules of regular rings have finitely many associated prime ideals. This is
known in various cases due to the work of Huneke-Sharp and Lyubeznik, but
remains unresolved for polynomial rings over the integers. Some critical cases
have been settled recently in joint work with Lyubeznik and Walther; these in
turn, lead to new vanishing theorems for local cohomology modules. Hochster's
monomial conjecture remains unresolved for rings that do not contain a field,
such as those arising in number theory; the PI will pursue an approach to this
via local cohomology. The proposed work in tight closure includes investigating
the question whether weak $F$-regularity---the property that all ideals of a
ring are tightly closed---is preserved under localization; this will be attacked
via the notion of splinter rings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
concerned with questions in commutative algebra. This is a field closely related
to algebraic geometry: while algebraic geometry focuses on the geometry of
solution sets of polynomial equations, the point of view in commutative algebra
is to study the ring of polynomial functions on a solution set. Most of the
questions that will be investigated are questions about the nature of the
solution sets. Commutative algebra continues to develop a fascinating
interaction with several branches of mathematics, and is becoming an
increasingly valuable tool in engineering, coding theory, cryptography, and
other areas of strategic interest.
