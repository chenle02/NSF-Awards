This project provides for the purchase of 16 compound light microscopes, 16
stereo dissecting microscopes, 4 spectrophotometers, and 4 laptop computers to
equip General Biology and General Chemistry course laboratories. The new
equipment is the key ingredient in an expansion of the biology major to a second
campus. The biology major has been offered only at the main campus, greatly
reducing the number of potential students able to enter the sciences. The
expansion of the biology major can channel students into the sciences who may
not have previously considered or who were unable to enroll in the biology
major.
