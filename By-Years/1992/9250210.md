The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a high performance liquid
chromatograph and ultracentrifuge for use in a collaborative project between
students enrolled in organic chemistry, biochemistry, and instrumental analysis.
Organic chemistry students prepare acetanilide and three deriatives, and
determine the appropriate HPLC conditions for their separation; students in
biochemistry study the hydroxylation of acetanilide by rat liver microsomes
using the developed HPLC conditions to determine the relative amounts of the
various isomers produced; finally, the instrumental analysis students conduct a
structural analysis via the technique of gas chromatography/mass spectrometery.
The project demonstrates the interrelationships between chemistry subdisciplines
and the need for cooperation among scientists with expertise in different areas.
