The kinetic theory of gases will be applied to predict heat and mass transfer
rates to small gas borne particles. The influence of molecular concentration,
molecular mass, molecular interaction with the particle surface (accommodation
coefficients), and particle size relative to gas mean path will be examined.
Hopefully, accurate but simple formulas for engineering use will be developed.
Design of processes involving particle formation from vapor phase reactions
might benefit from more reliable expressions for transport rates of the type
sought in this research.
