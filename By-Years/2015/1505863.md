The Conference on the Intersection of Particle and Nuclear Physics (CIPANP) is a
triennial series that focuses on topics of interest to elementary particle
physicists, nuclear physicists and particle/nuclear astrophysicists. In addition
to disseminating the latest results, CIPANP facilitates both formal and informal
exchanges of information and the building of connections between physicists in
these fields. The 12th CIPANP will be held May 19 through 24 in Vail, Colorado
and will bring together physicists from around the word. This award supports the
participation of young physicists and will be used to encourage a diverse group
of participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CIPANP 2015 is organized with public
lectures, plenary, parallel and poster sessions. Topic areas include Physics at
High Energies; High Intensity and Precision Physics; Cosmic Physics and Dark
Energy/Inflation; Neutrino Masses and Neutrino Mixing; Electroweak Tests of the
Standard Model; Dark Matter; Particle and Nuclear Astrophysics; Heavy Flavor and
CKM Matrix; QCD, Hadron Spectroscopy and Exotics; Partonic Distributions in
Nucleon and Nuclei; Hadronic Physics and Structure of Nucleus and Nuclei; and
Quark Matter and High Energy Heavy Ion Collisions. Proceedings will be published
and presentations will be posted on the conference website.
