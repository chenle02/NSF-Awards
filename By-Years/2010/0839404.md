This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
improve the reliability of widely used methods for detecting and measuring trace
amounts of RNA (genetic material actively made by cells and contained within
certain viruses). Most current methods for detecting RNA use two different
enzymes; one to convert RNA to DNA and a second to generate billions of copies
by PCR amplification. This two enzyme approach has serious problems (e.g.,
additional manipulations, cross contamination, uneven amplification of certain
genes, inaccurate amplification, and low efficiency). Alternative enzymes have
been discovered and characterized at Lucigen that efficiently perform both
conversion of RNA to DNA and amplification in a single reaction. However, these
need to be more fully developed and characterized to replace existing methods.
These candidates and others in our collection will be developed and compared to
available enzymes in Phase I. Those that are superior to current enzymes will be
developed for commercialization in Phase II. The broader impacts of this
research include substantial cost savings in biotechnology research, increased
accuracy of data, and improved reliability of diagnostic tests. Nearly $1
billion is spent annually on detecting RNA targets, and this amount is growing
rapidly. This type of research is strictly dependent on the available enzymes
and is compromised by their deficiencies. Improved enzymes to be developed in
this SBIR project promise to greatly improve basic research, diagnostics, and
drug development, and will have an important impact on human health,
agriculture, and research in microbial diversity.
