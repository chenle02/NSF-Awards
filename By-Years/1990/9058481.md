Dr. Gilbert Nathanson is supported by a Presidential Young Investigator Grant
from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study atomic and molecular
beam scattering from various low vapor pressure liquid substrates. Nathanson
will be studying the gas-liquid interface to learn, on an atomic scale, about
the roughness of liquid surfaces, about how various beam molecules adsorb,
solvate or desorb and about the process of proton exchange on especially
prepared surfaces. Nathanson's scattering experiments will answer these
questions by following the trajectories of the molecules as they strike the
liquid surface. A highly collimated beam of atoms or molecules traveling at a
selected velocity impinge on the surface and bounce off or react. The identity
of the reaction product and its recoil velocity and direction are monitored by
mass spectrometry. By carrying out microscopic,"single collision" experiments,
Nathanson hopes to construct an intimate picture of how chemical reactions occur
at the interface between gases and liquids.
