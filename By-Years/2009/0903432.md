Architecture and Design Automation for 3D Multi-core
Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Three-dimensional
integrated circuits (3D ICs) are envisioned as a promising solution for future
multi-core architecture design. This project will investigate two cross-cutting
research thrusts related to architectural exploration and design-automation
tools for future 3D multi-core systems. The stacking of memory components and
the relationship between memory stacking and interconnect will be explored. The
stacking of logic layers that provide distinct service to the system such as
improved reliability and efficient power management will also be investigated.
The PI will consider the interplay between different constraints such as thermal
profiles, performance, and cost in these explorations. To facilitate such
explorations, a set of design automation toolsets will be developed. In addition
to validation using simulation and emulation environments, the project will
fabricate and test some of these designs to demonstrate the feasibility of the
ideas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted in collaboration
with industrial partners enabling direct transfer of technology to industry. The
outcome of this research will, therefore, have a direct impact on future multi-
core designs. Undergraduate and graduate students involved in this research will
get versatile training. The tools and techniques developed in this research will
be used in developing a new course on multi-core design. The PIs will also
organize tutorials along with major conferences to disseminate the results from
this work.
