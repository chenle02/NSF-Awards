9410707 Shene Using a geometric approach, this project aims to completely solve
the problem of using Dupin cyclides as blending surfaces for all pairs of CSG
primitives, and to explore the possibility that other tractable surfaces, such
as the cyclide family, can be used for blending purpose. Initially, the project
will investigate the role of Dupin cyclides as blending surfaces for CSG
primitives. This includes construction algorithms and characterization results
for each pair of CSG primitives and their generalizations. Since constructions
are based on the geometric characteristics, not on implicit/parametric
equations, the construction algorithms would be more robust. Next, various
generalizations of Dupin cyclides (e.g., projective cyclides, general cyclides
and quartics with a double conics) will be examined to see if there are viable
and tractable classes of lower degree algebraic surfaces for blending purpose.
Techniques from descriptive, algebraic and differential geometry will be used to
study the geometry of these surface classes and to develop efficient
construction algorithms. Finally, some fundamental issues of general blending
surface construction will be considered by looking at the connection between the
geometry of the intersection curve, the clipping curves, and the blending
surfaces. ***
