9500179 Mehra This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
develops an advanced multivariable adaptive control system for hot isostatic
pressing (HIP) operations in the fabrication of metal matrix composites (MMCs).
Phase I computer simulations indicated response times, shorter by a factor of
three, of the new system over standard proportional-integrative-derivative
techniques. The new system controls temperature and pressure profiles in a HIP
furnace using modern control techniques of Model Predictive Control and Risk
Sensitive Optimal control. The Phase II project focuses on a test of the
prototype system at a large HIP furnace facility operated by Industrial
Materials Technology, Inc. in Andover, MA. The new approach to furnace control
has potential for large savings in argon gas usage and electric power, for
higher yields of MMC products, such as titanium matrix SiC fiber composites, and
for more reliable environmental/health monitoring.
