The project is concerned with research in optoacoustics, focuses on both
fundamental and novel applications, and emphasizes experimental work. Three
topics are covered in this activity and include optics and optoelectronics
applications in acoustics, development of fiber optics devices to measure normal
and tangential micro-vibrations on surfaces, and outdoor sound propagation. The
first topic involves the applications of acousto-optic light modulation with
Bragg cells to the laser generation of ultrasound in materials. This non-contact
method of sound generation is attractive where the environment is either too hot
or radioactive. The second research topic's outcome is expected to provide
information on the mechanisms controlling sound radiation from fluid/structure
interactions. The third topic is concerned with the modeling of sound
diffraction from irregular topography. It may find applications in environmental
acoustics and noise near airports.
