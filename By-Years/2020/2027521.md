The Spatiotemporal Innovation IUCRC develops novel spatiotemporal analytical
tools to enable applications of national and global significance. In response to
the COVID-19 crisis, Harvard University and George Mason University, university
sites within this IUCRC, propose this collaborative project to collect and share
COVID related data in near real time, conduct spatiotemporal analytics, and mine
socioeconomic and environmental knowledge to facilitate decision support systems
in response to the pandemic. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will build a
unique cloud-based platform composed of a data collection subsystem for
collecting global, high quality COVID-19-related data; spatiotemporal analytics
tools for analyzing the disease evolution and socioeconomic patterns; and,
modeling tools for assessing medical supplies and logistics. Through web access
services, the platform will provide capabilities for easy access to the data
collected as well as access to the developed spatiotemporal analytical and
modeling tools. Such capabilities will facilitate quick production of data-
driven decision support systems for community preparedness. This project has
secured participation of 50+ international researchers in developing the
proposed platform. These researchers will help collect and validate data,
analyze how policies influence the outbreaks, how the Earth environment is
impacted, and how to balance reopening of the economy and controlling the
spreading of the disease in the U.S. based on experiences from Asia and Europe.
Over 200 undergraduate volunteers, including many from underrepresented groups,
are already involved in this project through Harvardâ€™s Coronavirus Visualization
Team efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data, information, and knowledge accumulated
in this project have been, and will continue to be, archived long term in a
comprehensive gateway (covid-19.stcenter.net). Such data include spatiotemporal
distribution of confirmed cases, relevant social, economic and natural
information from different resources, such as authoritative reports, news
releases, Earth observation, and social media. Software and tools developed are
posted on GitHub for open access. Sustained online collaboration is being
conducted to produce replicable research using spatiotemporal analyses to mine
patterns and relations between COVID-19 and social and natural factors for
community response and preparedness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
