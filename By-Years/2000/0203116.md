Professor Carol Korzeniewski of Texas Tech University is funded by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study oxidation pathways of methanol
and related small molecules on electrodes, which constitute fundamental steps in
fuel cells. Bulk and graphite-supported nanoparticles that contain platinum and
platinum-group metals will serve as substrates. The reactions will be studied by
vibrational spectroscopy, scanning force microscopy and Monte Carlo simulations.
The objective is to identify steps that limit current flow, an understanding of
which can help to improve electric power generation. Different molecular
behaviors are observed on bulk and nanoparticle materials. This research could
lead to a molecular understanding of this paradox.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fuel
cells are an exciting growing technology based on an electrochemical device that
combines hydrogen fuel and oxygen from the air to produce electricity, heat and
water. Fuel cells operate without combustion, so they are virtually pollution
free. Research is needed to overcome some of the problems and to further develop
this technology.
