This is a two-year collaborative research project between James A. Dumesic of
the University of Wisconsin and Chen Yi of Nanjing University on the study of
solid acid catalysts. The project is sponsored by NSF and the Chinese State
Education Commission. Solid acids are used as heterogeneous catalysts for such
important processes as cracking of hydrocarbons in the petrochemical industry
and the formation of amines as intermediates in the polymer industry.
Collaborative research between the University of Wisconsin and Nanjing
University will address how catalyst structure and composition control acid
strength and how these factors are thereby related to the catalytic performance
of these materials for cracking and amination reactions. Catalyst acidity
studies and reaction kinetics measurements will be conducted at the University
of Wisconsin, while catalyst preparation and characterization will be performed
at Nanjing University. Kinetic modeling will be carried out to test quantitative
relations that may be used to design new acidic materials as effective catalysts
for hydrocarbon processing reactions.
