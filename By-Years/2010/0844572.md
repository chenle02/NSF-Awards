Science is becoming a data management problem. Advancements in sensing and
computational modeling have dramatically increased data acquisition rates,
establishing queries --"in ferro" experiments -- as an essential method of
scientific discovery alongside in situ, in vitro, and in silico experiments.
Unfortunately, the infrastructure to design and conduct in ferro experiments
over massive datasets has not kept pace with our collective ability to create
these datasets. Computational modelers, who have long enjoyed the benefits of a
research focus on creating larger and faster CPU farms, now face terabytes of
simulation results in which deep insights into the health of the planet remain
locked. The key is seamlessness: to interactively analyze these data,
quantitatively and qualitatively, without regard to boundaries manifesting from
time and space domains, physical location, hardware architecture, storage
medium, or file organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is building a
new infrastructure that uses the CluE platform to allow ad hoc, longitudinal
query and visualization of massive ocean simulation results at interactive
speeds. This infrastructure leverages and extends two existing systems:
GridFields, a library for general and efficient manipulation of simulation
results; and VisTrails, a comprehensive platform for scientific workflow,
collaboration, visualization, and provenance. By cloud-enabling these systems,
the proposed infrastructure provides: (1) seamless access to the 10 year history
of simulation results at interactive speeds; (2) an architecture and execution
strategy that exploit both remote cloud and local desktop resources; and (3) a
provenance capture and manipulation platform that enables repeatability, code
reuse, forensics, and collaboration.
