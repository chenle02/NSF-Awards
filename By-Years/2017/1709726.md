Homology is one of the most fundamental and useful invariants of topological
spaces and is a measure of the number generalized "holes" in a topological
space. Homology theory has applications in as disparate areas of mathematics as
algebraic topology, number theory, mathematical physics, data science, and even
economics where it is used to show the existence of Nash equilibria. Homology is
useful only to the extent to which one can calculate it. Oftentimes the spaces
that one is interested in come in natural infinite families. An interesting
phenomenon that simplifies homology calculations for many of these families is
homological stability. Examples of spaces exhibiting homological stability are
ubiquitous in group theory, low dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, and
number theory. This research project aims to broaden and deepen understanding of
homological stability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the study of
homological stability as well as some generalizations, representation stability,
coefficient dependent homological stability, and secondary stability.
Representation stability concerns the controlled growth of the homology groups
of spaces with group actions. Coefficient dependent homological stability
involves studying sequences of spaces where the integral homology does not
stabilize but some patterns exist if one works with mod p or p-local
coefficients. Secondary stability entails exploring stability patterns in the
unstable homology groups of spaces exhibiting various forms of stability. The
first two generalizations broaden the class of spaces that fall under the scope
of homological stability. In contrast, secondary stability significantly
increases the amount of information that one can extract from a sequence of
spaces using stability techniques. The investigator will explore these
generalizations of homological stability with the goal of proving new stability
results for congruence and Torelli-type groups as well as configuration spaces.
