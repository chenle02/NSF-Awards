Offspring Recognition and Brood Parasitism in African Finches: Implications for
Signal Mimicry and Diversification David W. Winkler and Justin G. Schuetz

Communication between parents and offspring is widespread among birds. However,
the signals that nestlings employ in this dialogue have undergone extreme
elaboration in only two families of birds, the Estrildid finches and the brood
parasitic Viduid finches. The mouth patterns of estrildid nestlings are
incredibly diverse; each species possesses a unique combination of spots,
colors, and markings on its palate and tongue. Viduid nestlings, which are
raised alongside estrildid host nestlings, have mouth markings that precisely
match those of the host species they exploit. Presumably, mimicry occurs because
raising parasites is costly and because host parents that discriminate against
foreign-looking young are favored by natural selection. However, to date, there
is scanty evidence for nestling recognition in estrildids and only a few studies
of wild host populations have been undertaken. Previous work suggests that food
availability, host learning, and nestling phenotypes may influence whether host
parents recognize and reject nestlings. Controlled aviary experiments in
combination with fieldwork will help to assess the relative importance of these
variables. Captive populations of known-age hosts and parasites have already
been established, and research in Tanzania, where a viduid exploits more than
one host species, will allow for tests of nestling discrimination. Throughout
aviary and fieldwork, variation in nestling morphologies within and across
species will be documented. In addition to informing our understanding of
offspring recognition behavior, results from this research will provide insight
into host-parasite interactions and the processes that affect the evolution of
animal signals.
