Thin film ferromagnetic materials are at the core of a large array of data
storage applications of modern digital technology. The widespread use of these
materials is due to their ability to retain information in the form of distinct
magnetization states, without the need of being powered, and the possibility to
read and write information in a fast and reliable way. Magnetization reversal in
thin ferromagnetic films is often mediated by appearance and motion of domain
walls, which can be considered as line defects separating different magnetic
domains. This project studies one particular type of magnetic domain wall, which
is of intrinsically topological nature -- winding domain walls. The simplest
winding domain wall is a 360-degree wall, in which the magnetization vector
rotates by a 360-degree angle in the film plane across the wall. The
investigator undertakes a systematic study of existence, stability, and motion
of winding domain walls and investigates their role in magnetization reversal
processes. This problem presents many mathematical challenges, because existence
and properties of winding domain walls are determined by a delicate balance of
different nonlinear and nonlocal forces. The investigator develops new
analytical, asymptotic, numerical and stochastic tools to tackle these
challenges.

This project is strongly motivated by the efforts to develop a new, universal
computer memory based on thin film ferromagnetic materials: MRAM
(Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory). Therefore, the potential impact of the
results of the project on the computer industry and society, in general, is
high. To this end, the investigator addresses the questions of feasibility and
reliability of the designs that utilize ferromagnetic nanorings as storage
elements. A key component of the project is the involvement of a new generation
of applied mathematicians into this highly interdisciplinary area of research.
As part of this process, the investigator develops courses in applied sciences
and takes part in interdisciplinary training of mathematics and engineering
graduate and undergraduate students. The aim of these efforts is to help foster
better interactions between researchers in applied mathematics and experimental
scientists. The tools developed by the investigator are also expected to be
useful for many other problems of energy-driven pattern formation.
