This project will investigate the connections between the intellectual and
cultural changes during the Chemical Revolution in France in order to illuminate
the cultural and intellectual reasons why certain theoretical conclusions were
reached, and conversely, the effect of those theoretical conclusions on the
culture of chemistry in France. The project aims to broaden the evidentiary and
interpretive scope of current scholarship by including the host of savants who
sought to propel chemistry forward to its revolutionary conclusions as well as
those who tried to stem that revolutionary tide. The study will chart the
changes during the Chemical Revolution along four integrated axes of historical
analysis: communities, practices, institutions, and theories. Thus, examination
will be made of the competing groups in the chemical community and how these
sub-communities interacted among themselves and with other intellectual and
social groupings; the experimental, textual, and social practices that
characterized the various chemical factions; the institutions in which chemists
learned and practiced their science; and the intellectual agendas and
theoretical commitments in play during the episode.
