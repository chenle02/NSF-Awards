9714575 Logan Prior exploratory research on this topic was conducted by the
Principal Investigator under NSF Small Grant for Exploratory Research Number
94-14423. The objective of research on this renewal award is to continue
determination of the feasibility of using microorganisms capable of using
chlorate as an electron acceptor in their metabolic processes for
decontamination of soil and aquifers. The investigators plan on studying
chlorate-based microbial respiration in contrast with molecular oxygen pathways
by use of respiratory inhibitors to dissect the electron transport chain. Soil
and aquifer contaminants to be investigated in this research for determination
of their biodegradability by chlorate-respiring microorganisms include toluene,
p-xylene, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, carbon tetrachloride, chlorophenol,
chlorobenzoate, benzene, pentane and phenol. The contemplated decontamination
process based on results of the proposed research would involve simultaneous
injection of chlorates and chlorate-respiring organisms into the contaminated
soil or aquifer. Results of this project are expected to provide the basis for
its potential application in engineering design of a system to decontaminate
soil and groundwater aquifers by use of sodium chlorate as a source of
respiratory oxygen under conditions that prevent or inhibit use of oxygen from
atmospheric sources. In contrast to other potential chemical electron acceptors
such as nitrates and sulfates, byproducts of which are potential groundwater
pollutants, the only byproduct of biochemical chlorate utilization is the
chloride ion. ***
