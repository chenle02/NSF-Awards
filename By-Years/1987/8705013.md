This Engineering Research Equipment proposal is for funds for a 55,000 lb.
capacity servo-hydraulic high speed testing machine with the necessary controls,
intelligent interfaces and other accessories to conduct experiments to
characterize polymer material behavior and to perform deformation processing
experiments. Such equipment is needed for basic studies related to polymer
material behavior/processing and in the development of an integrated software
system that can simulate the solid phase processing of thermoplastics.
