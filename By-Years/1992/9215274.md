9215274 Gandhi The proposed research would adapt and expand on efficient
computational techniques (both time domain and impedance methods), previously
used to help understand radio-frequency EM field effects on humans, to the study
of power-frequency EMF's. Field distributions and current densities will be
estimated, using detailed high resolution, anisotropic, anatomically-based
models based on MRI scans, for a range of conditions of practical interest. The
accuracy of the numerical methods will be verified experimentally using a
reduced scale models of the human. This research is important because it deals
with an issue that is of current public concern. The information gained from
this study could help determine appropriate experimental conditions to use in
biological studies on the effects of power-line fields on humans and to help
determine realistic safety guidelines. ***
