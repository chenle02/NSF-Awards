The goal of our project is the creation, testing and dissemination of a
prototype textbook entitled in Microtechnology and Nanotechnology: A Connected
Approach to Small Systems, intended for upper-undergraduate and graduate level
study of microtechnology, specially microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and
nanotechnology. As new courses in these areas continue to emerge at American
universities the need for an innovative well-written understandable textbook
grows as well. We recognize that some MEMS-specific and nanotechnology-specific
textbooks are available, but none that effectively tie these disciplines
together. A broader and more cohesive viewpoint is overdue and a gap currently
exists in the marketplace. Our book is being developed to appeal to a wide
audience and to better augment instruction by representing all of the required
knowledge bases from engineering and science. Expert colleagues currently
working and teaching in the field will editorially evaluate our new textbook's
materials throughout the composition process. Pilot tests in the form of courses
taught by the PI will share the title and content of the proposed textbook and
generate important feedback. Our final product will be a saleable first edition
that, having proved effective in beta site testing, will be published by a major
house. Preliminary discussions with McGraw-Hill suggest a market exists for such
a product, as well as a desire to publish it.
