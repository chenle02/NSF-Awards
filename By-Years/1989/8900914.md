This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in
analytical, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry. For a three-year period
beginning in April, 1989, eight (8) undergraduate students will spend ten (10)
weeks engaged in basic research under the direction of eleven (11) faculty
members from the University of Pittsburgh chemistry department. Unique aspects
of this REU activity are that each participant will become a part of an existing
research team, and the faculty member who heads the team will become the
participant's mentor.
