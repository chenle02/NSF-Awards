For about 12,000 years, numerous small foraging communities lived in equilibrium
in a region of what is now the US. Using resources created in this project,
linguists are reconstructing their relationships and history, and community
members are regaining language and culture, a vital gesture of restorative
justice and healing of generational trauma. The project compiles, elucidates,
and makes accessible invaluable language resources that are in danger of being
lost both to scientists and to the communities. The scientific results of the
study contribute significantly to our understanding of human prehistory and to
theories of language contact and change, while the broader impacts include
training and transfer of data stewardship to community members, advancing US
efforts to build relationships with Indigenous communities based on respect for
Tribal sovereignty and self-governance.

This project delivers a linguistic database to the Indigenous community, with a
grammar, dictionary, collection of oral literature (translated, analyzed, and
annotated), and a range of materials and processes created by project staff for
the people to make each of their homes a 'language nest' in which the language
is used and nurtured. For several other languages in the area, it provides the
example and explicit instruction for Indigenous language activists and
researchers to create a database of the same sort for their respective
languages. These databases together enable researchers to reconstruct the
linguistic history of the earliest inhabitants of the region with specificity,
completeness, and confidence that have until now been impossible. This award is
made as part of a funding partnership between the National Science Foundation
and the National Endowment for the Humanities for the NSF Dynamic Language
Infrastructure â€“ NEH Documenting Endangered Languages Program.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
