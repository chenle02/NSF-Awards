Current methods for estimating design wind speeds in non-hurricane regions of
the United States do not distinguish between winds originating from large-scale
extratropical pressure systems and small but intense thunderstorms. These two
different meteorological phenomena have separate statistical distributions and,
based on the Phase I results, should not be handled using a single (mixed)
distribution, as is currently the case. From the Phase I study, it appears that
there may be many sites in the United States where thunderstorm winds dominate
the extreme wind climatology (for the return periods relevant to conventional
structural design) and that the traditional approach tends to underestimate the
design winds and too narrowly models the wind directionality distribution. Since
thunderstorms differ from large- scale extratropical winds in the details of
wind structure, storm duration, frequency, and directionality, these differences
could have an important influence on the future codification of design winds,
the safety of structures, and wind tunnel testing in the United States. The
objective of the Phase II research is to evaluate the importance and merits of
treating thunderstorm gust front winds as a separate and distinct wind loading
event. The integrated research plan includes three basic tasks: (1) develop wind
engineering models of the spatial and temporal characteristics of thunderstorm
gust fronts; (2) analysis of thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm windspeed and
direction statistics at selected sites; and (3) evaluate the effects of
thunderstorms on structural response for several categories of structures. The
work could have nationwide significance and, if successful, influence future
wind load design criteria in the United States and other countries where
thunderstorms are important contributors to extreme wind frequencies.
