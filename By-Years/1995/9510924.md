ABSTRACT Markman, Arthur Columbia University SBR-9510924 The PI has submitted
this proposal under the Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER). He
proposes ten studies on decision making. The conceptual underpinning for this
research program is comparison-based architecture for choice (COBAC). The
central principles of this model are predicated on the alignability of the
features belonging to various choice options. Decision makers make more use of
alignable than non-alignable features. Furthermore decision makers will attempt
to convert the latter into the former. Some of the studies will use think-aloud
and other process-tracing methodologies. The PI will also examine the importance
of goals in choice behavior. Finally, a computational model will be constructed
on the basis of the results of these studies. The educational plan involves the
PI s participation both in the development of computer-assisted instruction and
in the revision of the statistics/experimental design curricula in his home
institution.
