Under the mentorship of Dr. Ruth Peterson, the primary objective of this
postdoctoral fellowship is to shed light on the differential consequences of
incarceration at both the individual and community levels of analysis. At the
individual level, the focus is on whether or not incarceration influences labor
market outcomes for different racial and ethnic group members across contexts
that vary in levels of segregation and social disadvantage. The interest in the
impact of incarceration on the community is twofold: 1) to understand how the
distribution of incarceration affects community organization and structure and
2) to examine the consequences of incarceration for communities with different
race/ethnic and class composition. The data selected for examining the
consequences of incarceration at the individual level is the National
Longitudinal Survey Youth 1979-1998 (NLSY). The basic modeling strategy will be
to estimate three-level Hierarchical Linear Models (HLM) where level one is a
person-year, level two is the person and level three is the spatial context of
labor market conditions, disadvantage and segregation. The data for examining
the consequences of incarceration at the neighborhood level will be drawn from
the Ohio offender database maintained by the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation
and Corrections and a neighborhood crime database for census tracts in Ohio
cities being assembled by Professors Ruth Peterson and Lauren Krivo. The
modeling strategy will be to estimate Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regressions
for predominantly black, predominantly white and mixed census tracts.
