This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II seeks to develop a
surface texturing technique that will significantly improve sunlight coupling
into various types of solar cells. Surface textures are mandatory to record
efficiencies in solar cells. The Omni-Directional Antireflective Coating (Omni-
AR) solution showed a reduction in reflection in a large range of incident
angles (omni-directional) over a broad spectral range (400-1200 nm). Improved
solar cell efficiency of over 10% was demonstrated (experimentally).

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be a low-cost,
broad-spectrum, omni-directional and substrate-independent surface texture
antireflective coating. It is expected to have a significant impact on current
and future solar cell technologies. The ability to provide near ideal
performance of antireflective coatings to solar cells without a vacuum process
is a major step in reducing the cost of solar electricity. This solution-based
deposition technique makes it possible to provide a single coating technology
that should work with all types of solar cell materials and structures. This
project will significantly improve the conversion efficiency in both current and
future solar cells (~10%) with a minimum cost increase (~4%).
