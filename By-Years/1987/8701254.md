This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of spectroelectrochemistry. The thrust of this project is to
combine x-ray absorption spectroscopy and thin-layer electrochemistry and to
carry out in situ characterization of electrochemically generated species in
terms of oxidation state, coordination number, donor atom type, and bond length.
The materials to be studied include metal complexes in polymer-modified
electrodes and metal-metal bonded molybdenum and tungsten dimers. The principal
investigators will also design and build electrochemical cells which may reduce
or prevent x-ray induced sample damages. Such cells may be extremely useful for
x-ray absorption spectroscopic studies of bioinorganic materials. This research
should be important to an enhanced understanding of structural aspects of
electron transfer reactions.
