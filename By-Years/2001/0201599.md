ABSTRACT

This mathematical research focuses on equations of Monge-Ampere type and fully
nonlinear elliptic equations with geometric or physical motivation. The first
part of this project is devoted to several equations of Monge-Ampere type. In
particular, we propose to study regularity of solutions and other quantitative
properties such as the large time behavior of solutions and characterization of
associated nonlinear semigroups for several parabolic Monge-Ampere equations
arising in the deformation of surfaces, to develop regularity theory for weak
solutions of degenerate Monge-Ampere equations and study its interaction with
Monge-Kantorovich optimal mass transfer problem stemming from economics and
other areas of science, and to consider an equation arising in geometric optics
for the synthesis of reflector antennas. The second part of the project is
concerned with fully nonlinear elliptic equations without concavity condition,
regularity theory of weak solutions of Hessian equations, and the infinity
Laplacian equation as the Euler equation of minimizing Lipschitz extension.

This research is in the area of nonlinear partial differential equations. These
equations play a crucial role in the application of mathematics to real world.
Most phenomena in nature and society, such as heat transfer, flows in porous
media, construction of reflectors, optimal disposition of air masses, are
described by nonlinear partial differential equations. Study of these equations
will greatly help understand the nature of these phenomena and develop
practical, fast, and reliable numerical algorithms. One of the proposed problems
is related to Monge-Kantorovich optimal mass transfer problem appearing in
economic, physics, and meteorology. Another problem arises from the engineering
problem of construction of reflector antennas. The parabolic Monge-Ampere
equations are motivated from differential geometry and appear in the model of
worn stones. The proposed project has a strong connection with real harmonic
analysis and differential geometry. We expect that this research will stimulate
more interplay among these areas.
