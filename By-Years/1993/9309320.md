RIA: Towards a Generic Visual Query Language with Formal Basis for Object-
Oriented Databases This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
award. Object-oriented databases have been recognized as very useful for
advanced non-traditional applications such as design, planning, scheduling and
geographic applications. Recently a number of object-oriented data models have
been developed. To facilitate easy querying in these disparate models, a number
of visual query languages have been proposed. This project identifies the basic
constructs required for visual querying in object-oriented applications, and
uses them to design and implement a generic visual query language. This language
extends gracefully from relational and nested models to disparate object-
oriented models (extendibility). It uses as few basic language constructs as
necessary, while at the same time is versatile enough to encode specialized
query-features of diverse object-oriented languages (few but powerful core
language constructs). Furthermore, such encodings are user-friendly. The generic
language has strong theoretical foundations: (1) enabling formal semantics, with
proper consideration for safety, negation, etc., and a formal basis for
measuring expressivity and complexity; and (2) proving minimality of the
constructs and showing how they simulate other useful query-constructs, etc.
Such a generic language will provide a uniform front-end to users of diverse
object-oriented models and applications, and will play an important role if
developed as a server (analogous to SQL-servers) in a client- server
environment.
