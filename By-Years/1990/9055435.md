Michigan State University seeks funds for a three-year program to promote the
improvement of the teaching of mathematics to middle school minority students.
This will be accomplished through a three-week summer workshop for Professional
Development Teams of middle school mathematics teachers and support people
(secondary or college mathematics teachers, supervisors or administrators) from
eleven urban school districts in Michigan. Current exemplary materials in the
teaching of algebra, geometry and visualization, probability and statistics, and
contributions of African-Americans to mathematics will be used. Participants my
earn six hours of graduate credit for the summer workshop. School year follow-up
activities will include two, one-day conferences and two visits by staff members
to each of the school districts. Each year 45 middle school mathematics teachers
and support people will be enhanced and expected to return to their schools as
teacher-leaders to enhance an additional 225 second-wave teachers. In all 810
teachers and support people should be enhanced during the lifetime of the
project. Michigan State University's cost-sharing will account for 13% of the
NSF budget. Reaching, teaching and retaining minority students in mathematics is
an NSF and indeed a national goal of the highest priority. This project has the
potential of providing a prototypic model for an in-service delivery system
capable of empowering teachers to achieve this goal.
