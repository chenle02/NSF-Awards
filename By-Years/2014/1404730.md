Agents that selectively and efficiently extract anions (negatively charged ions)
from water are potentially useful for important applications such as the removal
of harmful anions from contaminated lakes and rivers, industrial and
agricultural wastes, and of anions interfering with certain technological
processes. Dr. Gellert Mezei of Western Michigan University conducts research to
gain a better understanding of the mechanism of formation of a new class of
agents for binding anions and the binding characteristics of these agents. His
research aims to provide fundamental insights important for improving strategies
to the design and synthesis of more efficient and selective receptors for anion
extractions. In addition to training graduate students, he recruits and engages
high school and undergraduate students (especially from underrepresented groups)
in research. Through outreach events, such as the activities on the "Chemistry
Day at the Museum" at the Kalamazoo Valley Museum, Dr. Mezei and his research
group educate the general public about science and the exciting careers
available through a degree in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses
on the synthesis and study of "nanojars" that selectively encapsulate anions,
such as sulfate, phosphate, arsenate and chromate. Each "nanojar" is comprised
of three or four macrocyclic copper complexes ([Cu(OH)(pz)]n, where
pz=pyrazolate, n=6-14) that self-assemble into a two nanometer-sized
supramolecular structure with a large number of hydrogen bonds directed toward
an anion inside the jar. A cation serves as a "lid" that seals the nanojar and
renders the anion completely buried and inaccessible. The Macromolecular,
Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of NSF supports Dr. Mezei's research
group to investigate the mechanism of formation of these nanojars and to
understand the thermodynamics of self-assembly and anion encapsulation. New
nanojars with substituted pyrazole ligands are designed to enhance their
selectivity for certain anions and to impart solubility in solvents of interest.
