The primary goal of this project is to determine both the prevalence and
magnitude of protactinium-uranium fractionation in volcanic rocks, so that the
igneous processes causing the fractionation can be identified and temporally
constrained. The secondary goal is to produce, purify, and calibrate an isotope-
dilution spike for Nb, and to develop the analytic methods to make isotope
dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID- TIMS) measurements of Nb in
geologic materials. A third goal assumes that protactinium and niobium have
chemical properties so similar that Nb may be considered a stable analog of Pa.
This hypothesis will be tested by analyzing young volcanic rock samples for Nb
as well as Pa, Th and U.
