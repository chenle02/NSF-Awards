9612327 Mistree The integration of at least three distinct design areas in
manufacturing organizations will be investigated, namely, product design,
manufacturing process design, and design of the organization itself.
Historically these activities have been carried out in relative isolation, by
separate people on different timelines. The following research questions will be
addressed: (1) How can a unified and mathematically rigorous approach be
implemented for designing products, manufacturing processes, and the
organization itself? (2) How can the design of these interdependent entities be
integrated and connected along a single design timeline? (3) How can the
strategic actions of many competitive and/or collaborative players be modeled in
a rigorous and quantitative design environment? (4) How can management strategy
and policy be designed in the face of such competitive and collaborative forces?
Answers to these questions will be built on applications of systems theory to
product design and a rigorous mathematical implementation of game theory. If
successful, this research will facilitate integrated product and process
development of designed-to-order and made-to-order systems, and it will impact
materiel acquisition in both the commercial and defense sectors. This will have
the benefit of achieving more effective utilization of resources and quicker
response to customer orders.
