The topic of proposed work is development of robust algorithms for vision-based
mobile robot navigation. A probabilistic framework is proposed for reliable
navigation between landmarks in an unmodeled environment. In the considered
strategy, the robot first explores its environment to learn the landmarks, and
then uses the graph produced in the process for navigation.
