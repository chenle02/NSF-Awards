9423613 Pine This proposal requests funds for Immaculata College to reconnect
its campus network at a much higher level to the Pennsylvania regional mid-level
network, PREPnet. Immaculata College is currently connected to PREPnet, but at a
minimal level which dos not adequately meet the needs of even the few faculty
and administrators who have a campus network connection. Upgraded access using a
frame relay connection, a router, and a CSU/DSU would immeasurably enhance the
available resources for faculty and staff research as well as facilitate
improved information service to student at Immaculata. The benefits of this
NSFNET connection include e-mail between local and remote researchers and
educators, file transfer capability and the ability to use remote computer
resources. Also the college will have the ability to investigate innovation in
educational resources and incorporate them into their curricula.
