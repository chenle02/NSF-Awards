Hedges (OCE-9711690) ABSTRACT Hedges OCE-9711690 A major area of interest in
marine sciences is the distribution and preservation of organic matter in marine
sediments. The PI has been a key contributor to studies in this area, and he
proposes to continue his research on the forms, distributions and preservation
of organic matter in marine sediments. A major aim of this proposal is to
identify shifts in the major biochemical compositions of sedimentary organic
mixtures subjected to varying extents of degradation. New analytical techniques
would be brought to bear on existing sediment samples which would be selectively
extracted for organic carbon. Thus in addition to bulk characterizations,
analyses by 13C NMR would be added to provide more detailed organic
compositional data. Results from this study would be expected to unravel the two
fundamental issues in the preservation of organic matter in marine sediments,
namely 1) how oxygen-sensitivity relates to protective sorption of organic
matter in sediments and 2) to what extent oxygen- sensitive organic matter might
be directly derived from hydrolysis-resistant biomacromolecues.
