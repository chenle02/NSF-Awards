The inherently parallel nature and high speed of optics, combined with the
recent technological advancements in optical logic, storage and interconnect
devices are raising hopes for practical realization of highly parallel optical
computing systems. This research explores the application of optics to symbolic
computing using the Content-addressable Memory (CAM) model. It covers algorithm
development, architectural design and experimental demonstration. The approach
consists of examining the computational requirement of symbolic computing tasks,
and implementing them as directly as possible, thereby as efficiently as
possible, using the parallelism and high speed of optical systems.
