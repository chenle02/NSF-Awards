Earthworms show promise of being excellent indicators of vicariance events, due
to their apparent failure to cross salt water. Unfortunately, so little is known
about earthworms in the Caribbean Basin that they cannot be used to test any
biogeographical hypotheses. This project aims to partially correct that
deficiency by conducting a complete survey of the Greater Antilles and some of
the Lesser Antilles. The Trigaster group of genera and the Central American and
Antillean Notiodrilus will be revised based on the collections to be made. Data
derived from the survey will be used to test the hypothesis that earthworms have
not dispersed to the volcanic southern Lesser Antilles. This project will
provide the distributional and taxonomic data necessary to begin work on larger
biogeographical and geological questions about Caribbean Basin history, as well
as on important species conservation and ecological concerns.
