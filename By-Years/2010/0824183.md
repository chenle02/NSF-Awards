Objective&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop an opto-fluidic
hybrid miniaturized flow cytometry. The approach is to implement an integrated,
fully functionalized on-chip system, which is capable of (1) three-dimensional
(3D) focusing of cells, (2) flexible manipulation of light in both X-Y and X-Z
planes, and (3) simultaneous collection of all three types of light signals
(forward scattering, side scattering, and fluorescence).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will
address two major problems in the existing miniaturized flow cytometry chips:
lack of flow focusing in the vertical (Z) direction and lack of on-chip focusing
of light. Its functionality and simplicity of fabrication and assembly will make
the proposed system attractive for both fundamental biomedical research and
clinical applications. Moreover, it will shed light on our understanding in the
light and fluid interactions at microscale, providing momentum to the emerging
field of optofluidics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;In addition
to its technical contributions, the project will impact society by implementing
vigorous education and outreach programs that are closely integrated with the
proposed research and designed for groups at all levels (general public,
undergraduates, and graduate students). Underrepresented students will
participate extensively in the proposed research and be recruited through the
Penn State WISER and MURE programs. Results and expertise developed during the
course of this project will be incorporated into the PI's teaching activities.
To obtain the broadest possible impact, the PI will partner with the Penn State
MRSEC to develop a suite of demonstrations in MEMS/NEMS and deliver them to the
general public.
