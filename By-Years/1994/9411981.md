9411981 Hobeika This award is being supported under NSF's Small Grants for
Exploratory Research program. The focus of the project is to study the impacts
of the short and long-term transportation strategies deployed after the January
17, 1994 Northridge, California earthquake. Two tasks will be pursued: (1) the
collection of data on the closure of transportation facilities in the immediate
aftermath of the earthquake and its impacts on transportation services, and (2)
the analysis of short and long- term emergency traffic management procedures
used to minimize transportation disruptions. ***
