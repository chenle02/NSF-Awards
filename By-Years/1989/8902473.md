This research effort is concerned with several topics of current interest in
applied mathematics, especially those associated with nonlinear phenomena in
continuum mechanics. Emphasis is placed on both the physical phenomena and the
mathematical theories used to describe nonlinear wave and stability
characteristics in hydrodynamics. Specifically, a systematic study will be made
of a new theoretical approach to nonlinear stability. This development
emphasizes the importance of mean flow/first harmonic interactions, rather than
the more usual ones that involve the generation of higher harmonics, as the
driving mechanism underlying the evolution of 3-D disturbances in shear flows.
Some special cases have already been considered and it is believed that this
approach could have important consequences to a broad range of instability
problems. The PI intends to consider a number of further applications so that
the range of its applicability can be fully assessed.
