The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of
Alabama in Huntsville has initiated the development of a comprehensive
laboratory which provides "hands-on" education in digital signal processing,
control, robotics, and communications. Two adjacent and identical rooms with an
area of 1500 square ft. are provided for this lab. There are 12 workstations in
each room. The main components of these workstations are: TMS320C30 DSP
Evaluation Board, an IBM 386/25 MHz computer, DSP hardware and software
development systems. The TMS320C30 DSP is a high performance 32 bit floating-
point device in the TMS32O family of single-chip DSPs. The 60-ns cycle time of
the TM5320C30 allows it to execute operations at a performance rate up to 33
MFLOPS with parallel multiply and ALU operations on both integer and floating-
point data in a single cycle. The TMS320C30 real-time performance offer flexible
design approach in a variety of applications. At the junior level, students are
introduced to the implementation of basic DSP algorithms such as sampling
techniques, convolution, correlation, and fast Fourier transforms using the
TMS320C30 Evaluation Board. At the senior level, students apply these tools to
implement design projects in the areas of control, robotics, or communications.
