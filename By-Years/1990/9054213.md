This workshop is focusing on the installation and implementation of PC-based
data acquisition systems in science and technology laboratories and is geared
towared science or engineering technology faculty teaching in associate degree
programs in the New York City/New Jersey metropolitan area. The workshop
includes instruction in transducers, signal conditioning, analog to digital and
digital to analog converters and conversions, programming, and data acquisition
systems, as well as intensive hands-on experience with systems and components,
installation, and debugging. Participants plan a project to install a computer-
based data acquisition system in one of their own laboratories.//
