Dr. David Gillette, the State Paleontologist of Utah, is currently involved in
the excavation of "Seismosaurus", an as-yet undescribed sauropod dinosaur
discovered in central New Mexico. Current estimates suggest that this individual
may measure 140' in length, roughly half again as long as the largest known
dinosaur. This well-preserved specimen is the first articulated sauropod
dinosaur discovered in many decades, and study of the specimen, once excavated,
will shed new light on the size limits on terrestrial animals. Excavation of
this dinosaur skeleton has been aided by several new remote sensing techniques
(ground- penetrating radar, scintillation counting, magnetometry, and seismic
diffraction tomography), under development at Los Alamos National Lab. These
exploration tools are being developed to help locate buried containers of toxic
waste and other hazardous materials, and the only way to test their accuracy and
reliability is to excavate the dinosaur. The proposed excavation has the
potential for profound impact on our understanding of dinosaurs, and the size
limits of terrestrial life. The project may have the added benefit of helping
efforts to dispose of hazardous waste materials.
