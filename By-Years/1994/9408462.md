This project is designing an architecture and compiler for video signal
processing, with collaboration among researchers in computer architecture,
compilers, and signal processing. The architecture is a very long instruction
word machine dedicated to the applications, which means that a large number of
small data paths are used. Address generation may receive hardware support. The
compiler differs in several ways from general purpose compilers: optimization is
sought even at the cost of high compilation times, and memory usage will be
explicitly optimized. Architecture and compiler design are being evaluated by
experimentation with application codes, including video compression, image
enhancement, and machine vision. The architecture is being simulated on a
network of high-performance workstations, while the compiler is being
constructed based on the Gnu C compiler. The architecture and compiler will be
iteratively improved to result in a high- performance system and a set of design
principles.
