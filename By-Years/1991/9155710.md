We propose to create the Geometry Forum, which will consist of the following
three elements: o an electronic database containing a great deal of useful
information on geometry in all its aspects -- its teaching, modern research
questions, information on mathematics education projects, records of student
interactions and questions; o a community consisting of the many satisfied users
of the database (often conducting their own private electronic mail
correspondence on the side): high school and college students, high school and
college teachers, pure and applied research geometers, developers of materials
and researchers into geometry education; o especially user-friendly software for
creating, maintaining, and accessing the electronic database, which allows
sophisticated techniques for browsing and searching, uses symbols and diagrams,
and implements hypertext features. In effect, we will be creating a dynamic
geometry journal, together with a large and diverse group of
readers/contributors. Users will have their own personalized electronic journal,
with immediate access to all previous material, and easy means of making their
own contributions. Our Forum will contribute both to new telecommunications
technology, and to education. We will expand the possibilities for student
learning via telecommunications, and also increase the geometry resources
available to teachers (including such personal resources as support groups). Our
Forum should also make it possible for the geometry research community to become
meaningfully involved with the education of school students.
