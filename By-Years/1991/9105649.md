This proposal deals with control of linear systems driven by poorly known
Markov processes and white noise. Nonlinear filtering techniques can give the
conditional probability distribution of the current state of the Markov process
in terms of system's history. In this way the controller learns about the poorly
known processes based on the observation of their past performance. Specific
examples of applications of the type of control problems discussed in this
proposal include models of solar electric generating stations, where the Markov
process is the variation of the solar power due to cloud cover, and certain
pursuit-evasion problems, where the pursuer bases its strategy on the past
performance of the evader.
