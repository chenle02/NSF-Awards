In modern server architectures, the processor socket and the memory
system&lt;br/&gt;are implemented as separate modules. Data exchange between
these modules&lt;br/&gt;is expensive -- it is slow, it consumes a large amount
of energy, and there&lt;br/&gt;are long wait times for narrow data links.
Emerging big-data workloads will&lt;br/&gt;require especially large amounts of
data movement between the processor&lt;br/&gt;and memory. To reduce the cost of
data movement for big-data workloads,&lt;br/&gt;the project attempts to design
new server architectures that can leverage&lt;br/&gt;3D stacking technology. The
proposed approach, referred to as Near Data&lt;br/&gt;Computing (NDC), reduces
the distance between a subset of computational&lt;br/&gt;units and a subset of
memory, and can yield high efficiency for workloads&lt;br/&gt;that exhibit
locality. The project will also develop new big-data &lt;br/&gt;algorithms and
runtime systems that can exploit the properties of the&lt;br/&gt;new
architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will lead to technologies that
can boost performance and&lt;br/&gt;reduce the energy demands of big-data
workloads. Several reports have&lt;br/&gt;cited the importance of these
workloads to national, industrial, and&lt;br/&gt;scientific computing
infrastructures. The project outcomes will be&lt;br/&gt;integrated into
University of Utah curricula and will play a significant&lt;br/&gt;role in a new
degree program on datacenter design and operation. The&lt;br/&gt;PIs will
broaden their impact by publicly distributing parts of their&lt;br/&gt;software
infrastructure and by engaging in outreach programs that&lt;br/&gt;involve
minorities and K-12 students.
