ABSTRACT Special Algebra Meetings in the Midwest DMS - 0753127



The goal of the activities supported by this grant is to create strong
scientific interactions among the centers in Algebraic Geometry and Commutative
Algebra that are located at Purdue University, the University of Illinois at
Chicago, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of
Kentucky, and the University of Notre Dame. The various research groups at these
institutions have compatible interests, but at the same time complementary
expertise, and collaborations are already ongoing. Primarily, this goal will be
achieved by promoting a series of bi-annual rotating conferences and by
supporting the mobility of graduate students, junior faculty members, and
visitors. These types of initiatives will help graduate students, postdocs and
young faculty broaden their mathematical background and start new
collaborations.

Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra have seen a great deal of advances
in the past years, most notably through a recent breakthrough in the minimal
model program. Particularly fruitful has been the interaction between the two
fields, which will also be the focus of the activities supported by this grant.
In addition, the advent of high-speed computers and the development of
algorithms have led to a line of research in Algebra and Geometry that is close
to applications. An area of common interest of the groups at Purdue, UI Chicago,
Kentucky, and Notre Dame have been the topics of multiplier ideals, integral
closures, and cores. The other areas of common interest among the groups at
Purdue, UIC, and UIUC are intersection multiplicities and related problems, and
the homological conjectures. Our groups approach these subjects from different
points of views, ranging from complex analytic geometry to commutative algebra
and combinatorics. This makes an exchange of ideas and the mutual training of
graduate students even more crucial. The series of conferences will showcase
recent progress in various areas of algebra and geometry, including Hilbert
functions and multiplicities, Groebner bases and computational algebra, liaison
theory, the homological conjectures, problems in positive and mixed
characteristic, tight closure and its interaction with birational geometry,
resolution of singularities, Rees algebras, multiplier ideals, cores and
Briancon-Skoda type theorems. To this end many of the national and international
experts in these areas will be brought together, but there will also be ample
opportunities for young researchers to present and discuss their work. It is an
implicit expectation that many new fruitful collaborations will emerge.
