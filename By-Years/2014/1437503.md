This grant provides international travel support for U.S. based graduate student
participants to attend the 2014 International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM
2014), which will be held in Shenzhen, China, on December 14-17, 2014. It is
expected to provide scholarships to 16 U.S. based graduate student participants.
The award results will be announced at the ICDM 2014 conference website. A
strong representation of U.S. researchers at the Conference is useful in
maintaining U.S. competitiveness in this important area. The total number of
ICDM participants in the past has been in excess of 500, with a majority of the
participants from the U.S., then Europe and Asia. This grant will partially
support the travel costs for the U.S. based graduate student participants.
Participation in international meetings is a key to effective scientific career
development for graduate students.
