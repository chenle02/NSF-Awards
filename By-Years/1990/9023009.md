The objective of this proposal is the production of cie crystals by the
propellers of aircraft when operated in supercooled clouds. These crystals
comprise an undesirable contamination when research aircraft attempt to measure
the ice structure of natural clouds. Reduced pressure at the propeller tip is
thought to initiate artificial nucleation; this and other candidate processes
will be investigated using the King Air aircraft.
