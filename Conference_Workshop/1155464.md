The University of Nebraska will host a two-day Conference on Mathematical
Ecology, to take place in Lincoln, Nebraska on April 14-15, 2012. The conference
theme is Population Dynamics and will be held in conjunction with the Howard
Rowlee Lecture, an endowed public lecture intended for a general audience,
presented annually by the Department of Mathematics. The 2012 Rowlee address
will be given on April 13, 2012 by Mark Lewis, Professor of Mathematics and
Biology at the University of Alberta. This conference will present an efficient
interdisciplinary overview of current state-of-the-art research in population
ecology, and will focus on the interplay between modeling, data collection,
parameter estimation, numerical simulation, and mathematical analysis. The
conference will feature 15 half-hour presentations by some of the most
distinguished researchers in the field, a poster session, three organized
40-minute discussion times, and evening activities to encourage informal
interactions. The conference will foster contacts between mathematicians and
ecologists, and between early-career researchers and eminent researchers,
encouraging new ideas and collaborations. Financial support will be used for
partial support of travel and lodging for the participants, primarily for
students and researchers in the early stages of their careers, and is intended
to make the conference as accessible as possible to a diverse group of
researchers.
