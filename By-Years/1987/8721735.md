The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) under the direction of Theodore H.
Geballe at Stanford University has three major objectives: to support
multidisciplinary efforts in materials research which require the participation
of several investigators to make progress; to fund an important set of central
facilities which support a wide range of materials research on campus; and to
start outstanding new research efforts rapidly and intelligently through the use
of "seed money". Of the 60 or so faculty members currently active in the MRL,
about 35 participate in thrust area research or receive direct MRL project
support. There are about 35 graduate students and 4 postdoctoral research
associates in the program, which maintains strong links with industrial and
government research laboratories through cooperative research. Seven students
participate in the NSF "Research Experience for Undergraduates" program through
the Stanford MRL. The research program includes major thrust areas in
optoelectronic and infrared materials, polymer structure and dynamics, structure
and properties of thin films (primarily high- temperature superconducting
materials), and photon materials research using free electron laser and
synchrotron sources to address electronic properties of surfaces and interfaces.
A particular strength of the Stanford MRL is its ability to span the range from
basic science to engineering the individual thrust areas as well as in the
program as a whole. The thrust research is strongly interactive, faculty are
first-rate and the quality of students and postdoctoral associates is very high.
The MRL is well equipped and is addressing scientifically challenging and
technologically significant research problems. The research on optoelectronic
and infrared materials, polymers, and high-temperature superconducting thin
films is at the forefront; the research on photon materials science involving
the free electron laser and synchrotron radiation studies of surface chemistry
is an exciting new initiative. Seed funding is used effectively, and there are
strong interactions with industrial research groups.
