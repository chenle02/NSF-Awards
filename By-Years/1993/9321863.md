Abstract - Barton - 9321863 Concerns over process safety, advances in automation
technology, and restrictions on venting to the atmosphere have resulted in the
installation of increasingly sophisticated automatic protective devices on
process equipment. These devices enable a plant to respond quickly and
accurately to emergency situations with a series of prespecified actions,
without relying on the performance of the control system, or the training and
reactions of operators. Automatic protective devices range from simple
mechanical devices such as a float and valve arrangement, to complicated
interlock functions that define relationships amongst several items of
equipment. In modern plants these devices are usually referred to collectively
as the safety interlock system (SIS), and the responsibilities of this system
also includes alarms and trips. The SIS is installed in order to keep the plant
safe, not to produce a product, and has two functions: to protect the plant from
equipment failures, and to protect against higher level control failures or
operator errors. This research will develop mathematical methods and software
tools for the detailed quantitative analysis of a process and its safety
interlock system. It will focus on the enhancement of general purpose dynamic
simulations software to cope with comprehensive models including details of both
physical behavior and safety interlocks. Several tasks will be undertaken: 1.
Development of a symbolic language and user interface that will facilitate the
efficient construction of models for safety interlock systems. 2. Development of
a novel algorithm for the simultaneous solution of the differential-algebraic
equations derived from the physico-chemical phenomena, and the classical
propositional logic derived from the interlock system. 3. Implementation of
these advances in a modern process modeling environment and demonstration
through a series of detailed examples furnished by industrial collaborators.
