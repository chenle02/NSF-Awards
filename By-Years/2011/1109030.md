Almog&lt;br/&gt;1109030&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator studies several
fundamental theoretical problems of superconductivity. Through analysis of the
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model, he examines:&lt;br/&gt;1. Critical
currents, and bounds on them, associated with the loss of stability of the
normal and superconducting states in two and three dimensions. &lt;br/&gt;2.
Phase transitions between these states in various circumstances. &lt;br/&gt;3.
Critical currents under magnetic field effects near the normal state.
&lt;br/&gt;4. Highly nonlinear effects of induced magnetic fields.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Superconductors are metals that at a sufficiently low
temperature exhibit two important properties:&lt;br/&gt;1. They lose entirely
their electrical resistivity. &lt;br/&gt;2. The magnetic field is excluded from
the superconducting area. &lt;br/&gt;Superconductors have great technological
potential for applications ranging from magnetic sensors, through generators of
large magnetic fields, to high power transmitters. The investigator studies the
behavior of superconducting materials near the critical current, the maximum
current density which can flow through a superconducting wire with (practically)
zero resistance. He focuses on the transition between the normal and
superconducting states, how stable these states are, and effects of induced
magnetic fields on the critical current. Of particular interest is the disparity
between experimental measures of the critical current and theoretical
predictions of the critical current in the absence of magnetic fields.
Determining the maximal current a superconductor can carry before reverting to
the normal state where material resistivity causes energy losses is an important
consideration in superconductor technologies. The project sheds light on both
the nucleation of superconductivity for decreasing currents, and on the loss of
superconducting properties when the electric current increases.
