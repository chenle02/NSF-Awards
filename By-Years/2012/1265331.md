This I-Corps team plans to further develop a software tool that takes x86 binary
programs as input (including stripped binaries), and produces equivalent source-
code programs in C. The binary can be compiled from any language. The output C
code is not the same as the original source code, but is functionally
equivalent. The output C code is fully functional: it can be modified,
recompiled, and run as needed. Alternately, the software can output a rewritten
binary, or the intermediate representation (IR) of the open-source LLVM
compiler, allowing further analysis and transformation of binary code with
existing or new LLVM passes. The software developed by the team is able to
perform deep binary analysis where the output code is high-level, containing
symbols, functions, arguments, return values, types (including aggregate types),
and there are high-level control flow constructs, and an abstract stack. Alias
analysis and type recovery schemes have been developed that work synergistically
to do effective alias analysis on binary code, and recover types including
aggregate types like structures and arrays. The team has also developed
technologies to rewrite stripped binaries (i.e., those without relocation and
symbolic information).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With further development this
software tool may be a valuable tool for the recovery of source code from legacy
binaries. Both in government and industry, legacy code is run every day, but its
source code is often hard to track or lost, given that the original code vendor
may have gone through corporate mergers, reorganization or liquidations. Re-
developing code from scratch can be costly and difficult to replicate as the
full scope of the original functionality is often unknown. In these cases, this
software tool may be able to provide source code that can be understood,
maintained, updated and recompiled with newer compliers and for newer versions
of the x86 instruction set. Additionally, this tool may have applications in
forensics to examine and understand the behavior of vulnerable or un-trusted
code prior to or after a security breach. This goes beyond existing security
tools in dynamic binary rewriters or binary analysis tools, which used automated
security tools that are useful, but cannot help with the human understanding of
un-trusted or vulnerable code.
