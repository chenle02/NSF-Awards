Surveys have determined that the majority of accidents, injuries, and fatalities
on two-lane rural roads are related to improper speed estimations. A technique
to achieve a correction for this problem is to improve the consistency in the
horizontal alignment which should result in an improved consistency in the
driver speeds and enhance traffic safety. This project will investigate a new
design procedure to analyze the consistencies and inconsistencies in road
characteristics and the corresponding driving behavior. The project will
determine boundaries for good design practices, boundaries to correct geometric
defects in the horizontal alignments, and will recommend solutions for the
different levels of dissimilarities in horizontal alignments. The results will
be very useful to transportation engineers and officials with respect to the
design or redesign of two-lane rural highways.
