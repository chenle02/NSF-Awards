This project is concerned with various questions about the structure of normal
singularities and of maps between varieties. The principal investigator will
determine if the product of complete ideals being complete characterizes
rational surface singularities. He will study the resolutions of singularities
of a normal Cohen-Macauley variety as well as the structure of birational maps
between algebraic manifolds. The structure of the local fundamental group of
surface singularities in positive characteristic will be investigated. This work
lies on the interface of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The
investigator will examine algebraic structures associated with a surface to see
if information can be derived concerning the surface. This is currently a very
active area of mathematics.
