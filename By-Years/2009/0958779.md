In this project, the proposing team will digitally record observations of the
state of the solar surface using UCLA's Mt. Wilson Observatory (MWO) 150-foot
solar tower telescope. MWO records of solar surface magnetic fields and flow
velocities go back to 1967, and the Principal Investgator for this project notes
that this long duration record provides a unique database for tests of existing
solar cycle models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Measurements of the state of motion
and magnetism on the Sun's surface are necessary for defining and testing models
of solar variability and instability, and MWO data will be provided to the
scientific and operational communities who develop quantitative predictions of
the space environment. MWO data will continue to help improve our understanding
of the sunspot cycle, and potentially make it possible to predict the level of
solar magnetic activity for future cycles, thereby contributing to operational
space weather forecasting.
