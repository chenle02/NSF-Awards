This project supports participation in two workshops: "Combinatorial
Representation Theory of Algebras and Applications" (May 12-14, 2023: North
Carolina State University) and "Quantum Groups, Quantum Symmetric Pairs and
their Categorifications" (March 1-3, 2024, University of Virginia) in the
Southeastern Lie Theory Workshop Series. The Southeast Lie Theory Consortium and
Workshop Series will continue to stimulate and enhance regional research
collaboration in Lie theory and representation theory in the Southeastern United
State. Featured expository talks at the workshops by leading researchers will
provide an avenue for graduate students and early-career researchers to enhance
their research programs. The opportunities for mathematical interactions and
mentorship during the conferences will foster a strong regional tradition of
research and education.

The proposed workshops are broadly concerned with the representation theory of
Lie algebras, quantum groups, and related algebraic structures. These topics
have numerous connections to theoretical physics, number theory, algebraic
geometry, and other disciplines. Research in these fields involves the study of
a broad range of algebraic, combinatorial, or categorical objects, a sampling of
which includes: quantized enveloping algebras, quantum function algebras, Kac--
Moody Lie algebras, Hecke algebras, canonical bases and crystal bases, vertex
operator algebras, Hall algebras, quivers, cluster algebras, Hopf algebras, and
Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras. In general, the representation theory of
quantized Kac--Moody Lie algebras and its accompanying categorical and geometric
developments has taken on a significant role not only within Lie theory but also
in other areas of mathematics and physics such as combinatorics, group theory,
number theory, integrable systems, low-dimensional topology and conformal field
theory. The workshop series website is https://www.math.lsu.edu/~pramod/selie/.
