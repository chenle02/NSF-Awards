The primary objective at this U.S.-Czechoslovakia research project between Dr.
Timothy Keiderling of the University of Illinois and Dr. Petr Pancoska of
Charles University is to determine reliable empirical interpretations of protein
spectroscopic data for secondary structure. The researchers will employ various
vibrational spectroscopies, including circular dichroism. The combination of
techniques is intended to draw upon strengths of each to produce uniform
systematic analysis for spectral data. The reference proteins used to calibrate
the analytical methods will be those for which good crystal structure data are
available. Cluster analysis and neural network analysis will be employed to
clarify inter-relationships in initial structural parameters. Results would be
linked for an optimized single computational model. The hope is that the use of
such a standard model for spectral data treatment will simplify understanding
the wealth of new literature being produced on protein characterization. This
project in experimental physical chemistry fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the United
States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
