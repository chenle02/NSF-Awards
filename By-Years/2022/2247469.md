The project centers on the investigation of how information about small scale
distortion of a spatial transformation influences information about the
transformation on a global scale. The ideal case of no distortion occurs when
the transformation is conformal, a type of transformation with widespread uses
in physics and engineering. Transformations with less strict restrictions on
their distortion have also found uses in fields such as the study of elastic
bodies. The project will deepen current understanding of the weaker forms of
such distortion restrictions. The methods to be employed mix multiple fields of
mathematics including non-smooth analysis, topology, and differential geometry,
with potential to strengthen the connections between all of these separate
fields. An auxiliary goal of the project is to produce expository texts that
make tools from other mathematical fields more accessible to experts in non-
smooth analysis.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The primary aim of this project is to
investigate various topological obstruction phenomena arising in the field of
higher-dimensional quasiconformal analysis. These problems involve, for
instance, existence questions for quasiregular maps between manifolds and
limitations on the possible topological shapes of point-preimages under mappings
of finite distortion. The project is also expected to result in further
development of the recently conceived theory of quasiregular values, which
provides single-value versions of classical results in quasiconformal analysis.
A further objective of the project is to improve upon and find applications for
underutilized tools of quasiconformal analysis, such as conformal de Rham
cohomology theories and the moduli of surface
families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
