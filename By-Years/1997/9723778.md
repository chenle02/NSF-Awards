97-23778 Newman EST sequences have provided the most immediate and versatile
sequence information on expressed genes. The Arabidopsis EST sequence databank
will be expanded through this work. In order to improve the impact of the
sequence information in the 12,000 EST that are already available, the 3Ä± ends
of these clones will also be determined, thus providing information on gene copy
numbers. In addition, novel transcripts will be obtained by selecting and
screening of cell-, tissue-, and developmental stage-specific libraries. It is
expected that an additional 5,000 unique sequences can be provided during the
award period as a service to the community.
