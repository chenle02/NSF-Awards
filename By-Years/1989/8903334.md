TonB is a protein required for active transport of several ligand molecules
across the outer membrane of E. coli, including iron-bearing siderophores and
vitamin B12. The current model for TonB function is that it couples cytoplasmic
membrane potential energy to conformational changes in the outer membrane
receptors, which in turn results in transport of the ligands across the
membrane. The goal of this project is to biochemically analyze TonB function
within the context of this model. The relationship of TonB instability to its
function will be investigated by immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled
TonB in pulse-chase experiments. Structural features of the unusual proline-rich
regions of TonB will be analyzed for functional significance by creation of
specific mutations using site-directed in vitro mutagenesis techniques. The role
of potential membrane anchors at both the carboxyl and amino termini of the TonB
proteins will be determined using membrane fractionation techniques combined
with site-specific TonB mutants. This project will explore a structurally and
functionally unusual and important membrane protein. The results will be of
interest to protein biochemists as well as cell biologists, since general
principles concerning structure-function relationships are likely to emerge. In
addition, the information which will be generated concerning the structure and
role of TonB in active transport of necessary nutrients may be useful in
combatting pathogenic Gram- negative bacteria.
