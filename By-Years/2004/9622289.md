9622289 Clark This Research Equipment Grant will be used to purchase a variable
frequency microwave system that will be used to support research projects at the
Microwave Processing Research Facility at the University of Florida concerning
microwave effects on liquid and solid state materials processing. The proposed
equipment operates at various frequencies and power settings which will extend
microwave processing research studies to understanding the effects of variable
frequency effects on microwave materials processing. Currently, multiple
frequency capabilities do not exist in the microwave processing facility.
Therefore, this equipment will extend the research capability of the facility to
explore an area untouched before and should lead to new results. ***
