This collaborative award, made under the Materials Chemistry and Chemical
Processing Initiative is supported by the Divisions of Chemistry, Materials
Research, and Chemical and Thermal Systems. New precursors will be prepared that
will participate in the chemical vapor deposition of high-performance
semiconductors and ceramic materials under kinetic control. Intermediates in
chemical vapor deposition and vapor phase epitaxy will be identified and their
reactivity will be correlated with film growth. Mechanisms of film growth will
also be studied. A novel reactor system will be employed permitting new
approaches to the identification, and spatial and temporal monitoring of species
formed upon thermal decomposition of gaseous precursor molecules at solid
surfaces. %%% Reactive intermediates formed from precursors used in established
vapor deposition and vapor-phase epitaxy processes are largely unknown.
Identifying them and monitoring their reaction rates will contribute to more
effective process control and also extend to the deposition of entirely new
materials.
