This project seeks to improve our understanding of dynamical mechanisms
responsible for the formation and maintenance of zonal jets and their
implications for atmospheric mixing and transport. The approach is underpinned
by the observation that potential vorticity (PV) is a fundamental dynamical
quantity that can unify questions of small-scale eddy mixing, wave propagation
on jets, and mixing due to wave breaking in their vicinity. In particular, the
project will address: (i) fundamental constraints on zonal jets arising from
angular momentum conservation (natural, since zonal mean structures such as
zonal jets contain most of the atmosphere's angular momentum) and flow
stability; (ii) wave dynamics (and associated eddy momentum fluxes) and the role
of critical levels; the role also of edge waves propagating on a PV jump in
contrast to waves propagating on a smooth background PV gradient; (iii) PV
mixing as a route to zonal jet formation, independently of the direction of
energy cascade; (iv) tracer mixing and transport and the role of jets as
transport barriers; (v) jet evolution and mechanisms of jet merger; (vi)
secondary circulations and the development of steep tracer gradients through
vertical motions; alignment of tracer and PV gradients. The dynamical processes
involved govern zonal structures observed in the terrestrial atmosphere and
oceans as well as in the atmospheres of the gas giants.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will impinge on several areas of climate science,
including variability of the mid-latitude storm tracks, subtropical jet, and
Arctic oscillation, the hydrological cycle, stratospheric ozone recovery, the
dynamical coupling of the stratosphere and troposphere, and transport and mixing
across the extratropical tropopause.
