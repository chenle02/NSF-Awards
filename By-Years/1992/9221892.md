The project will support the Joint Summer Research Conferences in the
Mathematical Sciences, administered by the American Mathematical Society, the
Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics and the Institute of Mathematical
Statistics. Between six and ten one or two-week conferences have been held
annually since 1982 on a broad range of mathematical topics. The 1993 Summer
Research Conferences will be held during the period July 10 - August 6, 1993 at
the University of Washington in Seattle, WA on the following topics: (1)
curvature equations in conformal geometry, (2) multivariable operator theory,
(3) spectral geometry, (4) recent developments in the inverse Galois problem,
(5) mathematics of superconductivity, (6) distributions with fixed marginals,
doubly stochastic measures, and Markov operators, and (7) applications of
hypergroups and related measure algebras.
