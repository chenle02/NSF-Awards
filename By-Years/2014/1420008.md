This project, to be conducted at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, will study algebra learning and problem-solving by college
students and children age 12-14. The project will use behavioral and brain
imaging methods to examine when problems are solved using symbols versus images.
The results will be used to develop a computational model of mathematical
reasoning, and to inform practices for teaching math. This project will advance
the work of the REAL (Research on Education and Learning) program in studying
the cognitive and neural basis of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics) learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use fMRI
(functional magnetic resonance imaging) to study brain activity, focusing on
brain regions including the RLPFC (rostrolateral prefrontal cortex) and AG
(angular gyrus). The computational modeling will take place using the ACT-R
(Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) model. The main theoretical focus will be
how symbolic and visuospatial processes are used and integrated during math
learning and problem-solving.
