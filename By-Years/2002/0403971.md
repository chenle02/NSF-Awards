0403971&lt;br/&gt;Vazquez&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory research proposes to
develop quantitative measures of the changes in one cell function, chemotaxic
migration, induced by the multivalent binding of one adapter protein needed to
initiate chemotaxic signal cascades, Growth Factor Receptor Bound-2 (GRB2).
Measurable changes in cell behavior will lead to the exciting possibility of
using multivalent nanoprobes to alter or direct cell behavior as a new
means&lt;br/&gt;for therapeutic intervention.&lt;br/&gt;
