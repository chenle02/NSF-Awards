9628033 Kastens The PIs propose a multi-national collaboration to quantify
contemporary deformation of the Eastern Mediterranean region using measurements
from the Global Positioning System (GPS). They will incorporate existing GPS
data from their former campaigns from 1988-1994, and will reoccupy and collect
new data in September of 1995. They will also install a number of permanent
sites in the region. The new information resulting from this study will help
quantify rates and styles of deformation in the region, thereby constraining
models for lithospheric rheology and dynamics in this and similar collisional
settings. ***
