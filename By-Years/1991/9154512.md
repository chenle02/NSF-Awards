This project will develop a model mathematics portfolio practice in which
cycles of productive activity and assessment recur throughout each curriculum
unit. The model is grounded in work in developmental psychology that emphasizes
social and cultural supports and the role of motivation in children's learning.
Two studies are planned: (a) a trial of portfolio practice to refine it and the
measures needed to evaluate it; (b) a systematic comparison among classrooms
that vary in curriculum approach and portfolio use to evaluate the impact of
portfolio practice on classroom instruction and assessment, on teachers'
knowledge of students' mathematical understandings and motivations, and on
students' own understandings and motivations. Research measures include
quantitative (group tasks, questionnaires) and qualitative (individual tasks and
interviews, videotapes of classroom practices, field notes) methods. The work
has import for diverse audiences: For educators, a completed set of materials
for classroom portfolio assessment; for researchers, increased knowledge of
fundamental relations among assessment and instruction practices and teacher and
student outcomes; for evaluation specialists, an effective system of classroom
assessment that has implications for the design of coordinated external
assessments.
