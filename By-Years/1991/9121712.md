This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
program provides continued support for the research of William J. Evans of the
Chemistry Department, University of California at Irvine, on the chemistry of
organosamarium(II) compounds. Attempts will be made to isolate an alkene in a
cage created by a disamarium tetracyclopentadienyl cavity. Reactivity of cyclic
monoalkenes and dienes will be tested. Coupling reactions of alkynide complexes
of Sm(III) will be investigated, as will the details of the formation of the
sterically crowded tris(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)Sm compounds. Further work
will also be carried out on the recently characterized dinitrogen compounds,
especially concerning cleavage of the N-N bond and its substitution and
oxidation-reduction reactions. The utility of samarium species in formation of
poly(main group element) ions will be tested as will the promotion of reactions
photochemically. %%% This fundamental research project will explore the
organometallic chemistry of samarium, a lanthanide metal. Research on samarium
compounds of this type has been limited, so the goal of this work is to expand
the range of reactivity known for such compounds and to determine some of the
parameters affecting reaction mechanisms. Not only have compounds with unusual
structures been prepared, but they have also been found to participate in
reactions which may have some synthetic utility.
