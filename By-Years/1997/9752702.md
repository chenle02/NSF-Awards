This two-week summer workshop focuses on undergraduate faculty enhancement in
computer networks. Twenty computer science and engineering faculty from small
colleges/universities will be exposed to state-of-the-art developments in
computer networks, with emphasis on LANs, WANs, and emerging networking
technologies. During a typical day of the workshop, time is equally divided
between discussions on network concepts and theory, and laboratory assignments
involving various implementations of protocols and network designs. Each
participant maintains a complete notebook consisting of lecture notes,
quizzes/exams, and laboratory assignments for possible use in future network
courses at the home institution. Michigan State University network facilities,
including the Computer Science Department's High-speed Networking Research
Laboratory, will be available to participants for workshop related activities.
As a follow-up of the proposed project, a quarterly newsletter will be available
to participants via the Internet. Participants will attend SIGCSE99 and have an
opportunity to share experiences. Experts on computer networks will be available
to participants throughout the workshop.
