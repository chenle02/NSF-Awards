Subcommittee on Global Change Research (SGCR) of the Committee on Earth and
Natural Resources (CENR) of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC),
including for the USGCRP Office; development of documentation, including
translation and printing; and activities related to planning and development of
new international, including regional, research institutions and mechanisms for
global change research. A major international focus will be the work of the
International Group of Funding Agencies for Global Change Research (IGFA). IGFA
is presently addressing issues such as arrangements for support of international
project offices (IPO's) for global change research projects; refining its
initial assessment of reservations and data management required for global
change research; observations and data management required for global change
research; and needs and potential opportunities for cooperation between research
funding and development aid agencies in support of global regional activities
such as those of the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction
(IRI); Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN); and European
Network for Research in Global Change (ENRICH). ***
