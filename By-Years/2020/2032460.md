This award contributes to national prosperity by advancing planning methods for
combined drone/truck fleets to serve critical societal needs, such as energy
transmission infrastructure monitoring, urban police patrolling, rural and
suburban mail delivery, roadway pavement inspection, and traffic monitoring.
Despite the significant opportunities offered by drones for remote operations,
their limited flying time and small battery capacity hamper large-scale
operations. Coordination between drones and roadway-dependent motor vehicles,
such as trucks, can help resolve these issues by providing batteries and payload
required for continued drone services. This project will provide a novel
approach to cover large service areas using combined drone/truck fleets. This
award highlights the societal applications characterized by combined ‘arc’
routing, for which existing routing methods cannot provide adequate decision-
making tools. In particular, this project will validate the methods developed
through a case study involving surveillance of electric power transmission
lines, the backbone of the nation’s energy infrastructure. This project will
train the future workforce in computational operations research and develop
open-source software packages to support the further use of unmanned vehicles.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will advance our understanding of arc routing
problems in combined drone/truck fleets by developing computational optimization
models and algorithms. The combined drone/truck arc routing problem is
fundamentally different and significantly more challenging than traditional arc
routing problems because drones can fly directly from one point to another point
in the network without following ground arcs. In addition, a drone may serve
only part of an arc due to its limited capacity and footprint, or potentially
multiple distinct routes covering the entire arc. The optimal routing of mobile
hubs served by trucks must also be incorporated into this already challenging
problem. Furthermore, a drone may launch from one truck and return to another
truck if beneficial; therefore, synchronization between drones and trucks plays
a significant role. This project will provide a novel mixed-integer linear
programming formulation and adaptive heuristics based on decomposition, dynamic
programming, partitioning, large neighborhood search, and machine learning for
efficient operations of the combined fleets. The models and algorithms will be
validated with actual data from power transmission line
monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
