There is a critical need to erect bypass brides quickly to repair or replace the
on-line bridge structure. The concept could also be used to erect a new bridge
quickly. In response to the need, this project will investigate the feasibility
of using a standard form to produce precast shell-type bridges or bridge
segments which can be manufactured, transported, and erected quickly. The
investigation will study dimensions and methods of mass production for various
size bridges for different span lengths. This first phase will be an analytical
study to determine sizes and effect of various parameters to determine the
suitability of shell-type structures for bridges of short and intermediate
spans.
