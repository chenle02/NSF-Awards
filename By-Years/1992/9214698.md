In this project a method of pattern completion based on networks of artificial
neurons (neural networks) will be employed. The artificial neural network, in
effect, extracts the statistics of the spatially distributed field from punctual
observations and enables the field to be estimated at unobserved locations. The
method has some characteristics similar to kriging, but evolves from a
completely different perspective,. It also bears many striking similarities to
discriminant analysis. This similarity is exploited to provide a method of
generating random field samples for Monte Carlo simulation that are conditioned
on information,. The methods can be implemented very efficiently on massively
parallel computers and are amenable, in principle, to implementation in computer
hardware.
