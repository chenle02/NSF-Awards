Toward the long term goal of developing computational tools for dealing
efficiently with the complexity and the constraints of physical tasks, the
research targets the solution of several well defined robotics problems and the
improved understanding of algorithmic techniques that are useful for
applications arising in the physical world. The core areas of research include
the application of randomized methods to geometric problems, the incorporation
of physics-based models and techniques in geometric frameworks, and the
development of data structures for storing/searching geometric data and for
supporting continuous motion. A few key problems have been identified to guide
and inspire research in the above domains. These are: assembly with emphasis on
virtual prototyping for maintainability studies involving rigid and flexible
parts, path planning in cluttered environments, and manipulation with emphasis
on part orientation. Practical solutions will be sought for the above problems.
The proposed research plan thoroughly integrates educational activities at Rice
University. The main focus of these activities will be (a) the immersion of
students, and especially undergraduates, into research projects, (b) the
introduction of a course in robotics and the restructuring of basic theory
courses to include algorithmic techniques that have been proven useful in
graphics and robotics, (c) the mentoring of women students, and (d) the
promotion of industrial and interdisciplinary training for Ph.D. students.
