9410771 Delfyett Work will be performed on the generation, characterization, and
utilization of high power ultrashort optical pulses from semiconductor traveling
wave optical amplifiers. Funding for this effort is required to initiate and
establish a high speed photonics effort at the Center for Research and Education
for Optics and Lasers. The salient feature in this research proposal is to
exploit the large gain and bandwidth, which can be bandgap engineered into
semiconductor optical amplifiers in order to support the generation of
ultrashort, high power optical pulses from a compact efficient semiconductor
laser source. In addition, novel uses of this source will be developed for
applications in all optical photonic networks, real time nonlinear optical
signal processing, and real time optical recording and retrieval in three
dimensional, volume or multilayer-multiwavelength optical memories. ***
