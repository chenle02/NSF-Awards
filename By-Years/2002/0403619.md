Abstract

Proposal Title: NER: Nanostructured, Multilayered Polymeric Membranes for Gas
Separations Proposal Number: CTS-0403619 Principal Investigator: Peter Pintauro
Institution: Case Western Reserve University

This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering
initiative, NSF 03-043, category NER. The objective of this exploratory research
project is to fabricate, characterize and test a new class of polymer-based
membranes for permanent gas separations. The membranes will be composed of
between 30 and 2000 nm-thick continuous polymeric sublayers with a repeating
polymer layer sequence (e.g., A-B-A-B and A-B-C-B-A). The multilayer films will
be coextruded using a unique apparatus. Such new nanolayer membranes may
overcome the undesirable gas flux/selectivity limitation common to typical
polymeric membranes. The membrane fabrication work will proceed in two high-
risk/high-reward directions: (i) multilayer polymeric membranes with repeating
two or three polymer layer sequences and (ii) multilayer mixed-matrix membranes,
where a molecular sieve material is imbedded in multiple layers of a rubber
polymer, with numerous glassy polymer interlayers. The membranes will be tested
for the selective extraction of oxygen from air and the separation of hydrogen
from carbon dioxide. It is the nano-layering effect, from a fabrication,
application, and performance viewpoint. The experimental plan is to: (i) select
polymer and polymer composite materials for the individual membrane nanolayers,
(ii) design optimal repeating nanolayer sequences of these polymers, (iii)
fabricate membranes with a different number (30-2000) and thickness (10-100 nm)
of polymer layers, and (iv) test the membranes for O2/N2 and H2/CO2 separations.
In terms of the broader impacts, highly efficient membranes for oxygen removal
from air could be used in medical applications, fuel combustion, and in
hydrogen/air fuel cells. Successful outcomes will result in the creation of an
entirely new class of membranes, with a nano-layered morphology, that outperform
present-day membranes, in terms of permeability and selectivity.
