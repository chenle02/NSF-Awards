The main objectives of this project are: (1) to understand the relationship
among various properties of pyrite (e.g. reflectivity, hardness, anisotropy,
lattice cells, sulfur deficiency, conductivity, surface reactivity, 34S), the
specific pathways of pyrite formation (e.g. replacement of stable or metastable
iron monosulfide, direct precipitation from hydrothermal fluids), and the
mechanisms of polysulfide generation (e.g. H2 diffusion, H2S - SO42-reaction)
that are involved in the formation of hydrothermal pyrites, and (2) to determine
the kinetic and the equilibrium sulfur isotopic fractionation factors between
pyrite and various aqueous sulfur species. These objectives will be pursued by a
variety of hydrothermal experiments to synthesize iron disulfide minerals at
200oC - 350oC, by mineralogical, chemical, electrochemical and sulfur isotopic
investigations of the experimental run products. The results from this project
may provide a set of mineralogical and isotopic indicators of geochemical
processes and environments of ore formation, and of chemical and isotopic
compositions of hydrothermal fluids as well as information useful for the
development of pyrite as a semiconductor.
