This project is a response to mounting evidence that the secondary school
curriculum does not provide adequate experiences in mathematical modeling,
problem solving, the probability concepts. The proposed instructional design
emphasizes an eight step simulation model building process, and the process of
exploring simulation models as a strategy for developing problem solving skills
and for understanding probability concepts. The approach to development of the
materials is comprehensive: consideration is given to the student, teacher, and
teacher training, with special attention given to the teacher's role in
influencing instructional styles and curriculum change. The materials for
implementing the instructional design and strategy include a student manual,
teacher manual, and teacher training manual. These printed materials will be
accompanied by computer software and instructional fields for use by teacher and
student. This project aptly meets both the objectives of the Instructional
Materials Development Program as well as the thinking of mathematicians and
researchers in the cognitive sciences. The materials, and the attention given to
real classroom situations will provide the inroad necessary to modify the
mathematics curriculum so that consideration of the uses of technology in
teaching of the discipline will find its way into the secondary school
classrooms.
