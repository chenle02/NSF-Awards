This effort brings together an international team of glass scientists, and
optical design and laser physicists to investigate advanced glasses for novel
optical fiber applications. This network of scientists examines the intrinsic
limits of next generation glasses for use in traditional and novel fiber
geometries, models and experimentally verifies the impact of such compositional
modification on the glass? hot-forming response during fiberization and
extrusion, and assesses the post-fabricated material stability and optical
performance of the resulting fibers. Chalcogenide and tellurite-based glasses
form the primary focus of the effort, exploiting the novel aspects of the
glasses visco-, thermal and optical properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team
addresses materials science questions which extend current capabilities in the
design, processing and manufacture of advanced glasses into glass fibers.
University researchers benefit from the support of key industrial partners who
recognize the critical need for such advances. There is an overall benefit to
the international community in bringing diverse skill sets together through
global training experiences for faculty and students across a team of eight
scientific groups from four countries (Australia, France, Italy and the US).
Through this partnership, the US team coordinates education and research
experiences for team members via summer research experiences, faculty and staff
exchanges, as well as opportunities for student participants to complete dual
PhD degrees.
