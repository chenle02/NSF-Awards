This award provides funding for the second edition of the Conference on Modeling
High Frequency Data. This year the conference is a joint effort between Stevens
Institute of Technology, University of Texas at El Paso and Purdue University.
The purpose of the conference is to improve the models used to analyze data
sampled with high frequency. Tools available from a variety of areas such as
statistics, stochastic processes, statistical mechanics, clustering, and systems
will be exposed. Academics, industry professionals, and government regulators
will meet to collaborate, with the goal of advancing the quality of research
currently under development in the field.

The scientific motivation for the conference arises from the fact that
organizing a conference in the trade capital of the world has the potential of
bringing together the best mathematicians, practitioners and regulators to help
develop and better the modeling aspect of the marketplace.

The main training objective of this meeting is to expose today's economic and
modeling problems to current graduate students in the hope that this will
improve the quality of their research problems.
