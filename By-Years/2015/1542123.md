The conference "From Industrial Statistics to Data Science" will be held October
1-3, 2015, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on the University of Michigan campus. The
theme of the conference is a path toward addressing the next generation of
critical challenges in science and industry to which statisticians can
contribute, building upon the strong legacy of industrial statistics that has
resulted from the contributions of many researchers in academia and in industry.
The conference will feature approximately 20 invited speakers, from both
academia and industry, many of whom have made fundamental contributions to
industrial statistics, data science, and allied areas of statistical
methodology, and a student poster session. This award will support registration
and travel to the conference for students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior
researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent crystallization of interest around the
term "Data Science" provides a framework for thinking about ways to effectively
build on the contributions of industrial statisticians and leverage the well
developed classical frameworks in modern applications. Industrial statistics
with its focus on reliability and design of experiments has traditionally been
an area of statistics with strong connections to industry. In the era of data
science, many of the traditional areas such as design of experiments are as
relevant as ever, but new connections need to be made to bring these ideas into
the context of big data. To address this need and help build relevant
connections, the conference program will include sessions on industrial
statistics, data science, and new methodologies for addressing challenging
problems in natural science, social science, and engineering, with a view toward
how research in these areas contributes to critical national and global
priorities. More information about the conference can be found at
