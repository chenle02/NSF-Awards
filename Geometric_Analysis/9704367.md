9704367 Hardt This project lies in the general area of geometric variational
calculus, dealing with the behavior of singularities and various energy critical
objects. Some specific investigations focus on n-harmonic maps and biharmonic
maps, regularity theory for minimal surfaces with boundary, and isoperimetric
and sobolev inequalities in varieties. Geoemtric variational calculus involves
questions about various extremal and/or optimal objects amongst families of
objects satisfying a common set of constraints. Area and energy minimizing
surfaces are among the objects studied in this theory. These surfaces have
applications in materials science as they can be used to model condensed matter.
