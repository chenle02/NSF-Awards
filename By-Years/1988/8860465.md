In this project, analytical and experimental research will be conducted on
centrifugal infiltration of carbon fiber preforms by molten aluminum alloys to
form tubes of aluminum-carbon fiber composites. Modeling will be done to derive
the optimum surface treatment of fiber preform and infiltration conditions. A
few selected experiments will be conducted to centrifugally infiltrate carbon
fiber preforms with a selected aluminum alloy and the formed composite tubes
will be examined using optical and electron microscopy to check fiber
distribution, porosity and bonding. The variables studied will include preform,
surface treatment and temperature. Limited testing of tubular composites will be
conducted to demonstrate the integrity and advantageous properties of these
structures. It has already been demonstrated that fiber preforms can be
successfully encapsulated and partially infiltrated by centrifuging molten
magnesium alloys and this knowledge base will be applied to this project. This
research could lead to an inexpensive process to produce aluminum-carbon fiber
composite tubes of large lengths and diameters.
