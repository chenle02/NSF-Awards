This award supports the principal investigator's role as a campaign coordinator
for the GEM (Geospace Environment Modeling) Program's cusp and boundary layer
working group. In addition, the PI will analyze the data from GEM observing
campaigns to determine polar cap potential patterns and their relation to
dayside boundary regions and the boundary between open and closed field lines.
As campaign coordinator, the PI will plan and implement a program to specify the
magnetopause boundary-normal magnetic field and the reconnection electric field.
He will be involved in the coordination of observations and will facilitate and
participate in comparison between the observations and theoretical models. As
part of the research effort, the campaign data will be used for determining the
dayside magnetic reconnection rate and its temporal and spatial variations, and
for evaluating the cause of temporal changes in the polar cap convective flow
near the dayside separatrix.
