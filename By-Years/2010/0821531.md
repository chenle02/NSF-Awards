CBET-0821531&lt;br/&gt;Bonner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Aquatic Health Monitoring
Unit (AHMU) with modular sensing, power, data telemetry and control sub-systems
deployed for autonomous, long-term, and periodic ecosystem monitoring and
scientific studies in the coastal margin will be developed. This will be done
through a partnership between Clarkson University, the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe
(SRMT) Environment Division and industry partners. Given the complexity of
coastal and hydrologic processes, the ecological and environmental measurements
required for characterization, monitoring and assessments require a diverse
array of sensors. The instruments and deployment platforms need to be enhanced
in terms of performance, price, robustness, ease of deployment, power
requirements, data and communications.&lt;br/&gt;
