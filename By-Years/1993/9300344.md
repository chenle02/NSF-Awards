Promising engineering, science and mathematics undergraduate students nationwide
will be invited to participate in a challenging and rewarding program of hands-
on, independent research in a Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at
the University of Wyoming in Laramie. Qualified women, minorities, and disabled
are particularly encouraged to apply. Eight students per year will be chosen for
this summer program, which includes independent research, formal colloquia on
research, close faculty/student interaction and technical presentations.
Research topics which the students may choose from are in the areas of Fluid
Mechanics and Heat Transfer and involve both laboratory and computer
investigations. There is an opportunity for participation for more than one
year. A salary stipend, living expenses, and travel support is being offered.
Four faculty in the College of Engineering are directly involved in this
program.
