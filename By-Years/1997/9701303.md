9701303 Tian This project concerns various Riemannian geometric properties of
the Teichmuller space, which in turn gives a new way to parametrize the moduli
of compact Riemann surfaces. More specifically, the investigator is to use the
geometric characteristics of the Teichmuller space to study fibrations of maps
into surfaces, and to identify the diffeomorphism group of the circle with the
moduli of simply connected complete hyperbolic surfaces. Other applications
include minimal embedded surfaces in Euclidean three sphere. Riemann surfaces
are an abstraction of curved surfaces; compact Riemann surfaces are pretzel-like
surfaces (with any number of holes) where angles are well-defined. These
surfaces originally arose in connection with solving polynomial equations in two
variables.
