&lt;br/&gt;Objective &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop a
new biochip technology based on spin valve sensor arrays and magnetic
nanoparticles, which may eliminate the need for sample amplification, and make
rapid pathogen detection possible. The approach is based on two technical
components: (1) a DNA fragment detector with a sensitivity of ~100 femto-molar
that is at least 10-fold better than the present technology, and (2) a sample
preparation system allowing rapid and efficient concentration of the DNA (or
protein) samples. Both components utilize monodisperse magnetic nanoparticles
(nanotags) with a mean diameter ranging from 10 to 100 nm to label pathogen
targets.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the
project is that the magnetic biochip allows greater specificity and sensitivity
for pathogen detection and quantitation. In particular, the intrinsic
multiplexing capability of magnetic DNA chip will create what economists call a
?disruptive? technology. Because it is cost-effective and easy to use, the
magnetic DNA assay can define a new standard of healthcare for infectious
diseases.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact extends well
beyond magnetics, spintronics, nanotechnology, and biology. It will eventually
make it possible to detect, and in some cases treat, diseases such as cystic
fibrosis, cervical cancer, sickle-cell anemia, and diabetes. The same magnetic
chip can be adapted for use in genomics, forensics, biodefense, and cancer
detection. The fundamental knowledge of magnetic biosensors and nanoparticles
would have wide-ranging implications for micromagnetic and nanomagnetic devices
in microelectronics as well as medicine. The research will attract and train
undergraduates and under-represented minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
