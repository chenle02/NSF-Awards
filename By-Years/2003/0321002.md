With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at The University of Montana will acquire a 500 MHz NMR
Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out research on a)
metabolic engineering and biosynthesis in Streptomyces; b) the use of
fluorine-19 NMR to probe macromolecular interactions; c) the application of
triosmium benzoheterocycle clusters as biomarkers; d) studies of the structure
and function of retro-viral RNA; e) synthetic hydroxylated polyamides from
unprotected carbohydrates; and f) medicinal chemistry.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas,
including medicinal and polymer chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
