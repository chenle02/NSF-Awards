This research investigates coordination of multiple mobile manipulators for
grasping and transporting large and irregularly shaped objects. A mobile
manipulator considered in this study is composed of a mobile platform for
locomotion and a manipulator for grasping and manipulation. A large object
without special features such as handles cannot easily be grasped by the
conventional end effectors such as jaw grippers or multifingered hands. A new
approach based on the concept of enveloping grasp and manipulation by multiple
mobile manipulators is proposed. The major contribution of the proposed study
will be control algorithms for coordination of locomotion and manipulation of a
mobile manipulator with the motion of the manipulator being constrained, and
coordination of two mobile manipulators for transporting large objects. An
experimental system will be developed to test and evaluate the proposed
coordination algorithms. //
