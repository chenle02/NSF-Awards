&lt;br/&gt;Abstract for DMS - 0104453&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
project is to describe all embedded minimal surfaces of &lt;br/&gt;some fixed
(but arbitrary) genus in a fixed (but arbitrary) closed &lt;br/&gt;3-manifold.
Such a study would include the description of these surfaces on &lt;br/&gt;a
fixed small scale. Various applications of such a description will also
&lt;br/&gt;be studied. In particular to the spherical space-form problem, the
topology &lt;br/&gt;of 3-manifolds with positive scalar curvature and various
other problems in &lt;br/&gt;the topology of 3-manifolds. Two other seperate
projects will be &lt;br/&gt;investigated. One is simple closed geodesics on
surfaces and another is &lt;br/&gt;degeneration of Kahler-Einstein
manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roughly speaking the goal of this
proposal is to describe all smooth &lt;br/&gt;soap-films. I soap-film is a
surface spanning a boundary and which is &lt;br/&gt;critical for area among all
other surfaces with the same boundary. Besides &lt;br/&gt;being a classical
problem such a description would have many possible &lt;br/&gt;applications in a
wide varieties of fields. Spanning from topology to &lt;br/&gt;mathematical
biology.&lt;br/&gt;
