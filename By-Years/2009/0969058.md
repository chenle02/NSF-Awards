The Hope College Nuclear Group will continue its study of neutron-rich unstable
nuclei near the drip-line with the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) at the National
Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) and will continue to apply a variety
of nuclear techniques (e.g. Particle Induced X-Ray Emission, Rutherford
BackScattering, Nuclear Reaction Analysis, and Ion Beam Induced Luminescence) to
a range of interdisciplinary questions with the Hope Ion Beam Analysis
Laboratory. This proposal will support two faculty in these efforts, each of
which will include undergraduate researchers in all aspects of the
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nuclear Group will investigate unstable
neutron-rich nuclei to refine the theoretical understanding of the nuclear shell
model. This will involve measurements of excited states and ground states of
unstable nuclei created at the NSCL and measured with the MoNA-LISA/Sweeper
system. The Nuclear Group, as part of the overall program, will supervise the
construction of Large-area multi-Institutional Scintillator Array (LISA) by 12
undergraduate institutions in the MoNA Collaboration (MRI:PHY-0922794). The
interdisciplinary portion of the proposed research will examine metalloprotein
stoichiometry (deposited on mylar foils), forensic characterization of layered
automotive paints and automotive glass fragments, and luminescence studies of
feldspars and carbonates. On-going analysis of previous experiments and
development projects will continue. Interdisciplinary collaborative efforts will
also continue with other Hope researchers (electropolymer characterization,
superconductor and electrodeposited thin film stoichiometry) and groups outside
Hope College (metal contamination in sediments, provenance of river sediment,
detector characterization, and aerosol measurements). All of these initiatives
are not only important for the specific science result they yield, but for
possible far-reaching impact on the analytical techniques used in many areas.
