This project addresses the need for accurate friction process models during all
operating conditions of a machine for friction- based diagnostics and motion
control. Slow or sudden changes in friction characteristics due to wear,
temperature, humidity, lubricant conditions, and loads can lead to undetected
changes in the parameters of a governing friction process model. For model-
based diagnostics, accurate friction process models are required to detect
faults that may lead to machine failure. For motion control, friction process
model uncertainty must be minimized to maximize performance. This research
develops estimation methods for mechanical systems with nonstationary sliding or
rolling friction to detect and compensate for changes in friction process
models. To accomplish this, a synergistic combination of non- model-based and
model-based estimation is developed to separate friction force observation from
friction process model identification. For friction force observation, nonlinear
estimators that do not require a structured friction model or direct measurement
of friction force will be developed. Friction observers will use models of the
physical system (apart from the friction model) and measured motion to estimate
friction force through state extended filtering. Friction force observation will
supply inputs for model-based, multiple-model estimation to identify a
physically relevant friction model using Bayesian selection. Experiments
combining estimation and control will focus on maximizing accuracy of high-
speed, repetitive, motion control for diverse applications such as semiconductor
manufacturing, positioning hard disk read/write heads, and machine tool
position/velocity control. Use of the estimation methods to enhance friction
based diagnostics will be demonstrated by simulation in the context of model-
based condition monitoring of bearings.
