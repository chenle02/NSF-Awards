9724495 Goldberg, Mark Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Acquisition of
Instrumentation to Facilitate Large Scale Parallel Computation Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute (RPI) will be acquiring three four-processor shared-memory
computers. The equipment will be used to support research in parallel adaptive
computation, silicon simulation, software tools development for parallel
scientific computation, generic software libraries for parallel computation,
learning algorithms for combinatorial optimization, and query optimization in
heterogeneous mediated systems. RPI will also be developing a library of
programming tools for handling distributed computing on a cluster of high-power
shared memory workstations and will make this software freely available to the
scientific community and accessible through the World Wide Web. The equipment
will also be used in undergraduate courses in computational science and
engineering, in particular a studio course in algorithm design and a second
course in the design and implementation of generic software. Both of these
courses provide hands-on experience for students and will thus allow direct
involvement with the new equipment.
