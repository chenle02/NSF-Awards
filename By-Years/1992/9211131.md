The objective of this research is to use the most advanced computing
environments and the most efficient computational techniques available to study
the long term dynamics of normal and abnormal electrical activity in heart
tissue. A patch of heart tissue is modeled as a two- or three-dimensional grid
of cells the electrochemical activity in each cell being modeled by systems of
nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODE) and with resistive coupling
between each pair of cells. We propose to directly simulate a nonlinear partial
differential equation (PDE) formulation of the system to examine the long term
dynamical behaviors such as frequency entrainment in pacemaker sinus cells, the
development and propagation of arrhythmias in the normally quiescent atrial cell
tissue and the interaction of the normal pacemaking activity and abnormal atrial
ectopic beats in combined sinus node-atrial tissue. The solution of the system
of coupled ODEs have been approximated using an explicit numerical integration
method on both the CM-200 and CM-5 Connection Machines but due to the stiffness
of the equations, we have been restricted to medium length simulations of two-
dimensional long-time simulations of both the PDE and ODE formulations. This
research will not only advance the current state-of-the-art in scientific
computing, but will also further our understanding of cardiac dynamics under
both normal and abnormal conditions.
