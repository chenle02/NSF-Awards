In ca. AD 600, a catastrophic eruption by the Laguna Caldera volcano in El
Salvador completely buried a Mayan homestead and the fields which surrounded it.
Preliminary excavations at this site of Ceren in 1978 indicated that the
volcanic ash packed around and thoroughly preserved structures, wooden
artifacts, trees, corn plants, a field with footprints, and human bodies.
Subsequent geophysical prospection in 1979 confirmed the existence of intact
houses which remain buried under five meters of ash. NSF funded research in 1989
and 1990 revealed extremely well preserved remains. Dr. Sheets and his
colleagues will return to this site and continue their extensive excavation
which will focus on a single structure and surrounding environment. Floral and
faunal materials will be recovered and analyzed to reconstruct household
subsistence, and expected skeletal materials will provide insight into family
composition. Field excavation will allow reconstruction of agricultural
techniques. Ceren is unique, even in comparison to Old World sites such as
Pompeii, because the volcanic ash matrix is so fine that it preserves organic
materials down to the cellular level. This virtually complete material culture
record will allow for a detailed reconstruction of functioning households and
important insights to human behavior, demography, nutrition, agriculture, and
economics. Anthropologists have come to realize that in many societies the
"household" - a group of individuals who live together in one place and closely
cooperate on a daily basis- form an essential unit. However, archaeologically
households are usually difficult to isolate and study. At Ceren it appears that
just such a unit exists. This research is important because it will shed a new
and important light on the development of complex Mayan society and help us to
understand how complexity develops and is maintained.
