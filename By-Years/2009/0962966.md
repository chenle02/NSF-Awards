This award funds ongoing curatorial activities at the WHOI Sea Floor Samples
laboratory. This repository provides facilities and services to an international
audience of marine scientists, and provides the marine science community with
samples for a diversity of research areas ranging from climate history to
petrology to tectonics. The repository also provides immediate access to fully
documented, described, and digitized core and rock samples, and new material and
data are continually added to the collection. In addition to curation and sample
distribution, the repository is involved in outreach activities that introduce
students and other non-scientists to the collection and to sample acquisition
processes.
