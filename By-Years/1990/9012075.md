From the age of 18 months on, toddlers learn new words at the phenomenal rate
of over 9 a day| To support such successful learning, children must have
considerable knowledge of the nature of the meanings words encode. This research
will seek a precise characterization of that knowledge and of its roots in early
infancy. The research will focus on one aspect of word meaning, that of
quantification. Language makes use of many different types of quantificational
devices, including quantifiers ("a, another, some, more...."), the numerals, and
count/mass syntax. Knowledge of quantification would help even the learning of
nouns, for nouns carry quantificational commitments in their meanings. Children
use quantifiers, apparently correctly, very early in language production. Recent
research has shown, however, that children do not know what the count words mean
for over a year after they have been counting. This raises the possibility that
they do not know what the other quantifiers mean either. The studies will use
new techniques to assess what even babies know about number. Further, the
techniques will allow the assessment of patterns of generalization to new
contexts of various types of newly-taught words, supported by different sorts of
quantifiers. A longitudinal study will assess the process by which two-year-olds
work out the meanings of number words. The outcome of these studies will be an
understanding of the conceptual underpinnings normal young children bring to
language learning, and the conceptual change they must undergo to grasp the
meaning of number words like "two." Research on normal cognitive development and
normal language development is important scientifically, for it bears on what
makes humans unique among animals. But it is also essential for understanding
the many ways language acquisition goes awry in various abnormal populations.
Such understanding must precede interventions to help children overcome specific
cognitive deficits.
