Much has been learned and written about the fragility of today's Internet
routing architecture because of inherent limitations in traditional network
routing protocols and the way they are used. Whether by accident or with
malicious intent, network operators routinely disrupt network traffic on a
regional and global scale, causing both service disruptions and data privacy
breaches.

This project works towards alleviating these problems in the global network
infrastructure by exploring the feasibility of a trusted routing architecture
based on the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). This research effort
will identify and overcome barriers to the design, deployment and operation of
networks with secure, trusted routing information. The results of this effort
will include a working example, from which network operators can learn how to
ultimately create a more reliable international communications infrastructure
with fewer threats to data security.
