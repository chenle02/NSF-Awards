This project involves an investigation of the nature and mechanisms of the
diagenesis of carbonate sediment in cores recovered by the Deep Sea Drilling
Project. The goal is to use petrographic, chemical, and isotopic techniques to
determine the degree of modification by diagenesis on the isotopic signature of
foraminifera from DSDP and ODP drill cores. Those isotopic signatures are used
to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental conditions at the time of deposition at
the site and may also include an overprint from the subsequent diagenesis.
Recognition of samples with this overprint will allow paleoceanographers to
reject samples which do not retain an environmental signal so that
reconstructions of paleoclimates recorded in drill cores will not be in error.
