The Constant Load Creep Testing machine with environmental chamber and crack
monitoring system will be used to study the effect of various gaseous
environments on sustained load crack initiation and crack propagation at high
temperatures in a variety of metals, alloys, and advanced materials. this work
will expand previous studies of intergranular penetration of aggressive gaseous
species to study how monotonic stress, and complex stress and strain fields,
influence the kinetics of penetration. The role of this diffusion, and the
concentration of embrittling elements in advance of a crack, in controlling high
temperature time-dependent fracture will be explored in detail.
