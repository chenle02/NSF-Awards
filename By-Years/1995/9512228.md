ABSTRACT Dendy E. Sloan Colorado School of Mines 9512228 The Colorado School of
Mines proposes to establish a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Laboratory to
meet the growing teaching and research needs of the CSM campus. The proposed NMR
laboratory will be primary exemplar of the way a major instrumental resource can
inter-relate research of scholars in diverse fields. The facility will both
serve a thriving research community and be used to enrich undergraduate and
graduate education. In addition it will be a resource facility for local
industry. It is proposed to acquire a dual probe solids/liquid NMR spectrometer:
on probe assembly will support liquid phase samples while the second will
support solid state samples. This arrangement will provide the most economical
method of studying both types of instrument will be upgraded and brought on
line. The later instrument will be used in several courses offered on campus.
