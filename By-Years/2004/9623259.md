Ulrich 9623259 This proposal supports the work of Professor B. Ulrich to work on
problems in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. he intends to study the
Rees algebra and its associated graded ring. In particular the proposed research
investigates how graded rings associated with an ideal intertwine with the
Cohen-Macaulay property. He also intends to study problems that circle around
the classical problems of determining the classical join and secant varieties
for certain factor rings. Finally, he intends to study the scheme associated to
the source and target of finite morphisms between perfect R modules and certain
Cohen-Macaulay rings. This research is on the boundary between commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry. Both fields arose from the classical problem of
studying mathematical objects defined in the plane by the simplest of equations,
namely polynomials. Today, the fields use methods not only from algebra, but
also from analysis and topology, and conversely are extensively used in those
fields. Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics,
theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
