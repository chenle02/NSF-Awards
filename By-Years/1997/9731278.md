9731278 Copeland The Technology Education Leadership Project (TELP) provides
two-week leadership development workshops for 90 Maryland technology education
teachers during the summers of 1998 and 1999. The workshops include technical
instruction in the nine core technologies in the Maryland curriculum framework
for technology education: mechanical, electrical, electronic, structural, fluid,
optical, thermal, bio, and materials. The leadership workshops also include
instruction in facilitative leadership, information systems, and the
teaching/learning strategies used in Maryland technology education courses:
investigation; modular technology activity packages; topic investigations;
engineering design and development; product generation; and research and
experimentation. Four weekend institutes supplement the summer workshops during
each of the three years of the project. These sessions deal with the
implementation of the core technologies and the teaching/learning strategies
outlined above, the use of instructional technology, standards for technology
education, and the planning, delivery, and assessment of the teacher enhancement
programs in each of the school districts. These weekend workshops meet in
locations across the state. During each of the second and third summers, the
leadership group of master teachers provides five days of teacher enhancement
activities in each of the school districts across the state. This instruction
covers the core technologies, information systems, teaching/learning strategies
and instructional technology.
