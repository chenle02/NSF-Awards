The project aims at the study of the friction mechanism of particles along an
interface with a solid body by conducting theoretical and experimental work. The
theoretical work is based on a mechanical (S.G.-Sphere-in- the-Groove) model of
a single particle . The experimental work entails building two testing
apparatuses. One will utilize photoelastic ideal particles to study the
interparticle and interface/particle contacts. The other apparatus will study
the friction between ideal particles and natural sands along interfaces of
controlled roughness. The experimental and theoretical work will then be
incorporated to predict friction coefficient of granular soil .
