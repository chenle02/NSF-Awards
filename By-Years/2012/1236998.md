The proposed effort in this Innovation-Corps project develops a LED-based
product to replace fluorescent industrial lighting. The ubiquitous linear
fluorescent T8 light bulb generates over 3300 lumens, while the brightest LED-
based replacement generates less than 2500 lumens. However, customer desire for
an adequate LED-based T8 replacement remains strong, and a bulb that can exceed
the 3300 lumens brightness barrier and offer good light quality can capture much
of the market. To address this market demand, the team proposes to
experimentally validate a lighting architecture based on mercury-free, low-cost,
off-the-shelf components that can exceed 3300 lumens brightness, match or
improve upon the color temperature and color rendering index of current linear
fluorescent lamps, while exhibiting a spatially uniform emission pattern.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team's proposed lighting architecture enables a LED-
based, drop-in linear fluorescent replacement with greater power conversion
efficiency across the entire visible spectrum compared to typical white LED
technologies, while providing a more eye-pleasing light quality. Importantly,
the proposed design utilizes commercially-available, highly efficient, and
highly tunable luminescent dyes that enable unrivaled spectral engineering and
adaptation for numerous specialized markets (e.g. hydroponics, museums, etc.),
while allowing the component / supply stream to become completely independent
from the fluctuations in the price and availability of rare earth elements.
