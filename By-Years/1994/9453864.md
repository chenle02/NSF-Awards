To understand how students constructs mathematical ideas in "Dynamic Geometry"
environments (tools like Geometer's Sketchpad and Cabri), one needs clear
characterizations of : (1) the mathematical "raw materials" embodied in the
software and (2) how students use these "raw materials." What are the
mathematical objects and allowable transformations? Which do they notice and
attend to? How do they interpret what they notice? Through interviews with
developers, and through our won analyses, we will investigate the tools'
mathematical and pedagogical potential. Experiments and clinical interviews with
students well lead to a preliminary epistemology of concepts related to the
defining feature of this software: dynamic "dragging." focussed experiments will
then reexamine these results and hone them, to derive implications for learning
and teaching, and for the design of materials. Thus the project will establish
empirical and theoretical foundations for an epistemology of dynamic geometry.
