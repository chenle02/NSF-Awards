The project will develop new statistical methods to analyze stochastic phenomena
that inherently evolves in time. The methods will be based on high-frequency
monitoring of the phenomena under study, which is of widening use in many fields
such as finance, meteorology, biology, neuroscience, turbulence, statistical
physics, seismology, and telecommunication. Thus, the research will foster more
interaction between applied scientists and statisticians. The research and
educational elements of the project will also serve as a training tool for both
undergraduate and graduate students by forming synergistic research groups
involving all levels.

Nonparametric methods are powerful statistical tools to reduce the model
misspecification error, and high-frequency-based statistical analysis is a
natural route to take when estimating the fine statistical features of
continuous-time stochastic processes. Though the literature combining these two
approaches has grown significantly during the last two decades, comparatively
little work has been done to analyze and correct the sensitivity of methods to
tuning parameters. The project will address these needs by (i) developing a
unified approach for optimal kernel estimation of the spot volatility of an Ito
process in the presence of leverage and microstructure noise; (ii) devising of
optimal jump detection and integrated variance estimation methods, under the
presence of stochastic volatility and infinite jump activity, via thresholding
or shrinkage of the process' increments or wavelet coefficients; (iii)
establishing theoretical guarantees for the data-driven plugging implementation
methods resulting from the optimal schemes.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
