This project bridges the widening "high-tech gap" between majority and minority
communities that can seriously undermine our nation's leadership position in
science and technology. The main objective of the project is to build up IA
education capacity at NC A&amp;T SU so that it can offer an independent IA
program that meets NSA CAE/IAE designation criteria. UNC Charlotte, a CAE/IAE
institution, provides critical support to NC A&amp;T SU in this effort. The
project also enables UNC Charlotte to further enhance its IA education capacity.
With focus on the development of information assurance curricula, the project
establishes new IA undergraduate programs within the Computer Science Department
at NC A&amp;T SU and within Software and Information Systems Department at UNC
Charlotte. These programs, though independent, are designed to share IA
resources in order to offer richer electives for students at both institutions.
Curriculum development involves activities such as modification of existing
courses, new course design and development, as well as laboratory and lab
projects development. The project also promotes faculty development at NC
A&amp;T SU, through a well-designed faculty summer program.
