Various technological trends, such as faster networks, cheaper data storage, and
ubiquitous data logging, have given us access to massive amounts of data. This
gives rise to two fundamental questions that need to be addressed if we are to
exploit this data: (a) How to process such data? Traditional models of
computation and notions of efficiency need to be reconsidered when monitoring
Gbps network traffic, mining petabytes of search engine data, or processing data
that is distributed across multiple low-power sensors. (b) What to compute about
such data? Often the data that is quickest to accumulate is data that is noisy,
plagued by internal inconsistencies, or redundant. How can useful information be
extracted from such data? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last decade, the study
of sketching (a form of compression based on linear projection) and stream
computation (space-bounded computation where the input is processed
sequentially) has sought to address aspects of the above questions. The research
goal of this project is to initiate and pursue a variety of new directions for
these computational models. These include (a) Developing a more systematic
understanding of computation in the existing models by seeking broad
characterizations of problem tractability and developing "super synopses" that
solve entire families of related problems. (b) Extending and tailoring existing
models in order to address a wider range of applications such as processing
stochastically generated data. (c) Establishing a general and intellectually
intriguing abstraction of the challenges of computing with massive data sets
that subsumes sketching and stream computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
conjunction with these research goals, the project includes various educational
and broader impact initiatives that are designed to ensure a wide dissemination
of research results and to train graduate and undergraduate students.
