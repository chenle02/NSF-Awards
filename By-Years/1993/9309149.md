9309149 Papadimitriou This research will focus on the development of a multi-
parameter stochastic characterization of earthquake acceleration time histories.
The stochastic models will consider important ground motion features including
the nonstationarities in both the amplitude and frequency content of the ground
shaking which have significant influence on the dynamic response of structures.
The parameters of the stochastic model will be probabilistically related to
variables accounting for the seismic environment at a site, so that the ground
motion model can become an integral part of a seismic hazard assessment.
Response characteristics of linear and nonlinear, including hysteretic
structures subjected the stochastically defined ground motions will be studied
to evaluate the effect of various ground motion features and their associated
uncertainties. ***
