A workshop is to be held at the Wingspread Conference Center to address the
structuring and implementation of entry level college courses so these courses
may be designed to be more accessible and more rewarding to students than they
presently experience. Participants from diverse types of colleges and
universities and from diverse disciplines will, together, address the issues of
entry level courses in science, mathematics and engineering for: 1) the major,
and 2) the general college student.
