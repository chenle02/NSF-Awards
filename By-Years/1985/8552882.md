This project investigates microemulsions; the objective of the research is to
improve on the understanding of phase transitions, microstructures, bulk, and
interfacial properties and interactions in microemulsions. Pure component
systems containing non-tonic, ionic, and zwitterionic surfactants will be
investigated using a battery of analytic tools. Techniques to be used include
dynamic light scattering and electrochemical methods for diffusion coefficients
and, hence, aggregate size, average intensity measurements for the virial
coefficients and radius of gyration, electrophoretic light scattering for zeta
potential in charge systems, and surface light scattering for interfacial
tensions. These measurements will be complemented with necessary phase behavior
and analytical studies. The effects of composition, temperature, and pressure
will be determined, and correlations will be developed to model the behavior.
