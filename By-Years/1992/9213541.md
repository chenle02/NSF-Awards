This Engineering Faculty Internships (EFI) project supports the collaboration
of Professor Richard E. Riman with scientists at EniChem on the preparation and
study of silicon carbide passivation layers. Methodologies for characterization
of the silicon carbide layers and the modified layers after exposure to chemical
processing environments will be developed. Additional work will focus on the
establishment of surface chemistry models that describe major reactions. The EFI
program enriches the background of college faculty to make them more effective
teachers and encourages them to contribute their expertise to the aid of
industry. Corrosion shortens the functional lifetime of much industrial
equipment and increases costs to society. Protective coatings like silicon
carbide might mitigate substantially the deleterious effects of corrosion.
