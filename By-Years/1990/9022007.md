Genetic algorithms (GAs) -- search algorithms based on the mechanics of natural
genetics and natural selection -- are playing increasingly important roles in
complex systems optimization and machine learning, but further progress depends
on the creation of new quantitative and qualitative theory that more adequately
explains GA power. This project extends and expands the analytical and
metaphorical theory available for genetic algorithm design and analysis.
Important topic areas of analytical theory are investigated, including
classification methods, deterministic population models, nonconventional
population models, and Walsh methods. ANalogies to biological, social, and
economic systems are also drawn and used as a source of new GA mechanism. In
particular, natural recombination and gene expression are used as a source of
design inspiration. Together, the study provides the foundations for
understanding the operation of the current generation of genetic algorithms and
for designing the next.
