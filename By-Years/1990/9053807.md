The coalition includes eight institutions (Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, Cornell
University, Hampton University, Iowa State University, Southern University,
Stanford University, Tuskegee University, University of California, Berkeley)
and has a twofold goal: 1) to increase the quality of U.S. engineering education
and to increase the number of engineering graduates at all levels, especially
among women and underrepresented minorities, 2) to improve the effectiveness of
engineering education so as to enhance the quality of the graduates and their
effectiveness in industry. The coalition develops, experiments with, and
evaluates the effectiveness of a variety of innovative curricula, delivery
systems, settings, and pedagogies. In addition, to attract and retain increased
number of engineering students, the coalition undertakes intensive activities
aimed at improving the image of engineering as a field of study and as a
profession. The grantee provides funds for this project that are more than an
equal match for the NSF award.
