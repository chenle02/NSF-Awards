The HITRAN (high-resolution transmission) molecular absorption database
currently contains some 7.4 million spectral lines of some 47 different
molecular species (https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hitran/ ) As such, along with
appropriate computer codes, it can be used to accurately calculate the
spectroscopic properties (transmission and emission) of light in the terrestrial
(and other planetary) atmospheres. The HITRAN database is widely used by
thousands of scientists and engineers, tackling a large range of scientific
problems and interests.

This project has two stated objectives namely : (1) continuing studying
theoretical and computational treatment of line mixing for molecules that are
important in remote sensing and spectroscopy, and , (2) providing theoretical
support for improving the accuracy of the HITRAN database, in particular
calculation of H2O lineshapes. The first objective is based on prior NSF support
to develop a formalism capable of studying line mixing from interactions between
a molecular absorber and molecular perturbers. The second objective represents
continuing effort to improve the accuracy of spectroscopic parameters of H2O
lineshapes in spectral databases, specifically HITRAN, and related compilations.
