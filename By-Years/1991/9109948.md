In response to chemical gradients, bacteria are able to direct their motion
toward conditions favorable to their survival. The objectives of this project
are: to quantitatively characterize this phenomenon, known as bacterial
chemotaxis, within natural systems; to develop predictive capabilities through
mathematical modeling; and to exploit chemotactic behavior technologically. By
manipulating their chemotactic response through genetic engineering or
adaptation, the migration of bacterial populations toward contaminated zones can
be enhanced.
