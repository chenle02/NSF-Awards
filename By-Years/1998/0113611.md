Verification tools based on decision procedures including OBDD based tools and
model-checkers have been effectively used in many application areas including
hardware verification, protocol analysis and verification, static analysis and
type-checking of code, byte-code verification, analysis of mobile code and
proof-carrying code. These tools are however unable to deal with computations
modeled using large state space (including infinite state space), partly because
they do not support inductive reasoning. Induction based theorem provers, while
quite powerful, lack automation and require tremendous user guidance. A novel
and radical approach is proposed to combine decision procedures, rewriting and
induction schemes in a restricted way so as not to lose automation. Using this
approach, recursive definitions are given as terminating rewrite rules on top of
decidable theories, such as Presburger arithmetic. Induction schemes are
generated from these terminating definitions. By imposing structure on recursive
definitions, it becomes possible to automatically decide a large class of
conjectures requiring inductive reasoning. It is proposed to extend and
generalize this approach to consider a large class of recursively defined
functions, their interactions with each other, as well as a large class of
conjectures about these functions, that can be automatically decided (without
any need for user guidance).
