An industrial controls laboratory is developed in the Computer Integrated
Manufacturing (CIM) Center to support a course in industrial control systems for
the CIM curriculum of the Southern New Jersey CIM Consortium (6 county colleges
in addition to NJIT). This laboratory also supports a similar non-credit short
course for manufacturers and a professional development course for educators.
The emphasis is on Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) programming and
applications to industrial controls. Class notes and laboratory experiments are
developed and made available to the engineering technology community.
