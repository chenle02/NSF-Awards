SRI International (SRI), Girls Incorporated of Alameda County (GIAC), and TERC
are collaborating to create and implement Girls InnovaTE3: Girls Innovating with
Technology as Entrepreneurial Environmental Engineers. InnovaTE3, a Strategies
project in NSF's ITEST program, is an out-of-school youth-centered curriculum
for 8th through 11th grade girls. Within this context, InnovaTE3 will
investigate the strategy of integrating innovation practices with interest-
driven science learning for girls, evaluating the potential of the strategy to
accomplish five goals: (1) developing and applying girls understanding of core
concepts in Earth systems science content to an engineering design challenge,
(2) developing girls interest and confidence in pursuing additional STEM content
knowledge, (3) increasing girls? fluency in the innovation process and
preparedness for the engineering workforce, (4) enhancing girls knowledge of a
variety of STEM careers and interest in pursuing a specific STEM career, and (5)
building staff capacity in after-school sites to engage girls in integrating
innovation with science content.
