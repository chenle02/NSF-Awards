The project consists of four topics. The first deals with the approximation of
the infinite particle systems by large finite systems as both the time and the
size of the system tend to infinity. These results are particularly important
from the point of view of the infinite particle systems as models for various
practical problems. The second topic concerns the large deviation rate in a
Poisson system of noninteracting random walks. The third topic can be described
as the spread of the surviving particles following branching process models. The
corresponding theoretical questions explore the clustering and coalescing
behavior of the branching random walks. The last area of inquiry is relatively
unexplored as yet. Multitype systems with non-attractive, non-additive state
space, without duals arise naturally in epidemics or chemical reactions. Such
systems are expected to exhibit new and interesting phenomena.
