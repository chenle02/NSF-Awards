This award supports the Summer Institute in Museum Anthropology at the
Smithsonian Institution which provides an intensive four-week program to train
graduate students to use museum objects in their research. Students will learn
to collect data and analyze museum collections in light of anthropology's
current research agendas, using a range of qualitative and quantitative methods
and approaches. The training will take advantage of the Smithsonian
Institution's vast anthropology collections and related resources, allowing
students a hands-on experience working with museum specimens on individual
projects. The Institute will focus on experiential learning, combining elements
of a field school with classroom/laboratory training.

Anthropology collections at the Smithsonian and other museums represent an
enormous national legacy, assembled over generations to document world cultures
and serve anthropological research. However, many potential researchers are not
effectively utilizing museum collections because they do not know how to
approach or evaluate this type of data, which present distinct challenges. Few
universities have the capacity to offer such training.

The Institute will train 36 graduate students over the three year course of the
grant, leading to better research design and methodology in research on museum
collections and an increase in theses and publications effectively utilizing
museum objects. Through development and sharing of curriculum materials, it will
serve as a model to encourage wider teaching of museum anthropology research
methods and development of similar programs at university museums. The broader
goal of the program is to use museums more effectively as sites for the
production of knowledge. Increased productive use of collections will allow
anthropology to capitalize on the investment made by former generations, as well
as engage in research of interest and value to the communities where this
material originated.
