This award will enable junior investigators to attend the
school,&lt;br/&gt;"Electromagnetic Probes of Fundamental Physics," to be held at
the&lt;br/&gt;Ettore Majorana Center in Erice, Sicily, on October 16-21, 2001.
&lt;br/&gt;The school will cover a wide variety of topics spanning,
and&lt;br/&gt;crossing, the fields of nuclear and particle physics, including
both&lt;br/&gt;quantum chromodynamics and quantum electrodynamics, the physics
of strong fields, and the experimental promise of
collider&lt;br/&gt;laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
