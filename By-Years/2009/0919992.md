This project builds on a one year Phase 1 project in which ecology faculty began
to use Diagnostic Question Clusters (DQCs) to: 1. organize an entire
introductory course around key concepts and biologically principled thinking
based on an overarching framework and 2. identify and gauge student progress on
specific principles especially problematic for them. The DQCs focus on energy
and matter across all levels of biological organization. Faculty from
universities, including Historically Black Colleges, plus four year and
community colleges contributed to the original DQC research. Adopting an
expanding networks approach for broader dissemination and impact, this project
extends this model to more faculty and also introduces modifications to the
faculty workshops based on the "lessons learned" from the previous project.

Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project stems from the value
of the material being produced and the lessons concerning effective
dissemination techniques being learned from the outcomes of the workshops.

Broader Impact: The ability of the workshops to help faculty inspect their own
teaching practices is potentially transformative.
