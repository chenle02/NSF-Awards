This program involves a set of experiments to test the relationship between
chaos and diffusion using the plasma state as a medium. Laser induced
fluorescence is used to measure spatial ion diffusion, and the degree of chaos
is quantified in terms of Lyopunov exponents. Different chaotic states are
selected by varying the discharge parameters. The research is conducted by
undergraduate students, and this multidisciplinary activity provides excellent
training in experimental tools and methods used in the exploration of nonlinear
dynamics. This award is made in connection with the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic
Plasma Science and Engineering.
