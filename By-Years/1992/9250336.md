The goal of the project is to increase the quality of undergraduate laboratory
education in psychology at Metropolitan State College of Denver (MSCD) and to
provide increased student experience with current computer technology. The
Psychology Department has established a strong statistics and methodological
requirement in its curriculum. Students' exposure to experimentation is
currently limited to the two- semester required research methods course
sequence. The department is committed to providing direct experimental
experience in a developmentally sound sequence, beginning with demonstrations
using single subjects in Introductory Psychology and progressing through
research design, data collection, and analysis in such content courses as
Sensation and Perception, Cognitive Psychology, and the Psychology of Learning.
The hands-on research activities and demonstrations will broaden student contact
with basic principles and concepts of scientific methodology and increase their
technological and experimental skills.
