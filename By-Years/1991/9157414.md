Research plans are 1. to continue theoretical investigations of the mechanisms
of high temperature superconductivity, with special emphasis on magnetic
mechanisms and novel approaches to the physics of strong coupling
superconductors, and 2. to study the statistical mechanics of phase transitions
in quantum and driven non- equilibrium classical systems.
