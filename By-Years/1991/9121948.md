This proposal is a renewal proposal to a prior NSF grant, DMR-8819186. It plans
to perform three major tasks. One is the measurement of preferred crystalline
orientation (texture) resulting from the deformation of polycrystalline
structural ceramics, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, and alkali halides. Related work
involves Si3N4, and ceramic matrix composites. Second task is to use polycrystal
deformation mechanisms to explain the textures. The third task is to demonstrate
the anisotropic properties as the results of the texture. %%%% This proposed
research is a continuation of the PI's efforts in establishing quantitative
description of textures in ceramic materials. It will provide information about
the mechanical deformation of polycrystalline ceramic materials.
