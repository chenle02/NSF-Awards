This project is an investigation of operational semantics of concurrent
processes. Preliminary results reveal some inherently unobservable behaviour in
the interactive testing of concurrent processes. The work leads to the
formulation of a new, general notion of Structured Operational Semantics for
concurrent processes, generalizing the traditional framework.
