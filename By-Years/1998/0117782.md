This project is a study of how the dynamics of a thermohaline intrusion changes
as a function of stratification, shear strength, and ambient turbulence. A
particular focus is the interaction between salt-fingers and mechanically
generated turbulence and the way the two combine to produce vertical fluxes. The
study will be carried out in a laboratory setting designed to permit the
detailed observation of an arrested wedge of cold, fresh water in an ambient
warm, salty flow. Experiments will be conducted with and without turbulence
generated by stationary and oscillating grids. The experiment seeks to obtain a
qualitative and quantitative description of a ubiquitous oceanic phenomenon that
is difficult to observe in situ. If successful, it will provide significant
insight into the mixing of water masses with different temperature and salinity
properties.
