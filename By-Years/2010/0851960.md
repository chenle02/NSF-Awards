This project renews an exemplary existing Research Experience for Undergraduates
site focused on the areas of pervasive and mobile computing. The project engages
students in a wide range of projects in wireless engineering, including human-
computer interaction, distributed computing, software architecture, network
design, and simulation. A nationwide recruitment process is used to select
cohorts of undergraduate students to participate in a ten-week summer research
program at the host institution. Particular emphasis is placed on recruitment of
students from under-represented populations. The project includes mentoring by
the experienced computer science faculty members, technical seminars and
workshops, student presentations, and field trips and other professional
development opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The
intellectual merit of this project lies in strong research basis and the
expertise of the faculty. The projects are in current research areas that are of
interest to the community at large and that have clear practical applications.
The students participate in a full range of research activities from preparing
research literature reviews to production and dissemination of research
results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The broader impacts of the project
include providing a quality research experience to undergraduate students,
particularly students from underrepresented groups. The participating faculty
members are committed to including under-represented minority students in their
research. Thus this project has the potential to produce new computer science
graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding
while promoting learning.
