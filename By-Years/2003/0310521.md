Chemistry (12) A new Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) equipped
with an autosampler, electron impact and chemical ionization ion sources, and
direct probe sample inlet is being acquired to be implemented in several
courses, including organic chemistry, instrumental methods, student-faculty
research, and two non-majors courses. GC/MS experiments are being adapted from
the Journal of Chemical Education and derived from the primary research
literature. A wide range of students (science majors and non-science majors, and
first-year students through seniors) are being exposed to GC/MS techniques at
varied levels of complexity with an eye towards illustrating the design of
experiments that take advantage of automation and providing the students with
experience generating and interpreting large data sets. The GC/MS is also being
used to expand the range of possible student-faculty research
projects.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
