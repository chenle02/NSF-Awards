This project will provide theoretical studies of the interactions of energetic
particles with the solar wind. The studies will be broad-based and include
interstellar and cometary pickup ions, galactic cosmic rays, shock-accelerated
particles including the cosmic ray anomalous component, and solar slare
particles. A unifying theme is the influence of genergetic particles on the
structure and location of the solar wind termination shock. The investigations
will emphasize analytical methods, the microprocesses governing the interactions
including wave excitation by the energetic particles, and comparisons between
the theoretical results and spacecraft oberservations. The goal of the study is
a better understanding of the structure of the heliosphere and its enegetic
particles. Specific topics of research are, for example: 1) A prediction of the
momentum- and mass-loading of the solar wind by interstellar H+ and He+. 2) A
prediction of the shift in the location of the termination shock due to
interstellar pickup ions and cosmic rays. 3) Development of an analytical model
for the solar-cycle variation of cosmic rays at high energies. 4) Acceleration
of lower-energy "seed" particles at shocks.
