Obtaining the ages of the basalts in mid-ocean ridge neovolcanic zones has been
a vexing problem. The principal investigator will develop a radiometric
technique that uses observed disequilibrium between Ra226 and its parent Th230
to determine the ages of yound mid-ocean ridge basalts less than about 8000
years old. The usual approach in geochronology is ton moralize concentrations of
the daughter isotope to a stable or very long-lived isotope of the same element
since it is of ten possible to estimate initial ratios more accurately than
concentrations. Since Ra226 is the longest-lived radium isotope and Ra has no
stable isotope, Ba will be used as the reference. Ra and Ba are alkaline earth
elements with large ionic radii and +2 oxidation state and are expected to act
similarly during chemical fractionation associated with magma genesis. Thus, the
ratio Ba/Th in the source must be essentially constant for the suite of rocks
being dated.
