For generalized linear models, including those for survival analysis, improved
asymptotic methods based on saddlepoint and related methods will be developed
and evaluated. These improve- ments are a natural extension of the asymptotic
methods ordinari- ly used for generalized linear models and should come into
routine use to verify or to improve on application of standard methods. Aside
from practical import, these developments provide insight into the basic nature
of asymptotic methods particularly in regard to the effects of nuisance
parameters. Closely related Laplace approximations will also be developed for
likelihood calculations in generalized mixed linear models involving additional
random effects in linear predictors. Statistical regression models relate a
response variable to a set of explanatory variables and factors or attributes. A
major development in statistics during the past 15 years has been the expansion
of classical regression modeling to a much broader field of applications often
involving more complicated dependen- cies on the explanatory variables and
factors. The aim of this project is to continue the development of this broader
theory for generalized regression modeling, emphasizing two directions: first,
improvement on necessary approximations in the analysis calculations and second,
allowance for still more general dependencies reflected in the variability of
the data.
