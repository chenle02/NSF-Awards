The legal right to a name and a registered birth is a central principle of
modern human rights law. Birth registration is often identified as a "gateway
right." It is a necessary precursor for accessing political, economic, and
social rights, including access to health care and education as well as
protection from child labor, trafficking, and under-age marriage. However, the
majority of children born in the developing world are never legally registered.
The current project explores the factors that contribute to the low rates of
birth registration as well as the cultural, social, and historical significance
attributed to registering births in such locations. The research involves
household surveys, semi-structured interviews, participant observation of birth
registration activities, and archival research in Tanzania and England.

Public health and human rights campaigners have proposed that improving birth
registration rates is one key means to improving health and development outcomes
across the developing world. The results of the current research could offer
insights into the continued presence of low birth registration rates in many
developing countries.
