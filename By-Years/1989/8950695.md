To provide an up to date, relevant education in Applied Optics, it is essential
for students to have hands-on experience with computer data acquisition and
analysis. This project will provide such an experience in the very first Applied
Optics lab which the students will take. A personal computer will be interfaced
with a linear photodiode array to measure the spatial extent of images and the
image irradiance. With this equipment, students will be able to perform
experiments in radiometry. The student will also be able to measure the
transverse aberration of an image. The linear array and computer combination
will make it possible to scan an image to determine a point spread function and
then the modulation transfer function. This unique and straightforward way of
determining the modulation transfer function of an optical system should greatly
clarify this important subject. This equipment will also make it possible to
modernize the classic pinhole camera. The University will match the award with
an equal amount of funds.
