This award will fund two workshops. The first is a conference that will bring
together local stakeholders in the Kansas City and Kansas state health
communities with health economics researchers. This first conference will focus
on encouraging cooperation between research economists and the Kansas health
community, with the goal of starting new collaborations and spurring community
outreach. The second conference will be an academic research conference that
will bring together health economists from other parts of the country to
consider some of the specific health challenges of the Midwest/Great Plains
states. Funding make it possible for graduate students from around the region to
attend, along with scholars from a diverse group of academic
institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
