The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will establish a service-oriented
facility to analyze radiocarbon samples on behalf of the ocean sciences
community. The Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) Facility will use newly
developed techno- logy, modern instrumentation and automated sample preparation
procedures. The Facility is required to analyze radiocarbon and other tracer
samples collected during upcoming field programs of major Global Geosciences
projects and individual research grants. Chemical tracers are powerful tools for
describing oceano- graphic processes. The analysis of several natural and
anthropogenic chemical constituents of seawater, such as Carbon-14, provides
information on long-term mixing and circulation in the deep ocean, on upwelling,
and on air-sea carbon dioxide exchange processes. These processes have major
implications for understanding the forces that affect climate variability and
the chemical interaction of the carbon cycle and biological productivity. The
description of processes such as these is central to major oceanographic
investigations planned for the next decade. AMS technology reduces required
sample size by a factor of 1,000, to 250 milliliters of seawater, for achieving
the requisite level of precision to define the geophysical processes under
investigation. Given the large number of samples needed for the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment (WOCE), the Global Ocean Flux Study (GOFS), and other
geo- sciences programs, the AMS Facility will be operated on a 24- hour a day
basis to meet scientific requirements. Present plans call for the analysis of up
to 4,000 C-14 samples annually with precision of +/- 0.3 percent to 0.4 percent.
The Institution will provide cost-sharing in terms of engineering and
architectural drawings and will construct the required laboratory addition to
house the AMS Facility.
