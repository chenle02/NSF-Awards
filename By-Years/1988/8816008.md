Using high spatial- and temporal-resolution images acquired with the Clark Lake
multifrequency radioheliograph, we will study meter-decameter radio sources in
the solar corona. Radio synoptic charts and quiet Sun maps will be used to study
and model large-scale structures such as streamers and coronal holes. Impulsive
burst observations will be used in conjunction with soft X-ray data to study
several aspects of coronal mass ejections, including structure and plasma
parameters, height-time evolution, the relationship of CME's, flare and shocks,
and acceleration of particles at slow shocks. The overall aim is to use already
existing data to elucidate the nature of impulsive ejections from the sun which
ultimately impact the earth.
