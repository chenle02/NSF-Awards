The proposal deals with the development of novel process evaluation procedures
for the flotation/separation process in mineral engineering. It combines
technological innovation and industry interaction to aid one of the "mature"
U.S. industries, namely, the non-ferrous extractive metallurgical industry. The
PI believes that a sizable portion of the copper industry, for example, can be
returned to profitability by use of technological innovation to cut costs and
increase recovery. The PI proposes to study the interrelationship between the
chemical, machine and operational factors that influence the flotation process.
Results of this work can be used for understanding and optimizing the separation
method wherever it is used for ores, coal, sewage treatment and a broad range of
pollution control processes.
