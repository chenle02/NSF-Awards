Modern medical research and imaging technologies together present physicians and
clinicians with mind-boggling amounts of detailed molecular or cellular
structures. For example, one 2-dimensional image slide can contain millions of
cells. In fact, pathologists use microscopes to examine only tens or hundreds of
cells at a time, missing most cells, and also missing possible patterns in the
intermediate range. This project addresses the need to study patterns in cell
images through powerful computational and analytic techniques in computational
geometry, and to validate these algorithmic techniques, and software built from
them, in medical research and applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
formulates challenging geometric and algorithmic problems that emerge in the
diagnosis, prognosis, and analysis of diseases (e.g., breast cancer,
inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis), identification and
classification of different types of immune cells (e.g., neutrophils,
eosinophils, plasma cells, and lymphocytes), and tracking and analysis of
collectively moving and swarming bacteria (e.g., Myxococcus xanthus and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in terms of a class of Voronoi diagrams (developed by
the lead investigator) in which collections of cells influence nearby neighbors.
Specific geometric techniques include clustering-induced Voronoi diagrams,
coupled optimal shape approximation, and matching based on earth mover's
distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exploring these geometric structures in important
medical problems will not only lead to new methods in combinatorial optimization
and machine learning, and new publically-available software for medical
applications, but also train students in the broad range of interdisciplinary
research and education from geometric algorithms, software development, to
medical applications. By providing appropriate analysis tools for the
physicians, this project and its students will help save lives.
