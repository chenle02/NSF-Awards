Sharon Hammes-Schiffer of the Pennsylvania State University is supported by an
award from the Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry
division to carry out research on theoretical studies of proton-coupled electron
transfer (PCET) reactions. The PI and her research group are pursuing four
related projects: 1) developing both grid and nuclear-electronic orbital(NEO)
methods for analyzing the electron-proton nonadiabatic effects to elucidate the
mechanisms of PCET reactions. The degree of electronic nonadiabaticity for the
proton transfer reaction provides a quantitative diagnostic for differentiating
between hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and PCET, where HAT is electronically
adiabatic and PCET is electronically nonadiabatic. 2) developing methods to
calculate electron-proton vibronic couplings to enable the prediction of trends
in rate constants and kinetic isotope effects for PCET reactions. 3) developing
methods for studying the dynamics of photoinduced PCET reactions. The solvent
and solute nuclei are propagated on adiabatic electron-proton vibronic surfaces
using a surface hopping method to incorporate nonadiabatic transitions among the
adiabatic states 4) modeling the ultrafast dynamics of photo-excited PCET in
DNA.

Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions play a critical role in a wide
range of chemical and biological processes, including electrochemistry,
photosynthesis, respiration, and enzyme reactions. Software resulting from this
project is made widely available to the broader community by being included in
the public version of the GAMESS computational chemistry software package. The
advances from this research are provided to the public through a website devoted
to PCET that contains tutorials, code and interactive Java servletes
(https://webpcet.chem.psu.edu).
