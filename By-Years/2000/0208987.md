The general research goals will be to develop scheduling algorithms, to provide
provable performance guarantees, and to explore lower bounds defining the limits
of achievable performance. The performance of an algorithm on a given instance
will be evaluated by comparing the algorithm's achieved benefit to the maximum
possible benfit which could have been achieved on the same instance. The ratio
between teh achievable benefit and the achieved benefit will be considered over
an entire class of instances; the worst-case value of this ration is commonly
called the competeitive ration of an algorithm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
specific research goals will be two-fold. The first direction of research will
be to develop additional parameterization which can be used to describe the
competitiveness of schedulers with finer granularity. The second goal is to
better understand how subtle changes in the underlying modelaffect the
achievable performance.&lt;br/&gt;
