The Nebraska Statewide Systemic Initiative proposal aims to improve mathematics
education in Nebraska's schools. Although the core of the proposal is at the
precollege level, the project hopes to achieve higher University entrance
requirements in mathematics and increases in the numbers of degrees awarded in
mathematics (particularly to underrepresented populations). After solving the
state's problems in mathematics, an initiative for science education is
promised. The project's initial goals are: (1) implementation of the NCTM
standards in elementary and secondary schools; (2) a revised elementary
mathematics curriculum; (3) an increase in the mathematics requirements for
elementary certification; (4) a distance learning project for rural schools; (5)
greater integration of mathematics and science in secondary schools; (6) a
public awareness campaign to generate support for mathematics education; and (7)
a program to make mathematics education culturally relevant and learning-style
specific. Cost Sharing: 85%.
