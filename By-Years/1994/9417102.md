Branch, David AST 94-17102 This research will analyze and interpret the observed
photon spectra of Type I supernovae (those lacking conspicuous hydrogen lines in
their optical spectra) to constrain the elemental composition of the ejected
matter as a function of the electron velocity. Further studies will include
calculations of theoretical spectra for comparison with observed spectra of Type
Ia, Type Ib, Type Ic and Type II supernovae; determination of ejected mass, the
radius of the exploding star, the kinetic energy of the ejected matter, the
amount of radioactive Nickel ejected and the amount of mixing which occurs in
the ejecta; and analysis of observations of radio emission from supernovae and
supernova remnants in external galaxies. ***
