Diagnostic techniques based on video analysis and digital image processing are
implemented using inexpensive educational computers and home-video systems.
Coupled with laser-based imaging systems, these techniques enable a quantitative
understanding of the details of unsteady, multidimensional flows. This permits
us to address a major need in undergraduate fluid dynamics education: we can
teach about unsteady flows, and equip the engineering graduate with the
understanding and skills needed to make flow control innovations in a variety of
applications. A laboratory is proposed, to be organized around the existing
strengths of a modern aerospace fluid dynamics curriculum, to test this concept
for a year. Success will lead to a new way of teaching fluid dynamics, where
students will work hands-on with actual , dynamic flow images as part of their
courses. The project consists of designing and implementing an experimental
image database, using it in course assignments, developing and teaching a new
course on advanced flow diagnostics, and developing course material for a new
Flow Control course. The results will be disseminated by means of image data
discs, manuals and a Conference paper.
