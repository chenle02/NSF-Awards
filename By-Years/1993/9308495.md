9308495 Campbell The pace of recent colonization of the Brazilian Amazon has
provoked concern over losses of large areas of tropical primary forest as well
as the uncertain prospect of establishing sustainable agricultural systems in
this region. Effective policies for managing development of such regions depend
upon a clear and detailed understanding of how colonists have used the landscape
and how their uses change over time. Previous studies have examined
deforestation in such regions by means of satellite overviews, often without the
benefit of field data. This study applies multispectral remote sensing data to
identify land use patterns in a recently colonized region of Rondonia, Brazil.
It performs a detailed examination of land use on a lot-by-lot, field-by-field
basis for the period 1986 to 1992. It will focus on changes in forested area and
upon land uses that have replaced forested areas during colonization. Through
analysis of changes in land cover the research will isolate those biologic,
social, and economic processes which contribute to deforestation. Of particular
interest is the regrowth of forest after abandonment of economic activity, and
how the differences between primary and secondary growth forest can be
determined through spectral images from satellite data. Research on global
change includes not only analysis of ways in which human activity modifies
physical environments, but also the speed and character of regeneration of
natural systems. This research project, combining use of remotely sensed data
with ground observations and social surveys, will enhance understanding of the
role of human activity in the complex processes of deforestation and forest
regeneration in ecologically senstive areas of the world. ***
