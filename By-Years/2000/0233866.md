0233866 &lt;br/&gt;Wendorf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This project
supports a US-Egypt Workshop on Research in Anthropology to be held in Cairo,
Egypt, February 2003. The organizers are Dr. Fred Wendorf, Department of
Anthropology, Southern Methodists University, Dallas, Texas and Dr. Dr. Azza
Mohamed Sarry El-Din, National Research Center (NRC), Cairo, Egypt. The workshop
is to exchange information between the US and Egyptian sides on: 1) specific
topics in anthropological archeology including: cultural heritage management,
exploration of the Nile floodplain, desert survey, desert-valley interaction,
national archeological map, relationship between landscape culture and society,
environs of Egyptian temples, 2) topics in physical anthropology and human
paleontology including: early primates, paleopathology, prehistoric and early
historic population characteristics, human genetics, including DNA studies of
ancient and modern populations and populations history and migration, physical
effects of urban environments in Egypt, and demographic and epidemiological
transitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This project enables US and Egyptian
scientists to participate in a workshop to discuss an area scientific importance
to scientists and officials in both countries and to identify potential
collaborative research where the two sides can complement each other's
capabilities. Dr. Wendorf has successfully conducted research in Egypt in this
field for several years. The NRC has a group that does considerable
anthropological research in Egypt, and has the facilities to manage the workshop
and to promote the resulting joint collaborative research. This project is being
partially supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants
to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these joint
scientific activities. Additional funding is provided by the Division of
Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;
