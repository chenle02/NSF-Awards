The Midwest Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics Meeting will be held in
Pittsburgh, PA on May 13-14, 2002. Although, most of the speakers are faculty,
this meeting also emphasizes presentations and participation by graduate
students and postdoctoral scholars working in all areas of thermodynamics,
including experimental and classical thermodynamics, molecular simulation, and
statistical mechanics. Funding is requested to reimburse graduate students for
travel and registration costs associated with the meeting. Funds for other
aspects of running this meeting have been arranged from other sources, primarily
donations from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. NST-
CTS has provided student travel funds for this meeting several times in the
past, and this action has been important in making attendance at this meeting
widely accessible to graduate students.
