MRI: Acquisition of a Power4-based IBM SP and PC-based Scalable Display Wall for
Multidisciplinary Computational Science Research

This is a proposal for equipment acquisition under the Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) program to support research and student training across a
broad range of advanced scientific computing applications. The proposed
supercomputer and visualization instrumentation would contribute to
computational investigations of subnuclear particle phenomena, the dynamics of
quantum systems, space weather modeling, the electrodynamics of plasma processes
in the ionosphere, managing the manufacturing supply chain, subsurface sensing
and imaging systems, among many other projects.
