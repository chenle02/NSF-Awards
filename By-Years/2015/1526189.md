Among the most fundamental problems in theoretical computer science is the
k-SATISFIABILITY problem (k-SAT), which roughly asks: Given a set of Boolean
constraints of a special form, each acting on k out of n bits, does there exist
an assignment to all n bits which simultaneously satisfies every constraint?
This problem has far-reaching applications in areas ranging from artificial
intelligence to electronic design automation to theorem proving, thus
underscoring its significance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More recently, a quantum
generalization of k-SAT has arisen, known as k-QSAT, which finds applications in
areas such as quantum error-correcting codes. Moreover, k-QSAT is physically
well-motivated, as it can be thought of as modeling how quantum systems in
nature are governed by local quantum constraints. Unlike k-SAT, however, much
less is known about k-QSAT. The aim of this project is precisely to close this
fundamental knowledge gap. In particular, this project broadly asks: In what
cases can non-trivial algorithms be developed for solving k-QSAT?
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resolution of this question will yield deep insights
into which properties of quantum systems can be computed efficiently by a
classical computer. Moreover, the results obtained will be disseminated through
a variety of avenues, including conferences, new course materials, and high
school workshops aimed at exposing young computer scientists to the frontiers of
research.
