Abstract

The PIs will carry out an integrated chemostratigraphic, lithostratigraphic and
ecostratigraphic study that will consider the onset and history of the
Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum in the context of earlier studies from the
Atlantic, Pacific, and deeper Southern Ocean. The PIs have generated a bulk
carbonate stable isotope record for two Southern Ocean sites that demonstrates
stratigraphic completeness across the Paleocene-Eocene boundary at both sites.
They propose to test three questions and relate their findings to other PETM
records: 1) what was the rate of onset of the PETM and specifically, did the
hypothesized methane release that triggered the PETM event oxidize in the
atmosphere and progressively mix downward through the ocean?; 2) how did
carbonate saturation change through the section and were there multiple methane
injections?, and 3) how did the planktic and benthic ecosystems respond to the
event by way of changes in hydrography and planktic-benthic coupling? The
addition of Sites 738 and 689 results to other depth transects focused on high-
resolution study of the PETM will provide new information for the shallower
depths of the Southern Ocean.
