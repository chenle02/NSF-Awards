The Duke University Office of Continuing Education will conduct a 5-week summer
Young Scholars Program for 20 minority girls, rising North Carolina 8th and 9th
graders, on the Duke campuses in Durham and Beaufort, North Carolina, to be held
in 1989 and 1990. The core of the Young Scholars curriculum is three 3-week
courses, one on research in marine biology, one on problem solving, and one on
computer programming. The Duke Marine Laboratory on the coast in Beaufort, North
Carolina, is the setting for the marine biology course, which will be completed
in the labs of the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics in Durham.
The course in computer programming will introduce students to a programming
environment which emphasizes structured programming. Supplementary activities in
writing and speaking will use science and math-based materials and will enhance
communications skills. A mentorship program will place students in labs with
working scientists. A follow-up weekend is planned for Winter/Spring 1990 in
Durham at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics.
