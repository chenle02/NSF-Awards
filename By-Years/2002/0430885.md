Cooperative Source and Channel
Coding&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current and next generations
of wireless devices and services are substantially different than the original
cellular phones which could only carry voice signals. Third/fourth generation
cellular and wireless local area networks are designed to support data services,
image and video communications as well as voice. Multimedia signals require
higher data rates and larger bandwidths than their voice counterparts. This
necessitates a more efficient use of already scarce radio resources.
Furthermore, guaranteeing a desired level of signal quality for image and video,
measured in terms of overall distortion, is especially difficult given that the
wireless channel is unreliable and most efficient compression algorithms involve
error propagation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to provide robust wireless
multimedia communications, this research uses cooperative communication
techniques along with jointly optimized source compression and channel coding
strategies. Cooperation of wireless terminals is achieved by overhearing other
terminal's signals and retransmitting towards the desired destination. This
provides signal diversity and enables robust source-to-destination routes which
can adapt to changes in the wireless environment. In order to establish the
theory and practice of cooperative source and channel coding, the research plan
consists of three interrelated components: Information theory of source channel
cooperation; design of cooperative source and channel coding techniques with
numerical/simulation studies to jointly optimize the parameters; and application
of these techniques to wireless video transmission. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
