Proposal #0204119 PI: Yingfei Yi Institution: Georgia Tech Title: Multi-
frequency oscillations and related perturbation problems

ABSTRACT

This project concerns the study of multi-frequency oscillations, including
quasi-periodic, almost-periodic and almost-automorphic oscillations, in physical
systems that are either regularly or singularly perturbed. Quasi-periodic
oscillations will be studied mainly for Hamiltonian and generalized Hamiltonian
systems originating in fluid mechanics, solid state physics and biology. Almost-
periodic and almost-automorphic oscillations will be studied for quasi-
periodically forced oscillatory systems and weakly coupled networks of quasi-
periodic oscillators. The goal is to better understand the complicated dynamics
resulting from the interaction of several frequencies and the intermittency
phenomena that occur especially when the frequencies are close to resonance. For
singularly perturbed oscillatory systems, the study of multi-frequency
oscillations will focus on those of either relaxation or fast type, with
particular attention to ecological, bio-medical and communication systems. The
results of this project will have significant applications to the analysis,
computation and design of certain biological, electrical and mechanical
oscillators.

This project is concerned with mathematical models of dynamics arising in
biological, electrical and mechanical systems that present multi-phase
oscillations. Multi-phase oscillations are universal phenomena in physical
systems that involve a large number of degrees of freedom, multi-parameters, and
many oscillating frequencies. Their study is of great importance for the
understanding of complicated phenomena in nature, such as turbulence in fluids,
noisy signals in telecommunication, transport of DNA chains, and transmission
dynamics of infectious diseases. The results of this project will also have a
large impact on practical engineering designs of mechanical and electrical
systems and devices, in particular the identification of useful design
parameters and the prediction of singular oscillatory behavior.
