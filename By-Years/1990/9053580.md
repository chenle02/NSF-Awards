New Mexico State University will conduct a four-year program to improve
secondary school teaching and learning of mathematics through student "research"
projects. The concept, which has been developed and successfully tested at New
Mexico State by the project staff, will be transported to secondary schools and
tested via this teacher enhancement program. In line with the NCTM Curriculum
Standards and with principles underlying calculus reform, the idea is to
transfer the emphasis from teaching by transmitting information to learning by
hands-on problem- solving work. The program activities will focus on the posing
and solving of substantial problems that form the basis of project-oriented
learning, and on cooperative learning strategies. All three Las Cruces public
schools will participate in this project, with 28 teachers as participants. The
evaluation component has a unique characteristic in that a high percentage of
the Las Cruces high school graduates who continue on to higher education do so
at New Mexico State University. For this reason, the progress of a substantial
number of students can be monitored and assessed during the life of the grant.
The project staff has produced materials for over 100 undergraduate student
research projects and, together with the participants, the staff will produce
100 for teacher enhancement under this grant. A leadership component is included
to achieve a multiplier effect. New Mexico State University and the Las Cruces
Public Schools have contributed an amount equal to 47% of the National Science
Foundation request.
