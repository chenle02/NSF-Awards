III-9361651 Bend Research Inc. Walter C. Babcock Abstract The aim of this
project is the formation of new hollow fiber membranes made of plasma polymers.
The method derives from earlier work on the preparation of flat-sheet plasma
membranes which were both flexible and highly selective. Testing of the hollow
fiber membranes will include the specific application of separating oxygen from
air. Membrane technologies offer the prospect of effective, low energy
separations in processes that readily scale up. Advances in the synthesis of new
membranes will help American industry be more cost effective and better able to
address environmental concerns. PYI BK! ı@g ı BEAST COM ) vK CHECKERSCOM t ! #
