Boss, Alan AST 96-16093 Recent observational evidence indicates that stars form
in pairs, or as binary systems, rather than singly, like our sun. Conditions
required to form binary stars are poorly understood, and most theoretical
modeling has concentrated on studying single star formation. Dr. Boss will
rectify this situation by carrying out research into the processes that lead to
binary star formation. His program will improve understanding of the
fragmentation process which occurs during protostellar collapse in molecular
clouds, and his theoretical models will include effects such as mass accretion,
orbital mergers and initial magnetic fields, all previously neglected in
theoretical treatments, but recognized to be potentially important. His work
will follow the orbital evolution of the binary fragments for much longer times
than is typical in models, as the fragments interact with the residual disk and
cloud envelope. Dr. Boss's work is closely tied to observations, both through
the initial conditions of his models and through the resulting calculation of
line emission from the protostellar fragments for comparison with observations
of star-forming regions. His results will also allow the determination of the
minimum mass of a protostellar fragment, which has bearing on the discrimination
between brown dwarf stars and giant planets, and the interpretation of recent
observational detection of companions to solar-type stars. ***
