This investigation will both experimental and numerical. The objectives of the
proposed research are as follow: 1) Experimental Investigations (These are
divided into two parts). a) Experimental investigation of double- diffusive
convection in a static V-shaped sump during the binary system solidification
process. b) Experimental investigation of double- diffusive convection during
the continuous casting process. 2) As far as the numerical investigation is
concerned, this section is also divided into two parts. a) Development of
mathematical modeling and refinement. b) Numerical study of the continuous
casting process. The specific objectives are to obtain velocity, temperature,
concentration distribution, and the evaluation of the solid liquid interface in
the cases cited for which rigorous experimental and numerically results are not
available, and to present correlations, tables and graphs for use in industrial
applications. It is believed that the availability of accurate
experimental/numerical results for these fundamental problems is important from
an academic and practical point of view and that they will further enhance
research in these area.
