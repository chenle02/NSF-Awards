Funds are provided to physicists at Northeastern University for computing
equipment to enable them to pursue their experiments in elementary particle
physics. Northeastern University will cost share with the NSF in the ratio 1:2.
Seven workstations linked to a central node with disc storage space will be
purchased. The equipment will be used for experiments in progress at Fermilab,
the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland and the Gran
Sasso Laboratory in Italy.
