Physicists from the University of Rochester will continue their research on the
study of heavy quarks and related topics. They will use two electron-positron
colliding beam facilities, one in the U.S. at Cornell University and the second
in Japan at KEK (National High Energy Physics Laboratory). 1. At KEK, they will
design and construct an instrument to be used to identify electrons to be used
with a major particle detector (called AMI) at the newly commissioned Tristan
storage ring facility. 2. At the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, they will work
with the particle detector (known as CLEO II) now being upgraded. They will
study the weak decays of b-quarks to measure some of the fundamental parameters
of the electro-weak interactions.
