Interdisciplinary(99) This project brings interdisciplinary study to mechanical
engineering and biology students through a course entitled "Mechanical
Properties of Biological Tissue". Emerging fields which include biology
applications in engineering are important and involve contributions from a
number of fields. The course enhances opportunities for students from
engineering and science in the field of bioengineering. The project focuses on
the need to increase collaboration between students and faculty from different
disciplines to solve increasingly complex problems in technology. Through
innovative modules of learning, biology and engineering students interact and
share expertise from the perspectives of their disciplines. Students serve as
peer mentors in a hands-on discovery-based laboratory setting to study issues
involved in the engineering of connective tissues. The course produces students
who have experienced the benefits of working at the interface of disciplines and
working in tandem with peers from a different disciplinary background. This
interaction contributes to the creation of a workforce prepared to address
increasingly complex technological problems.
