Planning Grant: Next Generation Electronic System Design (NEXYS)

University of Pittsburgh; Alex Jones &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning grant
proposal targets a new program on next generation electronic system design
(dubbed Nexys: Next Generation Electronic System Design), based at Carnegie
Mellon University (lead institution), in collaboration with Pennsylvania State
University and the University of Pittsburg. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
participating universities propose a framework that will allow a seamless
communication channel between academic and industries, and will enable
innovation in the semiconductor and electronic design automation field. The
proposed research thrusts reflect the expertise of the PIs and include: system-
level power/thermal/sustainability modeling, analysis and optimization; system-
level reliability, robustness, and system lifetime modeling and optimization, as
well as test and diagnosis; on-chip communication fabrics; manufacturing process
or system parameter variability impact and mitigation at architecture and system
level; 3D integration; advanced memory design, including phase-change and
magnetoresitive RAM. In addition, the proposed program will include several
cross-cutting research themes targeting different application platforms:
embedded, high-performance, cyber-physical, reconfigurable computing and FPGAs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed framework will provide a direct flow of ideas
among participating academic and industrial institutions, as well as
student/researcher exchanges, while also building a diverse body of
participants, with deep implications in undergraduate/graduate education or
beyond. The proposed center plans to enable fast transfer of technology from the
academic side to industrial partners, and a steady pipeline of graduate students
working on industrial-relevant project with direct feedback from industry. All
three institutions are committed to a strong educational and advising program,
but diversity will be addressed explicitly in their efforts.
