The principal investigator will use methods of complex analytic geometry to
investigate the relationship between stable holomorphic bundles on a compact
complex surface and their blowups. The goal here is to distinguish
differentiable structures on 4-manifolds. He will also study singularities of
holomorphic vector bundles with bounded curvature on the complements of analytic
sets. The proposed research will contribute to our understanding of the large-
scale nature of the universe. This effort should help to answer the long time
question left open by Einstein as to which four dimensional space-time comprises
our universe.
