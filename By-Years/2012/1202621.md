This project provides funding for the completion of the final report of a long-
term archaeological project at Wales, Alaska, and will support two students as
they assist in preparing the data and contents of the monograph for submission
for publication, and ultimate curation of the cultural materials in the
collection. The Wales project represents almost two decades of research on an
important Alaskan site that represents a complexity of social group interaction
in the region that both complements and complicates previous understandings of
Bering Strait prehistory. In addition, the project will engage the Wales
community in the preparation of the monograph, including traditional community
knowledge (written by members of the Wales community) about the archaeological
sites investigated. The completion of this project will see not only the
publication of results but the return of the collections from this project to
public curation and, eventually, the return of part of this collection to the
Seward Peninsula/Bering Strait region where it can become a focus for local
community awareness and education as well as a source of interpretation for non-
indigenous residents and visitors to the area.
