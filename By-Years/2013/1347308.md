The Principal Investigator (PI) formulates the information procuration problem
of converting unstructured data into structured information as one of using
limited resources (such as processing time and collection costs) among several
available strategies for information acquisition, extraction, collation and
aggregation in a sequential and adaptive manner. The proposal aims to build a
Markov decision process (MDP) for which both the states and the rewards will be
learned, and from which an optimal adaptive strategy for effective information
procuration will be extracted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent methods for designing
adaptive strategies for multi-armed bandit problems and budgeted learning
approaches by the PI will be extended for this purpose, as well as techniques
from inverse reinforcement learning. Moreover, given the intended size of the
application data sets, the focus will be on on scalable algorithms for these
problems. Due to the centrality of the problem, new approaches to making better
sense of unstructured data will have much impact both in terms of developing new
methods and in practice. The proposed synthesis of methods from Operations
Research, Approximation Algorithms and Machine Learning is novel in this
context. This proposal will increase the cross-fertilization of ideas between
Operations Research and Machine Learning, via a collaboration team formed at
this intersection.
