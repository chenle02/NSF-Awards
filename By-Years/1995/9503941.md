DMR-9503941 Hiltner A layer-multiplying technology is proposed that will process
elastometers, thermoplastics, and composites into sheets of films with hundreds
or thousands of alternating layers. With this technology, two polymers are fed
from extruders into a feed block as parallel layers, and then into a die that
splits, spreads, and recombines the melt. Any number of die elements can be
combined in series to produce two- component multilayered structures, or three-
component multilayered structures by adding a third OtieO polymer. Fundamental
research topics include mechanisms of polymer compatibilization and of interface
formation. As the individuial layer thickness becomes comparable to the size of
the polymer molecule, new phenomena and properties arising from the high
interface to volume ratio are anticipated. There is a need for new processing
technologies to create engineered microstructures of incompatible polymers. The
processing facility to be developed at Case Western Reserve will make it
possible to scout a wide range of multilayered compositions of interest to the
academic as well as to the industrial communities. The co-extrusion technology
can potentially produce layered polymers with unique toughness and permeability
characteristics.
