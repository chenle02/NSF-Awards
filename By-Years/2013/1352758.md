The focus of this project is community-driven coordination and support for the
2014 Campus Cyberinfrastructure - Networking, Infrastructure and Engineering
(CC-NIE) Principal Investigators' (PI) meeting. The workshop, comprising over 80
active award activities in the CC-NIE program, will help the community
understand the research and development challenges at the intersection of campus
networking infrastructure and innovation, and the science application domains
enabled. Activities include community engagement and knowledge exchange
generated through CC-NIE project presentations from both main areas of the
program, including interactive sessions. Key campus network engineering issues
are identified and discussed among networking leaders in research and education.
Some sessions focus on the applied research and development elements of the
program and funded activities, covering emerging topics in data networking such
as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and promising research from the GENI
project and the Future Internet Architectures (FIA) program.
