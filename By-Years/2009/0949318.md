MetPetDB (Metamorphic Petrology Database) is a database and collaboration
suite&lt;br/&gt;developed at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute through a previous
Geoinformatics grant. MetPetDB is designed for archival of published data for
ready access, an access point for researchers and students to the enormous
volume of available information, a collaboration tool among researchers working
in different institutions, and a source for data analysis and networking
interactions among researchers with the ultimate goal of fostering new and
innovative science. It provides a first step for a robust cyberinfrastructure in
the geosciences where published and unpublished data can be shared with the
community, used in research collectively, and curated by its use through
selections, comments and references.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In this project, the
PIs will develop a number of new and innovative&lt;br/&gt;functionalities to
enhance the current system and continue populating it with data to further
improve on this vision of a completely new science through the use of
cyberinfrastructure. The data model of the MetPetDB system is based on
metamorphic samples and subsamples and incorporates seamless integration between
sample characteristics, images and chemical analyses as a fundamental design
element. This aspect of MetPetDB is unique in the geosciences, and their results
have application in other, image intensive, disciplines.
Several&lt;br/&gt;hundreds of samples and thousands of chemical analyses are
already uploaded to the system.
