The objective of this project is to determine the technical feasibility of
process to biologically degrade chlorinated hydrocarbons by sequentially
subjecting them to anaerobic and aerobic degradation systems. The feasibility of
this approach will be determined using a laboratory scale aquifer simulator in
which ground water is selectively amended to stimulate growth of appropriate
microbial communities and is recirculated through contaminated soil. The initial
target compound for this work will be tetrachloroethylene, a chlorinated solvent
that has been spilled and disposed of on soil and subsequently entered ground
water, causing widespread aquifer contamination. The proposal leading to this
Phase I award was submitted and evaluated in accord with NSF 87-8, NSF Program
Solicitation, Small Business Innovation Research.
