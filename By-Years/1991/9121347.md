Large meteorite impact craters on the Earth are rare at best, and only Tunguska
in Siberia is known to be less than 10,000 years old. However, there is strong
evidence that a large meteorite (est. over 100 meters in diameter) struck in
South America (Argentina) in the very recent past, possibly within the last 2000
years. At present this crater is virtually unknown to both the public and the
scientific community but knowledge of it's existence is bound to spread rapidly.
If this impact was caused by a bolide bigger than Tunguska and the crater is
better preserved than Meteor Crater, the scientific implications will be
startling. This award will enable the PI to visit the site this Fall where he
and his local collaborators plan to conduct field investigations, collect
samples and do some preliminary analysis.
