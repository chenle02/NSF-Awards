The Louisiana Mathematics Masters in the Middle (LaM3) project is a
collaborative partnership involving the University of Louisiana at Lafayette's
College of Education and College of Sciences, Lafayette Parish School System,
Iberia Parish School System, Vermilion Parish School System, and the Allen J.
Celestine Foundation. Twenty exceptionally qualified mathematics teachers
recruited from the three partner school districts are completing graduate
coursework leading to the Louisiana Elementary Mathematics Specialist
Certification, which signifies the ability to provide instructional leadership
in mathematics. This Master Teacher Fellowship project is anchored in intensive
content and pedagogical graduate courses and in engaging practicum that allows
the participants to maximize their pedagogical potential. An objective of the
project is to leverage the knowledge and skills of this talented mathematics
teaching corps to foster, nurture, and unearth the hidden or unmet potential in
students who are often underexposed to high-quality mathematics teaching. The
project is 1) studying the effects of further strengthening mathematical content
and pedagogical knowledge of exceptional mathematics teachers in Louisiana and
2) examining the extent to which the participants can accelerate the
mathematical savvy and proficiency of students who possess hidden or unmet
potential. The Master Teachers are establishing professional learning
communities in their schools and mentoring preservice students who are preparing
to become middle school mathematics teachers. The project further attempts to
accentuate the value of LaM3 participants by chronicling changes in their peers'
pedagogical practices that are attributable to participants' instructional
leadership and describing empirical accounts of pre-service teachers' seminal
experiences under the mentorship of LaM3 participants.
