The project is concerned with mathematical research on the function theory on
domains in the space of several complex variables. Fundamental ideas from
complex analysis, partial differential equations, operator theory and integral
representations are combined in these investigations. One basic goal - well
understood in one variable but open in several variables - is the classification
of domains into equivalence classes under holomorphic coordinate changes.
Considerable progress has been made recently in this area through research on
related problems of extending holomorphic maps to the boundary of regions. This
was done by analysis of the Bergman projection operator. This focused attention
on projections of functions onto holomorphic function spaces such as the Bergman
and the Szego projections. Work will be done analyzing the regularity properties
of these and related projections on convex domains. Corvex domains with real
analytic boundary are of finite type so that well known methods of partial
differential equations can be used to show that these projection operators
preserve differentiability of functions in Sobolev spaces. Work will be done in
expanding present methods and developing new tools to handle domains of infinite
type.
