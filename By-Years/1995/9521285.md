9521285 Cabrera This project is to develop a low-cost Acoustic Doppler Current
Profiler (ADCP) optimized for shallow water applications. In addition to lower
instrument cost, the new system will provide a number of significant advantages
over existing ADCPs such as: ability to measure closer to the surface/bottom,
more rugged transducers, lower power consumption, smaller size, and simpler
operation and deployment. It has demonstrated the feasibility of achieving these
goals with the use of state-of-the-art electronics and application specific
hardware to reduce cost, size and power consumption. It has also demonstrated
how new transducer design and optimized pinging schemes can significantly reduce
sidelobe interference thus increasing the likelihood of accurate measurements
close to the surface/bottom. In addition, a number of materials and construction
techniques for transducers and underwater housings that can be used to improve
the ruggedness of the system in areas of high biological activity were
evaluated. Research will continue in some of the areas identified. Two complete
field-worthy prototypes will be constructed and extensive field testing and
system evaluation in cooperation with academic institutions will be performed.
The device will allow the relatively low cost measurement of currents in bodies
of water to further studies in ocean research, nearshore erosion and bridge
pillar deterioration, etc.
