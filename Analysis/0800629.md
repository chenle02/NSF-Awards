Abstract Li

Since Klyashko's major breakthrough in the mid 1990s, there has been great
excitements and renewed interests on a wide range of problems related to the
Horn's conjecture in representation theory, algebraic geometry, and
combinatorics. In particular, significant results were obtained by Balkale,
Buch, Fulton, Knutson, Tao, Woodward, and many others. In contrast, the Horn's
conjecture has not attracted as much attention in operator theory, even though
the conjecture was formulated in terms of self-adjoint matrices. The proof of
Horn's conjecture uses highly nontrivial tools from algebraic geometry and
combinatorics. For the past ten years, it has been an ongoing project of
Bercovici and the PI to find a constructive proof of Horn's conjecture which can
be generalized to the von Neumann algebra setting. Recent progress has shown new
promises. The propose project will provide new understanding of the eigenvalue
problem and the intricate geometry of the eigenflags. The PI and her
collaborators also plan to use the machinery that they have developed so far to
extend the Horn's conjecture to type II_1 von Neumann factors. A recent result
of Collin and Dykema may allow one to use their approach to settle the
Connes'embedding problem, i.e., if every type II_1 factor can be embedded in the
ultrapower of the hyperfinite II_1 factor, a fundamental question in operator
algebra.

The problem of eigenvalues of sums of selfadjoint matrices has intimate
connections with algebraic geometry, intersection theory, representation theory,
and combinatorics. The proposed project will provide the much needed insight
from the operator theory point of view. The generalization to type II_1 factors
will bring interesting problems and feedbacks to algebraic geometry and
representation theory. The PI is the Georgia Tech ADVANCE professor in the
College of Sciences. She is working with others at Georgia Tech to promote the
advancement of women in science and engineering in academic. She is also working
with AMS on issues that are especially affecting the advancement of women
mathematicians in academics. The proposed project will be an essential part of
her research program that will help her greatly at this endeavor.
