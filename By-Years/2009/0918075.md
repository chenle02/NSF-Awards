This RAPID proposal describes a series of field and laboratory studies to
determine whether the election of Barack Obama, the first African American
president, will serve as an affirmation to members of ethnic minority groups and
lead to improved academic motivation and performance. Whether this particular
event has significant effects on the achievement of students of varying age
groups, especially in STEM subjects, constitutes an urgent and important
question for rigorous scientific research. We agree with the PI that this
research will advance our understanding of how major societal events, beyond the
immediate classroom environment, affect students' psychology and achievement
motivation. The proposed research will shed light on the social-psychological
processes that play a role in the racial achievement gap in STEM-related fields,
a critical educational problem. Further the results of this study will
facilitate the development of pedagogical strategies, and cost-effective
teaching and curriculum strategies that benefit minority achievement and
participation in STEM-related fields and beyond.
