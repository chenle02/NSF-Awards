Increased intelligence and flexibility in a distributed database system are
achieved in this project using new automated reasoning algorithms. In
particular, concurrency control is done by logical analysis of updates and
queries to determine whether they conflict. The specific focus of the project is
the design and implementation of a new database system that is fully distributed
in the sense that neither concurrency control nor any other function are
necessarily performed at a central site. Fully distributed concurrency control
is achieved by explicit agreement between sites as to which transactions may
proceed, which should be delayed, and which should be restarted. Explicit common
knowledge of active transactions allows the system to adapt heuristically to
changing patterns of access to the shared database. This explicit common
knowledge is achieved by syntactic and semantic reasoning about queries and
updates at individual sites which then execute a distributed consensus algorithm
to share their conclusions. OPTIONAL: The algorithms for reasoning about query
and update conflict are based on a comprehensive theory of query and update
independence developed recently by the principal investigator.
