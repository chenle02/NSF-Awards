ECS-9634210 Lee, Hua The purpose of this equipment award is to replace the
computation component of the laboratory with three advanced HP workstations
(HP9000 model C110 and model C100) in order to provide adequate computational
support to the research programs. In addition an Agfa ProColor Premier digital
film recorder as an additional unit for the component of high-resolution image
display and visualization, for the purpose of hard-copy documentation will be
purchased. Hewlett-Packard has offered special discounts of 50% which are
significantly larger than the normal educational discount as a cost-sharing
contribution. The total cost of the equipment replacement is $59, 832. The
College of Engineering will provide $20,000 as the institutional match to this
request. Thus, the total NSF funding is $39,832.
