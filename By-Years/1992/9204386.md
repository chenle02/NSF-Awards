This research is to utilize a theoretical method developed by the Principal
Investigator, the partitioned waveform method, to digital and analog seismograms
to investigate the S velocity in the upper mantle of the North American plate,
with special emphasis on the lithosphere/asthenosphere structure beneath the
continent. The major goal of this study will be to provide a structural
interpretation of the upper mantle beneath the continents with a resolution of a
few hundred km or better that is sufficiently well balanced geographically and
that extends deep enough to serve as a framework for the interpretation of
gravity anomalies, heat flow and stress patterns, and to study the evolution of
the continent.
