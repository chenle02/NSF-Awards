Large-magnitude intracontinental extension in the Death Valley region of
California has been modeled by using pre-extensional markers such as pre-
Tertiary thrust faults and Paleozoic strati- graphic trends. The model indicates
that extension across the region was accommodated by wholesale separation of the
upper 15 km of the continental crust along a discrete, west-dipping zone of
normal faults less than 10 km in width. During the ensuing 150km of pull apart,
deep crust rose isostatically and filled the void left between the separating
blocks. Volumetrically minor fault slivers were sequentially transferred from
the hanging wall block to the detached slivers and apparent cessation of major
extension migrated westward with the hanging wall. This project will use
structural mapping, paleomagnetism and thermochronology of the slivers to
rigorously test this model. Results are of importance to south-western U.S.
tectonics and to the general process of large-scale continental extension.
