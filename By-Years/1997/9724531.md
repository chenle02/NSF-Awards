This proposal seeks funding for the completion of a state of the art, bending
magnet, protein crystallography station on the X9A beamline of the National
Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven National Laboratories. The plan
includes the purchase of the beamline optical components (i.e., monochromator
and mirror) as well as a CCD detector and associated automation and computing
hardware for rapid and efficient data collection and reduction. This facility
will provide the crystallographic communities at the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine (AECOM), Rockefeller University (RU) and the Sloan-Kettering Institute
(SKI) with 170 days of access per year to high flux, tunable synchrotron
radiation, and will allow for rapid progress on existing projects, as well as
the initiation and timely completion of new structural problems. In addition,
this facility will provide 60 days of beam time to the protein crystallography
community nationwide through the NSLS General User program, which requires that
25% of the total beam time be distributed through a peer reviewed process
administered by NSLS.
