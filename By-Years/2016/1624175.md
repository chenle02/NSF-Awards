This request is for support to broaden and diversify the student participation
in the 25th International Conference on Parallel Architecture and Compilation
Techniques (PACT 2016). PACT is the premier event that brings together
researchers from architecture, compilers, applications and languages to present
and discuss innovative research of common interest.

The students receiving travel support will benefit from the opportunity to
engage in the technical, professional, educational and social exchanges that
PACT fosters. The conference serves as an open forum to exchange research
results and develop new ideas, as an educational platform to expose students to
new research methodologies, tools, and infrastructures, and as a social event to
network and prepare students as future researchers. More broadly, this travel
support will increase the attendance of under-represented minorities and
talented undergraduate students, attracting them to graduate schools.
