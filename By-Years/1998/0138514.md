In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Wodtke will use a new technique to study highly excited
vibrational states of polyatomic molecules, with energies that bring them close
to the reaction barrier. Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) will be used as a prototype
system and will be studied by the combined techniques of stimulated emission
pumping and electric hexapole focusing to obtain energy and dipole moment
information in individual highly excited rotation-vibrational states. Such
information will serve to better map out the wavefunctions for highly excited
states especially for isomerizing transitions.

This project addresses a major problem in contemporary physical chemistry,
namely the characterization of molecules in excited states, high enough to
affect reactions and isomerization transitions. Two separate techniques are
combined in a novel way to obtain such information. Experiments on the prototype
hydrogen cyanide molecule will be extended to other systems. The research will
provide excellent training for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in
modern research techniques.
