9601597 Reckhow This is an award to provide support for purchase of analytical
equipment to be used in support of environmental engineering research at the
University of Massachusetts. The equipment to be obtained as a result of this
award will be used on research to chemically modify the structure of
recalcitrant organic compounds in such a way as to render them more biologically
degradable. While principally addressed to research on water treatment
processes, the equipment is also expected to contribute to research on issues in
air pollution control and decontamination of groundwater. The proposal leading
to this award was submitted in response to the National Science Foundation's
Instrumentation Development and Acquisition Solicitation, NSF 96-8, Academic
Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program. Results of this award are expected to
improve the accessibility of modern research instrumentation for use by this
institution's faculty in conducting research on important topics of
environmental significance and in educating students.
