Animals, including humans, routinely use movement to sense the world around
them. For example, to sense the texture of an object, a person might move her
hand over the surface, whereas to measure the object's weight, she might hold it
in her palm and move it up and down. This use of different movements to sense
features of the environment is called Active Sensing. Although active sensing is
commonplace in human behavior, how the brain generates and controls these
movements is poorly understood. The goal of this project is to reveal and
describe (in mathematical equations) the brain's strategies for active sensing.
This will be achieved by studying a specialized animal species, the weakly
electric glass knifefish. This animal was chosen because it has a suite of
properties that make it ideally suited for the experimental approach. The
expected findings will have broad implications for active sensing in other
animals (including humans) because active sensing behaviors are similar across
species. This work will have broad societal impacts, including the possible
transformation of robotic control systems and enhanced understanding of the
brain that may ultimately improve our understanding of neurological disorders.
Further this work includes multidisciplinary training of promising students in
critical STEM fields.

The central hypothesis for this research is that organisms adjust active
movements in order to tune the resulting sensory feedback to match processing
features of CNS circuits. This is a challenging problem because sensory inputs
and motor outputs are linked by a closed loop. The experimental approach
overcomes this challenge by (1) exploiting unique features of a well-suited
model system, weakly electric fishes, (2) developing a closed-loop behavioral
control system, and (3) performing chronic neurophysiological recordings in
freely swimming fish. This integrated approach will enable the quantification of
neuromechanical control strategies that organisms use to produce and modulate
movements for active sensing, identification of cellular and synaptic mechanisms
underlying neural responses to feedback from active movements, and discovery of
how these changes in active movements affect sensorimotor integration in
midbrain circuits.
