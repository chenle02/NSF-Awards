Although failures of meiosis are common, leading to a high rate of spontaneous
miscarriage in humans, little is known about the causes of meiotic
nondisjunction. The goal of the project is to pool the resources of two
laboratories, one working on retroposons and other working on meiosis, to study
the role of transposable elements in causing meiotic errors. Although some
previous studies suggest that transposon movement may be the cause of
spontaneous nondisjunction in meiotic chromosome segregation, this will be the
first test of the hypothesis. This project will induce a high rate of transposon
movement and then assess the effect on meiotic chromosome segregation, using
both genetics and cytology. Interactive activities include teaching
undergraduates in both a large and a smaller advanced class. The interactive
activities are designed to advertise the ability of women to excel in academic
research.
