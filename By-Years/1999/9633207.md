9633207 Mason Mercury is one of the few metals which can be said to be a
pollutant on a global scale. Anthropogenic inputs of gaseous Hg0 to the
atmosphere, estimated to be three to four times the natural terrestrial flux,
reach even the remote ocean due to the slowness of Hg0 oxidation in the
effective transport of atmospheric Hg), the most important source of Hg in the
oligotrophic ocean is aeolian deposition of oxidized Hg scavenged from the
atmosphere. One of the key reactions which determines the global fate of
anthropogenic Hg is the reduction of aeolian deposits of oxidized Hg2+ to Hg0 in
the ocean. Evidence that the reduction of Hg2+ in marine waters occurs in the
euphotic zone produced in fresh, estuarine and ocean surface waters at rates
which are quite variable (0.2 to 10% per day) by mechanisms which are poorly
understood. This work will seek to determine the mechanisms which are
environmentally significant and the conditions under which Hg is reduced and
oxidized in natural waters. Hg2+ reduction is likely to be a complex process,
necessitating both an in-depth understanding of photochemical reactions in
natural waters and experience studying the interaction of trace metals with
bota. The approach will uniquely combine abiotic photochemical studies and
estimates of biologically medicated Hg2+ reduction rates at realistic trace
concentrations of Hg2+.
