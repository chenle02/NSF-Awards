9424129 Datye This REU Site award provides an opportunity for eight
undergraduate students at the junior or senior level in chemistry or chemical
engineering, selected from institutions other than the University of New Mexico,
to work with faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates within the
Center for Microengineered Ceramics at the University of New Mexico on numerous
collaborative research projects in advanced materials processing during a ten
week summer period. The research focus is on synthesis, processing, and
characterization of advanced materials, such as ceramic powders, thin films,
membranes, absorbents, catalysts, and sol-gel synthesis of oxide and nonoxide
ceramics. %%% This program provides an invaluable opportunity for undergraduates
to gain insight and experience working on challenging, complex interdisciplinary
problems in materials processing.
