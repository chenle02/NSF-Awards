Random dynamical systems arise in the modeling of many phenomena in physics,
biology, economics, etc. when uncertainties or random influences, called noises,
are taken intoaccount. These random effects are not only introduced to
compensate for the defects in some deterministic models, but also are often
rather intrinsic phenomena. A fundamental problem is to study the dynamical
behavior of orbits of random dynamical systems. &lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to
establish some of the basic geometric framework for infinite dimensional random
dynamical systems. By proving existence and robustness of random invariant
manifolds and foliations, results on structural stability of deterministic
systems under random perturbations will be sought. Floquet theory containing the
multiplicative ergodic theorem will be developed, statistical properties of
random attractors, and pattern formation in random media will be explored. The
theory of smooth conjugacy for finite dimensional random dynamical systems will
also be developed.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include the
training of graduate students and junior faculty members in this emerging area
of dynamics. Applications to the many fields mentioned above will create
opportunities to interact on many levels with students and faculty members from
other disciplines and will lead to advances in technology. One such example are
the possible applications to the study of nano-devices, for instance, random
thermal fluctuations or quantum effects must be accounted for in order to
accurately predict performance. That field is one of many that is completely
open to analysis using tools of the type to be developed here.&lt;br/&gt;
