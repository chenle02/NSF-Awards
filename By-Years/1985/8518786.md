Support is provided for a conference under the Committee on Vision of the
Natural Research Council. The working group will survey the current state of
vision research on aids for those with vision handicaps. The legally blind or
those with substantial loss of vision may have a serious inability to move about
in their normal environment, even when limited to activity within the home. The
working group will summarize the current status of our knowledge about the
dimensions of the mobility problem, the status of currently available
technology, and an assessment of limitations and future potential of mobility
aids. To assist the working group, a two-day workshop of invited experts also
will be held, with the primary intent of promoting useful interaction between
visual researchers and those who can apply this knowledge to manufacture
effective, durable aids.
