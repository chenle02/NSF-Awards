In this in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Chronister will test theoretical models of the dynamics of molecular
solids. A combination of high pressure and ultrafast nonlinear coherent
spectroscopic techniques will be used as high resolution probes of the dynamics
of molecular solids at low temperatures. Ultrafast coherent Raman, photon echo,
and material preparation techniques will be used to uncover the homogeneous
dynamics in amorphous and pressure broadened systems. These experiments will be
used to refine theories of optical and vibrational dephasing in amorphous and
mixed crystalline solids. %%% Chronister will measure the behavior of solids
under high pressure and low temperatures. The information gathered is difficult
to obtain because the pressures involved are extremely high and temperatures are
very low. However, these data will ultimately aid our understanding of the
dynamic interactions between species in solid solution and their host materials.
