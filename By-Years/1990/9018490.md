Unresolved issues on the timing and magnitude of changes in deep ocean chemical
composition and circulation can be tackled with selective paired measurements of
benthic foraminiferal Cd, &13C, and &180 in deep ocean sediment cores. Gaps will
be filled and benthic paleochemical coverage of the last glacial maximum, and
cores from the South Atlantic, Antartic, and Northwest Pacific will be examined
to clarify why existing &13C and Cd evidence suggest such different glacial
paleochemical characteristics. Two more long downcore Cd records will be
completed to constrain the amplitude, timing, and spectral chacteristics of
benthic paleochemical changes. This data will be examined from the perspective
of simple models for carbon and nutrient cycling within the ocean, in order to
assess the role of ocean chemistry and circulation in controlling atmospheric
CO2.
