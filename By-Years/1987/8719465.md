Scientists at the California Institute of Technology are carrying out a new
Palomar Observatory Sky Survey known as POSS II. Three private grants funded an
upgrading of the telescope and laboratory facilities. National Science
Foundation (NSF) funds support a photographic scientist who oversees the quality
control necessary to produce a collection of high quality photographic plates.
The first Palomar Observatory Sky Survey, produced in the period 1952-1957, is
an extremely important reference source for all of astronomy. However, since the
sky is constantly changing through long term spectral and intensity changes,
proper motions of celestial objects, and relatively short term explosive events,
as well as through improved instrumentation and photographic techniques, a
repeat of the 30 year old atlas is of great importance.
