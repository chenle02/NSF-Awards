Jamie Karthein is awarded an NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Karthein will develop and improve
a theoretical equation of state for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) matter,
benchmarked by data from relativistic heavy ion collisions, in particular the
beam energy scan at Brookhaven National Laboratoryâ€™s Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider. Along with this research, Karthein will curate a workshop
series&lt;br/&gt;on leadership skills for minorities in STEM at MIT in
collaboration with the MIT Institute Community and Equity Office and establish a
Graduate School Mentorship program in partnership with the MIT Society for
Hispanic Professional Engineers for MIT undergraduates in
STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will lead to an increased
understanding of the fundamental strong interaction, one of the four forces of
nature. The strong force is responsible for binding together the protons and
neutrons, collectively hadrons, occurring in our universe today. By
understanding the medium produced in Heavy Ion Colliders (HICs), scientists
study the primordial liquid of the universe, the Quark-Gluon Plasma, and as a
result, the mechanism by which quarks and gluons combine to form hadrons.
Results on the QCD phase diagram are impactful for the astrophysics community
for studies of neutron-star mergers. Additionally, the extreme matter created in
HICs can also inform other fields of research on strongly coupled systems,
including ultra-cold atomic gases in magneto-optical
traps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
