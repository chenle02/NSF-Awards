This grant provides travel support for US scientists to a three-day "Workshop on
Numerical Linear Algebra and Optimization", to be held August 8-10, 2013 at the
University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. The workshop has the
following three objectives: (1) to bring together the community of linear
algebra and optimization in order to foster interaction and explore the rich
area at the intersection of these two research fields; (2) to seek application
of these problems in fields like machine learning and control; and (3) to
promote and discuss the issue of actively using large-scale numerical linear
algebra tools in scientific and industrial optimization. One of the main areas
the workshop will focus on is eigenvalue optimization, which has received a lot
of attention recently and which is studied by the two communities from different
perspectives.

Optimization is a large field of research, with applications ranging from
economics and engineering to national security, energy, and climate
understanding. Examples of problems that can be solved with the help of
optimization include maximizing profit or minimizing waste when manufacturing a
variety of goods under raw material constraints; computer-based learning to
classify objects (e.g., distinguishing tanks from trees); designing stronger
buildings subject to volume and environmental constraints; and making planes
safer by avoiding certain undesirable vibration frequencies. Solutions to such
optimization problems need to make use of linear algebra quantities (like
eigenvalues), and extensive calculations of such quantities must be done with
care and in the most efficient way. This is a central task in numerical linear
algebra, the tools of which have been adopted and adapted by various
optimization communities to suit their needs. There is a very rich area of
research at the interface between these two fields of optimization and numerical
linear algebra, and the organizers of this workshop aim to see both communities
work together toward addressing the important problems that arise in industry.
