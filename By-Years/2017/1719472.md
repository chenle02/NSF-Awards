Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive
institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate
degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance
the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research.
The project at Fayetteville State University seeks to build on previous
successful efforts to increase the participation of African-American students in
STEM disciplines. The goal of this project is to significantly improve
recruitment, persistence, retention and graduation rates for STEM undergraduate
students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will utilize evidence-based, high-
impact pedagogical practices to improve student learning and outcomes. The
practices include: a professional seminar course sequence; assessment-based
adaptive mathematics courses; student-centered active learning environment
upside-down pedagogies; intrusive peer tutoring and supplemental instruction;
and undergraduate research. The project will study the impact and efficacy of
the flipped classroom and determine effect sizes of its adoption by examining
students' perceptions, learning and outcomes. The project will be advised and
evaluated for effectiveness by internal and external advisory boards and an
evaluator.
