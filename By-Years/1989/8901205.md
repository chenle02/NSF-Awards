Jonathan Losos, a doctoral student working under the supervision of Dr. Harry
Greene at the University of California- Berkeley, is conducting an integrated
study of anatomical adaptations, ecology and performance (jumping ability,
sprint speed, clinging ability, etc.) of Anolis lizards of the Caribbean Islands
set in context of the evolutionary history of the group. Anatomical studies of
the numerous species of Caribbean Anoles suggests considerable parallel and
convergent evolution has occurred in anatomy, behavior and performance skills
among distantly related species as a result of adaptation to similar ecological
conditions. Losos studies the ecology and behavior of lizards in natural
habitats; the animals are then captured and a number of performance variables
measured in a field laboratory; morphological measurements are subsequently
made. The latter include measures of mass, body size, limb-length and scanning
electron microscope assessments of digital lamellar hairs which function in
adhesion. Integrated studies such as this, that take advantage of diverse
species in natural environments, lead to an understanding of how species evolve
adaptations to their environments. This, in turn, provides basic information on
how to protect the biodiversity of the earth.
