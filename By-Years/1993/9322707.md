9322707 Ruskai This project is a block travel grant for scientists to travel to
XI-th International Congress on Mathematical Physics (ICMP) sponsored by the
International Association of Mathematical Physics (IAMP) to be held in Paris,
France on 18-22 July, 1994. These meetings afford a unique opportunity for
mathematical physicists to see the latest developments in the wide range of
topics under the umbrella of mathematical physics. A major portion of the funds
go to support participation of new scientists and researchers from
underrpresented groups. The project will enable US scientists to remain at the
cutting edge of research in mathematical physics. ***
