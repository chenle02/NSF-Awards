an understanding of the nature, spatial variability and evolution of the
magmatic source region at subduction zones is one key toward an overall
understanding of crust-mantle and lithosphere- asthenosphere interactions.
Valuable insights into the magmatic source beneath the Central American
subduction zone have been determined through an evaluation of systematic trace
element and isotopic variations along the volcanic front (Feigenson and Carr,
1986; Walker, 1989; Walker and others, 1989; Carr and others 1989). These
variations indicate that contributions to the magmatic source from the subducted
Cocos plate decrease northward from Central Nicaragua. Preliminary geochemical
data suggest that such "slab" contributions may also decrease across the arc.
This project is a trace element and sr, Nd and o isotopic study of behind-the-
front (or BVF basaltic lavas from southeastern Guatemala, which should possess a
minimal geochemical inheritance from the subductd plate or slab. As crustal
differentiation processes are also minimized behind the front, the geochemistry
of BVF lavas will provide the clearest picture of perhaps the most vital element
of the magmatic source, the mantle wedge. Comparison of trace element and
isotopic data for Guatemalan volcanic front (or VF) and BVF basaltic lavas will
permit an evaluation of source involvement in across-arc geochemical variations
particularly and degree of involvement of the subcontinental lithosphere. Study
of trace element and isotopic data on both V or BVF Basalts will therefore
provide a comprehensive understanding of the nature and variations in the
magmatic source for a single subduction zone.
