9727453 Cashman This is a feasibility study to determine if particle size
distribution in cataclastic rocks case be determined by automated scanning
techniques. If successful, large numbers of crushed grains in fault rocks can be
measured, and criteria developed to help isolate mechanisms of faulting and
several important fault parameters.
