Abstract Hofstra University is offering a four-year program in mathematics
content and pedagogy for 50 middle school teachers in the New York City - Long
Island metropolitan area. The project offers a coordinated collection of
mathematics courses over four summers and additional courses and other follow-up
and leadership activities during the intervening academic years. The project is
designed to allow less well-prepared middle school teachers to enter the project
starting in the second academic year. Modeling of effective teaching methods
will be a feature of all courses, as will the integration of the use of
technology. Participants will receive resource materials and computer software
to use in their own classrooms. Hofstra University and participating school
districts will provide cost sharing of approximately 33% of the requested
budget.
