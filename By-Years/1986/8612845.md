Support is provided for a conference which identifies new research needs and
opportunities in the field of the control of mechanical systems. The workshop/s
objectives are to recommend important generic areas of mechanical systems
control research for the next decade, to identify and rank specific research
problems within these generic areas, to identify control funding activity in
various federal agencies and industry, and to demonstrate the relevance and
importance of these areas to the competitiveness of U.S. industry. The workshop
is being organized under the auspices of the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers and will be held in Seattle, WA, on June 16 and 17, 1986.
