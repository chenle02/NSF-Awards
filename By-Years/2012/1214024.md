With the support of an award from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism
Program (CSDM) at the National Science Foundation, Professor Joseph M. O'Connor
of the University of California, San Diego will lead a research program that
will investigate the chemistry of metallacyclobutene and vinylcarbene complexes.
Such complexes have been widely proposed as intermediates or transition state
structures in metal-catalyzed reactions that impact the fields of organic
synthesis, polymer chemistry, pharmaceuticals, material science and theory. The
approach will involve a combination of synthetic, structural, computational and
mechanistic work. Targeted molecules are chosen to maximize the potential for
subsequent reactivity and to reveal mechanistic features of new and existing
chemical transformations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed chemistry will
advance the fundamental knowledge base of organic, inorganic, and organometallic
processes, and contribute to future advances in the environmentally friendly
construction of molecules with useful properties. A key objective of the
proposed studies it the interdisciplinary training of graduate students in the
area of organometallic chemistry which will position them to make important
scientific contributions to both industrial and academic endeavors.
