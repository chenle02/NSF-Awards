In 1993, Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory will
operate the research vessel MAURICE EWING in support of NSF-funded scientific
research. The EWING is a 230' general purpose research vessel with specialized
capability in marine geology and geophysics. Although the vessel operates world
wide, cruises in 1993 will only be in the Atlantic Ocean. Following a lay-up in
early 1993 the EWING will support six projects from the North Atlantic and
ultimately south to the Vema Fracture Zone in the South Atlantic. This vessel is
part of a fleet used by the National Science Foundation in support of
oceanographic research. Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized
equipment and extensive support from the ship's crew members. Increasingly
research projects require equipment which must be permanently installed on the
vessel, thus requiring specialized vessels. These vessels do not operate the
same as general cargo/fishing vessels, therefore NSF supports the operation of a
variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are
operated by universities and research institutes around the country.
