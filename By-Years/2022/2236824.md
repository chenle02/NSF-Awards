The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design a value-driven design debt
management system applicable to modern, distributed, dynamic software systems.
This system will pinpoint and quantify design debt and recommend the most
eï¬€ective debt-reduction strategies. This system will also support risk analyses
for managers and designers, helping them choose a strategy that prevents severe
decay in product performance, and maximize product value, productivity, and
quality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project provide a value-driven, design-debt management system that (1)
discovers and empirically validates design debt in modern distributed and
dynamically-typed software systems based on options theory, Conway's law, and
design principles, leveraging a knowledge graph to capture and manage implicit,
heterogeneous, and distributed entities and relations; (2) discovers the
intrinsic and implicit relations among multiple design anti-patterns and creates
an algorithm to prioritize and recommend the most effective debt-reduction
strategies; and (3) bridges the gap between development and management, enabling
a user to simulate refactoring outcomes and evaluate their economic implications
by combining Monte Carlo simulation and Datar-Mathews option valuations, for
each proposed refactoring strategy. The outcome of these research and
development activities will lead to the first framework specialized for managing
technical debt at the design and architecture level, rooted in financial and
design theory, and applicable to modern distributed and dynamically typed
software systems. This project has the potential to fundamentally change the
management of software, supporting better informed, data driven decisions by
focusing on their economic values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
