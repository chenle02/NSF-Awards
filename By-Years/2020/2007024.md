Software reliability is of critical importance to society, and software
verifiers can improve reliability by guaranteeing the absence of certain bugs.
In particular, typestate verification prevents important classes of bugs by
ensuring programs do not perform certain illegal operation sequences. However,
despite over 30 years of research, typestate verification has not been widely
adopted by developers. This project will develop techniques for lightweight
typestate verification, leveraging new insights on the structure of typestate
properties and common programming patterns. The project is expected to make
typestate verification significantly easier for programmers to adopt, thereby
improving the reliability of large-scale, real-world software
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key barrier to adoption of typestate analysis is
handling of pointer aliasing, which in extant approaches necessitates either an
expensive whole-program analysis or, in modular approaches, heavyweight code
annotations. This project will achieve lightweight and modular typestate
verification by developing algorithms that leverage typestate system
characteristics and common aliasing patterns in modern code bases. For example,
the project identifies accumulation typestate systems, in which an object's
enabled methods only grow over time. An accumulation typestate system can be
verified soundly even in the absence of alias information. The project also
studies restricted aliasing patterns arising from modern coding patterns like
fluent APIs, which can be precisely analyzed with lightweight, modular
techniques. The project will apply these insights both to traditional typestate
systems and to new properties that are inconvenient or impossible to express in
existing typestate formalisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
