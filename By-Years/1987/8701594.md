In this project work will be done on self-conformal mappings of Riemann
surfaces. In recent work the principal investigator has given a representation
for arbitrary Riemann surfaces which provided simple proofs of old results
together with new applications to self-conformal maps of surfaces which have a
fixed point. In cases where the group of maps have several base points good
progress has been made in describing the groups in terms of congruent polygons.
Related to this work is on-going research measuring the number of regular
mappings between a fixed (closed) Riemann surface to surfaces of lower genus.
This finite bound depends only on the genus of the original surface. Similar
questions regarding maps between multiply connected plane domains will be
treated. The extremal metric method and Loewner's variational method of studying
univalent functions have never been studied for connections. A careful analysis
of this question will be undertaken. Aside from general interest, the outcome of
this effort should provide a characterization of Loewner chains associated with
quadratic differentials.
