This research is to investigate deformation associated with oblique plate
convergence, with emphasis on Sumatra, Indonesia, by analysis of seismological
data. A model of earthquake slip vector direction, based on Sumatra
investigations, is to be investigated for other oblique plate subduction zones.
Similarities are seen between the Sumatra and Aleutian subduction zones.
Comparison of the seismic data with GPS investigations, supported by NSF and the
Indonesian government, will provide constraints on the strain field and
resultant earthquake activity. This research is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
