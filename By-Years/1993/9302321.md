9302321 Queiroz This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science award will support the
collaboration of Mardson Queiroz of Brigham Young University and Joao Carvalho
of the Brazilian National Space Research Institute (INPE). The project aims to
investigate the effect of atomization parameters (such as nozzle Sauter-mean
diameter and size spectrum) and frequency of oscillation on spray combustion
instability excitation in Rijke burners. The researchers will prepare INPE's
existing combustor to burn sprays, as well as design and build a smaller
combustor at Brigham Young. With an existing laser system, they will
characterize the spray injectors in terms of droplet mean diameter and size
spectrum; work on a theoretical model for particulate behavior in a pulsating
flow; and perform tests under different combustor lengths (different frequencies
of oscillation), oxidant/fuel ratios, and mass flow rates for spray nozzles with
different mean droplet sizes and size spectra. Both the U.S. and Brazilian
groups will benefit from new data on liquid fuel combustion instability and the
possible use of results for designing high-efficiency liquid waste incinerators.
The project will also prepare the two groups for joint training of graduate
students in the two different environments. ***
