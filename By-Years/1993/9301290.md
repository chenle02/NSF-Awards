The investigators will continue their investigation in crack propagation
phenomena in solids. They will construct analytical solutions to canonical
initial/boundary value problems relevant to the modeling of dynamically
accelerating cracks in viscoelastic composites. Various crack-tip failure zone
constitutive models, both linear and nonlinear, will be investigated. For
nonlinear models, numerical simulations will be performed of the dynamically
growing cracks. The transition from quasi-static to dynamic crack propagation
will be investigated. Cracks from a common mode of failure in structural members
of most engineering structures. The analytical study and numerical simulations
of this project will help the engineers to better understand such failure
mechanisms.
