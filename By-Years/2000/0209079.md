This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Thomas C. Flood, Department of Chemistry, University of
Southern California, in fundamental studies of alkane activation and
functionalization. They are particularly interested in understanding the weak
interactions of alkanes with electrophilic metal centers. These sigma complexed
alkane intermediates may play a key role in many primary reactions involved in
catalysis. One catalytic transformation Flood is concentrating on is the
oxidation of methane to methanol using a rhodium or osmium catalyst. A flexible
triamine ligand such as 1,4,7-triazacyclononane (tacn or Cn) complexes and
stabilizes the catalyst and will not decompose under the reaction conditions
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New catalysts and processes may be designed as a result of
detailed understanding of the way alkanes interact with metal centers,. The
efficient conversion of alkanes to alcohols is a longstanding goal of the
chemical industry. Students will be trained in the synthesis, characterization
and mechanistic studies of these potential catalysts and catalyst
precursors.&lt;br/&gt;
