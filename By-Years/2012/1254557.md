The National Center for Atmospheric Research will undertake a comprehensive
assessment that quantifies and documents the major sources of uncertainties in
hydrologic monitoring and model-prediction products. The goal of this work is to
quantify the effects of different sources of uncertainty on different types of
hydrologic forecasts used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) water
managers for different forecast time horizons and different forecast
initialization times and for the different hydroclimates where USACE operates.
