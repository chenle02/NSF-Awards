This project aims to enhance our understanding of tampering attacks which are
one of the most basic ones in cryptography and computer security. A tampering
adversary may try to modify data at rest or in transit, which could be
devastating to the security of a number of computer systems. The goal of non-
malleable cryptography is to develop the tools and techniques required to secure
computer systems against such attacks. The project's novelties are in
conceptualizing a number of new primitives which can help fight against such
attacks in emerging computer systems. The project's impacts are in providing an
intellectual toolkit to deal with these type of attacks, and in training the
next generation of experts in computer security and
cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scope for non-malleable cryptography is
quite broad: it ranges from designing protocols secure against man-in-the-middle
(MIM) attacks, ensuring guarantees against a tampering attack for data at rest,
and the (relatively newer) area of information theoretic non-malleable
cryptography. The fundamental nature of these questions can be seen by the
connections they have to a number of subareas in cryptography (e.g., secure
multi-party computation, and, concurrent secure computation), and even beyond to
general theoretical computer science (including to randomness extraction,
hardness amplification and coding theory). This project develops new techniques
to radically transform the state of art in all of these directions. The research
explores novel notions such as non-malleable secret sharing, and, correlated
source extractors. The project also tackles long standing open problems in the
area of non-malleable commitments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
