This award supports research that examines the experiences of marginalized
community members who are going through significant life changes. It focuses on
how augmented reality can address social and behavioral factors underlying such
changes. The project designs, builds, and evaluates technologies to address
these challenges by including marginalized community members as partners in each
stage of the project. It is expected to improve society more broadly by
increasing equity and inclusion in the public sphere by advancing (1)
understanding of how technologies represent and distort individual identities;
(2) the impact of these technologies on peopleâ€™s physical, mental, and economic
well-being; and (3) methods for and examples of technology designs that are more
equitable and inclusive. It also provides research training for underrepresented
students. The results of this research will be of interest to policy makers,
educators, and the general public. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research
increases scientific knowledge in Human-Computer Interaction and Social
Computing about how technology can contribute to addressing challenges faced by
people who are traditionally left out of design processes. The interdisciplinary
team of researchers uses participatory design and qualitative research to study,
build, and evaluate technologies to support marginalized communities. This
research is expected to yield the following outcomes: 1) a comprehensive
framework describing current gaps in technological innovation for people
experiencing a significant life change; 2) design recommendations for how
technology can address the needs and challenges of marginalized individuals; 3)
innovative, human-centered augmented reality prototypes and techniques for
supporting subcommunities in society; and 4) guidelines and heuristics for
inclusive augmented reality. This is expected lead to potentially transformative
theoretical and practical insights that extend Human-Computer Interaction
research; it will do so by incorporating what we learn via technology designed
with and for people who are not traditionally part of design
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
