9417755 Allen The ability of local density approximation band theory to predict
properties of matter will be explored. Algorithms will be tested to make global
searches for ground-state crystal structures. Magnetic excitations and
electrical resistivity of metals will be calculated. Vibrational energy
relaxation in carbon-sixty will be modeled. %%% Theory will be used to predict
properties of crystalline matter starting from fundamental concepts.
Specifically, methods for predicting the crystal structure, magnetism and
electrical conductivity of materials will be developed and applied to various
real materials of current interest. These methods, if successful will have wide
applicability.
