As the backbone of the U.S. energy infrastructure, the electric grid transmits
about 4 trillion kilowatthours of electricity to power the nation. The grid is
vulnerable to a variety of weather-related disruptions. The evaluation and
mitigation of disruption-related risks and impacts are often computationally
prohibitive due to the complexity of the power system, uncertainty of weather
conditions, and the combinatorial nature of component failures. This project
will advance the use of analytical models and scalable solution methods to
assist system operators to better evaluate and mitigate disruptions. The PIs, as
well as their graduate students, will collaborate with a U.S. Department of
Energy national laboratory, which will facilitate connections with power systems
operators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will study a new class of data-driven
optimization methodologies to support strategic and operational planning in
power systems management. As part of this research, the PIs will study
probabilistic modeling of electricity grid disruptions based on meteorological
and historical transmission availability data. These data will be incorporated
in distributionally robust optimization (DRO) models to (a) conduct risk
assessment analysis, (b) harden pre-disaster electricity grid, (c) take
corrective actions during disasters, and (d) conduct post-disaster self-healing
and system restoration. The DRO approach will allow the consideration of an
exponential number of disruptions, as well as their probabilities of occurring,
to be inferred from the analysis of the data. In addition, this project will
investigate new DRO solution approaches based on mixed-integer programming.
