The Fresno Unified School District, in partnership with the American Association
for the Advancement of Science, will build on the strengths of existing district
and after-school partnerships and programs to create a model for an Urban
Mathematics and Science Student Service Corp. High-school juniors and seniors,
recruited from underrepresented groups, will receive intensive, ongoing
specialized training to serve as mentors of science, mathematics and technology
for at-risk, middle-school students. Mentoring sessions will engage middle-
grades students in problems drawn from existing curricula that are aligned with
national standards. The goal of the program is to enable both mentors and
mentees to improve and advance in their formal school setting, while maintaining
an informal environment during the after-school mentoring sessions. Career
education will be addressed throughout the program. Strategies are planned for
involving parents in a substantive way, including workshops and events at the
school sites. Middle- and high-school students will present examples of their
work to the community. Evaluation will focus on the academic progress of mentors
as well as mentees.
