Many mechanical design problems are characterized by a large number of variables
that must be specified before the design is completed and by a large number of
constraints that must be satisfied for the design to be feasible. Under these
conditions, mathematical optimization is used; however, optimizing action can
consume large amounts of human and computer resources. The principal
investigator will extend his prior work on the design of mechanical hands
(robotic grippers) by studying the unstated knowledge and rules that are used
during the design process. One goal is to create a computerized tool that will
perform many of the time-consuming tasks normally required of a designer when
optimization techniques are used. Another goal is to generalize the design rules
that are developed to mechanical designs other than grippers.
