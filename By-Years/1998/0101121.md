DMS-0101121&lt;br/&gt;Paul G. Goerss&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides
partial funding for the 2001-2002 Emphasis &lt;br/&gt;Year in Algebraic Topology
at Northwestern University. The &lt;br/&gt;main goal of this special year is to
develop some of the new connections between homotopy theory and other areas of
mathematics, including algebraic geometry, cohomology of groups, algebraic
&lt;br/&gt;K-theory, and A(1) homotopy theory. During the year there will
&lt;br/&gt;be a series of short term visits by experts in these areas and
&lt;br/&gt;a smaller number of longer term visitors. A mini-conference on
algebraic topology and its connections with group cohomology and representation
theory will be held in the Fall of 2001, and an international conference on
Homotopy Theory and its Applications &lt;br/&gt;will be held in March of 2002.
Both will be at Northwestern University. Further information about the Emphasis
Year and the associated conferences, including invited speakers, schedule of
&lt;br/&gt;talks, and housing information, will be available at
