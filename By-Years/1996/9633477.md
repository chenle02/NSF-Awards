9633477 Erikson This Dissertation Improvement project examines the emergence,
growth and activities of a gay/lesbian community church in San Francisco and its
relationship to the larger San Francisco gay/lesbian movement and community.
This case study will advance sociological analysis and understanding of the
interconnections among social movements, religion, and collective identity. The
research employs a variety of qualitative methods, including semi-structured
interviews, participant observation, and archival/document analysis. It seeks to
fill an empirical gap in the sociological literature on gay and lesbian
religious communities and will test the general hypothesis that gay and lesbian
religious participation and organizations, in interaction with the larger gay
and lesbian community, facilitate the creation of new personal and collective
identities, and thereby increase participants' sense of personal and collective
efficacy and empowerment.
