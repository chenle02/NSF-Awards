The 3rd EPSRC/NSF/UK/US Workshop will be held in Washington, D.C. April 15 -16,
2004. The meeting will again be organized on the basis of the Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) signed between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC( to promote
collaboration and co-operating in research activities between the two
countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary object of this 3rd Workshop will be
to promote more co-operation and interaction among the computational sciences
from the United States and the United Kingdom in the area of High Performance
Computing, focusing on materials and biological applications, especially those
requiring access to the&lt;br/&gt;large national computing facilities. Goals for
the meeting are to articulate current and future needs (for the bio and
materials areas) with respect to the following areas at a minimum: current and
future uses of existing HPC machines and data rchives; current and future needs
for grid based applications and next generation HPC hardware and software needs.
The meeting will also discuss areas where the biological and materials sciences
could profitable collaborate and how to facilitate the development of US-UK
collaborative projects and will discuss impediments to such projects (funding,
use of each others facilities, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US organizers are
Ralph Roskies of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and Michael Klein of the
University of Pennsylvania. The UK organizer will be Mark Sansom from Oxford.
Representatives of the NSF will also be invited, as will representatives form
the UK funding agencies.
