The PI proposes to develop techniques, algorithms, and computer code through
which the Conley index will become an effective computational tool. There are a
wide variety of problems motivating this development. The primary issue is that
of being able to compute invariant sets for nonlinear dynamical systems arising
from differential equations or physical experiments. Since in general invariant
sets can undergo dramatic bifurcations under small perturbations, numerical
errors, parameter drift, and noise tend to make direct approximations of
invariant sets numerically unstable.

Being an algebraic topological quantity, the Conley index is extremely stable
with respect to perturbations. At the same time it is fine enough to provide
useful information (e.g. symbolic dynamics) about the structure of the invariant
set. Computing the Conley index involves two steps: (1) approximating the
dynamics, and (2) computing algebraic topological quantities. Both of these
issues are being addressed in this project. Specific applications include joint
work with experimentalists to analyze and control chaotic systems, and the
rigorous numerical analysis of low dimensional attractors of high dimensional
ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations.
