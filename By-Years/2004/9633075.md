Over the past decade, artificial intelligence concepts and techniques have been
productively applied to diverse aspects of manufacturing decision-making,
ranging from product and process development, to production management, to
process diagnosis and quality control. Artificial intelligence techniques will
continue to impact design and manufacturing. In fact, they are an important -
even necessary - part of the dreams shared by concepts such as lean
manufacturing, agile manufacturing, virtual manufacturing, computer-integrated
manufacturing and design. Because artificial intelligence is still a field in
which there is much fundamental research required to bring to fruition exciting
developments that will prove useful in these fields and because this research
might as well be focused on the most productive areas, it is a good time to
bring together experts and practitioners in both artificial intelligence and
manufacturing, to bridge gaps between problem and solution perspectives, build
better mutual understanding of important research challenges and technical
potential in the field, break down cultural barriers that now exist, and foster
future interaction and collaboration between the two communities. Together,
manufacturing and artificial intelligence researchers and practitioners will
work to facilitate the realization of truly intelligent manufacturing systems.
