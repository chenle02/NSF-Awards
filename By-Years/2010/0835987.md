This engineering education research project has the following objectives:
&lt;br/&gt;Determine the value of hands-on ability in the workplace for
mechanical and electrical engineers; Develop a motivation and emotion model for
hands-on ability; Develop a performance model for hands-on ability; Determine
the effectiveness of solitary lab activity as a way to improve hands-on ability.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will make use of several existing
instruments and will develop new ones: &lt;br/&gt;Survey on the importance of
hands-on ability (to be developed for this project); Previous experience
inventory (developed at Ohio U.); Engineering attitudes survey (developed at U.
Pittsburgh); Mechanical aptitude test (commercially available); Easy and hard
hands-on skills tests (to be developed for this project); Short stress-state
questionnaire (already developed by co-PI Helton); Think-aloud problem-solving
and protocol analysis &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the
project is in the new insights it will provide about the role of hands-on
ability in the preparation of engineers. The project will determine the
relevance of hands-on ability for engineering work and which previous
experiences predict hands-on ability. Furthermore, the project will determine
the role that hands-on ability plays in student motivation, confidence, and
attitude. Finally, the project will test the effectiveness of one intervention
strategy?solitary lab activity--for improving hands-on ability. The broader
impacts are eventual curricular reforms (at both the college and pre-college
levels) that lead to students with better hands-on practical skills and that
lead to much higher percentages of women in mechanical and electrical
engineering programs.
