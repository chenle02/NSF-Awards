The principal investigator will study at least three fundamental aspects of
ocean circulation: the theory of thermoclines in the ocean interior, the
structure of mid-ocean jets, irregularities in mid-ocean Ekman pumping related
to the sinking and mixing of water masses into the interior ocean, and the
relation between the fortnightly tidal currents and global electric current
fields.
