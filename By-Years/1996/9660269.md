*** 9660269 Garst This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
determine the feasibility of developing a natural and easy system for input and
editing of mathematical notation on a computer. Computer interfaces have made
great progress in most areas, but communication of mathematical notation to
computers remains unnatural and slow. It is believed that handwritten input of
mathematical notation will be efficient and natural to users. The proposed Phase
I work includes: collection of handwritten mathematical data; research into
algorithms for recognizing and editing mathematical notation; and investigation
into how to effectively integrate these capabilities into a natural user
interface. The market for natural and efficient input of mathematical notation
is potentially very large. This technology would allow the development of a
range of innovative products catering to students and professionals in many
technical, business and educational fields. Examples include: handhold
calculators which accept symbolic problems as easily as numeric ones, word
processors easier to use than pencil and paper for input of mathematical
notation; easy communication of mathematical notation over computer networks;
and others. ***
