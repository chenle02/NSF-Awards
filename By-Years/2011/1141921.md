The Principal Investigator (PI) will investigate the magnetodynamics of the
solar surface and upper convection zone in both quiet and active regions of the
Sun, in order to determine the origin of the 'quiet Sun' magnetic field. He will
evaluate the relative contributions of shallow surface dynamo action and deep
convection zone dynamo action, as well as establish the rate of magnetic flux
emerging from these two processes, by comparing observations with calculations
from dynamo and magnetoconvection simulations within a supergranule-scale
portion of the solar surface. His simulations will include the distribution of
vertical and horizontal magnetic field strengths, the spectrum of vertical and
horizontal magnetic fields, and the variation of supergranule sizes with the
solar cycle. The PI's simulations solve the non-linear, compressible, three-
dimensional equations for conservation of mass, momentum, and internal energy,
as well as the induction equation for the magnetic field. The PI's model uses a
tabular equation-of-state to determine the Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium
pressure, temperature, opacities, and source functions, as a function of log
density and internal energy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is motivated by the
fact that the behavior of magnetic fields near the solar surface is the ultimate
driver of Earth's space weather. The simulation results will be posted on
multiple web sites where they will be widely available to the solar scientific
community and to the general public. The PI will mentor a female collaborator at
Michigan State University in the use and analysis of his simulations and
observations. The simulation results from this effort will also be used to
enhance a museum exhibit demonstrating how scientists use sophisticated models,
now being constructed at the Lansing, Michigan "Impression 5 Science Center,"
which hosts over 100,000 people annually, both individually and in school
groups.
