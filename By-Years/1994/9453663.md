9453663 Cortines The New York Urban System Initiative (NYUSI) has at its core a
vision that seeks to improve the mathematics, science and technology literacy of
all K-12 students in the New York Public Schools. It has forged a strong
partnership between the public schools and the City University of New York
(CUNY). The initiative has two major thrusts: (1) the establishment of 250
Mathematics, Science, and Technology (MST) leadership schools (Cluster Schools)
over the next five years, and the expansion of the Initiative to 250 additional
schools through a paired school strategy; (2) the undertaking of exemplary MST
reforms at the initial 250 school sites through the cooperative efforts of the
Board of Education, CUNY, business and industry, and other stakeholders. In
addition to working with a specific set of cluster schools and paired schools,
certain essential certain citywide elements will reach all schools. These
elements include implementation of a citywide MST curriculum framework;
development of a technology network that links the Board of Education, CUNY, the
public schools and major NYUSI partnership members; and models of exemplary
mathematics and science education projects. The New York USI places strong
emphasis on grass roots MST systemic change through the cluster schools, coupled
with effective core leadership and high standards for all participating schools.
The commitment to site-based ownership reflects the perspective of New York
State's New Compact for Learning and the New York Statewide Systemic Initiative.
