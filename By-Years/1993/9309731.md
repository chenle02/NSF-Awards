This Career Advancement Award (CAA) to Professor Grassian is for the
investigation of fundamental photochemical reactions of molecules adsorbed on
single-crystal metal surfaces. Pulsed laser, time-of-flight (TOF) mass
spectrometry and infrared spectrophotometry will be used to analyze the products
from photodecomposition and photodesorption reactions occuring on the surface of
metal particles. In addition, the TOF instrumentation will allow the measurement
of the angular and translational energy distributions of the proposed
photooxidation and photohydrogenation reactions. The goal is to improve our
understanding of photo-induced chemical reactions which occur on the surface of
metal catalysts. %%% Career Advancement Awards allow female investigators to
initiate research programs in new or innovative areas of investigation.
Professor Grassian will use this CAA to expand her research into the area of
photochemistry on the surface of single-crystal metal particles. The results
will provide increased knowledge concerning photo-induced chemical reactions
observed on catalytic surfaces.
