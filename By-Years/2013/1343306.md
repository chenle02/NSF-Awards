This research effort focuses on the impact that 4G/LTE wireless devices (e.g.
cell towers and smart phones) may have on radar altimeters operating in the
4200-4400 MHz spectral band. Based on the identification of this band by the
government as a potential candidate for commercial cellular use, the spectral
characteristics and potential impact to the operation of these airplane landing
radars has become extremely important to a broad audience. The recent crash of
the Asiana Airlines flight has added to the focus on the operation of these
radars.

To obtain this understanding, a significant spectrum measurement campaign will
be undertaken focused on appropriate radar altimeter systems and on 4G/LTE
systems. The measurements will quantify the effects of 4G/LTE on radar altimeter
performance using actual and/or simulated equipment. These measurement results
will provide a basis for performing the detailed analysis work required to gauge
the level of impact that would be expected under a variety of conditions. This
information will need to be quickly and effectively disseminated to others in
the wireless research community and importantly to various decision-makers in
the telecommunications policy realm.
