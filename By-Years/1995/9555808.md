9555808 Musil For over 20 years, efforts have been made to recruit and retain
more women in science, math, and engineering. It is time to move from climate to
content. "Women and Scientific Literacy: Building Two-Way Streets" will
transform the content and teaching methods of the science curriculum as it is
taught both within traditional science departments and within humanities and
social science courses. Campus teams at institutions with strong women's studies
programs will design faculty development opportunities to teach new courses
based on the scholarship in gender and science. To assist faculty in their work,
there will be a national Advisory Board serving in a consulting capacity; two
national conferences on curriculum and pedagogical development; a newsletter
filled with curricular examples and resources; a moderated e-mail discussion
list; and annotated bibliographies. In order to increase science literacy both
inside science and in non-science fields, this project will encourage the
development of new college courses. New science courses will include more
information about women and science and women s studies courses will discuss
more questions about how women have participated in the scientific enterprise. A
resource book will be published to help others develop new courses. ***
