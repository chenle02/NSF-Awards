This proposal requests support for a workshop on performance analysis and user
requirements for scalable parallel systems. The workshop, the fourth in the
series, will be held in Keystone, Colorado, during April 5-7, 1993. During the
previous 1988,1989, and 1991 workshops, we recognized a pressing need for a
continuing exchange of ideas on performance measurement and analysis among
various groups engaged in high-performance, parallel computing. These groups
include the practicing scientists who use parallel systems and performance
analysis tools, the vendors who design parallel systems, and the academic
researchers in high-performance computing who are exploring software tools and
performance analysis techniques for parallel systems. The proposed workshop is
designed to bring together representatives of academia, industry, national
laboratories, and government agencies to explore these issues. The discussions
will focus primarily on issues of performance measurement, analysis,and
visualization as they relate to these needs.
