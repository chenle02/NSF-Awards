9451886 Vandiver This project is designed to establish an observational
filming/coding laboratory as a component of undergraduate instruction and
research. Students are trained in this area and become involved actively with
research in both classroom and laboratory situations. They also have the option
of incorporating independent research investigations into their undergraduate
studies. Specific courses include Experimental Psychology, Child Psychology, and
Human Growth and Development. The project also allows students enrolled in
Psychology Honors Thesis and Independent Research courses to conduct original
behavioral observation research and analyze their findings more effectively. It
is expected that the project will also add a real-life research methodology into
the curriculum and, combined with a computer laboratory already accessible to
students, will give students a unique and sophisticated background in research
methods in psychology.
