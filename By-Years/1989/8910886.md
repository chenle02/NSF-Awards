The region where the solar wind impacts the earth's magnetic field is called
the bow shock region. There the plasma is composed of ions and electrons that
have velocity distributions dependent in part on the acceleration mechanisms and
wave particle interactions taking place. This study will use in-situ satellite
observations, simulations and numerical and analytical stability analyses to
investigate the properties of these gyrophase-bunched distributions upstream
from the bow shock. A search will also be made for the occurrence of these
distributions elsewhere in the magnetosphere.
