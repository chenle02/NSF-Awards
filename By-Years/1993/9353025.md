9353025 Schneider In this project the Children's Television Workshop will
develop innovative instructional materials based on its Square One TV television
series to supplement mathematics curricula for the fourth, fifth, and sixth
grades. The project will develop twenty instructional modules of single-topic
television programs and videos for use in the classroom as well as teacher
enhancement videotapes and print packages and a teacher-parent video. Each video
will be approximately fifteen minutes in length. The classroom materials will
present sound mathematical content in an interesting, accessible, and meaningful
manner which encourages the use of problem solving processes and promotes
positive toward and enthusiasm for mathematics. Field testing and evaluation of
the materials will be included in the project. Partnerships with PBS and the
NETWORK will contribute to the dissemination of the materials.
