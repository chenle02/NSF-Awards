This project aims to study endpoint maximal inequalities for families of
convolution operators with smooth measures on manifolds under anisotropic
dilation structures, making use of local smoothing estimates in the context of
an advanced Calderon-Zygmund argument. The (properly scaled) convolution in
three dimensions with the arc-length measure on the twisted cubic is the
ultimate model case. In addition, LaVictoire and his collaborators hope to apply
these methods to obtain new estimates for singular averaging operators with
canonical folding relations in nilpotent groups, and also to complete a related
project on nonstandard ergodic averages derived from sparse sets in discrete
virtually nilpotent groups. Finally, LaVictoire plans to develop and test an
innovative approach to supplementary mathematics instruction inspired by the
website Project Euler.

Methods and techniques from the mathematics field of harmonic analysis have
often led to important applications to the natural sciences and engineering.
Harmonic analysis, in its broadest sense, concerns the study of functions by
means of calculus-type integrals that lead to the discovery or recovery of
important information which can be very hard to detect from the function's
technical definition. This project looks at various processes that distort a
given function (the data) in a geometrically patterned way similar e.g., to a
photograph taken with a shaking camera, or to a deep-space image warped by a
massive gravitational field. LaVictoire will investigate the important problem
of when can the original data be satisfactorily reconstructed from the distorted
data; such problems can be studied using recent advances in several areas of
harmonic analysis.
