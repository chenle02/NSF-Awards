This project would continue the development of a Bayesian approach to robot
vision. Its goal is the recognition, and position estimation, of 3-D indoor and
outdoor objects. The method will use as input the images taken by two or more
cameras in different positions, or on range data, or on other sensed data.
Textured-image analysis is also considered, both as a separate topic, and as it
relates to the preceding. The approach has three components: 1. Modeling of
objects to the necessary detail, based on a combination of geometric, algebraic,
and probabilistic models. 2. Development, for each problem, of the joint
likelihood of the measured data, and the a priori unknown model parameters,
followed by estimation or recognition using new extensions of classical
statistical concepts applied to this joint probability function. This permits
optimal estimation of a priori unknown quantities and optimal recognition of
objects of interest. 3. Development of new algorithms designed to run on
parallel processors, motivated by the need to deal with the large number of
parameters involved in these methods. The significance of the work is: 1. It
provides a unified framework for computer vision and for handling measured data,
a priori model information, and uncertainty. 2. It provides a very good
performance functional so that robot vision can be treated as a maximization
problem. 3. It permits the derivation of performance bounds (e.g., on covariance
matrices for parameter estimation errors), which help in understanding the
performance limitations of the new system. More importantly, it facilitates the
optimization of intermediate stages. 4. It provides a new set of interesting,
potentially powerful algorithms and operators to be studied for parallel
processing in computer vision.
