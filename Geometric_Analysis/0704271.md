This project in random matrix theory stems from Dyson diffusion for the
eigenvalues of a random matrix ,which forces the eigenvalues to evolve according
to non-intersecting Brownian motion.Upon letting the size of the random matrices
grow arbitrarily large, the eigenvalues turn into a "Markov cloud " of infinite
non-intersecting particles,distributed according to a certain equilibrium
measure. For each given time,its support will be concentrated on intervals,
whose number may vary with time..Therefore, when time evolves, intervals may
merge, may disappear and be created, leading to a region R in space- time,whose
boundary will be regular,except for various singularities. Near the boundary
points of R the non-intersecting Brownian motions will, in the limit, tend to a
Markov cloud performing phase transitions when approaching a singularity; these
infinte dimensional diffusion are thus critical phenomena and should exhibit
universal properties.We wish to derive (nonlinear) PDE's for the transition
probabilities and various scaling limits which will yield boundary conditions,
appropriatedly understood ,for these Painleve type PDE"s.This will also be a
tool to pass from one critical phenomena to another.Along the same vein, another
goal of the project is to connect conformal maps, dispersionless 2D-Toda and the
Stochastic Lowner equation, through using a stochastically changing domain, via
Brownian motion.

Random matrix theory has a diverse interface with numerous mathematical and
physical disciplines, on the one hand, Fredholm determinants ,integrable
mechanics and Painleve equations and on the one hand conformal field theory and
statistical mechanics, and in particular. critical phenomena and
universality.The basic motivation is to tie these topics together using a
Painleve type theory of partial differential equations to explain how various
critical phenomena merge into each other and emerge out of each other, perphaps
creating a sort of familty-tree for various critical phenomena.The tools of the
various fields alluded to will come into play in both describing the phenomena
and deriving equations for the probabilistic prediction of how the phenomena
evolves.
