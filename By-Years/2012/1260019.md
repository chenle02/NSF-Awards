The Mathematics Department at the University of Texas Arlington is supporting 30
students in two distinct 15-student cohorts, during their sophomore through
senior years as they pursue bachelor's degrees in mathematics. Scholars are
receiving financial support commensurate with their demonstrated financial need,
not exceeding $10,000 per year, and averaging about $5,800 per year. The
majority of scholars began their undergraduate education at a nearby 2-year
institution and come from a diverse set of backgrounds. The S-STEM scholar
program is a comprehensive student support component that builds on an existing
mathematics learning community, anchored by the local student chapter of the
Mathematical Association of America. S-STEM scholars are engaged with degree
planning, networking, mentoring, engagement with the student discipline society,
internships/research, conferences, and career workshops in a structured program
that is supportive for the students' current achievement level. Extensive
faculty mentoring is being enabled by weekly lunch-time meetings that includes
students and faculty as part of a dynamic learning community that enables
professional development and minimizes demand on participants' time. The S-STEM
project's success is leading to mathematics graduates entering the workforce or
continuing on to additional higher education. Findings and best practices are
being shared with other units on campus, with the institutions in the University
of Texas System LS-AMP program, with colleges and universities in the Math
Alliance, and through conference proceedings.
