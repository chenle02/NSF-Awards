Buonsanto This project will use Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar data and
Fabry-Perot interferometer data to study ion-neutral coupling and thermospheric
dynamics. A primary goal is to perform a statistical study to derive an improved
value for the O+, O collision frequency. This parameter is important in the
application of radar techniques for measuring thermospheric neutral winds.
Recent work at Millstone Hill has shown that horizontal gradients in the ion
velocity field and vertical neutral winds are large enough to have significant
effects on the winds derived from ion velocity measurements, even under quiet
geomagnetic conditions. This study will quantify the effects of both horizontal
ion velocity gradients and vertical neutral winds on both the derived collision
frequency and the wind climatology at Millstone Hill. The new results will be
used to assess the accuracy of earlier work carried out using the servo model
method, including the tidal decomposition of winds over a full solar cycle.
