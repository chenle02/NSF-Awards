The main objective of this project is to teach students, via intensive
laboratory experiences, the principles and procedures of modern scientific
psychology. A microcomputer-controlled general experimental psychology
laboratory, including operant conditioning stations and biofeedback monitors, is
being established to serve courses in experimental psychology, learning and
conditioning, sensation and perception, social psychology, independent study,
and a special topics course. In the new laboratories, students perform
representative behavioral experiments using either animals or student volunteers
as subjects. Microcomputers assist students in carrying out experimental
procedures, collecting data, and performing statistical analyses. These "hands-
on" laboratory experiences are teaching the principles and methodologies of
scientific psychology more effectively than lecture-oriented pedagogies alone
were able to do prior to the initiation of this project.
