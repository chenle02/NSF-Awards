9712197 Damodaran Protein adsorption and film formation at various interfaces
play important roles in many biological and technological processes. Despite the
enormous importance of this field, fundamental understanding of these processes,
especially adsorption at the lipid-water interface, is still elusive. Thus, the
main objectives of this project are: (1) to develop experimental approaches to
study the kinetics and thermodynamics of the air-water interface; (2) to
elucidate the relationship between the molecular flexibility and the equation of
state of proteins at air-water and oil-water interfaces; (3) to elucidate the
molecular factors affecting competitive adsorption of proteins from binary and
ternary protein solutions to the oil-water interface; and (4) to investigate the
thermodynamic compatibility and two dimensional phase separation behavior of
proteins in a binary protein film at air-water and oil-water interfaces. The
outcome from this project is to generate the basic information needed to
understand various biological, chemical, and technological processes which
involve protein/enzyme adsorption at air-liquid and liquid-liquid interfaces.
