Professor Teukolsky's group is investigating gravitational collapse and the
formation of black holes by solving Einstein's equations for gravitation on a
supercomputer. They will determine how much gravitational radiation is emitted
during such events. They are also studying how neutron stars can explode while
under the influence of another star in a binary system and are investigating the
properties of rapidly rotating stars. Finally, they are trying to understand the
observations of the eclipsing pulsar with a theoretical model.
