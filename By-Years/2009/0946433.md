The University of South Florida is hosting a conference on Research on the
Enacted K-12 Mathematics Curriculum. The purpose of the conference is to
explicate the theory on mathematics curriculum enactment, defining key
constructs and explaining how they are expected to interact, and why, in order
to facilitate the systematic accumulation of knowledge about mathematics
curriculum enactment that can guide policy and practice. The conference agenda
builds on work of the Center for the Study of Mathematics Curriculum (CSMC) and
work by NCTM to develop a research agenda for mathematics education. The
conference proceedings will include the conceptual model developed during the
conference, the priority research questions that were identified, and the
instrument development agenda for addressing those questions.
