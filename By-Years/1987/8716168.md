The project will attempt to analyze the proteins in the calcite of foraminifera
in order to identify proteins which are species specific. If the initial results
are confirmed by results of this research, the proteins may act as
"fingerprints" of individual species. If so, the evolution of true species may
be traced in the fossil record rather than using morphologically- defined
species which actually may not be different species. Therefore the fossil
lineage of individual species may be traced in the geologic record.
