As the size of a material system decreases, the ratio of the amount of its
interfacial and bulk atoms increases. Consequently, interfacial properties can
become dominant in small systems that often possess extraordinary physical
powers. As is well documented, for instance, nanoscale interfacial systems with
highly ordered assemblies of quantum dots, wires, or rings exhibit remarkable
optoelectronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties that have a wide range of
applications. Generally invalid for nanoscale interfaces, fundamental theories
for interfaces of bulk materials must be examined and reworked. This project
develops computational techniques and mathematical theories for a large class of
complex interfaces governed by the mechanical properties of underlying
heterogeneous systems at nanoscale, aiming at the understanding of the crucial
role of such interfaces in material behavior. It combines the novel finite-
element methodology and the powerful level-set technique into a new generation
multiscale simulation program, and applies directly to a host of nanoscale
material processes. Such processes include microstructural evolution in metals
and alloys, aggregation of strained islands in epitaxial thin films, and general
morphological instability in stressed solids. Powered by rigorous mathematical
theories, a set of well tested simulation technologies that are adapted to
academic and industrial needs should result from this research. Meanwhile,
connections between mathematics and nanoscience should be established, and
students will be trained in this interdisciplinary research.
