Professor Paul M. Lahti, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Massachusetts-Amherst is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program for his work that aims to discover new ways to assemble molecules and
ions to make materials with controlled magnetic properties. Magnetic materials
are worth billions in the marketplace, both for existing technologies such as
information storage and electronics shielding, and for developing technologies
such as molecular electronics and nano-electronics. Understanding how to make
designed magnetic properties as a function of structure is an overarching goal
of this work. Stable organic radicals will be designed to assemble the radical
spins into crystal arrays and polymer chains. In many cases, the radicals will
be designed to link with metal ions that have unpaired spin, to make hybrid
materials that combine some of the best properties of organic systems (synthetic
variability, crystalline design capabilities) with those of inorganic systems
(strong magnetic moments, possibilities to combine magnetic and ionic conducting
behaviors). The most important intellectual and scientific merits of the project
are twofold: (1) discovery of guidelines that related molecular structure and
multi-molecular assemblies to electronic properties, particularly magnetism; and
(2) in the best case, discovery of new materials with unusual and novel magneto-
electronic properties.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the
research activities of Professor Paul M. Lahti at the University of
Massachusetts-Amherst where the body of crystal information gathered as part of
this project will be placed into publications and crystallographic databases,
making it available to any of the wide variety of research areas that have need
to understand how molecules can be assembled in the solid state in a controlled
manner. The understanding of how electrons interact in complicated assemblies of
molecules, in polymers, and in crystalline solids will be of general use to
anyone interested in molecular structure and its relationship to electronic
behavior at the molecular level, as well as in materials science for
technological applications. Graduate students in this project will benefit from
international exchange of expertise and the development of direct ties with
scientists from Brazil and Spain, in addition to gaining an unusual combination
of skills in molecular synthesis and electronic physics. Such training is
extremely important in the modern technoscientific marketplace, where projects
have short timelines and workers need to be flexible, adaptable, and multi-
talented.
