The Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM) is collaborating with the Museum of
Science in Boston (MoS), the North Carolina Museum of Life and Science in Durham
(NCMLS), Explora in Albuquerque, the Center for Research in Mathematics and
Science Education at San Diego State University (CRMSE), and TERC in Cambridge,
MA to develop, create and evaluate "MathCore for Museums," long-term math
environments that children can interact with over multiple visits and over
several years. The project is prototyping and producing 12 open-source,
validated interactive exhibits about proportion: fractions, ratios, similarity,
scaling, and percentages, basic concepts for understanding Algebra. The eight
best exhibits will be replicated for each MathCore museum and the exhibits will
be supported by a limited-access website designed to support and extend repeated
use of exhibits and further exploration of ratio and proportion. Selinda
Research Associates will conduct a longitudinal evaluation of the project. CRSME
will conduct a research study of selected exhibit prototypes to investigate when
children start to work on proving relations between similarity and proportion in
informal settings, the relationship between children's artwork and mathematical
insight, and the roles of bodily activity in learning to see relations in
similarity and proportion. Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed
publications, at professional meetings, at the Association of Science and
Technology Center's RAP Sessions at the NCMLS, and through the project's
website.
