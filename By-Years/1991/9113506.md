In 1975, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry Began the
planning for the first of a series of conferences dedicated to discussion and
study of urgent problems facing the world on which chemistry has a direct
bearing. The conferences have come to be known as the "CHEMRAWN" conferences,
the acronym for CHEMical Research Applied to World Needs. This grant provides
partial support of the seventh conference in the series, titled "World
Conference on the Chemistry of the Atmosphere: Its Impact on Global Change". It
is dedicated to examining global threats to the environment and discussing the
role chemistry may play in alleviating or eradicating such threats. The
conference will be co-sponsored by the International Union of Pure and Applied
Chemistry and the American Chemical Society. CHEMRAWN VII will be held in
Baltimore, Maryland in December of 1991.
