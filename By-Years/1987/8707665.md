The diaphragm is the most important respiratory muscle. The central tendon
deforms in accordance with the contraction and relaxation of diaphragmatic
muscles. This proposal will study the contractile forces using the central
tendon as a strain gauge. Their hypothesis is that with properly characterized
strain histories and measured mechanical properties of the central tendon, they
will be able to form a model of the respiratory cycle. A working model is
necessary to adapt anesthesia and facilitated breathing instrumentation to the
respiratory system.
