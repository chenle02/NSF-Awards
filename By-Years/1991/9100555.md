This award provides funds to the Department of Environmental, Population and
Organismic Biology at the University of Colorado at Bolder to continue their
Research Experience for Undergraduates SITE in ecology, behavior and evolution.
The program provides undergraduates contemplating a career in the biological
sciences with 1) an introduction to current research areas of soil ecology,
plant and insect ecology and evolution, plant physiology and behavioral ecology;
2) the opportunity to conduct original research in a supportive, interactive
environment; 3) instruction in the planning, execution, and interpretation of
research in the areas of ecology, evolution and behavior. All participating
students will attend a course that will introduce them to the fields of ecology,
evolution and behavior, aid in planning and executing an original research
project, give them an introduction to statistical analysis, and provide
information on applying to graduate school. They will also present the results
of their research in a short seminar at the end of the summer. Students will
work with faculty members on their projects, and will also be able to interact
with other students and post-docs in their laboratories.
