The objective of this proposed study is to develop a new family of ligand-
triggered self-splicing and self-cleaving proteins with a wide variety of
potential applications. In practice, the switch proteins will be fused to
various target proteins at the DNA level to generate functionally inactive
precursors. The binding of a small molecule ligand by the engineered switch
protein will trigger the switch to splice or cleave as desired for a particular
application, typically resulting in the activation of the fused target protein.
The development of these protein switches will yield insights into the design
and behavior of artificial multifunctional proteins, particularly in the area of
allosteric domain fusions, and will include aspects of rational as well as
evolution-based approaches. Preliminary results imply immediate uses for these
protein switches in biosensing and drug discovery, and new technologies in
bioseparations are forthcoming. Long term applications include drug delivery,
metabolic engineering and even biomolecular computation. The proposed
pedagogical materials seek to provide students with information and skills to
allow them to make greater contributions at the interface between engineering
and biology, and include a high school intern program, the use of learning style
evaluations in an introductory engineering course and a seminar series in
applied biotechnology.
