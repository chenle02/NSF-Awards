Global Positioning System (GPS) technology is making a profound impact on the
understanding of diverse scientific problems, including plate kinematics, the
earthquake cycle, crustal dynamics, volcanic processes, ice dynamics and
associated sea level change, and atmospheric sensing. To make effective use of
this technology the Earth science community needs accurate and efficient
software to process GPS data and the knowledge to use this software effectively.
This grant supports the infrastructure necessary to make the GAMIT/GLOBK
processing software available to NSF-supported investigators and their
international collaborators for the next two years. Supported tasks include 1)
improving the models and user interfaces for automatic processing of GPS data
for high-precision applications, 2) improving the documentation of the software,
3) providing interactive, Web-based time series from global analyses that can be
used to assess an investigator's own analysis, 4) training and assisting both
new and experienced analysts in state-of-the-art processing strategies. ***
