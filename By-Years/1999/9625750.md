9625750 Singh The proposed research is aimed at developing a fundamental
knowledge base concerning crack propagation and fracture behaviors of ceramic
fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites. This objective will be accomplished
by performing in situ crack propagation measurements of stresses in fibers
bridging the crack at the process zone, using Laser Raman Spectroscopy, and
relating these stress measurements to local in situ crack opening displacements
and crack profiles. The proposal provides a well thought out series of
experiments which can reveal key information concerning the stress field and
crack aperture shape and the effect of varied interfacial traction (coatings).
This study should enhance modeling efforts to determine fundamental science and
behavior predictions of importance in ceramic fiber- reinforced ceramic matrix
composites. ***
