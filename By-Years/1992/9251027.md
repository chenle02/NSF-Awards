Cells and Development, a new course, introduces students to a problem-solving
approach while emphasizing molecular techniques for analysis of growth,
differentiation, and morphogenesis. Student laboratories include DNA analysis,
recombinant DNA techniques, protein analysis techniques, and cell and tissue
culture methods; all topics related to lecture material. Many of the laboratory
exercises challenge students with a problem and then require design of an
experimental strategy to answer the questions developed. Equipment for this
laboratory includes a spectrophotometer, shaking water bath, tabletop
centrifuge, microcentrifuge, laminar flow hood, inverted microscope, tissue
culture incubator, temperature cycler, and 10 electrophoresis systems (1 for
each student pair). The unique features of this course are the extensive class
discussions of experimental design and of student results.
