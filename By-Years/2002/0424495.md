The region between the Fifteen Twenty and Marathon fracture zones in the
equatorial Atlantic has a complex tectonic history associated with movement of
the North American-South American-African triple junction and the opening of the
Atlantic Ocean. Hydrophone-recorded seismicity shows a unique off-axis band of
seismicity within this region between 13 and 14.5 degrees north. This project
will fill in the gaps in multibeam bathymetric data for the area. Magnetic and
gravity data will also be collected. This is a reconnaissance effort and the
ultimate goals are to understand the tectonic history of the region and to
establish whether the triple junction is located between the Fifteen Twenty and
the Marathon fracture zones.&lt;br/&gt;
