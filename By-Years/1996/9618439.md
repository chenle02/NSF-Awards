Basri, Gibor AST 96-18439 Dr. Basri will carry out an observational study of
the properties of brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars. His study is timely and
important in light of the recent discoveries of very low mass companions to
other stars. His research plan has 3 primary objectives : 1) to search for brown
dwarfs in the Pleiades star cluster and to use them to estimate the brown dwarf
mass fraction and to establish the "lithium age" of the cluster in conjunction
with stellar models, 2) to explore the relation between rotational velocity and
activity in late M stars, and 3) to improve model atmospheres for very cool
main-sequence stars through the use of atmospheric diagnostics provided by high-
resolution spectroscopy. The proposed array of topics take advantage of the
observational facilities at Keck and at Lick, to which the PI has access. ***
