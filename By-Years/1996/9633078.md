HRD-9633078 McIntyre The 1997 NCBPS meeting is scheduled to b held February of
1997 with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as the tentative host
institution. The 1996 Conference will be the tenth consecutive meeting of NCBPS.
The objective of the NCBPS meeting is to assist and encourage Black students who
have shown interest and ability in physics to enter and complete Ph.D. programs,
and to initiate research, teaching, or technical careers commensurate with their
educational achievement in physics. NCBPS originated with a group of Black
graduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The conferences
have organized and implemented by students with faculty and staff assistance at
the various host institutions throughout the country. Information is presented
through the following mechanisms (1) lectures by distinguished scientists and
engineers, (2) technical presentations by Black graduate and undergraduate
students, (3) workshops on the graduate admission process, (4) seminars on
financial support to students for science education at the university level, (5)
forums on successfully completing a graduate programs in physics, and (6) career
opportunities at all degree levels. The primary audience for the Conference
consists of undergraduate students who are majoring in physics and/or who have
expressed a sincere interest in physics. A principal goal of the Conference is
to permit these students, ho are in the process of making career decisions, the
opportunity to discuss with graduate students and scientists their concerns
regarding a scientific career and to seek recommendations and advice about
educational paths.
