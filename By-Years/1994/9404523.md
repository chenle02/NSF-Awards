9404523 Weinstein The research involves several topics in general relativity
theory relating to rotating black holes in equilibrium. Certain problems can be
seen in the setting of variational principles when the defining equations give
rise to energy minimizing maps to symmetric spaces of non-compact type. Other
problems relate to configurations of massive bodies in a perfect fluid. The
research has applications to cosmology and relativistic fluid mechanics. ***
