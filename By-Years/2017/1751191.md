This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award will contribute to
the advancement of national prosperity and increased national security by
studying efficient operations of complex wireless sensor networks. Wireless
sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly used to collect and process data over
space and time in a variety of domains. Wireless sensor networks appear in
ecosystems and geological phenomena, as well in monitoring adversarial use of
biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons. In all of these applications, the WSN
must provide effective coverage over an extended period of time even as
individual sensors fail and require maintenance. Acquiring and/or installing
sensors may be costly, raising the question of how to ensure satisfactory
performance of the WSN indefinitely. This award supports research to establish
methodology required for the design and maintenance of the WSN over time as it
evolves to meet changing conditions. The award will additionally support the
creation of a new interdisciplinary honors curriculum within the PI's home
institution. This program will prepare engineering students to tackle multi-
disciplinary problems by broadening their awareness of emerging solutions to
modern societal problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute to
the complex problem of designing, maintaining, and adapting ad hoc WSNs over
time. This problem entails numerous sources of computational complexity stemming
from modeling randomly evolving networks and decisions made over time.
Overcoming these challenges will require advancing mathematical and
computational methods from network optimization, complex system reliability,
Monte Carlo simulation, stochastic processes, and stochastic optimization. The
research will initially develop stochastic network maintenance models and
computationally tractable reliability estimation procedures for the purpose of
describing WSN reliability under a given maintenance policy. Optimization
methodology will be derived to incorporate emerging reliability
representation/estimation techniques in order to determine efficient fixed-
schedule and condition-based maintenance policies that are efficient with
respect to cost and reliability criteria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
