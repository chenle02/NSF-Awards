The objectives of this proposal involve research and education goals that will
allow the integration of magneto-optical garnet in non-reciprocal devices to
enable source-integrated photonic and optoelectronic integrated circuits
(PICs/OEICs). Garnet is the obvious material for such devices, due to its
figure-of-merit (rotation/loss) which is several orders of magnitude higher than
any other magneto-optcical material, but the integration of garnet with
semiconductor platforms has long been thought impossible.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Using a recently developed process,
garnet devices will be realized here on Si, InP and GaAs for use in the near
infrared (1.3 and 1.55um) and infrared (~2um) wavelengths. The research will
focus on doped garnet waveguide isolators, garnet photonic crystal (PC)
circulators, semiconductor-core isolators (with garnet claddings for evanescent
coupling), and quasi-phase matched rotators. These devices will be the first of
their kind to be monolithically integrated, and they therefore promise to
transform the field of photonics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. This
project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching,
training, and learning from graduate student training through K-12 outreach,
including a focus on under-represented groups. In addition, this project truly
enables the "missing link" in photonics such that the first generation light
sources will be integrated with photonic integrated circuits and opto-electronic
integrated circuits near the completion of this project.
