AST-9731200 Abstract Funds from this grant will be used to develop the
technology for arrays of voltage-biased superconducting transition-edge
bolometers as direct detectors for ground-based astrophysics at far infrared and
millimeter wavelengths. In this new type of bolometer, strong negative
electrothermal feedback maintains the sensor temperature nearly constant. This
leads to several advantages over conventional bolometers which use doped
semiconducting thermistors.
