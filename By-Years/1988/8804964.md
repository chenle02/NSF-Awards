This proposal requests funds for a scanning electron microscope and other lab
equipment needed for electron microscopy. The center will benefit researchers
from the Department of Biology and Chemistry and the CUNY Medical School who are
engaged in research on the functions of cell surfaces. These instruments will
also contribute significantly to training undergraduate and graduate students,
including minority students, who are pursuing research careers in biomedical
science.
