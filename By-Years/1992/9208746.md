This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of
Professor Maurice M. Kreevoy at the University of Minnesota. An experimental and
theoretical study of hydride donation to NAD+ and abstraction from NADH will be
studied. A semi-empirical potential energy surface for the transfer of the
hydrogen isotope will be fit to the experimental data and the ability of this
surface to predict the reactivity in deuteride transfer will be examined. The
computations will use the POLYRATE program to predict the effect of ion pairing
and the explicit inclusion of solvent on rate constants and isotope effects. %%%
An important pathway for the transfer of electrons to and from organic molecules
involves the transfer of a hydride ion, whichis a hydrogen atom with an
additional electron. In effect, this type of electron transfer involves the
simultaneous transfer of an electron and a hydrogen atom. New methodology will
be developed for the study of hydride abstraction from and addition to
biologically iomportant molecules. This work will fundametally strengthen our
knowledge of reactions of polyatomic substances in solution, and particulary the
role of the solvent in such reactions.
