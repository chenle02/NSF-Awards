In this project, the PI will use the case of field studies of Karst environments
to explore international scientific collaborations and network building. The
study will highlight the importance of the specific historical, social, and
spatial dynamics of different scientific disciplines in order to increase the
likelihood of success of future scientific collaborations. The working
hypothesis is that the frequency of attempted and realized collaborations will
vary depending on 1) political events in the participating countries and 2)
personal networks established during international conferences. Data will be
coded to assess how participants of attempted and realized collaborations
defined exploration and research objectives. These results will be tested for
correlations with another scale that gauges the degree of failure or success of
expeditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance discovery and
understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning. One potential
outcome is the establishment of a Karst studies program at West Virginia
University. A bi-lingual website is planned for dissemination of results.
