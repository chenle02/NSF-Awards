This project is concerned with the study of a unique basis for the complex
valued class functions defined on the Carter classes of a finite solvable group
that behave the same way as the irreducible Brauer characters do in a p-solvable
group. The principal investigator will address a similar question for System
Normalizers. This research is in the general area of the representation theory
of finite groups. One of the main applications of group representation theory.
