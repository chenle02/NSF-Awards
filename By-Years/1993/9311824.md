9311824 Alexander The objective of this research are to: (1) develop a procedure
for determining optimum process settings for this and other related fill
problems; (2) to design and implement an effective automatic process regulation
and monitoring scheme for effectively minimizing the variation in this filling
process; (3) to recommend basic filling system design changes that will improve
the overall filling operation; and (4) to investigate the effect of measurement
error on automatically controlled processes. The research will address two
important problem areas with regard to the pouch filling process. The first
involves finding the optimal values for the process mean fill setting and the
upper specification limit such that overall profit is maximized. The second
involves the identification, control, and possible elimination of the sources of
variation within the filling process. Since these problems exist in a variety of
industries, the success of the research should have wide applications.
