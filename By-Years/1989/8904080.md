This award provides funds required to upgrade the instrumentation and to
support in part the operation of beamline X17C of the National Synchrotron Light
Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The beamline is a source of highly
brilliant radiation resulting from the accelerating action of a superconducting
magnetic wiggler on charged particles and provides access to the radiation for
earth science experiments. The beamline is scheduled for operation by June 1989
and will make available, for the first time, a dedicated source of high-
brilliance X-rays for diamond-anvil cell research in the earth sciences. The
ultra-high pressures needed in order to reproduce conditions in planetary
interiors can be generated in diamond- anvil cells, but the volume of matter
involved is extremely small (on the order of cubic microns). In order to
characterize the material subjected to these intense conditions it is necessary
to use the finely collimated and intense radiation available only at synchrotron
facilities. The beamline will serve as a versatile instrument for the
advancement of state-of-the-art technology for X-ray diffraction with the
diamond-anvil cell. It will significantly extend both the pressure and the
temperature ranges of ultra high-pressure studies (above 2 million atmospheres
and 5000K) aimed at explaining the properties of deep planetary interiors.
