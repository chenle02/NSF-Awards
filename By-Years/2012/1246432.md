The tremendous progress of high throughput technologies including DNA sequencing
and proteomics is rapidly advancing the understanding of beneficial microbe-host
interactions. Most animals and plants depend upon associations with coevolved
communities of microorganisms that play critical roles in physiological balance
and maintaining homeostasis. Recognition of these phenomena is revolutionizing
how biologists view the function of the normal microbiota with respect to their
association with hosts. The Beneficial Microbes Conference is unique in cutting
across disciplines by bringing together ecologists, microbiologists, molecular
biologists and computational biologists that have the common goal to understand
the mechanisms and benefits of microbial interactions with a variety of hosts,
from plants to humans. The conference will be held in San Antonio, Texas as a
convenient central location in the United States. The aim is to provide a forum
for increasing cross-disciplinary interactions and thus to develop new insights
and approaches to the study of beneficial host-microbe interactions. This field
is currently very popular as demonstrated by past scientist attendance to this
conference series, including graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. To
assure a broad representation, the organizational committee has well balanced
demographic representation. One third of the invited speakers are junior (pre-
tenure), and 6 of 19 invited speakers are women. Of the 36 contributed oral
presentations, 17 (47%) will be selected from submitted abstracts, ensuring
ample high-visibility for students and postdocs with innovative ideas. As in the
previous meetings, the selection process for these student and postdoc
presentations will focus on junior researchers, women and minorities. Students
at underrepresented minority institutions will also be targets for support. The
proposal budget includes 5 travel awards for minority graduate students, and the
awardees will be selected based on the quality of their abstracts. Only poster
presenters who are U.S. citizens will receive travel support.
