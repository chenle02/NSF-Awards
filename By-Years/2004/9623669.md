9623669 Del Castillo This research aims to develop effective multivariate
quality control (QC) methods for advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes.
Specifically of concern is the development and implementation of a novel
multiple-input-multiple-output quality controller for supervisory control of
semiconductor manufacturing processes based on the idea of optimizing adaptive
control. In many of these processes, the quality characteristics of a batch or
run of silicon wafers are regulated with automatic controllers of the
proportional-integral-derivative (PID) type, that regulates variables such as
pressures, flows, temperatures, etc. The proposed optimizing adaptive quality
controller (OAQC) provides a recipe of PID set points at each run by the on-line
estimation and optimization of a nonlinear transfer function model. The OAQC
will be developed and tested in close collaboration with Sematech's Statistical
Methods and Advanced Process Control Group. The educational component of this
project is integrated with the proposed research and reflects the PI's
philosophy on teaching modern QC courses an interdisciplinary field on the
intersection between applied statistics and control theory. The research and
integrated educational plan is well thought out and the industrial collaboration
excellent. The PI already has a strong track record and is felt to be extremely
competent. The area of research, QC, is of particular importance to the
semiconductor manufacturing industry.
