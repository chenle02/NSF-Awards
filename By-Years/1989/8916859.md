The work involves a new approach for the determination of absolute magnetic
paleointensity. Principally, the method deviates from that of the classical
Thellier approach in that not one, but several sub-samples are utilized per
determination. Each specimen is heated only twice to an individually-assigned
temperature. Thus, the primary advantage of the method over the Thellier is that
progressive physicochemical alteration due to serial heatings is held to a
minimum. Indeed, an initial study utilizing the new method suggests that it can
furnish reliable results when the Thellier approach may fail. As has been the
case with past research in Undergraduate Institution (RUI) grants, the project
will be assisted by several undergraduate physics majors. Past experience has
shown that the majority of students which have assisted in paleomagnetic
projects at Cal Poly successfully continue their academic careers at graduate
institutions in geophysics or physics.
