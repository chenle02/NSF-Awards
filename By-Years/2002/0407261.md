This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to Clarkson
University supports Professors. Don H. Rasmussen and Ian Suni, Department of
Chemical Engineering and Professor Brenton D. Faber, Department of Technical
Communications for their work to develop hypermedia software, including text,
graphics, animations, etc., for modular use in the area of Introduction to
Nanomaterials Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three modules will
be created covering materials aspects of nanoparticles and strength of
nanomaterials, as well as societal impacts of nanotechnology. These modules will
be employed for introducing nanotechnology concepts into an Introduction to
Materials Science and Engineering course (ES 260) which will be taught in the
spring and fall predominantly to sophomore engineering students. These
hypermedia software modules will also be accessible to other educators and
researchers nationally and internationally via Internet dissemination, and their
existence will be promoted through participation in professional society
meetings and through indexing in science and engineering
databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal for this award was received in
response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education (NSEE) announcement,
NSF 03-444, category NUE and was jointly funded by the Division of Civil and
Mechanical Systems (CMS) and the Division of Engineering Education and Centers
(EEC) in the Directorate for Engineering (BIO).
