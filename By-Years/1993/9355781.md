Weiss In 1990, the National Science Foundation (NSF) embarked on a new major
initiative, the Statewide Systemic Initiative (SSI), to improve science and
mathematics education K 12. The approach of using a relatively small amount of
federal dollars as leverage to move the states toward developing and
implementing coordinated reform efforts has received national attention. There
is a great deal of interest in the progress of the SSI program among policy
experts, education reformers, and the US Department of Education. The project is
a conference for a small group of policy experts, Statewide Systemic Initiatives
(SSI) Principal Investigators, NSF program officers, and contractors to reflect,
analyze, and synthesize from the collective experience and wisdom of all who are
intimately involved in the SSI. At the end of the conference, a monograph will
be produced on what has been learned about statewide systemic change and the
implications of that knowledge for the role of the federal, state, and local
governments, among others, in supporting systemic change. The conference will be
held at the Wingspread Conference Center in Racine, Wisconsin. The proposers,
Dr. Iris Weiss, Horizon Research, Inc., Dr. Mark St. John of Inverness Research
Associates, and Dr. Joy Frechtling of Westat, Inc., are highly qualified to
conduct this grant. Cost sharing in the amount of $30,171 is included. ***
