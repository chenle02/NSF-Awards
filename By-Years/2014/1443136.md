As our e-mail, medical, financial and other personal information is migrating to
the Web, the need to simultaneously guarantee privacy, availability of data, and
correctness of computations is a paramount concern for NSF and for our society.
This workshop will explore mathematical tools for addressing these needs. The
workshop will also address the ongoing concerted effort to create practical
solutions and new technologies based on these mathematical developments. The
workshop will be open to all potential participants, and the findings (including
videos of presentations) will be distributed to the public for comments and
engagement. This award will support students to attend the workshop, and the PI
will actively recruit scientists from a diversity of backgrounds. The
mathematical tools that will be considered include integer lattices, elliptic
curves, bi-linear and multi-linear maps, codes, and computational learning
theory.
