The goal of this research project is to create a biomaterial substrate to
support endothelial-specific adhesion and proliferation to further impart
thromboresistance to bioimplants. Exposure of blood to an artificial surface
usually leads to the activation of the intrinsic pathway of the plasma
coagulation cascade and to the activation of platelets which are often
accompanied by the formation of a thrombus or blood clot. A popular technique
for imparting thromboresistance to biomaterials has involved the
endothelialization ("endothelial seeding") of biomaterial surfaces. Successful
endothelialization of biomedical implants may improve biocompatibility and aid
in reducing antigenicity and thromboginicity of vascular grafts. The techniques
of producing precultured endothelialized surfaces and seeding material with
blood containing endothelial cells may require a specialized biomaterial surface
to support cell adhesion. This research will use plasma surface modification
technology to incorporate hydroxyl functional groups onto the polymeric
bioimplant surface. The cell-binding peptides will be immobilized to the
previously modified bioimplant surface with tresyl chloride chemistry.
