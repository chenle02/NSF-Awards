The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program will support
research by Dr. Michael P. Castellani of the Chemistry Department, Marshall
University, on the reactivity of organometallic radical compounds. Electron
deficient pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl carbonyl compounds of Cr, Mo, and W will
be synthesized and used to prepare 17- and 19-electron species. The relative
stabilities of these odd-electron species will be determined, as well as their
physical properties and reactivities. In a related project, 15-electron
nitromethane complexes of chromium will be prepared and used to investigate the
isomerization of nitromethane to methyl nitrite. This reaction will be studied
to determine if it is general for nitroalkanes. Also, related alkoxide and amido
chromium complexes will be prepared and their reactivity with alkenes and
alkynes explored. Organometallic compounds that have 18 electrons in their
outermost energy levels are generally less reactive than those that contain 17
or 19 electrons. Some 17- and 19- electron species are thought to be important
intermediates in catalytic reactions. This project focuses on understanding
factors important in the reactivities of some odd-electron species, especially
in reactions which may have utility for organic synthesis. The research will be
carried out by undergraduate students
