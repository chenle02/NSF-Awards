9703356 Lauersen A CAREER award supports a study of contact friction. Key issues
emphasized include development of energetically consistent numerical algorithms
for transient friction processes, development of an integrated thermodynamic and
computational approach to the treatments of thermal coupling at the interface
and of rate effects, friction anisotropy and lubrication and wear. The results
will be compared with data obtained from the automotive industry on the thermal
behavior of brakes and the dynamic behavior of tires on rough roads. The
educational aspects of the award include undergraduate student-assisted
development of electronic textbooks for basic solid and fluid mechanics courses.
