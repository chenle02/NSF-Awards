9414360 Cheng The 4th United States-Taiwan Multiple Hazard Mitigation
Symposium/Workshop will take place the 15-16 July, 1994, in Chicago, Illinois.
Both countries are exposed to the consequences of natural disasters, and through
research both have made great strides in the mitigation of these effects. For
several decades the two nations have conducted joint research activities of
which three workshops on multiple hazards mitigation were of great interest and
benefit to the natural hazards research community. The objectives of the fourth
meeting are: to discuss the lessons learned from recent natural disasters; to
assess the currents state of knowledge; to identify new research areas of common
interest; to evaluate the decade- long Taiwan's multiple hazard mitigation
project; and to continue building the bilateral relationship existing between
the academic and practicing communities. The benefits from these activities are
the reduction in losses, injuries and damages, due to natural hazards. ***
