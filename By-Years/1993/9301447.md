9301447 Carta This research project is to investigate chemical syntheses using
immobilized enzymes in organic media. A major goal is to develop a bioreactor
system which can be used efficiently for large-volume production. The proposed
bioreactor is an integrated system in which enzymatic conversion and separation
occur simultaneously. As a result, the conversion can have values greater than
the limits imposed by thermodynamic equilibrium in conventional reactors. Also,
the nearly continuous and simultaneous removal of water, which occurs with the
proposed reactor system, should reduce the inhibitory and denaturing effects
that water has on these enzyme- catalyzed condensation reactions. In addition,
mathematical models will be used to extend the reactor system to other
reactions.
