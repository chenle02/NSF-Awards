The project consists of a series of related empirical studies on the
determinants of business saving and business fixed investment in the United
States. While these are traditionally areas of activist fiscal policy, there is
still very little convincing empirical evidence on a variety of important
topics. Those to be studied are: the relationship between household and business
saving; an analysis of the pattern of business fixed investment since the Tax
Reform Act of 1986; a comparison of alternative models of business fixed
investment; and an examination of the relationship between overall domestic U.S.
investment and foreign direct investment in the United States. The project
should increase our understanding of the extent to which fiscal policy can and
has influenced capital accumulation in the U.S. This is an area of intense
policy activism, but the state of economic knowledge remains largely based on
theoretical predictions instead of the type of empirical analysis carried out
under this project. The contribution from this project is especially timely and
important because it helps explain recent changes in the U.S. economic
environment, such as the sharp decline in corporate saving, the large increase
in capital inflows from abroad, and the unexpected strong performance of
business fixed investment since the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
