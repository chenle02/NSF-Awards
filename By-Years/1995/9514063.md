Abstract Moore 9514063 Secondary sexual characters are traits that influence
the reproductive success of individuals. These traits, such as elaborate
structures, nuptial colors, courtship songs, or sex pheromones, have no function
outside of mating. They are often elaborate and may be costly to produce and
maintain. Secondary sexual characters develop after adulthood prior to full
sexual maturity and are often sexually dimorphic. Elaborate secondary sexual
characters are most often associated with males, often change with age,
influenced by the environment, and can be conditiondependent. These traits have
evolved as a result of sexual selection: i.e. either their impact on male-male
competition for mates or their influence on female mating preferences. This
study will determine the quantitative genetics and evolution of the male-
produced sex pheromone of Nauphoeta cinerea and the social behavior of males and
females that is displayed in response to this pheromone. This sexual signal
develops after males emerge to adulthood, is sex limited in expression, and
changes with age and social experience after it has developed. Further, this
signal has apparently evolved as a result of sexual selection; both of the
behavioral mechanisms of sexual selection are influenced by variation in this
pheromone. Females discriminate among males on the basis of this pheromone, and
bias the developmental rates of their offspring by mating discriminatory. The
outcome of aggressive social interactions among males is also influenced by this
pheromone. Extensive background knowledge and experience in studying this
pheromone allows one to address fundamental questions concerning the impacts of
variable environments, genetics, and development of this sex pheromone and
associated behaviors. The P.I. will determine developmental and age-related
changes in this pheromone. In addition he will address how the external
environment experienced during development shapes sexually-selected signals and
behavior. Fi nally, this will quantify the extent that genetic variation impacts
responses to environmental influences. These results will increase our
understanding of the genetics and evolution of social signals. These experiments
will provide the first information on how the behaviors and signals involved in
sexual selection are mediated by plasticity. In addition, they will address the
importance of genotype by environment (GxE) interactions for sexual selection.
