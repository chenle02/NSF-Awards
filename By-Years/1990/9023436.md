This project addresses the generation and multiplication of dislocations during
the growth of cubic, cylindrical crystals of Silicon, Gallium Arsenide, and
Indium Phosphide which are pulled from the melt by the Czochralski or the
liquid-encapsulated- Czochralski method. Emphasis in on the computation of
thermal stresses during high temperature deformation. Three major effects will
be studied: 1)the shape of the solid-liquid interface between the melt and
crystal, whose control may greatly reduce the resulting thermal stresses, 2)the
crystalline anisotropy in relation to the direction of crystal growth, whose
proper choice may minimize the resulting dislocation density for a given amount
of crystalline anisotropy, and 3)dislocation generation and multiplication by
using high temperature inelastic constitutive laws which treat the dislocation
density as an internal variable and allow for its microstructural evolution. New
qualitative and quantitative understanding of fundamental processes important to
bulk single crystal growth in semiconductors is anticipated from this project;
the results also have technological relevance to the microelectronics industry.
