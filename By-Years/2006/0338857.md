This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)project proposes to develop new
capability to model emergency egress from buildings. The primary focus of the
proposal is evacuation due to fires, but the software will be designed such that
exposure and response to biological and chemical agents can also be simulated.
The project will couple egress analysis to time varying fire conditions (e.g.
smoke density and heat) calculated using a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
fire simulator. This will enable simulation of emergency situations in which,
for example, some exit paths become blocked. In addition to incorporating
current human response models, the software will allow researchers to specify
more complex individual behavior based on the results of recent studies of
observed human behavior during emergencies. Egress analysis is a critical
component - with fire simulation - in the implementation of "performance-based
building design". This new approach, as compared to traditional rule-based
(prescriptive) design, is being adopted in the United States to save building
cost and reduce injury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will lead to a
product that will facilitate the introduction of a new technology (coupling
egress analysis with CFD fire modeling) into the present fire safety design and
regulation process. The integration of fire simulation with egress analysis
provides new capability to more accurately simulate emergency building
evacuation. The engineering time required for the analyses will be reduced by
the common user interface and will enable the broader application of this
technology throughout the fire safety industry. This technology will increase
public safety, advancement in fire research, and reduced building costs. The
software will enable researchers to add their own models of human behavior to
the analysis. The software will potentially facilitate peer reviews, an
essential component to robust fire protection design in the performance design
arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
