The product the team aims to bring to market is a cloud-based video encoding and
transcoding service with superior performance, flexibility and security
features. Customers using this service would upload video files through a web
portal (or API) for encoding/transcoding into their choice of formats and bit-
rates suitable for display on mobile devices. The differentiating features of
the planned cloud video product include: (a) fast encoding/transcoding speed
with superior video quality, (b) excellent cost/performance, and (c) the ability
to support a wide variety of input and output video formats. Implementation of
the proposed cloud service will employ distributed computing technologies such
as Map/Reduce and Hadoop to achieve significant parallelism in video processing,
resulting in efficient use of computing resources and faster processing time.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cloud video prototype to be developed in this project
is expected to result in a commercial service with significant revenue
potential. The product will simplify video encoding and transcoding for a
variety of enterprises including content producers, broadcasters and mobile
service providers, by providing on-demand and low-cost video conversion services
that currently require on-site equipment with related capital costs. If
successful, the cloud video technology will thus enable improved and lower cost
mobile content delivery benefiting a broad cross section of Internet and
wireless end-users.
