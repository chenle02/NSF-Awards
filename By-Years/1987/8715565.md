Society is experiencing the emergence of a post-industrial era characterized by
greater knowledge, complexity, and turbulence. One effect of this trend is that
decision-related meetings are becoming more frequent and more important. At the
same time, the decisions confronting groups are becoming more complex and must
be made more quickly, and with greater participation than in the past. As part
of the transition into this new age, organizational scientists are exploring
advanced technologies that might facilitate effective and efficient group
meetings. One such technology is the Group Decision Support System (GDSS), a
computer-based system that attempts to facilitate communication and provide
decision support for meetings. This multi-year project drawing on the management
science, speech communication, and strategic planning disciplines will test and
refine a theory of how groups use and adapt to group decision and support
system. Decision makers have already taken advantage of this new technology and
will do so increasingly in the future. The project has the following long-range
goals: (1) to build a general theory of GDSSs and other social technologies; (2)
to identify design factors that contribute to GDSS effectiveness; and (3) to
discover possible problems with GDSSs, so decision-makers can guard against
them. The research will focus on decision outcomes such as quality, efficiency,
commitment, and team building as a result of how GDSSs influence group
interaction processes and how groups adapt and change the GDSS as they use it.
In the early years of the project, a series of laboratory experiments will
systematically vary the design of the GDSS, the extent of the decision network,
and the group context. As the project progresses, the research will move into
the field with the goal of expanding the theory to include the larger social
context of the organization.
