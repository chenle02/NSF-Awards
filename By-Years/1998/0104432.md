Dr. Johnson is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to carry out a program of research, education, and public outreach at
the University of Wisconsin and at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at
Socorro. Her research program focuses on the study of the earliest stages of
massive star clusters. She will use panchromatic data, from the radio to the
near-infrared, to study the physical properties of the star clusters as they
evolve from being completely enshrouded to being dominated by stellar light.
Study of these clusters provides knowledge of the conditions required for the
formation of massive star clusters and their physical properties at different
stages in their development. Dr. Johnson will also carry out a program of
undergraduate education, community outreach, and minority participation and
recruitment. ***
