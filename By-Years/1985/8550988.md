The "Biotechnology Workshop for Teachers" will provide 60 biology, chemistry and
general science precollege teachers an opportunity to study the basic principles
of biotechnology as developed in the past ten years. Specifically this will
build the confidence of the participant teachers in the area of biotechnology by
updating their knowledge through "hands-on" laboratory participation, providing
opportunities to develop laboratory/lecture materials, and learning to use
specially prepared molecular biology kits that will be made available to their
high school students. The six-week summer workshop will be held at Georgetown
University and will include opportunities for independent research and informal
discussions on data analysis and experimental design. The long term goals of
this project are first to initiate the training of 60 high school teachers
within a 50-mile radius of the Washington, DC Metropolitan area and later to
expand this program over a wider area for a broader impact. Another major goal
is to develop, in conjunction with private industry, the necessary reagents
critical to study areas of biotechnology. Teachers who show promise of being
catalytic focal points in their respective school systems and of having the
skills to incorporate the materials in the classrooms and school districts will
be selected for this workshop. Follow-up and evaluation procedures by the PI
will continue to provide help for the teachers within their classrooms and in
their roles as resource persons.
