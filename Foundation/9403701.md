9403701 Laskowski Dr. Michael Laskowski will continue his research in the field
of model theory, a branch of mathematical logic. He expects to obtain more
information as to the possible mechanisms making a type inevitable in the
setting of superstable theories that do not have the Dimensional Order Property
(DOP). Laskowski expects to complete his classification of those countable
theories for which there are two non-isomorphic models that can be forced
isomorphic by a forcing with the countable chain condition. Finally, he will
continue his research into an inherent asymmetry between two new methods of
constructing models of small, superstable theories. Most of the field of model
theory (as a branch of mathematical logic) is concerned with developing methods
for building algebraic structures with certain properties. The problem of
whether there is a structure having an element satisfying an infinite set of
properties (i.e., realizing a type) is well understood: such a structure exists
if and only if, for every finite subset of the type, there is an element
satisfying each of these properties. However, it is a much more subtle question
to ask whether a given type is inevitable, i.e., whether EVERY structure
contains an element realizing the type. Without adding additional restrictions
to the class of structures under consideration, it is known that there can be no
satisfactory criterion for which types are inevitable. Laskowski will continue
his research on what additional constraints must be placed on the algebraic
structure to yield a natural characterization of inevitability. ***
