Capturing the essential behavior of nonlinear phenomena at the micro- and
nanoscales with the simplest and crudest models is of fundamental importance in
science and engineering. This allows for understanding of basic mechanisms, the
design and implementation of efficient numerical methods for simulation and
control of ensuing processes, and the analysis of both models and algorithms.
Mathematical models in biophysics (such as biomembranes in both fluid and gel
state), in materials science (such as crystal surface morphologies and bilayer
actuators), and in shape optimization (including electro-wetting on dielectric)
are typical yet quite distinct examples that the investigator studies in the
project. The governing partial differential equations are geometric and exhibit
disparate space-time scales: point and line singularities (interfaces), thin
layers, and large domain deformations, perhaps leading to topology changes. The
goal of the project is to model and control such multiscale phenomena, and to
design, test, and analyze reliable and efficient adaptive finite element methods
for them with space-time error control based on a posteriori error estimation.

Understanding the mechanisms of nonlinear phenomena at micro- and nanoscales is
essential in many areas of science and engineering. The investigator develops
mathematical models and reliable computational methods for studying a wide range
of such problems. This project deals with applications of Federal strategic
interest such as nano and microtechnology (such as the design and control of
micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS)), biotechnology (such as the study of
biomembranes), and high performance computing (such as the design of novel
efficient numerical methods). It is a collaborative endeavor involving a number
of scientists in the US and abroad, as well as several graduate students and
postdocs. A substantial effort is devoted to education and human resource
development.
