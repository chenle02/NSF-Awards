9316719 Santiago The cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) is a DNA
binding protein required for the transcription of the somatostatin gene. This
protein's usual narrow DNA binding selectivity is broadened upon heterodimer
formation with the pX protein (from hepatitis B virus). Two dimensional NMR
spectroscopy will be utilized to characterize this change in DNA binding
specificity. Specific aims include: (1) characterize the CREB:DNA interaction,
(2) Determine the solution structure of chimeric CREB peptides that exhibit DNA
binding similar to the native CREB, and (3) attempt to modify DNA recognition by
CREB homodimers. %%% DNA-protein interactions are of fundamental importance to
the control of cell physiology. The leucine zipper is a structural element found
in many DNA-binding proteins. Structural studies of many leucine zipper
structures have established the ground rules for specific recognition of DNA by
zipper dimers. The CREB protein (cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein):
DNA interaction is itself modulated by interactions with a protein from
hepatitis B virus. Of major importance is development of an understanding of the
modulation of the binding specificity of a zipper:DNA interaction. This study
could point the way to a broader understanding of the control of gene
expression. ***
