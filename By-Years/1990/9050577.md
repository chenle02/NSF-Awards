This project provides greatly increased learning opportunities for students in
the areas of mechanical, electro-mechanical, and computer-aided design. A key
aspect of this project is the acquisition of ten Hewlett-Packard computer
workstations with UNIX operating environment, Parametric Technology's Pro-
Engineer application software, and Hewlett-Packard's Printed Circuit Design
Software. This equipment enables the students to solve real-world design
problems relating to function, part fit, and manufacturing limitations that,
because of time limitations, require three dimensional methods. Students receive
a greater understanding of design principles through direct visualization of
both the problem and its possible solutions. The added capability of this new
software/hardware allows the student to spend more time in critical and
analytical thinking, and less time documenting and drawing the design. The award
is being matched with a greater amount (130 percent) by the principal
investigator's institution.
