Prof. Christodoulou will pursue rigorous mathematical studies of interest to
gravitational research. A new proof of the global nonlinear stability of the
vacuum (Minkowski space) will be given which avoids the use of maximal
hypersurfaces. The concepts of local mass and angular momentum in general
relativity will be investigated. The structure of singularities in spherically
symmetric gravitational collapse will be analyzed. This should lead to
understanding the good behavior of solutions of the spherically symmetric
Einstein equations in the past of the apparent horizon. The proof of a theorem
describing the formation of black holes and singularities for the general
Einstein equations will be attempted.
