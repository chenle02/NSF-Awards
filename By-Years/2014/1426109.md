The annual ACM CCS conference is a leading international forum for computer and
communications security researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to
explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and
experiences. ACM CCS is the flagship event of ACM Special Interest Group of
Security, Audit and Control (SIGSAC). Its acceptance rate is around 15-20%,
which makes it a highly selective conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant
provides support for 20 students to attend ACM CCS and associated workshops.
Preference will be given to undergraduate students participating in the poster
session, and students with papers in the conference or workshop who do not have
other support. Participation by women and underrepresented groups will also be
encouraged.
