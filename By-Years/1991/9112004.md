The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of New Jersey Institute of
Technology will purchase parallel processing hardware (specifically, adapter
boards for use in IBM AT-compatible host computers with INMOS T800 transputers)
and associated interfacing peripheral equipment and software which will be
dedicated to the support of research in engineering. The equipment will be used
to study several issues in the implementation of real-time parallel feedback
control strategies. The primary emphasis will be on the application to
antagonistic control, a new concept for controlling the position of an object by
means of strings or wires in which the tension is actively controlled. The
application not only serves as a useful paradigm for elucidating the issues in
implementation of parallel processing algorithms, but also has the potential of
an entirely new way of achieving accurate position control. Other uses for
research equipment will include reconfigurable control and reliable control
software.
