9319333 Kowalski This supplement funds the University of Washington's
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Process Analytical
Chemistry. The funding is provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
to augment on-going research in the area of sensor and flow injection monitoring
for Environmental Waste Reduction and Prevention at the Center. This project
entitled "Environmental Waste Reduction and Prevention through the Application
of Flow Injection Analysis" is to develop solution handling techniques based on
the developed Flow Injection method as a replacement of standard methods of
water analysis. This project is a continuation of the project initially
supported by the EPA. The Program Director recommends the University of
Washington be awarded $40,000 for one year with funds provided by EPA.
