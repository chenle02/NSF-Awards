With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Grinnell College will acquire an electrochemical
impedance instrument and a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The
electrochemical impedance instrument will enable the principal investigator and
undergraduates at Grinnell to carry out ionic conductivity studies of polymeric
electrolytes; the DSC will facilitate the measurement of the thermal properties
of the electrolytes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Differential Scanning Calorimetry is
an extremely useful tool in modern analytical chemistry. Calorimetric analysis
is used to measure the thermal energy (heat) exchange that occurs during
molecular interactions and reactions. Thus DSC provides a very reliable and
sensitive method for determining thermodynamic properties of materials such as
changes in heat capacity of liquid and solid samples. Impedance spectroscopy
measures the alternating current resistance, i.e., the impedance, of a sample as
a function of frequency. Knowledge of thermodynamic properties and impedances is
crucial to understanding the behavior of materials, such as polymer
electrolytes, that show promise in microelectronics and lightweight, small
batteries.
