The Summer Research Program in Biostatistics is offered by the Department of
Biostatistics and Medical Informatics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
The program will give undergraduate students the opportunity to explore a career
in biostatistics and bioinformatics by working closely with faculty mentors in
the Department and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The Department has an
internationally recognized research faculty committed to undergraduate and
graduate training, who will direct individual research projects. Our goals are
to spark the students' interest in biostatistical research and provide them with
the tools and skills to successfully gain admission to post-baccalaureate
programs. Students with strength in mathematics participate in coursework in
statistical computing, biostatistics, and bioinformatics. A seminar series
highlights the diversity of research areas utilizing biostatistics to solve real
problems in biological and medical science and provides an understanding of the
role of the statistician in a variety of scientific research areas. In addition
the program includes workshops on ethics, career choices and other topics of
interest.. There are a wide variety of biostatistics and bioinformtaics research
activities for 6-8 students in the summer program. Research areas include
clinical trials, epidemiology, bioinformatics, statistical genetics and
laboratory experimental design. At the end of the 8 week period the students
present their work on a chosen research topic to other program participants and
mentors.
