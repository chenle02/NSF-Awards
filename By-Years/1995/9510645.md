Fruit fly species residing in the Sonoran Desert of North America are faced
with a suite of ecological challenges. The desert is extremely hot. The
resources that the flies use to feed and breed are toxic to many organisms.
These flies are able to flourish in such an inhospitable place because of
adaptations at many biological levels, from their metabolic chemistry to their
mating behaviors. Understanding the nature of these adaptations has broad
implications for all organisms, especially under conditions of global warming
and habitat disturbance. The work to be undertaken during this 5 year project
will explore certain components of the ecology and population biology of these
insects: their ability to withstand heat stress, their longevity, temporal and
spatial qualities of their abiotic and biotic environments.
