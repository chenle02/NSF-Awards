The investigators will continue their research involving measures of various
kinds-Hausdorff, packing, Gibbs state, etc.; associated functions; and
associated dimensions. These notions will be studied within the context of
various dynamical systems as applied to Julia sets for example or to
characterization of Jordan curves as repellers. They will use these techniques
with regard to certain geometric objects and constructions, e.g. self-affine
sets and self-- similar objects. This project involves research in ergodic
theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of
systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in
microscopic detail. Under the heading "dynamics" can be placed the modern theory
of how groups of abstract transformations act on smooth spaces. In this way,
ergodic theory makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on
homogeneous spaces.
