Students in a microbiology course required for non-majors from a relatively
large group of diverse curricula uses computer presented case studies to
understand the basic biology of microorganisms as well as the applied aspects of
microbiology used in his or her career. The computer program presents a case
study with digitized images to provide realism. To solve a case, the student
must develop a hypothesis and test that hypothesis by interactively seeking
pertinent data from the computer. The data are obtained when clinical tests are
requested from a list of laboratory procedures available. Students are penalized
for asking for irrelevant data because there is a "mock" charge for each test.
The student's final evaluation is based on a written report that gives the
reasoned arguments that led to the solution and the final "cost" of solving the
case.
