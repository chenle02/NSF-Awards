0216133&lt;br/&gt;Pedone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support through the Major
Research Instrumentation Program, the imaging and analytical capabilities of a
scanning-electron-microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray analytical
system and a cathodoluminescence-imaging system will be applied to a wide range
of natural and synthetic materials in the physical sciences at California State
University Northridge (CSUN). Initial research use of this instrumentation will
include the study of biotic and abiotic formation of lacustrine carbonate
sediment and rocks; diagenesis of siliceous and siliciclastic deep-sea sediment;
the identification of volcanic, carbonate, and carbonaceous phases for
radiometric dating; the provenance of volcanic rocks in support of tectonic
reconstruction in southern California; and the physical properties of metals,
semiconductor and dielectric thin films. Acquisition of a research-quality SEM-
EDS will allow faculty to expand existing research programs and to explore new
avenues of collaborative research. It also will enhance recruitment of high-
quality graduate and undergraduate students to the physical sciences at CSUN and
provide them with first-rate research training to assure their success in future
academic study and professional careers. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
