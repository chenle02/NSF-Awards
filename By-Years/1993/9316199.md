9316199 Guidotti This award provides 63 percent of the funding required to
transport, install, and upgrade an electron microprobe. The instrument is being
donated to the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Maine by
the U.S. Geological Survey. The University of Maine is committed to providing
the remaining funds necessary for the installation and upgrade of this donated
electron microprobe. The newly equipped electron microprobe laboratory at Maine
will be a regional facility serving Maine's research community with a modern
analytical tool suitable for a wide variety of research projects where there is
a need for accurate chemical compositional data with high spatial resolution on
the order of micrometers. ***
