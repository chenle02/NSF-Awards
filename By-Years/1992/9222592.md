Improved understanding of the solar activity cycle and of its effects upon solar
outputs requires, first and foremost, more information on its past behavior.
This grant is for the completion of one aspect of the RISE (Radiative Inputs of
the Sun to Earth) program, to digitize and reduce the CaK spectroheliograms
obtained on a daily basis between 1915 and 1985 at Mt. Wilson. These images
provide by far the longest record of solar chromospheric plages. We also plan to
analyze the behavior of these structures in active regions and in the network
over the past 7 solar cycles, for information on variations of solar UV, EUV and
total irradiances. The behavior of facular area, spatial distribution, and
brightness will also provide information on the sun's magnetic fields and
activity levels that is complementary to data obtained by the sunspot index, and
from other much shorter data bases such as magnetograms. The data from this
grant will be made available to the scientific community. The results of this
project should be of considerable interest to the upper atmospheric physicists,
climatologists and in ongoing efforts to improve prediction and dynamical
understanding of solar activity cycles.
