The Midwest Geometry Conference is an annual meeting dedicated to the
dissemination of important recent advances in Differential Geometry, Geometric
Analysis, and Integral Geometry to the community of Midwestern mathematicians.
Each conference is devoted to a small number of topics that are central in
geometry and geometric analysis or bring up important and productive connections
with other fields of mathematics and applied science. The aim is to create a
focused environment, bringing together leading mathematicians in the different
fields of mathematics and students or young professionals that have just started
their career.
