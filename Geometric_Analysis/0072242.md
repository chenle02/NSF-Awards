Abstract

Award: DMS-0072242 Principal Investigator: Joel Spruck

The principal investigator proposes to study a number of classical problems in
Riemannian geometry that are related in that they may be described by, or have a
strong connection with, fully nonlinear elliptic equations such as Monge-Ampere
equations or mean curvature equations in some novel way. These include
extensions of the classical sharp isoperimetric inequality to negatively curved
Riemannian manifolds, hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature in hyperbolic
space with prescribed boundary at infinity, and the problem of deciding if any
local Riemannian metric can be realized by an embedding into Euclidean three
dimensional space. This last problem is interesting not only for its geometric
content but also for important concrete problems in computer vision.

Our research is motivated by concrete geometric and physical problems that are
of basic interest to pure and applied scientists. What are the basic geometric
design principles (variational principles) that govern the structure of the
protein in our genes and can we find a fast computational algorithm to predict
this structure. How can we make better color computer screens and smart cameras.
These questions and numerous others depend upon a deep understanding of the
geometry of surfaces and the complicated nonlinear equations that describe how
they twist and turn and move about in space. The effective solution of these
problems involves the study of geometry, partial differential equations and high
speed computation.
