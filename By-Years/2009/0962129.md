In democratic settings, members of minority groups have recourse to a variety of
political tools (for example, lobbying, making campaign contributions) to pursue
what they see as their fundamental rights and liberties. Not only do they have
numerous tools at their disposal, they have many potential points of entry into
the political system (including the legislative, judicial, and executive arenas
at both the national and sub-national level). Much less is known, however, about
rights mobilization in non-democratic settings. The purpose of this dissertation
research, to be conducted by Lynette Chua under the supervision of Dr. Kristin
Luker, is to understand why and how members of minority groups mobilize to
pursue what they see as their rights in non-democratic settings.

There are two central questions motivating this study. The first is how
activists make sense of rights and ultimately decide to become activists. The
second is how activists understand rights and how that understanding informs
their activities and ideas of success. The research will be conducted in
Singapore, an Asian country that resembles a Western democracy on paper but
functions differently in substantial ways in practice. The researcher will
conduct approximately 90 in-depth interviews with gay activists in Singapore.
She will also systematically analyze documents such as activists' writings and
state policies and laws.

This study will refine scholarly understanding about the place of rights in
less-than-democratic countries and, in the process, illuminate rights
mobilization more generally. The findings will advance knowledge regarding the
connection between rights and collective action and the connection between
individual actions, especially acts of resistance, and collective action with
regard to rights.
