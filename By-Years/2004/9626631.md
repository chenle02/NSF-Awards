9626631 Ferrar This grant supports a conference on Groups, Lie Algebras, and the
Monster to be held at Ohio state University in the Spring quarter of 1996. The
goal of the five day conference is to foster interactions between mathematicians
from the area of group theory and lie theory. Topics to be covered include:
quantum groups, vertex operators, modular lie algebras and the sporadic simple
groups. This is research in the field of algebra. Algebra can be though of as
the study of symmetry in the abstract. As such Algebra has direct applications
to areas of physics and chemistry. In particular the modern theory of gauge
fields in physics uses this area of algebra extensively. There are also
connections to coding theory and the transmission of data across communication
lines.
