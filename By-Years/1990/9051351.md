This laboratory course is offered in conjunction with the Applied Polymer
Science program in the Department of Food Science and Textile, Design and
Consumer Economics. The course is designed to provide a basic polymer knowledge
for undergraduate students in chemistry, textile science, food science,
packaging science and technology, art and textile conservation, polymer
composite studies, and engineering. It will also satisfy the needs of continuing
education students. Examples of laboratory experiences include spectroscopic
identification, branching and cross-linking, rheology, transport properties,
strength properties,polymer molecular weight, crystallinity, thermal properties,
polyelectrolytes and electrostatics.
