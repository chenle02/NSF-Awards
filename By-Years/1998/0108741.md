This work will build on recent work by the PI on the multimodel superensemble
approach for weather and climate forecasts. The principle of this technique
contains a partitioning of the timeline with a control (training) and a forecast
phase. Past results based on this technique have indicated that the
superensemble outperforms in skill, multimodel forecasts, ensemble mean and
climatology. The research will focus on the following areas: (1) to understand
the basis for improved results from the multimodel superensemble for global
numerical weather prediction, including hurricanes and forecasts of seasonal
climate; (2) to further improve the methodology for the construction of
superensemble forecasts; (3) to improve the initial state, i.e. superensemble of
day 0 input for all variables for training and model validation; (4) to design
and carry-out coupled atmosphere-ocean model based superensemble forecasts on
seasonal to multiseasonal time scales; (5) to address the issue of sensitivity
of superensemble forecast skills to perturbation of the training data base; and
(6) to continue the preparation of real-time multimodel superensemble forecast
data sets for global numerical weather prediction including hurricane track and
intensity forecasts. The work is important because it has potential implications
for prediction, both on weather and seasonal timescales, leading to great
societal benefits.
