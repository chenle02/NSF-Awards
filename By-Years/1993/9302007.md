Workshop on Algorithims for Constrained Approximation and Optimization May 23--
26, 1993 Stowe, Vermont The Organizers: D. Zwick, University of Vermont R.A.
Zalik, Auburn University The "Workshop on Algorithms for Constrained
Approximation and Optimization" will bring together leading researchers in
numerical analysis and approximation theory to discuss new and innovative
approaches to solving difficult problems in the area of constrained
approximation and optimization. The participants, who will come from a academia,
private and government research institutes, and industry, are mostly experts in
either constrained approximation or constrained optimization. While there is a
nonempty intersection in the problems and techniques familiar to these two
groups, there has not been much interaction and cross-fertilization between
them. The purpose of the proposed workshop is to provide a pleasant and
productive setting for participants to engage in an interchange of ideas, to
foster collaborative research among the participants, and to expose young
researchers and graduate students to the exciting mathematics being done at the
forefront of these fields.
