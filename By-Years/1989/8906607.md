This research elucidates adaptive responses in two similar but different
systems. The first is the adaptation to sensory signals seen in bacterial
chemotaxis, involving the aspartate receptor. The covalent modification of this
receptor is being studied both by a combination of genetic engineering to modify
the receptor and study its dynamic state, and by x-ray crystallographic
techniques which are designed to understand the detailed protein structure. In
addition, the feedback from the cytoplasmic constituents of the cellular system
are explored in an attempt to understand the quantitative contribution of the
cytoplasmic components relative to the contributions of the internal protein
structure. The second adaptive system is the branch point operating at the
isocitric dehydrogenase--isocitrate lyase position in Escherichia coli, which
allows the bacteria to adapt to growth on varying levels of acetate, and other
constituents. Studies focus on mutants of isocitric dehydrogenase and on
recombinant DNA procedures which allow manipulation of the steps in the pathway
in order to understand principles of regulatory control. The x- ray structure of
the isocitric dehydrogenase will be determined to understand the role of mutants
and the role of the induced conformational change in controlling the activity of
the protein. Studies combining protein chemistry, enzyme kinetics and feedback
control are leading to an understanding of adaptive behavior in model systems.
Protein structure has been shown to be crucial for adaptation in microorganisms.
This project is providing information on molecular mechanisms of adaptive
responses.
