This action funds Katelyn Patricia Goetz of Wake Forest University to conduct a
research project, entitled "Growing highly pure crystals of novel organic
semiconductor materials," during the summer of 2012 at Nanyang Technological
University in Singapore. The host scientist is Dr. Christian Kloc.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in the creation of novel
organic binary compounds composed of varying ratios of donor and acceptor
semiconducting opto-electronic materials. These materials are expected to
exhibit properties not present in the parent compounds, such as
superconductivity, ambipolar charge transport, or metallic behavior. Such
properties are technologically relevant because of the wide range of electronic
devices they make possible, and interesting from the fundamental standpoint
because of their ability to elucidate currently unknown mechanisms of charge
transport in organic semiconductor materials.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
