The investigator continues to study general decomposable forms. &lt;br/&gt;In
particular, he seeks&lt;br/&gt;better bounds&lt;br/&gt;for the number of
primitive integral solutions to non-degenerate decomposable&lt;br/&gt;form
equations and also stronger asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;results for the number of
integral solutions&lt;br/&gt;to the related inequality.&lt;br/&gt;In addition,
the investigator studies the&lt;br/&gt;absolute Siegel's lemma and the
related&lt;br/&gt;Hermite's &lt;br/&gt;constant over the algebraic numbers. The
main goal here is an effective&lt;br/&gt;version of the former and improved
upper bounds for the latter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The decomposable form
equations dealt with here are examples of&lt;br/&gt;Diophantine equations. These
have been studied for millennia.&lt;br/&gt;Long thought to be mere intellectual
curiosities, it is&lt;br/&gt;now realized that knowledge in this area is crucial
in our&lt;br/&gt;``digital" age. Much of cryptography, coding, and data exchange
rests&lt;br/&gt;on the ability, or lack thereof, to find solutions to such
equations.&lt;br/&gt;Siegel's lemma and Hermite's constant are intimately
connected with&lt;br/&gt;sphere packings, finite groups&lt;br/&gt;and
&lt;br/&gt;error-correcting codes, and via these to many disparate areas
of&lt;br/&gt;science.
