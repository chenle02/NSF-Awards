This project is a joint project between the University of Colorado and
Atkinson-Noland and Associates, in cooperation with the Politechnico di Milano
and ISMES of Bergauno, Italy. The researchers will investigate the structural
safety of unreinforced masonry walls duplicating construction practices of past
years in order to determine the best methods to repair and retrofit them.
