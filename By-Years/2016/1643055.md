The initial meeting of the Cascade Topology Seminar during the grant period
occurs the weekend of November 19-20, 2016 at Seattle University, located in
Seattle, Washington. The Seminar is scheduled to continue meeting semi-annually
throughout the grant period at various Universities in the US Pacific Northwest
and Southwestern Canada. The Seminar provides for frequent contacts between
workers in similar fields, allows for practitioners to keep abreast of recent
developments by bringing in speakers and experts from outside the region,
enables undergraduate and graduate students, post-docs, University faculty and
industrial topologists in the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Canada to hear,
consult, and collaborate with the outside speakers and with practitioners from
other institutions, in addition to providing an opportunities for local
practitioners in academia, industry, and government to lecture on their own
work. &lt;br/&gt;As the Cascade Topology Seminar is designed in part to keep its
participants abreast of recent developments in their own and related fields, no
attempt is made to limit the topics covered. However, the interests of the
various organizers tend to be mirrored by the interests of the presenters, thus,
the presentations at the Seminars usually concern algebraic, geometric, or low
dimensional topology, differential or algebraic geometry, or combinatorial group
theory. The Seminar also coordinates its activities with the Pacific Northwest
Geometry Seminar and the Western States Geometric Topology Workshop with whom
joint meetings have occasionally been held.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Recent topics
covered in Seminar presentations include triangulations, twist knots and the
uniform thickness property, right-angled Coxeter polytopes, hyperbolic
6-manifolds, geometric representatives of homology classes in the space of knots
, four manifold topology, finite group actions in Kervaire manifolds, locally
symmetric spaces, the cohomology of symmetric groups, metrics on manifolds with
large volume and spectral gap, Properties of the Alexander polynomial and knot
Floer homology, higher real K-theory spectra ,the bo-Adams spectral sequence,
the simplicial EHP Sequence in A1 algebraic topology, Calabi-Yau categories, the
Floer theory of a cotangent bundle, and string topology. General information on
