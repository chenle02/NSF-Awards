The effect of environmental variables on human performance is a long-standing
concern of physical anthropologists. The primary objective of this research is
to analyze the biological and behavioral factors that affect the ability of
humans to work in a cold environment. The proposed research will be carried out
in northern China as heavy laborers are paid by the unit of work accomplished,
thus allowing easy quantification of work performance. Additionally, the
Director of the Work Physiology Department of the Institute of Occupational
Medicine is a co-PI on this project. The PIs will use standard and newly
developed methods to measure the workers and their productivity in the
laboratory and under field conditions. The results will be used to test models
of the factors which enhance and limit human performance under cold conditions.
