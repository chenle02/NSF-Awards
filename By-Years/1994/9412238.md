9412238 Owen Auburn University requests support from NSF for connection of five
universities and colleges including: Birmingham-Southern College, Judson
College, Huntingdon College, Stillman College, and Talledega College to the
NSFNET. This connection is a basic part of an overall teaching improvement
project described below. The accessibility of the network to all the schools is
critical for the coordination of that project and accomplishment of its goals,
such as development of shared teaching resources and improvement of the quality
of teaching. In addition, those schools to be connected expect to see
significant benefit from the wider access to information to both faculty and
students. Auburn University is providing the project direction for the network
connection portion of the overall project. Each of the universities has written
a description of its organization and a statement of the benefits of Internet
access that it expects including: greater functionality and network speed to be
able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with
being able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty
research will benefit from the links. This is also a unique opportunity for the
schools to explore innovative educational resources.
