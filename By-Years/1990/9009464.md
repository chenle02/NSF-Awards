A field program will examine the mutual interaction of the Deep Western
Boundary Current and the Gulf Stream as they cross near Cape Hatteras. Sampling
will include both hydrography with a CTD and direct measures of transport with
POGOs. An additional tracer, CFM, will be measured through a companion proposal
from Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory. Dynamical interpretations of the
data will follow.
