This proposal requests support for the continued development and operation of
several lidar systems that are currently being used to explore the stratosphere,
mesosphere and lower thermosphere. These lidars systems include the CEDAR
resonance fluorescence lidar, the new Na temperature/Doppler wind lidar and a
powerful new Rayleigh lidar that is proposed for construction during the first
year of the project.***//
