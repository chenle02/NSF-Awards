From the moment of birth, humans begin to form social relationships with others.
These relationships, of course, become increasingly more complex across infancy,
childhood, and beyond, but the abilities that support this development likely
have their foundations in early infancy. The focus of this research project is
on one such ability, infants' recognition that there is a correspondence between
their own bodies and those of others (such as recognizing one's own hand as the
same body part with the same function as one's parents' hands). This recognition
of bodily correspondences requires that infants have a basic sense of the
structure of their own bodies despite not being able to see them from the
outside. This research investigates how infants' brains are organized to
recognize and organize information about their own bodies, how this changes over
development, and how it might influence their ability to recognize bodily
correspondences with others.

This award supports studies in which electroencephalographic (EEG) methods will
be used to study the properties of somatotopic body maps in the first weeks and
months of life. Specifically, mu rhythm desynchronization and event-related-
potential (ERP) responses in one-month-old infants will be measured in response
to tactile stimulation of the hands, feet, and lips, with the spatial pattern of
these responses being used to chart body maps in the developing human brain. The
investigators anticipate that the magnitude and patterning of these brain
responses may be modified when the infant is attending to the movements of other
people during the periods of tactile stimulation. This will inform how body maps
in the infant brain may be part of an early process relating self and other at a
bodily level.
