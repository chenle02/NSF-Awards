This research is concerned with an approximation theory for variational
(optimization) problems and its application. A major effort of the research will
go to the development of a quantitative theory that would be more directly
applicable in a numerical environment and would provide a means for calculating
error estimates. Of particular interest is the application of the theory to a
stochastic environment, including the computer implementation of solution
procedures. Three application areas have been singled out for detailed study in
this project: stochastic optimization problems, estimation theory in statistics,
and random operator equations that model conductivity or flow through random
composite materials. The research is in the general area of applied mathematics
with applications to the theory of statistics.
