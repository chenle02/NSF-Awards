This effort relates to the fabrication and demonstration of a new all-optical
switching device. Such elements are crucial to proposed developments of optical
signal processing technuques. This effort will involve fabrication and
experiments at an institution which is establishing a considerable effort in
this area and in the lightwave area generally.
