This action funds a Minority Graduate Student Travel Award. These awards permit
minority graduate students who plan to apply for an NSF Minority Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship to make visits to prospective sponsoring scientists prior to
submitting a fellowship application.

Ms. Danao will visit laboratories at the Institute of BioScience and Technology
at Cranfield University and the Silsoe Research Institute, Bedford, UK in
September, 2004. Her background is in engineering and her research to date has
been in developing optical sensors. She seeks cross-disciplinary training in
biology to optimize her ability to pursue her career goals of inventing new
biosensors. This visit will permit her to formulate a program for postdoctoral
research that adds a biological perspective to her research and training at
leading foreign institutions.
