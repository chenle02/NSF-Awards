This action funds Elizabeth Ann Gilbert of The University of Virginia to conduct
a research project, entitled "Does imagining how outcomes could have been
different explain cross-cultural differences in how we decide whom to blame?"
during the summer of 2012 at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The
host scientist is Chi-Yue Chiu.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to explore cultural factors in
styles of thinking and better understand whether East Asians think about
causation and blame differently than Americans do. Specifically, does the
process of imagining the ways that bad outcomes could have been prevented affect
East Asians' tendency to blame the environment rather than the individual?

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
