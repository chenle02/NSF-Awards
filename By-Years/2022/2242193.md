The Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) is a key component of the global thermohaline
circulation that affects the large-scale ocean circulation and global climate.
During the recent hiatus decade (2003-2012) about two-thirds of the excess heat
that entered Earthâ€™s climate system was stored in the Indian Ocean. This project
will address the ITF pathway patterns in the South Indian Ocean. The PIs propose
a new pathway for heat flow in the Southeast Indian Ocean and will investigate
its role in distributing the excess heat and freshwater that entered the South
Indian Ocean from the ITF during the hiatus decade. An integral approach will be
used that combines analyses of observational and reanalysis datasets with high-
resolution ocean model experiments. These methods will be used to characterize
the spatial and temporal structure of the flow pathway, investigate the forcing
and processes that govern the pathways of ITF waters, and explore the roles of
the different pathways in distributing heat and freshwater in the South Indian
Ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs hypothesize the existence of a flow pathway
for waters from the ITF between the Southeast Indian Ocean and the subtropical
South Indian Ocean, along which ITF waters spread to the western subtropical
South Indian Ocean with a portion leaking to the Southern Ocean. They posit that
this pathway was the major conduit for the enhanced ITF heat and freshwater
transport of the recent global surface warming hiatus period. To test this
observational data will be analyzed in combination with numerical model
experiments. Observational data will include data from moorings, drifters,
satellites, reanalysis products. Model data will include existing 1/10 degree
simulations from Ocean General Circulation Models For the Earth Simulator and
new 1/12 degree runs using HYCOM. The overall goals of the research are to
explore the potential new pathway of ITF waters in the South Indian Ocean,
investigate the governing mechanisms of this new pathway, and quantify its role
in transporting the excess heat and fresher ITF waters during the recent hiatus
period into the Greater Agulhas Current System of the subtropical Southwest
Indian Ocean. The project focuses on the hiatus period 2003-2012 when a dramatic
heat increase in the Indian Ocean due to enhanced ITF was
observed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
