In order to provide an industrial-type "design-production-test" experience for
students, a 3-axis milling machine with optional 4th axis, PC, AutoCAD and NC
postprocessor are used in a senior-level capstone CAD/CAM course and also in
other manufacturing courses, undergraduate independent study projects,
undergraduate research projects and demonstrations. In the capstone CAD/CAM
course, students use engineering workstations with solid modeling, FEM, dynamic
systems modeling, expert systems in design for manufacturability, the milling
machine, machine vision inspection and actual dynamic test to design, produce,
inspect and test plate cams.
