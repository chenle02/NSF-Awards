This award will establish a Laboratory for Computational Astrophysics (LCA) at
the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign as a joint venture between the
National Center for Supercomputing Applications and the Department of Astronomy.
At the heart of this laboratory is a new suite of application codes for
astrophysical hydrodynamic, magnetohydrodynamic and radiation hydrodynamic
simulations in one, two and three spatial dimensions implemented on NCSA's
supercomputers. Several of these codes are already in use by national
researchers on a variety of astrophysical problems. The central goal of the LCA
is the development, dissemination and support of community codes for
astrophysical simulation of general use to astronomical researchers.
