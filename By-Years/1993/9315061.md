9315061 Wolf The knowledge of many basic stellar properties is dependent on
studies of variable stars. Two classes of variable stars, eclipsing binaries and
yellow supergiants will be studied in this project. Photometry measurements will
be made with CCD on the Baker Observatory 0.4 meter telescope at Southwestern
Missouri State University. Light curves will be obtained for poorly studied
eclipsing binaries and eclipses sought in suspected eclipsing binaries. Many
yellow supergiants may vary at low levels and a sample of these stars will be
observed to search for such variations.
