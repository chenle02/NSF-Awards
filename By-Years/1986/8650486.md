The objective of this project is to make a significant contribution to improving
Wellesley's undergraduate Physiology laboratory through the acquisition of
electronic recording and monitoring equipment that will allow the incorporation
of computer-based data collection and analysis techniques. The instruments to be
acquired, when interfaced with general purpose microcomputers currently
available in the department, will provide invaluable experience with modern
physiological research techniques, as exemplified by thirteen already-developed
student exercises and by others yet to be prepared. Successful laboratory
exercises will be collected into a manual for dissemination to other
institutions. In addition, the equipment will allow the Wellesley faculty to
increase opportunities for independent research by undergraduate students in the
department, and to enhance the honors research program. This project ultimately
is aimed at increasing the number and improving the educational experience of
women who choose careers as professionals in the biomedical and allied life
sciences. The project's impact at Wellesley will be felt at once; a broader
national impact also may be gained.
