0320880&lt;br/&gt;Werne&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award to
University of Minnesota Duluth provides funds for acquisition of an isotope-
ratio mass spectrometer, a gas chromatograph and a headspace gas sampling device
to be applied to a variety of research projects in environmental sciences,
biology, geology and chemistry. It will be housed, together with existing ICP-MS
and elemental analyzer instruments, in a newly renovated biogeochemistry
facility. It will provide an important regional capability, presently lacking,
for environmental research in the Great Lakes region, with a strong emphasis on
lacustrine studies, both of the Great Lakes and elsewhere. The new
instrumentation offers undergraduate and graduate students, as well as faculty
and research staff, hands-on training in analytical techniques as well as access
to research-grade instrumentation for research projects. This proposal is
supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF.&lt;br/&gt; ***&lt;br/&gt;
