The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to acquire
instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of oceanographic
data. This proposal from University of Rhode Island requests funding for
equipment that will be used to support NSF-funded research cruises aboard the
R/V ENDEAVOR, a 177 foot vessel that is owned by NSF and operated by the
University.
