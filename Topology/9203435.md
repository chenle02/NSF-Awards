Essential laminations are a recently defined generalization of both the
incompressible surface and the codimension-one foliation without Reeb components
of a compact 3-manifold. Both of these more classical objects have proved
remarkably useful in obtaining geometric/topological information about
3-manifolds from homotopy-theoretic data, and the essential lamination has
already begun to show itself to be a worthy successor to both of its `parents.'
The investigator intends to use essential laminations to study the extent to
which the fundamental group of a 3-manifold determines the manifold up to
homeomorphism, and also to study the question of whether or not the manifold
admits a hyperbolic structure. He further intends to use the existence of normal
forms for essential laminations to study the question of whether or not a
3-manifold (principally a hyperbolic 3-manifold) contains an essential
lamination. It is a surprising fact that although we live in a three dimensional
space, a so-called 3-manifold, and so are blessed with a natural intuition about
such geometric objects, in the end this does not carry us as far as we might
have expected, for questions which have been settled by algebraic calculations
for higher dimensional manifolds still remain baffling in the 3-dimensional
case. The most famous of these is the celebrated conjecture of Poincare from
around the turn of the century concerning 3- dimensional spheres, where
precisely the original 3-dimensional case is the only one still open. The
investigator is pursuing a variety of questions about 3-dimensional manifolds,
some with slightly strange notions of distance on them, so-called hyperbolic
metrics, but time and time again these questions have been shown to have clear
relevance to the case of manifolds with a more familiar notion of distance.
