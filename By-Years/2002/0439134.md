In this SGER award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of
the Chemistry Division, Prof. Yanching "Jerry" Jean of the University of
Missouri - Kansas City and Prof. David M. Schraeder of Marquette University will
conduct research to develop a very intense source of slow positrons for
conducting unusual chemical research with these exotic particles. The device
would be based upon a LINAC that is currently available at Argonne National
Laboratory. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a postron source
that has sufficient intensity that would allow unique chemistry to be pursued:
ranging from its use as a unique ionization source to its use as a means of
synthesizing anti-matter-containing molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
will also contribute to the education and training of a post-doctoral fellow in
this unusual area of research.&lt;br/&gt;
