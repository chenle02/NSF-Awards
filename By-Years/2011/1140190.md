This award is funded under NSF's Science, Engineering, and Education for
Sustainability (SEES) activities, which aim to address the challenges of
creating a sustainable world. This Research Coordination Network (RCN)
sustainable energy project brings together a multidisciplinary team including
U.S. academics from Arizona State University, Northeastern University,
University of Michigan and Rochester Institute of Technology , together with
academics from Cardiff University (U.K) and Mountains of the Moon and Makerere
Universities (Uganda) as well as researchers at the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and the US Army Corps of Engineers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on concepts of strong and weak ties, the network
will build ties among stakeholders for sustainable energy systems with subgroups
focused on 1) innovations in energy technologies, 2) sustainability implications
of manufacture, use and end-of-life at scale, and 3) energy and human
development. Ties between and within groups will be developed through
industrial, government and developing country residencies through which graduate
students acquire tacit knowledge necessary to bridge various stages of the
innovation system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops knowledge and the
human capital necessary for sustainable energy systems as well as mechanisms for
interdisciplinary training necessary in a variety of technical domains.
