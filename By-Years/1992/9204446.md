This award provides one-half the funding needed to acquire a modern image
analysis system to be installed and operated in the Department of Geological
Sciences at the University of Oregon. The University is committed to providing
the remaining funds necessary for this acquisition. Interpretation of the
textures of igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks in order to better
understand the processes which formed them requires the application of recently
developed quantitative image analysis techniques.
