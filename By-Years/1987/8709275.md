This proposal is concerned with the thermal aspects of material cutting using
abrasive water jets. This cutting technique holds high promise of becoming a
viable alternative to oxyfuel and plasma torches, lasers, saws, and diamond
wires. The proposed work will identify the temperature field induced in the
workpiece by the cutting operation. Another objective of the work is to examine
the response of the cutting efficiency to external heating or cooling of the
workpiece.
