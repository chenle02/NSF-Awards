0964591&lt;br/&gt;Ryan Gray&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is in partial
support of the 2010 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) entitled "2010
Environmental Sciences: Water," to be held June 20-25, 2010. The agenda
encompasses topics central to environmental engineering and sustainability,
including water reuse, fate of pollutants in aqueous environments, emerging
pathogens, water quality, and green chemistry and engineering. The conference
will advance discovery while promoting teaching, training, and learning by
offering a platform for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to
present their research and participate fully in the conference activities. The
conference promotes broad participation from a diverse background, both through
speaker selection and special GRC funding mechanisms that target
underrepresented groups.
