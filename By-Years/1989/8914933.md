Software for generating the higher transcendental functions of mathematical
physics is in constant demand. This research aims to close some of the more
important gaps, particularly for functions having complex arguments and real or
complex parameters. New general methods will be developed to take advantage of
parallel and vector methods of computation. Special attention will be paid to
Bessel functions of complex order.
