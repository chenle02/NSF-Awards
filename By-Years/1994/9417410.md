9417410 Boucot The aim of this research is to increase biogeographic refinement
that will allow advances in understanding of global biogeography, paleogeography
and plate tectonic relations for the relatively poorly constrained time interval
from the Middle Ordovician to the Middle Devonian. Work involves preparation and
study of a very large number of samples already collected from diverse parts of
the world; included will be photography, identification, and comparative
analysis of brachiopod collections from Vietnam, NW China, Iran, New York, Peru
and Nova Scotia. Work includes collaboration with co-workers in the U.S. and
Asia. The project is part of a long term effort to compile a survey of
climatically sensitive sediment data for most of the Phanerozoic, in order to
delineate climatic zones of the past in more reliable detail.
