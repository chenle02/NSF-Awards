This project is developing instructional materials including print and video,
laboratory materials, and faculty guides to be used in the education of
environmental technicians. The project is being carried out in cooperation with
the Partnership for Environmental Technology Education (PETE) and Van Nostrand
Reinhold Publishers. The material to be generated covers eight content areas:
(1) Introduction to Environmental Technology; (2) Waster Generation, Reduction,
Treatment, and Prevention; (3) Basics of Toxicology; (4) Basics of Industrial
Hygiene; (5) Site Characterization, Sampling, and Field Analysis; (6)
Environmental and Hazardous Materials Regulations; (7) Contingency Planning and
Reporting for Emergency Response; and (8) Safety and Emergency Response. The
primary audiences for the modules are two-year community and technical college
students throughout the United States. Linkages are being established, however,
which will make Preserving The Legacy accessible to secondary school students,
as well as students attending four-year colleges and universities.
