Lubrication theory has been one of the most successful and widely used theories
in all of engineering and applied science. However, in a wide range of
conditions applicable to many researchers in microelectromechanical systems
(MEMS), experimental results seem to indicate that forces separating squeezing
surfaces vary according to film thickness to the power minus one, rather than
minus three, as lubrication theory requires. Hydrodynamic forces arise
incidentally, and are usually the largest source of parasitic losses. The
motivation of this research is thus to resolve the contradiction between
experimental results and theoretical predictions concerning squeeze film
dampers. The objective is to develop an improved theory of hydrodynamic
lubrication at the microscale. These goals have important implications in the
design of MEMS devices. A combined experimental and theoretical/modeling
approach will be followed. The damping coefficient will be directly determined
as opposed to indirect measurements in the existing MEMS experiments. A
theoretical framework for corrections or modifications to lubrication theory
will be proposed and tested both by experimental and numerical studies.

Employing active MEMS for actuation and sensing in a liquid environment has
potential applications in many technologies of industry and medicine. However,
the current lack of understanding of lubrication in microscale systems hinders
the development of liquid immersed MEMS. There is a real need for developing
trusted accurate verified models liquid damping in microscale systems in order
to design reliable devices, able to perform as expected. In addition, the PI and
co-PI will outreach to K-12 students by building a portable macro scale squeeze
film test rig, as dynamically similar to the microscale research device as
possible. Bringing theory to life, K-12 students can perform simple experiments
and compare their measured effects to the microscale, by visiting the lab, or by
web interaction with laboratory results.
