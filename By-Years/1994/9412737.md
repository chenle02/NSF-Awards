9412737 Cramer This project is on research to study the design of low molecular
weight displacers for the simultaneous concentration and purification of
proteins by displacement chromatography, and will focus on the relationships
between displacer chemistry and efficacy for protein displacement. Included in
this project are experiments with defined protein mixtures to examine the
effects of the polymer synthesis of displacers on dynamic affinity. The effects
of induced salt gradients on the ability to concentrate will also be studied. A
major issue will be to determine how to design for sufficient affinity while not
producing inordinately high induced salt gradients. Also, operational issues
such as ease of removal from contaminated zones and column regeneration will be
examined. Finally, experiments will test the ability of the displacers developed
in this research to purify proteins from complex biological mixtures. The long
term goal is to facilitate the implementation of this new technology for
industrial bioseparations. ***
