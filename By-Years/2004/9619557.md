Dr. Donald R. Bobbitt and other members of the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry at the University of Arkansas are being supported to continue a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period
1997-99, ten undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively
engaged in basic research projects drawn from the traditional areas of chemistry
and biochemistry. In addition, special sessions are offered for study of
scientific ethics. Field trips are scheduled to industrial and governmental
research laboratories. Students present their research at a meeting with the
department and are supported to attend a regional or national professional
meeting. Participants are recruited from the region, broadly defined.
