The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in the development of
a transformative carbon dioxide sequestration technology that can convert carbon
dioxide and water directly into gasoline fuels with unprecedented efficiency,
with sunlight as the only energy input. The technology is based on earth
abundant metals as photo-catalysts, is environment- friendly, and potentially
can be used to mass-produce gasoline fuels at very low-cost. The ability to
convert carbon dioxide into useful renewable energy source will not only
decrease the carbon footprint but also transform the current energy
infrastructure and reduce our country's energy dependence on fossil
fuels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer
(STTR) Phase I project is focused on developing a nano-enabled plasmonic
photosynthesis technology for converting carbon dioxide into gasoline fuels in
the presence of solar radiation. Preliminary laboratory scale experiments have
demonstrated a solar-to-chemicals peak conversion efficiency of 8 to 10%. The
proposal focuses on designing and building a bench-top semi-batch reactor to
demonstrate the technical feasibility of the process and assess its technical
and commercial potential for future scale up.
