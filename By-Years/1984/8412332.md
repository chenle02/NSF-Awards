This project examines the transport of polymer chains within porous media
focusing on systems where the mean chain dimension is comparable to or exceeds
the pore size. A solution of high molecular weight polymer is forced by pressure
through microporous membranes; polymer is larger than the pores and hence will
not pass through the membrane at low throughputs. However, at higher solvent
flowrates the polymer chains can deform and some of them will enter the pores.
The dependence of polymer rejection on solvent flow rate will be measured and
these results will be correlated with molecular properties of the polymer.
Successful completion of this work may contribute to an understanding of the
deformation of polymer chains in converging solvent flow fields, as well as
provide insight into separation of polymeric materials by ultrafiltration.
Additionally, adsorption of a polyelectrolyte onto the surfaces of a porous
membrane will be studied and transport rates of solvent and other small
molecules through the partially blocked pores will be measured. This work also
explores the feasibility of creating membranes, modified by adsorbed polymer,
whose permeability can be controlled by selectively changing solution
properties.
