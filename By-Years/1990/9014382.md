One of the great challenges of computer science is the development of correct
programs for real applications. The most critical real applications often
involve parallel processing, concurrency, and real time. These characteristics
render current techniques of software engineering less effective and emphasize
the need for more formal methods. Graphical Interval Logic derived from S4.3
modal logic, closely resembles the timing diagrams drawn by software engineers
and, thus, is highly intuitive and easy to use. Specifications expressed
graphically for concurrent systems can be parsed into an internal modal
representation and submitted to a theorem prover to provide rigorous
confirmation of the intended properties of a program or system design. This
project will develop an experimental implementation of Graphical Interval Logic
with its associated specification database, parser, and theorem prover, and will
investigate the application of the logic to the verification and testing of Ada
programs. The tools will be designed in consultation with industrial partners
and will be evaluated by them for use in real applications.
