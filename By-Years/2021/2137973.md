This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2). In this project, funded by the Mathematical and
Physical Sciences Directorate and housed in the Chemistry Division, Professor
Joseph Teprovich and his students at California State University Northridge
(CSUN) will perform studies that aim to improve our understanding of electrolyte
combinations so that lithium-ion batteries that are more efficient and have
longer lifetimes can be developed. Prof. Teprovich will also incorporate a new
course into the curriculum at CSUN in order to educate a diverse group of
students about the Chemistry of Energy, and he will facilitate research
experiences that are directly related to desirable career choices in STEM for
underrepresented students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Teprovich will
systematically investigate large boron-rich anions (LBRA) as alternatives for
PF6- and other common anions in electrolyte systems, with the goal of
understanding and achieving high cation translational mobility while
simultaneously reducing anion translational mobility. Two approaches, nanoionic
destabilization and anion trapping, will be used to minimize the translational
mobility of the LBRA. A plan for broadening participation is presented that is
centered around the high underrepresented minority (URM) student populations at
CSUN, which is both a Hispanic Serving Institution (HIS) and an Asian American,
Native American, Pacific Islander-Serving Institution (AANAPISI). A main feature
of the broadening participation plan is development of a summer STEM program for
local high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
