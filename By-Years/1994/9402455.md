9402455 Primack Theoretical research in cosmology and particle physics will
focus on the nature and distribution of the dark matter (DM) in the universe. A
major part of the research will involve construction and analysis of models,
currently concentrating on Cold + Hot Dark Matter (CHDM), and detailed
comparison with observational data. A closely related major subject of the
research will be the spatial distribution of dark matter in the universe as
revealed both via large-scale velocity flows and the velocity curves of spiral
galaxies. There will also be study of the origin of the density fluctuations
during inflation and the implications for large scale clustering and the cosmic
microwave background. The research to be undertaken deals with centrally
important questions about what the universe is, and how it came to be. ***
