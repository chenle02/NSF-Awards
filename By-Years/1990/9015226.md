The brain of mammals is not believed to add any more nerve cells (neurons)
after birth, although the functional connections of the nervous system may
continue to increase, and be modified by experience. There are whole populations
of identifiably different classes of cells in the nervous system, and much of
neuroscience is concerned with determining the structure and function of such
classifiable cell groups. This small pilot project will use a transgenic
biotechnology as a novel approach to see whether a one class of photoreceptor
cells in the eye can be selectively destroyed. Molecular biological techniques
will be used to produce a strain of mice containing a toxic gene linked to a
normal gene coding for a pigment molecule important in photoreception; when a
photoreceptor cell starts to make its internal pigment, the toxic gene also will
be expressed to kill the cell. Anatomical and neurophysiological data will be
used to test the efficacy of the removal. The capability of selective deletion
of specific classes of cells in the nervous system will provide a new tool for
correlating function with structure, and will have a big impact on many areas of
neuroscience and developmental biology.
