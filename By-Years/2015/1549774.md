This award supports student travel to The Sixth Annual ACM Conference on
Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH
2015). The conference is being held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania during October
25-30, 2015. SPLASH includes OOPSLA, one of the flagship ACM SIGPLAN
conferences, as well as many co-located events: Onward!, Wavefront, the Dynamic
Languages Symposium, SPLASH-E (Education), the International Conference on
Generative Programming: Concepts & Experiences, the Dynamic Languages Symposium,
Pattern Languages of Programs, SPLASH-E (Education), the International
Conference&#8232;on Software Language Engineering, Domain Specific Modeling, and
Database Programming Languages. SPLASH also includes a program of tutorials,
posters, demonstrations, a Doctoral Symposium, and an ACM SIGPLAN Student
Research Competition.

Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a
very important mission of the NSF. The funding provided enables broader student
participation, particularly women and underrepresented minorities, and those
without adequate support at their home institution. In this way the award helps
build a diverse pool of the next generation of programming language and software
engineering researchers.
