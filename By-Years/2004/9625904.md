The integrated design of aerodynamic, structural, and control systems is
essential to the development of new commercial aircraft. The validation of such
a design by numerical simulations requires solving simultaneously the
appropriately coupled fluid, structural, and control equations of motion.
Consequently, the numerical simulation of an integrated aircraft design is
computationally intensive. They propose to develop high performance
computational methodologies for addressing such challenging problems, and apply
them to the investigation of an Oblique Flying Wing (OFW) and a Corporate
Supersonic Transport (CST). The OFW is of great interest because it corresponds
to an optimum aerodynamic and structural combination, and offers speed and large
size. Moreover its control is likely to be most challenging. On the other hand,
the CST is perhaps the first civilian supersonic aircraft that will be built
after the Concorde. While the control of the CST can be expected to be less
difficult than that of the OFW, it will still demand considerable computational
resources. The proposed research is multidisciplinary and includes several
components: computational fluid dynamics, computational structural mechanics,
dynamics and active control, as well as applied mathematics, numerical analysis,
computer science, and parallel processing. The proposed research will be carried
out primarily by Dr. Pei Li, under the supervision of Professor Farhat, with the
assistance of Professors Seebass and Lawrence. The necessary training in
computational methods and parallel processing, and the needed computer resources
will be provided.
