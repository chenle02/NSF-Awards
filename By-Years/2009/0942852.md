Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing learning
modules in the area of software application development for wireless mobile
devices. The modules are being developed such that they can be incorporated into
conventional communication systems and technology courses or offered as
components of independent-study or senior design courses. The learning modules
are also incorporating active and collaborative learning strategies. The
specific goals of the project are (1) to develop a wireless application library
for cellular phones where each application can serve as a template for students
to develop their own projects, (2) to develop associated learning modules to
teach students the process of developing, compiling, and embedding applications
in cellular phones, and (3) to develop cellular phone applications that allow
students to explore a variety of fundamental communications and signal
processing principles, including convolution and the fast Fourier transform. The
project is also developing a cellular phone application that enables students to
use cellular phones, rather than single purpose clickers, as part of a classroom
response system. The wireless application library and associated learning
modules are being made available for free download from the project's website.
The project includes formative and summative evaluation plans for all aspects of
the project coordinated by an independent evaluator.
