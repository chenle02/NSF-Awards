The project is to derive equations of motion for multi-phase fluid flows using
various levels of course-graining on the microscopic dynamics and thereby obtain
dynamically consistent and useful descriptions of the macroscopic flow behavior.
The results will be implemented in high resolution computer codes for the
description of these multiphase flows. The coarse-graining methods to be
employed are projection operator methods, nonlinear response techniques, and the
renormalization group method. Specific applications will be given to bubbly and
annular flows in Phase I. A systematic scheme of numerical studies will be
explored in Phase II. Problems of multi-phase flows appear widely in engineering
problems. Proper formulations, coupled with efficient numerical flow software,
will have much impact on commercial activities.
