The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry
and the Atmospheric Chemistry program of the Division of Atmospheric and
Geospace Sciences will support the research program of Prof. Joel Thornton of
the University of Washington. Professor Thornton and his students will study the
reactivity of N2O5 in small aerosol particles and how it depends upon particle
size and morphology when moderately soluble organic carbonaceous material is
mixed with inorganic salts in aqueous solution droplets. N2O5 reacts primarily
on liquid or solid particles suspended in air (aerosol particles) that range in
size from 10 nanometers to 1 micrometer. Understanding chemical reactivity in
such small spatial domains is of fundamental importance beyond interpreting
atmospheric composition. The study will make use of state of the art mass
spectrometry and particle sizing instruments, and involve collaboration with
researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
(PNNL).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will improve our
understanding of the fundamental length scales of chemical reactions, of
interest generally to the physical and environmental chemistry communities, and
provide reaction rate measurements on atmospherically relevant particles. The
latter is critical for developing robust parameterizations of gas-particle
reactions for use in air quality and coupled chemistry-climate models that
ultimately inform regulatory policy. The project will provide excellent training
opportunities to students, including to members of under-represented groups, who
wish to pursue a professional scientific career in an area of great societal
importance.
