This award provides funds to help purchase equipment which will enhance the
ability of the Department of Sociology at the University of Maine to provide its
undergraduates with practical experience in modern methods of accessing and
analyzing social science data. The funds will be used to purchase a 9-track
magnetic tape reader, 5 large microcomputers, software which will network the
computers, and a printer and plotter for output. The equipment will be used in
two courses, Practicum in Sociological Research, and Population and Society,
both of which require students to complete projects which involve analyzing
census and survey data. The project is significant in providing a bridge between
traditional mainframe sources and the ease and flexibility of microcomputers,
and in the use of command files within statistical packages as templates in
guiding students to independent use of social statistics. The grantee is
matching this award with non-Federal sources.
