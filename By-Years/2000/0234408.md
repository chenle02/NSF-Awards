WGBH is conducting preliminary work on an untested and novel idea for a new
multimedia project, EGames. The target audience for the project is children ages
9-12. The project envisions a 13-part television series which combines the
appeal of a game show with the drama of real-world challenges to engender
enthusiasm and promote understanding of engineering in kids nationwide. The
television programs will be complemented with materials and training for
engineers to mount EGames events in public venues and run workshops in schools,
afterschool programs and libraries, and an extensive companion
website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the research phase, WGBH will convene a
Content Advisory Board which would include professional engineers, curriculum
developers, classroom teachers, professors of engineering and informal
educators, and a Funding Advisory Board. They will also write the series
curriculum, design the game, develop outreach, Web, and evaluation plans, and
develop and test a sample engineering challenge with a group of contestants to
work out logistic and production questions. This will inform the next stage of
project development.
