This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to assist in the expedited
analysis of and the creation of a long term storage plan for the archaeological
artifacts and associated data collected from the Village of Wales in 2003-2005.
This project will ensure the proper disposition of these materials a long term
storage plan and the ultimate repatriation of the artifacts to their owner, the
Village of Wales. Without this funding the very important Wales collection and
data are in limbo and at risk.
