The purpose of this project is to develop teaching materials that will allow
high school teachers to introduce various concepts from dynamical systems theory
and fractal geometry into the high school curriculum. The project will include
the development of approximately fifteen modules, each dealing with a single
topic from fractal geometry or dynamical systems. Some modules will be able to
be used independently; some will be developed to be used in a sequence of
successive class sessions. Each module will contain background materials,
preliminary student worksheets, a short video, and suggested followup
activities. Specific materials to be developed include videotapes, software,
Hypercard stacks, worksheets, and teacher guides. The aim is to help teachers
show students the vitality of modern mathematics with material that complements
and enhances the standard high school curriculum. Also planned is a two-week
Summer Institute to train teachers to bring these ideas from modern mathematics
into their classrooms.
