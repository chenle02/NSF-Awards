An "International Conference on Cycles in Graphs" will be held at Vanderbilt
University in Nashville, Tennessee from Wednesday, May 30th to Saturday, June
2nd, 2012. Graphs are abstract mathematical models of networks, and graph theory
forms an essential part of the theoretical background for much of our modern
information infrastructure, and for many modern methods of optimizing activities
such as scheduling and transportation. Cycle problems appear in many places,
including in questions of great practical importance such as the Traveling
Salesman Problem. Cycles are a fundamental topic in graph theory, and this topic
has many subareas, including conditions for hamilton cycles and their
generalizations; pancyclicity; circumference; cycle decompositions; cycles in
graphs with algebraic structure; cycle double covers; weighted cycle problems;
cycles in random, sparse or dense graphs; and cycle spaces. Recently there have
been significant advances in a number of these subareas, and it appears to be an
opportune time to gather together workers in this area to share ideas. This
conference should allow participants to review recent progress on important open
problems, determine the best directions for further work, and discuss possible
new avenues of investigation. The conference will be held in conjunction with
the annual Shanks Lectures hosted by the Department of Mathematics at Vanderbilt
University. The Shanks Lecturer will be Daniela Kuehn of the University of
Birmingham, in the United Kingdom, who will give two fifty-minute talks as part
of the conference. There will be six additional principal speakers, each giving
one fifty-minute talk, namely Alan Frieze (Carnegie Mellon University), Penny
Haxell (University of Waterloo, Canada), Deryk Osthus (University of Birmingham,
UK), Kenta Ozeki (National Institute of Informatics, Japan), Paul Seymour
(Princeton University) and Xingxing Yu (Georgia Institute of Technology). Other
participants will give contributed talks of twenty to twenty-five minutes. We
anticipate about 120 participants, and about 80 to 90 contributed talks,
arranged in two or three parallel sessions. The local organizers are Mark
Ellingham and Paul Edelman of Vanderbilt University. More detailed information
about the conference may be obtained from the web site,

by principal speakers and other participants, particularly targeting those
without other sources of federal support, early career researchers, women,
disabled persons and minorities.
