Abstract CTS-9500409 Miles &amp; Lempert Princeton University A high power, 10
Hz repetition rate, flashlamp-pumped dye laser system will be purchased to serve
as the optical source for advanced optical diagnostics. A variety of fluid
mechanics experiments will use this equipment, including measurements of
velocity profiles in electrogydrodynamic flows, the use of Raman-based
interrogation schemes for flow tagging in air, measurements of vortex breakdown
in a cylinder and fundamental turbulence measurements. The research programs of
five faculty members will benefit from this equipment.
