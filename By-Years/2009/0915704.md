Distributed applications that require enforcement of fundamental authorization
policies play an increasingly important role in internet and telecommunications
infrastructure. Traditionally, controls are imposed before shared resources are
accessed to ensure that authorization policies are respected. Recently, there
has been great interest in the exploration of accountability mechanisms that
rely on after-the-fact verification. In this approach, audit logs record vital
systems information and an auditor uses these logs to identify dishonest
principals and assign blame when there has been a violation of security policy.
Accountability is an important tool to achieve practical security that should be
viewed as a first-class design goal of services in federated distributed
systems.

The goals of this project are to provide a theoretical basis for the design and
analysis of accountability mechanisms and to use the theory to develop language
based techniques for statically validating auditors and accountability
appliances. This proposal investigates operational (via game-based models) and
logical (via game logics) foundations for accountability to provide the
theoretical basis for the design and analysis of accountability mechanisms.

The project will bring our understanding of accountability closer to the level
of before-the-fact access-control mechanisms, which benefit from well understood
operational models and logics and therefore support language-based methods that
statically validate implementations against interfaces which specify security
guarantees.

Accountability supplements purely technology-based approaches to security with
insights derived from the interplay between people and technology. This project
aims to develop new models, logics, algorithms, and theories for analyzing and
reasoning about accountability-based approaches to trustworthiness.
