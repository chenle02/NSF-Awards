For many physical phenomena dissipation of energy effects are very small and
ignoring them could provide a good approximation. Such phenomena include large
scale water waves in the ocean, the plasmas in space and controlled fusion
devices, dynamics of stars and galaxies in astrophysics. The dynamical behavior
of mathematical models of these phenomena is complex and includes formation of
coherent structures, such as tsunamis in the ocean, rotating stars (e.g. Sun)
and the observed galaxy structures, to name a few. One of the objectives of this
project is to contribute to the understanding of the formation and persistence
of such coherent structures observed in experiments and in nature. Another topic
is to understand and control the instability in many applications. One such
example is to control the instability of plasmas in fusion devices to achieve
the goal of controlled nuclear fusion for energy production. Another example is
the instability of radially rotating neutron stars, which is related to the
detection of gravitational waves. Methods of mathematical analysis are the
primary tools employed in this investigation. The rigorous mathematics makes it
feasible to do stable numerical computations and to better understand the
phenomena found in numerical and experimental studies. The project will
incorporate research of students from graduate through postdoctoral levels thus
providing for a vigorous mentoring program.

Many conservative models have Hamiltonian structures. One goal of this proposal
is to find an instability index formula for Hamiltonian PDEs with an indefinite
energy functional, including gravity water waves, ion acoustic wave equations
and Vlasov models for collisionless plasmas. The second goal is to find
stability criteria (particularly turning point principles) for several stellar
models including rotating and magnetic stars, neutron stars and relativistic
galaxies. The third goal is to understand the long-time dynamics near linearly
stable Bernstein?Greene?Kruskal (BGK) waves for the one-dimensional Vlasov-
Poisson equation.
