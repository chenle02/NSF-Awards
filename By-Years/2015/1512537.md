Abstract Choi, Jong Hyun 1512537

The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel super-resolution scheme capable
of simultaneous imaging in the visible and near-infrared range, and to use it
for studying synthetic DNA walkers. DNA walkers are a class of nucleic acid and
nanomachines that exhibit directional motion along a linear track. The proposed
imaging strategy will be explored as a super-resolved bioanalytical platform to
study single DNA motors.

Current sub-diffraction imaging methods uses a spectral range up to ~900 nm,
thus failing to exploit 0.9-1.4 micron window, the so-called near-infrared IIa
(NIR-IIa) biological window where the photon penetration depth into biological
substances is the greatest due to minimal scattering and autofluorescence. The
ability to use this spectral window would open up new opportunities to obtain
and transfer the information about thick biological materials. Multicolor sub-
diffraction imaging will visualize a DNA walker that transports inorganic cargo
particles (e.g. CdTe/CdS core-shell nanocrystal quantum dots) along a carbon
nanotube track. The visible fluorescence emission of the nanoparticles will be
used to locate the DNA walkers along the immobilized individual carbon nanotubes
that fluoresce in the NIR-II range. The proposed program will couple the
research efforts with educational and outreach activities designed to advance
the public understanding of biophotonics. The effort includes active involvement
of undergraduate students in multidisciplinary research. They will actively
recruit female and underrepresented students at individual and institutional
levels via collaboration with Women in Engineering and Minority Engineering
Programs at Purdue University.
