The Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach is one of the leading
mathematical research centres worldwide. This grant supports the participation
of additional young people from the US at Oberwolfach activities. These young
researchers are called "US Junior Oberwolfach Fellow". The funding is for 92
fellowships, on average 2 junior scientists per week, who are postdocs or
graduate students from the US. Candidates can apply (again, the NSF grant will
be made public on our homepage) or will be suggested by the organizers. The
final decision about participation will be made by the director after advice by
the organizers. There is support for board, lodging and facilities (computers,
library).
