The two principal investigators, Richard Durrett and Simon Levin, bring to this
Small Grants for Exploratory Research project expertise in stochastic processes
(mathematics) and ecology (biology). They will apply ideas from the theory of
interacting particle systems to study the spread and persistence of invading
species and the role of dispersal in the dynamics of populations and
communities. Concrete problems include (i) the effect of environmental
inhomogeneity on the spread of raccoon rabies (ii) epidemics in spatially
distributed populations, and (iii) a spatial version of Maynard Smith's
evolutionary game. These applications will require the development of some new
theory, e.g. methods for estimating critical values, since interacting particle
systems have not yet been applied to real data.
