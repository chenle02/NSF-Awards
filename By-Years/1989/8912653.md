Geological and geophysical studies of the upper oceanic crust and corresponding
components of ophiolite complexes indicate that significant heterogeneities
exist in this region on scales of a few kilometers to a few centimeters. This
project is a detailed geological study of major submarine fault scarps at the
Hess Deep using ALVIN in order to elucidate the petrological and structural
complexities of the upper oceanic crust. The Hess Deep exposes basaltic and
plutonic rocks on the face of a major fault scarp with average slope greater
than 60 degrees and vertical relief of greater than 2 km. This window into the
oceanic crust was created at the Galapagos Ridge propagated westward into normal
one million-year-old crust of the east flank of the East Pacific Rise. Because
this escarpment is parallel to a seafloor spreading flow-line, faults and
volcanic structures that are responsible for abyssal hill topography, the most
pervasive landwill produce a more realistic view of the lateral and vertical
heterogeneity of the East Pacific crust.
