The investigation proposed here has as its main objective the design, analysis,
and testing of the so called projected Newton methods in computational
optimization, with a special emphasis on the application of these methods to
optimal control problems. Two kinds of problems are considered: disrete-time
dynamical optimization problems and continuous time problems. It seems likely
that the results of this research may be also applicable to other large-scale
structured nonlinear optimization problems. The projected Newton method
algorithms converge more rapidly than the standard first order, i.e. gradient
based methods, yet the associated per iteration computational costs are still
only proportional to n, where n is the number of subintervals of the time
interval under consideration. A sizeable portion of the per iteration work can
be organized for parallel computation. This research belongs to computational
methods in optimization and control. Problems of this type arise in many
applications, typically in optimization of trajectories for space vehicles and
in calculations of optimal programs for control computers for various industrial
processes.
