This Research Initiation Award is for theoretical and experimental research in
visual tracking of non-rigid 3-D motion. Images of left-ventricle heart data
will be used to test theories of 3-D image analysis using local curvature
changes to fit analytic surface models. Application domains include radar,
sonar, X-ray tomography, cineangiography, and magnetic resonance imaging, as
well as human face recognition and studies of material deformation.
