This proposal is a request for travel and registration assistance for
participants from universities and non-profit research institutions. Travel and
conferences registration expenses have been estimated ranging from $850 to
$2400. The primary aim of this conference on organic thin films is to allow
scientists and engineers from industry, universities, and government to present
their most recent research findings, and exchange ideas. Organic thin films is a
broad field, including such diverse areas as cell membranes, structural
variability of organic molecules, and molecular assembly methods such self-
assembly and Langmuir-Blodgett films.
