Belmont College will improve and enhance the laboratory instruction provided
students in a modern physics course. The students enrolled in this course are
physics majors and minors, pre-engineering majors, chemistry majors, and
mathematics majors. The project will increase the number and level of
sophistication of the experiments conducted in this course. Students will be
given greater opportunity for "hands-on" experiences with the concepts and
phenomena of modern physics. Equipment items to be purchased include an
alpha/beta spectrometer, an X-ray spectrometer, and an electron spin resonance
probe. Experiments that explore alpha particle energy spectra, beta particle
energies, ESR phenomena, and Zeeman effect studies will be added to the course.
Students will have a better understanding and appreciation of the relationship
of theory and experiment. The result will be a more balanced presentation of the
concepts and phenomena of modern physics.
