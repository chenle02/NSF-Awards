9514238 Vaccarino The early embryonic stages of brain development in mammmals
are regulated by the influence of growth factors which stimulate neuroblasts,
the source of nerve cells, to proliferate in a coordinated manner. While the
presence of this control is well established, the mode of action of these growth
factors is not well undertood. The objective of this proposal is to explore the
distribution of the molecular receptors for these growth factors on neuroblasts.
Experimental administration of specific growth factors by microinjection will be
used to examine effects on the proliferation and death of neuroblasts. Parallel
studies will be performed on neuroblasts maintained in cell culture. The results
of these experiments will enhance our understanding of how the cerebral cortex
develops.
