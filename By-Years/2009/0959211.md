This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from the NSF MRI-R2 program were
awarded to the University of Mississippi Medical Center to support the purchase
of an Aviv AU-FDS Fluorescence Detection System. The new system is used to
perform hydrodynamic, thermodynamic and macromolecular interaction studies on a
wide range of cutting-edge biophysical projects by six major users. Projects
include investigations of the interaction of proteins that regulate microtubule
assembly, the aggregation of biologically important peptides, self association
properties of kinesin molecular motor domains, self association of Hfq and its
binding to sRNA and mRNA targets, aggregation properties of thermally responsive
elastin-like polypeptide (ELP), and assembly properties of coilin, including its
cellular size distribution. These projects will also result in the development
of advanced Analytical Ultracentrifuge (AUC) methods and software. The Aviv
Fluorescence Detection System brings capabilities to the AUC Facility that
greatly enhance the kinds of studies and applications utilized by researchers.
The projects enabled by the new equipment also greatly benefit and impact the
students and post doctoral fellows involved in those projects by exposing them
to state-of-the-art biophysical techniques. Investigators at UMMC are involved
in several programs designed to encourage outreach and diversity in science.
These include MARC (Minority Access to Research Careers), MFGN (Mississippi
Functional Genomics Network), and the Base Pair Program for high school students
in Jackson. In addition, undergraduates participate in summer research at UMMC
supported by grant funds or SURE monies. The impact of the new equipment on
projects at UMMC and throughout the state is further enhanced by the presence of
the Mississippi Biophysical Consortium (MBC). Results of the research projects
enabled by the AU-FDS system will be disseminated in peer-reviewed scientific
journals, and by student and faculty presentations at regional and national
meetings.
