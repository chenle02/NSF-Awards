Abstract The Texas Southern University project is developing an effective
pedagogy for incorporating interactive virtual and remote laboratories into
engineering and technology education at the undergraduate level. The full
development of such a framework will ultimately have an impact across all STEM
disciplines; a principal outcome being the enhancement of integration of
research and education. A target goal of the project is its potential to effect
increase in the recruitment, enrollment, retention and graduation of under-
represented populations from engineering, information technology, computer
science, and computing-related programs. The effort is expected to have a long-
term impact through the establishment of a sustainable inter-institutional
infrastructure to implement effective utilization of the developed remotely
accessible laboratory frame. The successful development of a virtual and
remotely accessible laboratory will set up a model for other departments, such
as the Industrial Engineering Technology and Transportation Studies departments,
as well as for other institutions. Hands-on education in these virtual lab
facilities will enhance the training students need to be prepared for the
engineering and technology workforce and for graduate school.
