In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Howard Reiss of the Department of Chemistry of the University of California, Los
Angeles will study the molecular theory of vapor phase nucleation and related
topics. This research comprises three related projects:(1) The molecular theory
of vapor phase nucleation, aimed at the prediction of nucleation rates for
Argon. (2) The length scale for configurational entropy for microemulsions and
nucleation will be studied and scaling laws will be formulated.(3) Thermodynamic
properties of hard particle systems using the available space function. The
formulation of a coherent and consistent theory of nucleation has important
consequences for many practical applications to atmospheric science, to
microemulsions, polymers and other colloidal systems. Prof. Reiss has been one
of the leaders in this field and his proposed work will be of equal importance.
