Abstract

Award: DMS-9971914 Principal Investigator: Jonathan Weitsman

The work in symplectic geometry on which this proposal focuses is divided
roughly into two overlapping areas. The first set of problems is focused on
developing a better understanding of symplectic manifolds, and in particular on
the topology and geometry of symplectic manifolds equipped with group actions.
The past five years have seen a significant increase of the role of the
symplectic category in topology and geometry, as well as a better understanding
of the analogies and differences between symplectic geometry and Kahler
geometry. In this proposal we propose to develop tools for the study of
Hamiltonian and symplectic group actions, as well as of the topology and
geometry of symplectic quotients. The second set of problems we are concerned
with is the application of ideas from symplectic geometry to problems arising in
other areas of mathematics and mathematical physics. These problems are largely
motivated by the applications of quantum field theory to geometry and topology,
many of which either involve symplectic geometry directly or else involve areas
where symplectic geometry can help to provide a better view of the geometrical
structure that must underlie these still-mysterious methods arising from
physics.

The areas of mathematics involved---symplectic geometry and mathematical physics
---are areas which have their historical origins in the physical sciences. As
such, they have had a long record of gaining insight from problems arising in
the natural sciences, as well as of making significant contributions to applied
problems. This record is one attained mostly by the whole field over decades,
rather than by individual contributions over the short term. But to the extent
that a long and consistent past record can be used as an indication of the
future, there are excellent prospects that current work in these areas of core
mathematics will provide indispensible building blocks for scientific and
technological advances in the decades to come.
