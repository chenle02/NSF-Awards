Abstract Proposal: CNS 0454416 PI: Sirisha Medidi Institution: Washington State
University Program: NSF 04-588 CISE Computing Research Infrastructure Title:
CRI: Secure Wireless Ad-hoc Networking and Sensor Networking Systems

Investigators at Washington State University will acquire laboratory equipment
for sensor networking research. They will establish a laboratory with an-hoc
network capabilities consisting of several wireless enabled computers and
personal digital assistants (PDAs), and a sensor network of 50 motes. The PI's
will conduct experimental research on topics such as: (i) detecting misbehavior
in ad-hoc networks, (ii) identifying and isolating malicious nodes in ad-hoc
networks, (iii) distinguishing congestion from misbehavior in ad-hoc networks,
(iv) quality of service routing in ad-hoc networks, (v) secure routing in ad-hoc
networks, (vi) energy-efficient information dissemination in sensor networks,
and (vii) receiver initiated MAC for sensor networks. The infrastructure will
allow them to do performance testing and validation of their research in a
realistic testbed. Broader impacts of the research include addressing the
growing applications of sensor networks in research and societal applications.
The facilities will be available for education and course work, including
courses that Washington State University offers jointly with the nearby
University of Idaho in Moscow, ID.
