People's perception of another's race can affect their interaction
significantly. Dr. Yuichi Shoda of the University of Washington and his
colleagues have evidence that this perception of race tends to be categorical.
That is, people perceive "race" as White, Black, Asian, etc. but not as a
continuum of variations. The issue of race has become quite salient during the
2008 U.S. Presidential elections. The Democratic candidate, Barack Obama, has
been characterized by the media as both Black and as "mixed race" or "multi-
racial" in that his mother is of European descent and his father is of African
descent. It is possible that these portrayals and increased familiarity with
Obama could potentially influence people's perception of race. Dr. Shoda and his
team hypothesize that over the next four months, perceptions of racial
categories may change in one of two ways: (1) people who see Obama as
multiracial will further expand their racial category repertoire and shift away
from black-white dichotomous categories toward a more continuous black-mixed-
white continuum; and (2) people who see Obama as Black may shift their
definitions of who is Black to include less Afrocentric (i.e., "Whiter") mixed-
race individuals. Using an implicit categorization task reflecting patterns of
errors in person recognition, these hypotheses will be tested, tracking the
possible change in people's race perception during the 2008 election. The
proposed research also provides a unique opportunity for assessing people's
intuitive assumptions about race, as well as a new method for examining the
processes through which people intuitively categorize other people.
