This study is a twelve month effort to examine the implications of school-based
management (SMB) on science and math education. The final report is intended for
use by school system personnel throughout the country and other educators. It
will provide findings and recommendations for systems considering, or in the
process of implementing, some form of SBM. The study will examine approximately
18 school systems, ones that have had at least one year of experience with SBM.
(Six will be examine on-site and twelve by extensive telephone interviewing.)
The study will focus on grades 7-12 to separate out SBM's science and math
implications from that of other subjects. It will use in- person interviews,
focus groups, semi-structured questionnaires, and an examination of
documentation from these schools. Using qualitative evaluation procedures, the
study will analyze such elements as: Extent of actual implementation, effects on
science and math educational practices, problems found, actions to alleviate
problems and extent of alleviation, factors associated with successful
implementation of SBM, and initial perceptions of effects on student learning
and interest in science and math.
