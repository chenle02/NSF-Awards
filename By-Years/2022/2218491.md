This project includes environmental chamber observations of multiphase smoke
chemistry and the interactions of smoke with clouds. There currently exists an
observational gap between laboratory experiments and field observations with
regard to smoke plume chemistry. Substantial uncertainties remain with regards
to how smoke plumes age and evolve and how aerosols emitted and produced during
the evolution of smoke plumes interact with our climate. Understanding how smoke
interacts with sunlight and with clouds is a critical part of making accurate
climate projections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four primary objectives to
this proposed work: (1) quantify dry aging and cloud processing effects on
secondary organic aerosol formation and light absorption within smoke samples;
(2) quantify these effects on smoke aerosol water uptake and semi-solid or
liquid phase transition; (3) train and mentor 12 diverse undergraduate students;
and (4) mentor and train a postdoctoral fellow teach at a primarily
undergraduate institution (PUI). Most of the experiments will be conducted in
the Chambre de Simulation Atmosphérique Multiphasique (CESAM) at the Université
Paris Est – Créteil (UPEC) in France. They are expected to fill a gap in the
current understanding of smoke aging and cloud interactions, particularly with
regard to brown carbon and differences between chamber and field observation
data. This research involves whole-smoke and fractional smoke experiments that
include secondary organic aerosol dry aging, cloud processing, and pyrocumulus
cloud processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort includes a large number of
undergraduate student researchers and provides them with substantial laboratory
and international research experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
