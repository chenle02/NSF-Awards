This is a proposal to purchase a graphite furnace atomic absorption
spectrophomtometer (GFAAS) with Zeeman background correction. A new instrument
is needed to augment sample capacity currently handled by a P.E. Zeeman/5000.
Increased analytical demands are primarily a result of newly funded
paleochemical studies of marine carbonates which involve thousands of time
series measurements. The University of Washington has guaranteed 50% matching
funds for the acquisition of a new GFAAS facility.
