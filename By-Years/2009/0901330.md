Topological Quantum Field Theory studies maps from Riemann surfaces to targets -
algebraic stacks. Homological Mirror Symmetry allows us to look deeper into
geometry of these stacks and algebraic varieties. In particular this project
studies two main questions:

1. Rationality and unirationality of algebraic varieties. Program maximum in
this direction is understanding non-rationality of generic four dimensional
cubic and non-unirationality of generic three dimensional quartic.

2. Theory of algebraic cycles - computations of Chow and Griffiths groups,
integral and Hodge cycles. Program minimum in this direction is understanding
Bloch's conjecture for Chow groups of surfaces of general type and Griffiths
groups of so called Fano - Calabi Yau manifolds.

By now Topological Quantum Field Theory and Homological Mirror Symmetry have
been established as closed and beautiful mathematical parts of String theory.
Regardless of the success of the experiments in the high energy collider in CERN
and confirmation of String Theory as a theory of everything, one can still use
Topological Quantum Field Theory and Homological Mirror Symmetry in order to get
nice mathematical consequences. In particular one can use them to get answers of
some long standing questions in Algebraic geometry.
