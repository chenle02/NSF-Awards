Undergraduates will obtain experience in use of microcomputers for data
acquisition and analysis through the purchase of Apple Macintosh computers and
peripherals to be used to enrich laboratory exercises in Physiology. Also, new
laboratory exercises are planned for Physiology and Animal Behavior. A user-
friendly software interface (HyperCard) will lead students through experimental
exercises and facilitate student exploration of biological concepts and
processes. The university will provide 50% matching funds.
