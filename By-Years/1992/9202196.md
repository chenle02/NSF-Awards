This award provides support for an international collaborative effort to develop
and evaluate a new type of ion source for mass spectrometric analysis of
biopolymers and bioconjugates. The American collaborator is a skilled mass
spectroscopist active in use of mass spectrometry for sequence analysis of
proteins and other polymers of biological significance. The Russian
collaborators have made significant contributions in development of mass
spectrometry instrumentation. The use of mass spectrometry for detailed analysis
of biopolymers is becoming one of the most important techniques for modern
analytical biochemistry. As such, it plays an important role in all aspects of
biotechnology, from research to process development and quality control. Thus
technological advances in this area, such as those likely to result from this
award, have great potential for strengthening both basic and applied aspects of
biological research.
