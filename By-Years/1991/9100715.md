The principal investigators will study problems in complex differential
geometry and spectral geometry. Professor Greene will attempt to find
biholomorphic invariants which can be used to classify domains with noncompact
automorphism group. Professor Petersen will study the relationship between the
topology and geometry of a manifold and the spectrum of the Laplace operator.
The post doctoral associate supported by this award, S. Zhu, will study the
relationship between topology and Ricci curvature. This award will support work
in differential geometry which tries to relate global topological information to
local analytic information. The local information generally is presented in the
form of an invariant of a differential equation or system of equations. The
information is then used to classify the domain or to obtain restrictions on the
global "shape" of the set under consideration.
