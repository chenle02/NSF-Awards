Research under this ROW Research Planning grant will use the regulatory
sequences of the human immunodeficiency virus to study transcriptional
regulation and protein binding. The purpose of the research is to determine if
there is a relationship between DNA methylation and protein binding and to
understand the rate of that interaction in the regulation of gene expression.
This system is an excellent one for this study because so many of the regulatory
elements also regulate cellular genes and thus this important virus will serve
as a model system.
