This research will study the asymptotic solution of nonline- ar initial and
boundary value problems involving systems of differential equations. A
characteristic of the solutions of these equations is that they exhibit rapid
changes within thin regions. Consequently, the asymptotic methods are able to
make use of the presence of multiple scales. Of particular interest in this
research are problems involving boundary and interior layers. The work is
motivated by physical applications including models which simulate the operation
of semiconductor devices and problems arising from optimal control. Problems
will be attacked using a combined analytical and numerical approach.
