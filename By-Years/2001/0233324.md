This project will build a QoIA-aware attack resistant database&lt;br/&gt;system
framework, call Linba. The trustworthiness of a computing&lt;br/&gt;system in
delivering valid services in face of attacks has&lt;br/&gt;become a more
critical concern than ever as people are experiencing&lt;br/&gt;increased cyber
security threats. A Quality of Information&lt;br/&gt;Assurance (QoIA) service is
a service associated with a specific level&lt;br/&gt;of trustworthiness. From
the viewpoint of end users, the goal of trusted&lt;br/&gt;computing is to enable
people to get the QoIA services that they&lt;br/&gt;have subscribed for even in
face of attacks. However, (most) existing&lt;br/&gt;trusted systems cannot
deliver QoIA services since they have very limited&lt;br/&gt;ability in
providing (sustained) quantitative trustworthiness
guarantees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to build a
new trusted computing&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure that is able to continue
delivering QoIA services&lt;br/&gt;in face of attacks and cost constraints.
Based on a novel formal&lt;br/&gt;(service) trustworthiness model,
Linba&lt;br/&gt;delivers multilevel, differential, quantitative QoIA
services&lt;br/&gt;through near optimal neuro-fuzzy composite QoIA adaptations
where&lt;br/&gt;Linba intelligently adapts itself to environment changes
and&lt;br/&gt;QoIA-cost tradeoffs are done in an optimized way.
Successful&lt;br/&gt;development of Linba will arm existing trusted database
systems&lt;br/&gt;with the ability to deliver QoIA services (in a cost-
effective&lt;br/&gt;way) and provide very valuable hints on developing a variety
of other&lt;br/&gt;types of trusted computing systems that can deliver QoIA
services.&lt;br/&gt;The cost-effectiveness of Linba will be evaluated
through&lt;br/&gt;simulation or prototyping.&lt;br/&gt;
