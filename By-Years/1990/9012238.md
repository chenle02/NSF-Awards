The objective of the proposed research is the continued evaluation of high
energy, high mass ions and their effect on resolution for Fourier transform ion
cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry. During the requested funding
period, the investigator will prepare a competitive research proposal that will
incorporate laboratory experiments along the lines illustrated in the proposed
text. That is, he will critically evaluate the ion physics as revealed by the
computer simulations to design his laboratory experiments. He considers that
such an approach is essential in the development of high mass FT-ICR. He
suggests that FT-ICR can play a major role in bioanalytical mass spectrometry,
ranging from applications that require ultrahigh sensitivity to more complex
areas dealing with structure (e.g. amino acid sequence) and structure/function
relationships.
