Thompson's group F appears in varied branches of mathematics, from logic to
algebra to homotopy theory and group theory. It can be understood either as a
finitely or infinitely generated group, with a standard finite generating set.
The principal investigator proposes to remove the dependence on this generating
set by studying metric properties of the group with respect to arbitrary
generating sets. Building on previous work, she will investigate whether this
group is automatic, as well as a quasi-isometry classification for the standard
generalizations F(p) of F. The remaining work proposed under this grant concerns
twisted conjugacy classes and the Reidemeister number of a group automorphism.
If f is a selfmap of a compact manifold, then the number of twisted conjugacy
classes of the induced map on the fundamental group is called the Reidemeister
number R(f). The Reidemeister number provides an upper bound on the Nielsen
number N(f) for f, which is difficult to compu te. If the Reidemeister number is
infinite for any selfmap of the manifold, this eliminates the possibility of a
special type of theorem equating N(f) and R(f). The principal investigator
proposes to extend the classes of (fundamental) groups with this property, and
build on prior work to see when it is invariant under quasi-isometry. She will
also investigate a geometric interpretation of twisted conjugacy classes, and
the relationship of this property to subgroup separability.

The principal investigator proposes several projects in the area of geometric
group theory. This field studies fundamental mathematical objects called groups
from a geometric point of view. Symmetry groups are a typical example of
mathematical groups. The study of symmetry groups was used, for example, to
discern that the shape of DNA was a double helix. The principal investigator
studies closely one particular group, named Thompson's group after the
researcher who first defined it. Thompson's group can be understood
algebraically, geometrically and analytically, allowing one to study it from
differing viewpoints. The geometric perspective equates each group element with
a pair of "tree-like" graphs, an approach which relates this group to questions
in theoretical computer science. In this way it provides an interesting
interdisciplinary application of abstract mathematics, with direct applications
to the problem of transforming data to maximize the efficiency of some computer
search algorithms. The principal investigator proposes sev eral problems related
to understanding the geometry of this group. The remainder of her proposal
concerns several problems at the intersection of geometric group theory and
topology.
