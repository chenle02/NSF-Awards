To understand how the central nervous system is made and functions, we must
first investigate how different nerve cells are made in growing embryos and
instructed to connect up into functional circuits. The spinal cord is a powerful
system for studying these processes as it is simpler and more experimentally-
tractable than the brain. This study will use newly-generated reagents and
experimental approaches to identify the key regulatory genes that instruct cells
to grow into a particular population of spinal cord nerve cells. These nerve
cells are called V0v cells and they are part of the circuitry that regulates
locomotion. The project will use genetic and molecular approaches to answer this
question. The outcomes of this project will be widely relevant, as this type of
nerve cell exists in all vertebrates and the mechanisms and genes identified are
likely to play similar roles in other nerve cells. This project will
significantly increase our understanding of fundamental biological processes
such as how genes instruct cells to grow into particular types of cells and the
roles of specific genes in the construction of neuronal circuitry.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator will incorporate this research
into her university teaching and presentations to the general public. This
research will also contribute to the diversification of the scientific
workforce. Both women and under-represented minorities will actively participate
in the project. The Principal Investigator will also continue to perform
outreach to local city high schools and to develop teaching modules for both
9th/10th grade and advanced placement high school students. These activities aim
to significantly impact the lives of traditionally under-served Syracuse high
school students (all of these schools have been identified as Persistently Low
Achieving by New York State) and enthuse under represented minority high school
students about science and research.
