Long-term Research: Characterization of Grain Boundary Structures in
Amphibolite. This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long and
Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence. The program is designed
to enable young U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research
abroad at research institutions of proven excellence. Awards provide
opportunities for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of unique or
complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in foreign
countries. The award will support Dr. Randolph Cumbest, under the sponsorship of
Prof. G. V. Gibbs, both of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,
for a six-month visit with Prof. Alex C. McLaren, The Australian National
University, Canberra, Australia. The award recommendation provides funds to
cover, as appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad, stipend,
dependents allowance, if applicable, and a flat administrative allowance of
$250.00 for the U.S. home institution.
