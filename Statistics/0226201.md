Proposal ID: 0226201 PI: Thomas Wehrly Title: Frontiers of statistical research:
Forty years of statistics at Texas A&M University

Abstract:

This research conference, in recognition of the 40th anniversary of the
Department of Statistics at Texas A&M University, brings together leading
researchers in four theme areas of great current interest in statistical
research: 1) Linear models and their generalizations, 2) bioinformatics and
statistical genetics, 3) time series analysis, and 4) smoothing. The meeting
features cutting edge presentations in these areas, stimulates cross-
fertilization, and pays especial attention to the interaction of new researchers
and students with established researchers. The conference offers a number of
ways through which new researchers can participate, including poster sessions,
roundtable discussions, and discussion sessions following the talks.
