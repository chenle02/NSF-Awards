This award in the Research Planning Grant for women program is made by the
Chemistry Division to Dr. Susan T. Graul of the Chemistry Department, Carnegie
Mellon University. Gas-phase reactions of oxygen atom radical ions with various
organic and inorganic reagents will be studied in order to elucidate the
mechanisms and dynamics of hydride ion and hydrogen atom transfer reactions.
Under the planning grant, Dr. Graul will construct a guided ion beam apparatus
and develop theoretical methods for calculation of velocity distributions that
would be compared to experimental results. The project is relevant to the study
of planetary atmosphere and to combustion.
