This project addresses the problem of science literacy of the non-scientist. It
will modify the curriculum and laboratory experiences involving the introductory
astronomy course which is generally taken by nonscience majors as a way of
satisfying a general education science requirement. It involves development of
educational activities using computer simulations and image processing with
commercial software. These activities include laboratories on naked eye
phenomena involving the Voyager night sky simulation, planetary modeling
involving the SimEarth simulation, and image processing involving NASA
spacecraft planetary images and CCD images obtained locally. The Indoor
Telescope, which is an extensive simulation of an astronomical research
telescope that has been developed and used for the last eight years will be
modified for more modern computers. Finally, a curriculum will be developed
which will involve highly motivated nonscience majors in simple astronomical
research using data obtained both with on-campus facilities and an Automatic
Photoelectric Telescope located on Mt. Hopkins in southern Arizona. These
innovations which will give nonscience students a greater opportunity to
experience science as it is done have the potential of increasing the science
literacy of these future leaders of society.
