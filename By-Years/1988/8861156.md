This research is on robust methods for analysis of variance and statistically
designed experiments and their implementation in interactive graphics
workstations. The Phase I research will focus on robust estimates of scale,
robust estimates of scale for effects contrasts and error term in factorial and
fractional factorial designs, robust methods for variance components models, and
initial design of interactive graphics and user interface. Phase II would treat
other problems of robustness in analysis of variance, and develop prototype
implementations. Phase III would concentrate on developing a final commercial
software product which would make robust methods of analysis of variance
available to wide range of users.
