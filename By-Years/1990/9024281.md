The Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University will items of
oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use equipment.
This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the research
vessel MAURICE EWING that is operated by the Institution. A substantial part of
the ship's operating schedule in 1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored research
projects. The instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of the ships
and of the institution to support research and engineering activities. The
instrumentation includes: -Shipboard data management systems and components for
real- time acquisition, management, analysis, and display of large environmental
and geophysical data sets, -A scientific control console for the multibeam
bathymetric mapping system, -Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler electronics for
providing continuous, underway measurements of subsurface circulation features,
and dead-reckoning navigational input. The instrumentation described above will
increase the capability of the organization to support NSF-sponsored research
and engineering projects.
