The research is focused on the calculation of three-body recombination rates at
ultra-cold collision energies. These rates are required to study and understand
bosonic and fermionic condensation of atoms in traps. The principal investigator
will calculate the necessary potential energy surfaces and then apply a
hyperspherical coupled channel expansion, including all necessary coupling
terms, to compute the cross sections.
