9604231 Blonder Lay Abstract Identification and understanding of the emotional
content of faces and language are essential part of human cognition and
behavior. As yet, there is little understanding of the brain areas that underlie
the interpretation of emotion expressed in facial expressions or in words. This
project addresses this fundamental problem using functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging to map patterns of activity in the human brain associated with this
process. A series of studies describe the neuroanatomical circuits that underlie
the recognition of emotional content in facial expression and speech and
examines how the brain organizes and processes different types of emotional
information. The project exploits a powerful technological development in
neuoimaging to increase our knowledge of how the normal human brain processes
and analyzes emotional information.
