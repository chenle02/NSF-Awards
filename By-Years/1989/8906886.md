Dimensional measurement equipment, consisting of an automated Coordinate
Measurement Machine (CMM) and a Roundness Measurement System (RMS), is being
funded. This equipment is intended for high-accuracy dimensional measurements in
six research projects, all related to specific aspects of automated
manufacturing. In addition, the equipment will provide a major upgrade in the
metrology laboratory and become a standard for the comparison generally in
metrology research. Specifically, current research in in-process sensor systems
will employ the equipment as a reference standard for calibration, and for
assessment of critical performance parameters. In the processes area,
experimental research on drilling, conventional and electrical discharge
machining, and computer assisted cast pattern production will use this equipment
for dimensional gaging of samples of produced parts. This equipment will also be
used to gather dimensional information on the form and fit of assembled
components, and to measure control points of required fixtures.
