With support from the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Hratch Semerjian of the Council
for Chemical Research will organize a workshop addressing "The Effect of
Intellectual Property Rights Issues on Industry-University Partnerships." A
group of about 30 academic and industrial leaders will convene to discuss and
identify best practices and models of addressing the intellectual property
issues that challenge industry/university collaboration in the progress from
discovery to innovation and economic implementation. The workshop will focus on
IP issues associated with industry-sponsored university research, collaboration,
and forward licensing in the chemicals and petrochemicals sectors. Intellectual
property (IP) issues have been identified in many studies and reports as the
principal impediment toward expanding industry-university partnerships are
critical for enhancing U.S. innovation and the competitiveness of U.S. industry.
The Workshop will gain broad impact by addressing these challenges and finding
ways to mitigate them.
