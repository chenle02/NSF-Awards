The research plan that the PI has initiated will answer a long-standing puzzle
of embryology- how do inducers transmit their effects to cause particular
patterns of organ formation in vertebrates? The PI is involved in several
innovative teaching projects, and is committed to increasing the standard of
science education in the United States. This NYI award will free time that she
would otherwise devote to grant applications and allow her attention to focus on
performing research of the highest quality and on implementing changes in both
the curriculum of her home institution and in the involvement of scientists in
school-level education.
