The Earth seeks to minimize its rotational energy while conserving angular
momentum: the most striking predicted consequence of this is true polar wander
(TPW). This proposal is to develop a systematic understanding of TPW and related
rotational energy reduction affects, by a theoretical consideration of the
following: (i) Geotesselation: What particular plate tectonic patterns (if any)
are characteristic of the consequences of TPW? Can one, for example, understand
the N-S trend of major subduction zones? (ii) Coupling: Does TPW require mutual
("locked") rotation of lithosphere and mantle or can these move separately?
Preliminary work suggests that locked TPW is mandatory; a more complete analysis
is needed. (iii) Is mantle circulation affected by earth rotation? Order-of-
magnitude calculations suggest that the answer may be yes, at least to a modest
degree. Linear stability analysis and approximate finite amplitude analyses are
proposed to bolster or disprove this conjecture. (iv) What relationship, it any,
is there between TPW and geomagnetic or paleomagnetic data? (v) Can we
understand what particular circumstances favor or inhibit TPW of the real Earth?
