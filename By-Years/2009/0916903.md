This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the development
of a new binary rewriter that can be use to statically transform binary code
that does not have relocation information and to do so without the overhead of
dynamic binary rewriting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Binary rewriters are pieces of
software that accept a binary executable program as input, and produce an
improved executable as output. The output executable usually has the same
functionality as the input, but is improved in one or more metrics, such as run-
time, energy use, memory use, security, or reliability. Many optimizations for
binary rewriting have been proposed to improve all these metrics. However,
existing binary rewriters have a severe limitation ? they are unable to rewrite
binaries that have no relocation information. Unfortunately, linkers typically
discard relocation information, and hence virtually all commercial binaries lack
relocation information. Consequently, they cannot be rewritten by existing
rewriters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI is building a binary
rewriting infrastructure that can rewrite binaries that do not contain
relocation information. This will have the following broader impacts: (i) the
ability for anyone to rewrite any binary to improve its performance, security,
or memory consumption, or to monitor its resource consumption, is a powerful new
ability that could unleash innovation and engender a new class of commercial
applications; (ii) the resulting new commercial applications will be a net gain
for the nation?s economy; (iii) the improvements in those applications will
boost the productivity and security of their users; and (iv) a strong
educational program with instructional and outreach components.
