This proposal requests funds for the partial support of the
Gordon&lt;br/&gt;Research Conference on Composite Materials to be held in
January 2004, in Ventura, California. The funds requested will be used to help
pay registration fees and travel expenses for invited speakers, discussion
leaders, poster authors, and specially selected
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Research Conference on Composite
Materials is one of the few&lt;br/&gt;Gordon Research Conferences that addresses
a field within the purview of materials science. The field of composite
materials is highly&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary, requiring the efforts of
physicists, chemists,&lt;br/&gt;mechanics, mathematicians and materials
scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The invited presentations will cover a range
of subjects, including&lt;br/&gt;biomimetics, novel resin systems, nanoscale
materials, interfacial&lt;br/&gt;issues, low cost composites, and materials
based on renewable resources. Identifying where a new generation of composite
scientists should best place their efforts to meet the challenges they face as
we move forward into the 21st century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
