The are two molybdenite polytypes; a hexagonal (2H) and the more rare
rhombohedral (3R). The purpose of this study is to determine which molybdenite
polytype is most likely to remain closed to Re-Os exchange after deposition. The
PI proposes to obtain molybdenites from different types of ore-deposits of known
age, and determine the polytype by XRD analysis and analyze the Re-Os abundances
by isotope dilution using an ICP-MS. The second purpose of this work is to
determine the Re-Os isotope systematics of sulfides from porphyry
copper/molybdenum deposits from Arizona, New Mexico, northern Mexico, Nevada and
Utah in order to constrain the crust/mantle input of metals into these systems.
