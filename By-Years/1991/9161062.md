Optical lithography is widely used in the manufacture of integrated circuits.
The current systems utilize conventional I- line (356nm wavelength) lamps or to
illuminate the lenses that print the IC patterns onto wafers. Future systems
will use laser. All of the lithography optics used to date have been the
refractive type. At the short ultraviolet (UV) laser wavelengths required for
next generation device manufacturing, several limitations exist for this type of
lens. These limitations include light scattering because of shot wavelengths,
heat absorption due to high photon energies in the UV, and optical transmission
losses (poor efficiency) from high absorption of the light. The PI propose to
develop a catadioptric optical system that has high optical transmission, high
resolution, is laser-resistant, and relatively easy to manufacture. Because the
optics are mirror-based, optical distortion is greatly reduced and very high
power levels can be used without damaging the optics. We have made preliminary
experiments in our lab with this type of optics, and achieved 0.4um resolution.
The development of this type of lens would lead to significant improvements in
the high resolution imaging systems for VLSI microlithography, a critical step
in manufacturing integrate circuits.
