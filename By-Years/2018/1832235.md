This award supports participation in the 2018 Yamabe Memorial Symposium on
"Moduli Spaces in Algebraic Geometry" held at the University of Minnesota on
September 28-30, 2018. Spurred by developments in algebraic geometry, as well as
in other areas of mathematics and physics, new and exciting aspects of the
theory of moduli have emerged. The purpose of this symposium is to bring
participants a deeper understanding of recent discoveries in these areas. At the
same time, the meeting will provide a valuable opportunity for graduate students
and junior researchers to interact with, and learn from, leading
mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developments in birational geometry and the
minimal model program have led to progress in the study of moduli of higher-
dimensional varieties. Another source of inspiration has come from string theory
in physics, in particular from its predictions about enumerative geometry of
curves in algebraic varieties. Yet another newer strand resulting in part from
the same influence is the study of moduli in logarithmic geometry and in
tropical geometry. The goal of the symposium is to help participants gain a
wider perspective of these new developments. It is anticipated that a long-
lasting benefit of the conference will be the stimulation of innovative
developments in mathematics research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information can

mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
