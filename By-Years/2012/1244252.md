Environmental governance requires participation by people and their local, state
and national governments, and decisions have implications across jurisdictions.
Cooperation across multiple disciplines from the social and natural and physical
sciences is necessary to inform our understanding of how to make decisions based
in the best scientific evidence. Yet although environmental systems are of
interest across the sciences, and require analysis from multiple sciences,
scientists often do not have the collaborations in place concerning how best to
research questions of how people constitute, interact with and govern their
behavior within complex environmental systems. This project supports a workshop
that will develop collaborations across sciences concerning people's
participation in choices about governing environmental systems, addressing
governing choices and frameworks across scales of governments. Participants will
include engineers, social scientists, and natural and physical scientists from
multiple disciplines, all with research priorities concerning governing
environmental systems. The workshop will develop collaborations and frameworks
in common for understanding how to explain variation in governing strategies. In
doing so, it will contribute to the development of concepts across the sciences.
In addition, the project's broader impacts will include contributing to
policymaking for governments, and training students in issues concerning
scientific collaboration as well as environmental sciences.
