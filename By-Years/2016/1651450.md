The Meinel band nightglow emission from the OH molecule has been used for
decades to characterize mesospheric temperatures. Aeronomers currently rely on
emission coefficients ("A coefficients") that the PIs argue are in need of
revision. Temperatures recovered using the existing set of A coefficients differ
by up to 15 K from actual temperatures computed from first principles. Large
uncertainty in the mesospheric temperature can have detrimental effects on
modeling chemistry, transport and circulation of the mesosphere and lower
thermosphere (MLT). The uncertainties also undermine efforts to monitor the
long-term temperatures in the MLT.

This proposal addresses the OH temperature determination by 1) using intensity-
calibrated nightglow data that has been collected simultaneously over a large
spectral range from astronomical sky spectra; 2) making comparisons between such
recently obtained OH Meinel band line intensities, and the most recent first
principles calculations of the emission coefficients. This research will
contribute to understanding fundamental physical quantum processes, atmospheric
motions on small and large scales, and long-term temperature change in the lower
thermosphere.
