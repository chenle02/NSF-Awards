9522301 Cypher MIMD (Multiple-Instruction-Stream, Multiple-Data-Stream) parallel
computers are naturally asychronous. Many MIMD computers use a separate clock
for each processor in order to avoid clock skew problems. Furthermore, even if
all the processors use a common clock, the timing of commulication events is not
known in advance due to factors such as data dependent processing times,
processor interrupts and variable network congestion. This asynchrony has a
major impact on the design of the machine's communication sub- system the
semantics of the programming model, and the creation of parallel algorithms.
This research studies principles for the design and use of asynchronous parallel
computers. Specifically, three key areas of asynchronous parallel computing are
studied. 1. specifying the semantics of message-passing, shared memory, and
other, novel, programming models. 2. Creating efficient communication protocols
that implement the above programming models, and 3. evaluating metrics and
models for the design of algorithms for asynchronous parallel computers. This
research will result in more efficient communication in MIMD machines, novel
techniques for reasoning about and using asynchronous parallel computers, and a
better understanding of how the theoretical community's body of knowledge in
parallel algorithms can be applied to real machines. ***
