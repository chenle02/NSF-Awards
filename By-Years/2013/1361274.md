Word meanings are central to the semantic interpretation of
texts.&lt;br/&gt;Although much work to date has focused on statistical
approaches that often ignore the explicit understanding of the text, recent
research work has begun to challenge this simplification, demonstrating that
semantic interpretation is indeed essential for a number of language processing
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key observation underlying this CAREER
project is that word meaning distinctions differ from one lexical resource to
another and that the optimality of word meaning representations should be
dictated by the target application. The project is exploring rich and flexible
word meaning representations that combine the benefits of multiple monolingual
and cross-lingual lexical resources and that can be adapted to the context and
to the target application. In particular, the multilingual nature of these
representations allows for an effective exploitation of the knowledge and
resources available in different languages. The project also explores the role
played by these word meaning representations and the corresponding monolingual
and cross-lingual knowledge sources in several natural language processing tasks
including lexical substitution, word and text translation, and text-to-text
semantic similarity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another aim of the project is to
integrate natural language processing into educational applications, and explore
the use of the word meaning interpretation models to build a comprehension-
assistant tool for students of English as a second language (ESL) and English as
a foreign language (EFL). The educational program also fosters increased
awareness about research in multilingual natural language processing among
college, undergraduate, and graduate students, through a college outreach
program and a new course on multilingual computational linguistics, as well as
increased exposure of students to international experiences through
international collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;
