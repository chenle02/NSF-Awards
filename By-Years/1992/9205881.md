Nonparametric statistical methods will be developed for spatial data arising
from random fields and point processes. A nonparametric approach is appealing
for analyzing spatial data because it avoids detailed assumptions about the
typically unknown and usually complicated underlying probability structure in
terms of marginal distributions of the observations or shapes of spatial
boundaries that partition the observations into homogeneous groups. Two specific
types of nonparametric methods will be developed: resampling methods, which
describe the sampling distribution of a general statistic computed from spatial
data; and boundary estimators, which separate nonhomogeneous spatial data into
homogeneous subsets. Spatial data is data that is laid out on a map or grid; it
arises naturally in geology, ecology, meteorology, agriculture, epidemiology,
medical imaging and other areas of scientific investigation. Often there is a
natural boundary running through spatial data such as a seismic fault line or
the edge of an object in an image. One goal of this project is to develop
methods for identifying such boundaries accurately; another is to develop
methods for assessing the sampling error in quantities calculated from spatial
data.
