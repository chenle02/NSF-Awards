This travel grant will be used for offsetting the cost of attendees
participating at the 14th Annual Power and Energy Conference at Illinois (PECI).
Beginning in 2010, PECI is the oldest annual, student-run IEEE international
conference about power and energy technology. The conference is organized by the
IEEE PES/PELS/IAS Joint Graduate Student Chapter at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign and is advised by faculty in the Power and Energy area of
the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign. PECI has become a perfect place in the Midwest for
industry, academic researchers, and students to discuss future power and energy
topics such as renewable energy, machines for electric transportation, smart
grid reliability, security of cyber physical systems, and power electronics for
emerging technologies. The travel funding for PECI 2023 will support
underrepresented students such as those from primarily undergraduate or minority
institutions. Students who apply for funding will be encouraged to present
either a poster or paper and will compete for Best Paper and Best Poster Awards.

The travel funding for PECI 2023 will help introduce students to innovative
power-focused technologies in both the academic and industry sectors, in fields
such as machines, power systems, power electronics and entrepreneurship. This
will advance the power engineering community by fostering discussion between the
leaders of tomorrow and current academic and industry professionals.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
