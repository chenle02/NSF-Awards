ABSTRACT A six-week workshop and associated one-day conference are to be
conducted at the 1989 Linguistic Institute at the University of Arizona on the
syntax and semantics of quantification, with special emphasis on cross-
Linguistic investigation. A central focus of investigation will be the
similarities and differences between quantification expressed with determiners
and quantification expressed with adverbs, auxiliary verbs, and verbal affixes.
Considerable attention will be paid to certain non-Indo-European languages which
appear to make little or no use of determiners for essentially quantificational
purposes. The six-week workshop, June 26- August 4, 1989, will be a closed
working group with three organizers and approximately thirteen invited scholars
representing a wide range of language expertise and considerable variety of
theoretical frameworks. There will be a one-day conference on the topic of the
workshop on a saturday during the Institute, presented by the workshop
participants, and open to everyone interested. The topics of the workshop and
conference are closely tied to the topics of a 3-year project being undertaken
by the same three investigators with NSF support.
