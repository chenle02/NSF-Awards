This project involves a cultural anthropologist from Johns Hopkins University
in an ethnographic study of decollectivization -- changing private property
rights -- in one Transylvanian community of Romania. The project will examine
how decollectivization affects people's fundamental relations with state
authorities and institutions. The researcher will observe and examine court
cases, interview villagers, local authorities, judges and lawyers and government
officials, observe the work of the village Land Commission, and consult archives
and local print media. These methods will produce a detailed picture of how
property restitution is taking place, what sorts of property rights are being
created, and how villagers are developing new concepts of themselves as citizens
and property-holders in relation to the land and the state. This research is
important because the changing societies of Eastern Europe often lead observers
to assume that the societies are simply becoming more `democratic` in the sense
of imitating Western capitalism. The reality is that the histories of each place
constrain the distribution of power and privilege, and limit access to justice
and civil rights by different groups. Research which provides a rich case study
of one community evolving a new relation between democracy and private property
will advance our understanding of the general principles involved.
