9508144 Cashman Detailed measurements of the vesicle structure of two inflated
sheet flows from Mauna Loa volcano and two inflated sheet flows in central
Oregon will allow testing of the applicability of the model of Cashman et al.
(in review) to flows of larger volume that typically produced by Kilauea
Volcano. This goal of interpreting the dynamics of the emplacement process is
distinctly different from previous studies that have viewed the development of
flow vesicularity as a static process. This work will lay the foundation for
addressing the emplacement of more enigmatic flows, such as flood basalts.
Temperature changes with transport distance will be determined for both of these
flows using the completed glass geothermometer with the goal of calibrating
temperature loss with basalt eruption rate (and thus flow emplacement style). A
glass geothermometer will be calibrated experimentally for quantitative
determination of temperature loss during transport and emplacement of the Gingko
flow. Finally, both pre- and post-emplacement cooling rates of basalt flows are
preserved in the microlite population of both glassy selvages and solidified
flow interiors. Experimental quantification of observed qualitative
relationships between cooling rate and crystal number density will provide a new
tool for determining cooling rate distributions in solidified basalt flows.
