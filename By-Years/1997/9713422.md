The investigators are using visualization and tracking techniques in studying
interplanetary type II radio bursts observed remotely from the Ulysses and WIND
spacecraft. Type II emissions are generated when coronal mass ejection-driven
shocks propagate through the interplanetary medium from sun to Earth, and
provide an intermediate link in the solar-terrestrial connection. The
investigators will better understand (1) the physical characteristics and
dynamics of individual type II radio bursts, (2) the relationship of type II
radiation to the coronal mass ejection-driven shocks and conditions in the
interplanetary medium, (3) the characterization of the geomagnetic response to
radio emitting coronal mass ejections, and (4) the interplanetary transport of
coronal mass ejections, and predictions of their arrival at Earth.
