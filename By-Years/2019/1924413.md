The goal of this project is to predict the system reliability of products whose
components are outsourced to outside suppliers. Outsourcing is a common practice
because of lower operational and labor costs. The detailed designs of outsourced
components, however, are mostly proprietary to component designers and are black
boxes to system designers. This poses a great challenge for system designers to
estimate the system reliability during the system design stage. This project
performs feasibility studies to explore possible ways for system designers to
predict the system reliability without revealing proprietary details of
outsourced components. As a result, this project offers to help engineers make
more reliable, safer, and cheaper products, thereby increasing competitiveness
and improving quality of life. This research could impact broad areas of design
methodologies and wide engineering applications, ranging from large structural
systems to small integrated circuit systems. Beyond engineering design, this
project also benefits system engineering, reliability engineering, and
operations research where system reliability plays a vital role.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses reliability prediction at both component and
system levels. From the perspective of component design, this project determines
what reliability information a supplier should provide to system designers and
how to do so. The information will be sufficient for system reliability
analysis, and the proprietary information of the supplier will also be
protected. From the perspective of system design, this project provides theories
to system designers so that they could use the above component information to
reconstruct component reliability models that accommodate dependencies between
component failures, thereby producing an accurate system reliability prediction
for decision making on system configurations, optimization, life cycle cost,
maintenance, warranty, and so on.
