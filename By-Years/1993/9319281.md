9319281 Goodman This grant supports the research of a senior faculty member, an
Associate Research Scientist and a Postdoctoral Research Associate and students
at the University of Maryland. They, with colleagues from the University of
California at Irvine, University of California at Santa Cruz and at the Los
Alamos National Laboratory study characteristics of high energy cosmic rays,
especially those produced by primary photons. The goals are to establish the
identity of as yet unknown sources and explicate still unknown acceleration
mechanisms. Those are subjects of intense current interest and activity. A major
thrust of the program is the development of a new air-shower detector - MILAGRO
- makes use of Cerenkov radiation produced by shower particles in a large pool
of water. ***
