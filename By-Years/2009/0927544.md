PI: Elica M. Moss (Alabama A&amp;M University)&lt;br/&gt;CoPIs: Robert W. Taylor
and Teferi Tsegaye (Alabama A&amp;M University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faculty at
Alabama A&amp;M University have teamed with the American Society for Agronomy
(ASA), Crop Science Society of America (CSSA) and the Soil Science Society of
America (SSSA) to develop a novel mentoring program designed to engage minority
undergraduate students in the crop sciences fashioned after the Golden
Opportunity Scholars Institute (https://www.crops.org/scholars/), sponsored by
the CSSA. Students will be recruited, selected, and teamed with faculty mentors
to travel to the Annual ASA-CSSA-SSSA Conferences where they will have
opportunities to present posters, give oral presentations and participate in
career mentoring sessions. Funds provided by NSF will support travel awards to
selected students and will enable year-round mentoring by project PIs and
faculty mentors. &lt;br/&gt;
