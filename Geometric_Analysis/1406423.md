This project studies symplectic topology, which is a mathematical foundation of
Hamiltonian dynamics. The research is also related to the mathematical
foundation of string theory in theoretical physics. The project includes a
systematic study of the "transversality problem" in those theories. We may
regard this problem as a mathematical equivalent to the problem of infinity in
quantum field theory in physics. The work is expected to answer essential
questions in the mathematical foundation of theoretical physics. The project
also studies several mathematical problems appearing in differential equations
of classical mechanics. In this project, the PI and collaborators will study
moduli spaces of holomorphic maps from bordered Riemann surfaces to a symplectic
manifold with Lagrangian boundary conditions. This is a generalization of the
theory of Floer homology which provides a mathematical formulation of
topological open string theory. At the same time, the project will deepen the
understanding of the virtual fundamental chains, which has important
applications in the study of moduli spaces in differential geometry and
topological field theories. Applications to Mirror symmetry and concrete
problems in symplectic topology will also be investigated.
