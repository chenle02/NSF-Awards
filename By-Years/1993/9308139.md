9308139 Myerson The goal of this project is to develop a better understanding of
how the design of political institutions can affect political behavior, with
hope that such understanding may be valuable for guiding decisions about
constitutional design in new and reforming democracies. In particular, the
researcher will continue his research on game-theoretic comparison of political
institutions by looking into several extensions. First, electoral systems will
be compared by analyzing large finite voting games in which the numbers of
voters of different types are independent random variables. Then the
effectiveness of different electoral systems for reducing government corruption
by considering single transferable vote and other electoral systems will be
investigated. Second, the tendency of plurality voting elections to become two-
party contests is known as Duverger's law. The investigator will work to derive
Duverger's law from game-theoretic analysis. Third, a variety of game-theoretic
models that may account for observed differences between parliamentary and
presidential systems will be studied. This question has been an important area
of study in the empirical literature on comparative politics, but there is a
need for game-theoretic models to guide and complement empirical work. Finally,
the investigator's long term plan is to integrate the results of his research,
together with other related results in formal political theory and social choice
theory, into a general monograph on game-theoretic models for comparing
political institutions. ***
