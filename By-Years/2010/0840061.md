Text Analysis and Pattern Detection - Phase II Lancaster, Lewis University of
California-Berkeley

This project extends the work of IIS-0741556 into new areas. While the purpose
remains the exploration of the use of high dimensional visualization to analyze
text structure and patterns for scholars in the humanities, This phase of
exploratory research will focus on enhancement of the user interface and
integration of a statistical analysis toolkit. Also included in the effort are
attempts to enhance the functionality and ease-of-use of the user interface.
This will be approached by including a context builder for search and retrieval
of reference works external to the data repository. In addition, a multi-lingual
capability will be explored through collaboration with domestic and
international partners. Evaluation plans for the resulting system capabilities
will involve numerous beta testing by domain scholars.
