During the last week of October, 1991, Hog Island of the Virginia Coast Reserve
LTER site was overwashed with sea water from the combined effects of three
weather systems. The relatively low relief of the island contributed to ca. 75%
of the island being inundated. There was a tremendous increase in salinity (a
substantial freshwater lens underlying the island now is 22 ppt saline). This
situation presents a unique opportunity to examine storm-induced changes in the
ecosystem that may not happen again for several decades. Specifically, this
project will study the impact of these storms on the dominant woody species of
the islands, Myrica cerifera (wax myrtle). Myrica is an "impact" species, either
directly or indirectly affecting many terrestrial ecological processes on the
islands, from island stability, to nitrogen availability (it is a N fixer), to
bird nesting. A series of field measurements will be conducted to examine
patterns of Myrica establishment, mortality, and production as related to
variations in groundwater salinity and subtle changes in elevation.
