This project will replace an obsolete mass spectrometer with a computer-
controlled gas chromatograph/mass selective detector for use by undergraduate
students in organic chemistry, chemical instrumentation, applied analyses, and
spectrometric and separation methods. The mass selective detector, associated
computer hardware and software acquired for this project will be interfaced with
a gas chromatograph recently donated to the chemistry department, thus providing
GC/MS capability. Principles and techniques to be taught in upgraded or new
experiments include operation of a computer-controlled GC/MS; identification of
a sample compound from the relative magnitudes of the P, P+1, and P+2 peaks;
separation and identification of compounds in complex mixtures; and
identification of compounds by interpretation of fragmentation patterns.
