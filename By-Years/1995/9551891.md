High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has become the most widely used
analytical separation technique. To respond to this trend, the university is
purchasing two HPLCs for use in engineering and environmental chemistry courses,
including organic chemistry and environmental chemistry labs, materials
characterization and adhesives labs for engineers, and automotive engineering
labs. Approximately 700 students utilize the equipment in these courses and
labs. An autosampler enables handling large numbers of samples on either it or
the HPLC. New experiments include analysis of nitrophenols and polymer
additives; characterization of polymers; analysis of plasticizers and surface
contaminants; analysis of trivalent and hexavalent chromium species and of mono-
and divalent cations by ion chromatography; determination of ammonia in
workplace atmospheres and of EPA Water Matrix anions; analyses of carbonyl
compounds, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons and, herbicides; and analysis of
automotive exhausts for carbonyl compounds.
