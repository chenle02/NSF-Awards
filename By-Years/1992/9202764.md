In this Experimental Physical Chemistry project sponsored by the Chemistry
Division, Prof. Herschbach (Harvard University) will construct a new apparatus
for electric field alignment of small molecules in a molecular beam. For the
first time, it will be possible to read the degree of alignment simply from the
spectrum without recourse to complicated photodissociation techniques. The use
of oriented molecular targets in molecular beam studies of chemical reations
will lead to much more accurate and detailed pictures of gas phase reaction
mechanisms. %%% Normally, when molecules serve as targets for chemical
reactions, the mutual orientation of the colliding partners is completely
random. Prof. Herschbach (Harvard University) is developing a general method for
orienting the molecules prior to reaction, and will apply it to elucidating
reaction mechanisms at an unprecedented level of detail.
