Kieron Burke of the University of California-Irvine is supported by an award
from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to carry out research
on the development of improvements to density functional theory (DFT). The
improvements focus on the development of new functionals including a kinetic
energy functional, which would eliminate the need to compute orbitals.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Density functional theory has become an essential tool of
electronic structure calculations in many fields of chemistry, but there exist
so many empirical functionals that users are often bewildered about how to start
using the method for their particular application. The primary objective of this
project is to develop an entirely new methodology for developing appropriate
density functionals using the semiclassical theories on which it is based. The
approach uses a simple principle, that of asymptotic exactness as the number of
electrons becomes large. The impact of Burke's work is expected to be broad and
to have application in many fields of science. The impact of the work will be
further broadened by the development of tutorials and distribution of Burke's
"ABCs of DFT" online notes.
