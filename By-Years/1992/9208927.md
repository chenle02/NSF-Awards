The focus of this research, carried out in an undergraduate institution, is to
study the cardiotonic glycosides alpha- and beta-antiarin, components of dart
poisons isolated from the latex of Antiaris toxicaria. The specific aims of the
project are to test whether the antiarins and related secondary metabolites
evolved as defense chemicals versus insect herbivores, to characterize any anti-
insectan activity, to study the specific mode of action of the poisons as a
guide to biorational pesticide development, to investigate the similarity of the
antiarins to ouabain, a known inhibitor of membrane-bound NA+/K+ ATPase and to
ascertain which structural units in ouabain and the antarins represent the
sources of anti-insectan activity. %%% With this Research in Undergraduate
Institutions (RUI) award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the
research of Dr. David P. Richardson of the Department of Chemistry at Williams
College. Professor Richardson will focus his work on carrying out rigorous
chemical and biological studies on the dart poisons derived from the latex of
Antiaris toxicaria, a tree indigenous to Borneo. The project offers exceptional
opportunities for student participation in the areas of chemical separation,
structural analysis and synthetic chemistry.
