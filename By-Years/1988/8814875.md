This project will support the Summer Conference on Combinatorics and Computer
Science to be held May 22-26, 1989 at George Washington University. Its purpose
is to bring together researchers in mathematics and computer science and to
provide a setting for the exchange of ideas and for potential collaboration
between these two groups. A second objective is to foster an exchange of views
on teaching and curriculum issues confronting those who work in combinatorics
and computer science. The principal speakers are L. Lovasz, R. Karp, and R.
Stanley, who will present survey lectures on the topics of graph theory,
algebraic combinatorics, and algorithms and complexity.
