This grant explores how alloying additions and crystal structure influence
magnetostriction in Fe and Fe-Ga based alloys. The influences of selected
alloying elements with no d-shell electrons, with filled d-shells, and with
partially filled d-shells are examined using single crystals and directionally
solidified polycrystalline alloys. The influence of crystal structure is
examined using a Fe-27.5 a% Ga alloy that can exist in a"-ordered (bcc),
DO19-ordered (hexagonal), L12-ordered (fcc), and disordered-bcc structures.
Another principal goal of this work is to examine a low cost thermomechanical
processing approach to produce [001] textured Fe-Ga based polycrystalline alloys
at low cost. The processing approach involves cold/warm deformation and
recrystallization. An assessment of the influence of the amount of different
process parameters on the nature of texture obtained in selected Fe-Ga alloys,
and the mechanisms controlling the evolution of texture will be
made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The processing conditions that result in [001]
texture are identified through a study of texture evolution during processing
using Orientation Imaging Microscopy (OIM) in an SEM. The grant will result in
an improved understanding of magnetostriction in Fe based alloys, and low cost
and highly magnetostrictive alloys for use in sensor and actuator applications.
The grant will also enhance the graduate and undergraduate educational,
training, and recruitment activities.&lt;br/&gt;
