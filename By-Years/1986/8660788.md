This work will examine the premise that the decrease in sediment load in the
Colorado River observed during the 1940's was due to the reduction of grazing
and the increased use of conservation practices during the 1920's and 30's. The
project will study the geomorphic changes in tributary channels in the Colorado
River basin with the idea that once the stored alluvium has been removed from
the tributary valleys the sediment and salinity production will decrease. The
protection of these sites from future remobilization through channel incision
and arroyo formation may thus prevent further increases in sediment and salt
loads. Results from this study will greatly benefit federal and state agencies
with responsibilities in land and natural resources management, as well as being
of signifcant economic value to the U.S. Western States.
