The proposed research is closely related to contemporary trends in fluid
mechanics and computational complex analysis, focusing on mathematical modeling
of supercavitating flow around hydrofoils in free boundary domains. The central
idea is the use of Riemann surfaces for the modeling of physical flow in the
rear part of a cavity and for the solution of the governing boundary-value
problems. The technique requires the development and implementation of diverse
modern tools of pure and applied mathematics, namely, the conformal mapping
method, the Schwarz reflection principle, the theory of symmetric Schottky
groups, and the theory of the Riemann-Hilbert boundary-value problem on Riemann
surfaces and for symmetric automorphic functions.

Hydrodynamic cavitation is defined as the breakdown of a liquid under low
pressure. Cavitation causes wall erosion, alters hydrofoil performance (reduces
lift and increases drag of a hydrofoil for example) and produces noise and
vibration. Cavitation has long been of interest not only in the field of
shipbuilding and hydraulic machinery, but also because of its positive effects
in chemical processing (electrolytic deposition and the production of
emulsions), physics (dispersion of particles in a fluid) and medicine (bacteria
destruction from the surfaces of equipment, therapeutic massage and potential
bioeffects of ultrasound caused by acoustic cavitation in blood vessels). The
overall goal of this project is to develop a unified mathematical approach for
free boundary problems in multiply-connected domains in order to solve non-
linear model problems of supercavitating flow around a stack of hydrofoils.
These solutions will help obtain an understanding of the mechanism of flow in
the rear parts of cavities, of how the cavities interact with each other, and of
how the lift, drag and the cavity configuration depend on the proximity of the
walls and the free surfaces.
