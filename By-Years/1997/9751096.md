The revision of the 10-year-old general chemistry laboratories curricula for
science majors at this historically black university includes the use of
technology and aims at the development of the scientific mind. The students keep
a laboratory notebook and design, carry out, and present a project. Multimedia
interactive pre-labs and post-labs extend the impact of each experiment on the
learning process. Simulated experiments not only eliminate the anxiety of
following a procedure for the first time, but also give the student the
opportunity to experience several related experiments. The relation between
daily experiences and concepts learned in the lecture is pursued. Measurement
and data analysis are emphasized as the best means of deriving the fundamental
principles of chemistry. Graphing calculators and spreadsheets are used to
display data and to search for relations between variables. Calculator-based
laboratory units facilitate data acquisition, with less stress on instrument
handling and more on data handling in the early laboratory sessions. The use of
numerical and graphical analysis, the experience with technology, and the
development of written and oral skills better prepare the students for the more
advanced laboratories and ultimately for graduate school and the job market. *
