This research will focus on the modelling, analysis, and design of so- called
hybrid systems. Hybrid means the system is comprised of a decision making
process (called a discrete event, DE, supervisory controller) interacting with a
continuous-time (CT) process. Examples of such systems include flexible
manufacturing systems and in general any management or decision making structure
which superimposes its will (decisions) on a continuous-time process at discrete
time instants. By investigating the mechanics of specific examples such as a
management decision making structure implementing an optimal profit- maximizing
harvesting policy on a fishery resource, one can define the structure of a
hybrid system model. Proper development of such a rudimentary model will result
in effective simulation, analysis, and control strategies for hybrid systems.
Specifically the model will readily adapt to the inexpensive and evolving
computer, information, communication, and industrial technologies which will
continue to impact the control of real world processes for years to come.
