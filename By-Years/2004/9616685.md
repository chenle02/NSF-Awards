The Mathematical Association of America through its Strengthening
Underrepersented Minority Mathematics Achievement program in partnership with
Arizona State University and in collaboration with the High Plains Rural
Systemic Initiative will conduct a 30 month Workshop to Enhance Native American
Faculty and teacher aides in the use of Calculators in Teaching (ENACT). This
will be a 30 month enhancing teacher project for 30 tribal college mathematics
faculty members and 50 American Indian teacher aides. The Project Director,
Professor Robert Megginson, with five other senior staff members will teach the
use of the Texas Instruments TI-83 graphing calcutor in teaching. Modern
pedagogy will be demonstrated in two workshops. The first will be a two-week
workshop and held in August 1997 and the second in August 1998 will be three
weeks.
