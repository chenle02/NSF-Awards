The California Alliance for Minority Participation in the Sciences (CAMP)
describes creating a four-regionally coordinated Statewide alliance where the
University of California-Irvine will serve as lead institution of the nine
University of California campuses and fifty public and private institutions
alliance. The fundamental goal of the proposed alliance is to increase
significantly the number of minority scholars in the biological and physical
sciences and related engineering fields at the undergraduate level by creating
undergraduate programs that address the primary barriers to success and
retention of minorities in the sciences and engineering. The P.I. lists ten
supporting activities that he latter groups into six broad programs which will
be implemented into each of the four regional. The programs are as follows: o
Academic year and summer CAMP Undergraduate Research Scholars Program o
Instructional Reforms and Student Assistance o Annual Statewide Symposia o
Quarterly Regional Colloquia o Pre-college Programs o Corporate Alliances In
California, 19,998 undergraduate minorities were enrolled in science and
engineering programs (13,071 Hispanic students, 5,796 Black students, and 1,121
American Indian students). CAMP objective is to award within the State 3,500
B.S. degrees, 500 master's degrees and 150 Ph.D. degrees in the biological and
physical sciences and engineering by the year 2000 to underrepresented minority
students.
