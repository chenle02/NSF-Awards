Longitudinal data are the result of taking repeated measurements on experimental
units over time. Because scientific interest often lies in how a response
changes over time, these data arise in both observational and experimental
studies in a wide variety of fields. Creative solutions to difficult theoretical
issues in longitudinal data analysis often rely on computationally intensive
methods. A workshop on longitudinal methods appeals to a wide spectrum of
researchers with diverse statistical interests ranging from clinical trials to
social behavior to environmental assessment. The challenge of drawing inferences
based on diverse datasets attracts those interested in theoretical and
methodological statistics. Finally, the excitement of accepting the challenge of
analyzing unorthodox data where existing statistical methodology is not
satisfactory will undoubtedly fascinate researchers concerned with applications
of statistics. This workshop will provide a forum for the positive interaction
between theoretical developments and advances in practical applications of
longitudinal methods.

The specific objectives of the workshop on longitudinal data analysis, and
consequently its potential broader impacts, are to generate interest in this
topic among researchers nationwide (particularly young researchers) and among
faculty and graduate students at the University of Florida and neighboring
universities; to encourage future collaborations among researchers; and to
promote advances in both the theory and application of longitudinal data.
