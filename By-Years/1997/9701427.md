w:\awards\awards96\num.doc 9701427 Prober This experimental research project
focuses on electron noise and correlations in phase-coherent nanostructures.
These studies will explore how electrons interact with their environment and
will provide new information on the effects of electron phase and correlations.
The noise studies will be carried in diffusive microbridges and quantum point
contacts, in the frequency range of 0.1 to 20GHz. Phase coherent transport, sub-
Poisson shot noise, and noise of superconductor-normal metal contacts may also
be studied. Quantum limits on the spectral distribution of the noise with
frequency will also be investigated. %%% This research project involves
experimentally studies the origins and limits on noise in nanometer-scale
electron devices used to detect radiation, emphasizing the 0.1 to 20GHz
frequency range. Applications of such detectors include radio astronomy and
radar receivers. The novelty of the research is in its focus on nanometer scale
devices where quantum behavior of electrons becomes important. In these
circumstances the understanding of noise effects is incomplete, both
experimentally and theoretically. Results from this research may include unusual
new effects or detector devices which may find new application in technology.
This research project is interdisciplinary in nature and involves both graduate
and undergraduate students who will be excellently trained to enter positions in
industry, government or education. ***
