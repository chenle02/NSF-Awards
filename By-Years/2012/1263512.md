This engineering education research project seeks to shed light on past change
efforts in engineering education in order to facilitate continuing improvement
in the programs that educate the future engineering workforce. The project will
study the development of prospective change agents by bringing together graduate
students and successful leaders and change agents, then collect, analyze, and
publish interviews. The analysis will be used to inform how innovations in
teaching and learning can be better integrated into existing engineering
curricula.

The broader significance and importance of this project is that it both sheds
light on how change happens in engineering program, and engages future leaders
in collecting and understanding how change has occurred in the past. The stories
of the change agents will be made available through efforts at wide
dissemination. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming
the frontiers by enhancing research infrastructure and data access to broaden
research capabilities. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is
enabled by creating results and research that are useful for society by
informing educational policy and practices.
