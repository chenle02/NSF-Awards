In this award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Millard Alexander of the University of Maryland and
Prof. Paul Dagdigian of Johns Hopkins University will conduct a joint
theoretical and experimental research program to study the effects of
nonadiabatic dynamics in molecular processes: reactions, photodissociation and
inelastic collisions. Knowledge gained from this research has important
implications in a variety of fields from combustion chemistry to atmospheric
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the broader scientific impact of the
research, the computer code (e.g. Hibridon) developed in the theoretical
portions of this research will continue to be disseminated, and graduate
students will receive training in experimental and theoretical physical
chemistry research.&lt;br/&gt;
