The Departments of Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and
Mechanical Engineering as well as the National Center for Security Research and
Training, and the Office of Strategic Initiatives at Louisiana State University
jointly aim to increase the educational and pedagogical opportunities for
academically talented faculty in information assurance and security. The focus
of this project is to increase the number of US citizens, including members of
under-represented groups, who will advance their teaching and research in the
emerging areas of information assurance and security. Six Faculty/Student
Scholar pairs are participating in a two-year training program. The training
program is a series of development activities that include summer workshops,
national lab/research center visits, and academic year mini-grants.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholars explore open scientific problems in the
protection of mission-critical information infrastructures including wide-area
network threat detection and reasoning about complex events using model-based
approaches to vulnerability analysis. Scholars also develop training and
pedagogical materials for use at their home institutions. Distinguished scholars
from national and homeland security laboratories work in collaboration with the
LSU National Center for Security Research and Training to encourage research in
information assurance and security and to extend the community of scholars.
