Algorithms for large-scale optimization have traditionally exploited sparsity
and structure in problem data. Many important optimization problems today, such
as those that arise in statistical machine learning (ML) and in compressive
sensing (CS) are extremely large-scale convex problems with completely dense
and/or unstructured problem data. However, there is often sparsity and structure
in the solutions to these problems. The goal of this research project is the
development of first-order algorithms, including gradient methods for non-smooth
functions, smoothed penalty methods for constrained problems, multiple splitting
methods, alternating-direction augmented-Lagrangian methods, and block
coordinate descent methods, for extremely large-scale convex optimization
problems that take advantage of solution structure and/or sparsity. Rigorous
convergence analysis for these methods will be provided and robust software
implementations will be developed. Although these methods are expected to have
wide applicability, the focus will be on applications in CS and ML.
Specifically, the investigators propose to develop and analyze new scalable
algorithms for (i) CS signal recovery, including algorithms that are able to
exploit more detailed a priori knowledge in addition to sparsity; (ii) matrix
rank minimization, the matrix analog of CS, and its variants; and (iii) a broad
array of ML problems that exploit the special sparsity/structure of the
solutions to these problems.

The research that is proposed under this grant is focused on the development of
algorithms with provable performance guarantees that are capable of solving
extremely large scale optimization problems whose solutions are either sparse or
have special structure. Such problems arise under the paradigm of compressive
sensing, which allows signals (e.g., radar) and images (e.g., CT and MRI scans)
to be obtained with far fewer measurements than predicted by traditional theory,
various extensions of CS, and in a broad array of problems in machine learning.
All of these problems are aimed at extracting a "sparse" or low-dimensional true
model from a high dimensional or dense empirical model or data. They have
important applications in extracting information from surveillance video and
hyper-spectral images, face recognition, medical imaging and data mining,as well
as many other areas of strategic interest such as national security and
biotechnology.
