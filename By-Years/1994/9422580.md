9422580 LAURIA Individual home ownership has generally been held as a positive
goal for society and the macroeconomy, as evidenced by the range of public
policies encouraging home ownership in the US. Home ownership is not only an
additive process, as some households lose possession of their homes. The most
dramatic end to home ownership is the foreclosure of property. Current academic
and policy discussions of residential foreclosure have the unfortunate context
of under-conceptualization of the issue and a lack of empirical information
about the correlates of foreclosure. We have little theoretical or empirical
knowledge concerning the effect of housing foreclosure on home ownership rates,
neighborhood conditions and stability, and the spatial structure of the city.
The proposed research uses a range of available theoretical and empirical
background to develop a set of hypotheses about: the economic and neighborhood
(social and institutional) determinants of foreclosure rates; the institutional
and economic determinants of the socio-economic results of homeowner
foreclosure; and the effects of foreclosure on the physical form of the city
(distribution of households by age, size, and income; residential versus non-
residential land uses). The empirical study will be conducted on foreclosure
activity and aftermath in New Orleans during and since the late 1980s. Data on
foreclosures will come from court records. Data on socio-economic
characteristics of foreclosees and purchasers will be collected via household
survey. Data on neighborhood characteristics will come from the US Census. The
ultimate purpose of the research is to enable municipal governments to predict
the effects of changed rates of foreclosure (depending in part on the
macroeconomic and institutional reasons for changes in those rates), and to
enable governments at all levels to reduce the rates and the negative effects of
homeowner foreclosure.
