ABSTRACT OPP-9728820 OSHERENKO, GAIL DARTMOUTH COLLEGE This award supports an
international workshop on reindeer/caribou grazing systems, particularly the
impact on large-scale development of ecosystems and human systems. The proposal
will bring together natural and social scientists working on arctic grazing
systems, residents of the Arctic who are dependent on the sustainability of
arctic grazing systems, and policy makers involved in resource management within
the Arctic. The results of the workshop are important for understanding the
potential effects on resident subsistence communities from global changes that
could potentially affect grazing populations.
