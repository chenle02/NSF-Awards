This project develops the experimental software, hardware, assembly techniques,
demonstration examples, teaching materials and techniques to enable students and
faculty in schools, colleges, and universities to build and learn from
experimentation with their own parallel computer. This is accomplished using
off-the-shelf motherboards and other components of typical persona computer
hardware. The premise is that this can be done at very low cost and yet provide
a relatively sophisticated parallel computer that will allow the user to see
most if not all of the fundamental concepts involved in parallel computation.
