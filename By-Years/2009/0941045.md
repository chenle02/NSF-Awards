The goal of the project, which is a collaboration involving Northern Illinois
University, Texas A &amp; M University, and North Carolina State University, is
to develop course materials in modern manufacturing technologies and establish
methodologies for collaborative teaching and learning of these materials. The
course materials reflect advanced manufacturing processes recently adopted by
industry and state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies and have the potential
for significant near-term impact on industry. The course is taught
simultaneously at all three universities and the students are collaborating
across university boundaries and so the project includes significant efforts in
the design and development of collaborative teaching and learning mechanisms.
The evaluation, being conducted by an experienced evaluator, is examining the
effectiveness of the instructional material and strategies and the effect on
student learning. The project team is disseminating through website postings,
conference presentations, and journal publications. Broader impacts include the
dissemination of the instructional materials and results.
