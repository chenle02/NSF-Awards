With the support of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Prof. Charles
S. Johnson of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will pursue a
number of research objectives: 1) he will expand the capabilities of Diffusion
Order Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (DOSY), so that it can be used to
study systems with very small diffusion coefficients. This will require very
large magnetic field gradients, and Johnson plans on exploiting the large fringe
fields of the superconducting magnet for the pulsed field gradient NMR. 2) He
plans on measuring molecular weight distributions of fluoropolymers in
supercritical carbon dioxide, an environmentally benign solvent; this will
require the design of a high pressure instrument. 3) Johnson will develop
heteronuclear DOSY, and 4) he will make improvements on electrophoretic NMR
techniques using Mobility Ordered 2-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, or MOSY. DOSY
and electrophoretic NMR allow the measurement of molecular diffusion
coefficients as a function of the chemical shifts of the various species present
in a mixture. This new work will extend considerably the range of diffusion
coefficients which can be measured, while also providing better sensitivity and
resolution. Supercritical carbon dioxide is a viable replacement for aqueous and
organic solvent systems, especially the ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons. The
research effort in fluoropolymers in supercritical fluids should prove critical
to furthering the basic understanding of the chemistry and dynamics of these
solution systems.
