9529071 Crain The goal of this project is to develop a new and fairly simple
method for creating targeted point mutations in genes in mice. Should the
approach prove successful it would substantially increase our ability to create
precise modifications in targeted genes in vivo. This would make it possible to
carry out much more sophisticated analyses of mammalian gene function and
regulation, and thus greatly enhance the study of mammalian genetics and
development. The experimental strategy is to promote homologous recombination
with targeted genes in embryos by injecting single strand oligonucleotides
(carrying the desired sequence change) into pronuclei. The theoretical basis for
this approach is that triple stranded DNA structures appear to be required
intermediates of normal homologous recombination. The empirical basis is that it
has been shown that introduced single strand DNA and oligonucleotides
participate in homologous recombination in mammalian cells and yeast, indicating
that they probably are incorporated into the putative triple strand
intermediates. Also, it has been suggested that single strand DNA is less likely
to incorporate randomly into host genomic DNA than is double strand DNA. If this
is the case, then the upper limit of the amount of DNA that can be introduced
without nonspecific toxicity to the embryos should be much higher with single
than with double strand molecules. The critical question that will be tested in
these experiments is whether a sufficiently high number of single strand
molecules can be injected to raise the rate of homologous recombination with
targeted genes to a level that can be detected without genetic selection. ***
