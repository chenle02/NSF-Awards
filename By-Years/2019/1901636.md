This proposal supports student travel to attend the 2018 Computer Security
Foundations Symposium (CSF) to be held in Hoboken, New Jersey in Summer 2018.
CSF is an annual conference for researchers in computer security, to examine
current theories of security, the formal models that provide a context for those
theories, and techniques for verifying security. This travel grant will enable
career development and learning opportunities for US-based and/or US citizen
graduate students. Attending conferences is an important component of graduate
school education for our society's future computer security researchers.
Students have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class
computer security researchers, and establish networks, connections, and
mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
