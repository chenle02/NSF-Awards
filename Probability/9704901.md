9704901 Pisztora The investigator proposes to study several inter-related
projects in random spatial models, more specifically in ordinary and invasion
percolation, in Ising and random cluster models, and in first passage
percolation. In ordinary and invasion percolation the critical behavior of the
chemical distance will be investigated. Another project is concerned with the
large deviation behavior of the random resistor network. In Ising and random
cluster models the investigator intends to study the rigidity (roughness) of
certain phase boundaries. In particular, questions related to roughening in
higher dimensional percolation models will be studied. The investigator also
intends to work on questions concerning the shape of certain interfaces. The
project in first passage type models includes work on comparison principles
between minimizing paths and certain random walks, and (jointly with another
colleague) on the confinement property of directed polymers in a random
environment. The aim of this project is to study certain geometric aspects of
random spatial systems. In some random systems geometric objects (in this case
surfaces) which are deterministic on a macroscopic scale arise naturally.
Examples of such objects are phase boundaries and droplets ("crystals") in spin
systems or the frontier of the invaded region in first passage percolation,
which is a basic model for randomly evolving (growing) surfaces. Both the
(asymptotic) shapes and the fluctuations of these objects are of prime concern
with great theoretical and practical interest. Many of the proposed problems and
models have their origin (and are still studied) in statistical physics,
materials science, chemistry, and condensed matter physics. The project's final
goal is to gain some insight into the behavior of random surfaces - objects
which seem to appear just about everywhere in nature, but are known to be
difficult to understand from the theoretical (mathematical) p oint of view.
