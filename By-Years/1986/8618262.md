This project supports a conference which identifies new research needs and
opportunities in the field of nonlinear dynamics. The workshop's objectives are
to recommend important generic areas of nonlinear dynamics research for the next
decade, to identify and rank specific research problems within these generic
areas, and to demonstrate the relevance and importance of these areas to the
competitiveness of U.S. industry.
