This dissertation research project will conduct an ethnographic study of
households' budgeting decisions and the importance of trust, in relation to
market factors, in informal lending practices in urban Zambia. The questions
asked are how personal trust is used in informal and semi-formal credit
relationships, and how trust is maintained across changing and difficult
economic situations. Methods include participant observation, semi-structured
interviews, survey sampling of a number of households, and an extensive period
of budget recording and analysis of a smaller sample of households. This
research is important because informal economic relations are becoming more and
more significant in both developed and developing countries as economies worsen.
Increased understanding of the strategies and issues that poor urban households
follow in obtaining necessary cash for subsistence will help decision makers
deal with potential causes of urban discontent.
