This award will support Professor C. Denise Caldwell of the University of
Central Florida in a research collaboration with Professor J. Jimenez-Mier of
the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM). The investigators intend to
measure the alignment of photoions as determined through the angular
distribution of decay fluorescence. The experiments will be performed at the
University of Wisconsin Synchrotron Radiation Center with an apparatus that has
been specifically constructed for performing this type of experiment. The
experimental effort will be joined by the investigator from Mexico, who will be
responsible for all data analysis and analytic interpretation. Measurement of
alignment of photoions by fluorescence analysis is a relative newcomer to the
group of techniques that are available for study of electron-electron
correlation. Due to its sensitivity to effects of this interaction, it has the
potential of becoming a powerful tool, especially for analysis at thresholds. In
addition to the application of this technique to the study of various systems,
the investigators will try to interpret its measurements in terms of existing
theories.
