Work under this award will investigate the possibility that the equator may
exercise an important control on the deep global circulation of an ocean driven
by the thermal contrast between polar and tropical regions. Both a linear
analytic model and a nonlinear numerical model of the equatorial ocean will be
used to study the response of the deep equatorial ocean to the buoyancy loss
that produces dense waters at high latitudes. Particular attention will be paid
to the geometry and the dynamics of the cross-equatorial flow. Another focus
will be on the possibility that the high-latitude buoyancy forcing may drive the
highly baroclinic zonal jets along the equator that have been observed in both
the Pacific and the Indian oceans.
