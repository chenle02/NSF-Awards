This project will develop a cognitive model addressing human learning in the
domain of computer programming. Building on prior research and additional
psychological studies to be carried out, the comprehension of instructional text
is formulated as a problem solving process in which the goal is to construct
mental models of domain entities, process principles, and problem solving
heuristics. New concepts introduced in these texts may be given meaning by
explaining their relation to examples presented in instruction. One major goal
of this project will be to model differences among learners in the self-
explanation of examples. Specifically, preliminary studies show that learners
differ in the way that they explain examples to themselves, and these
differences have significant correlations with subsequent programming
performance. Another major goal will be to study and develop a model whereby
learners reflect on their problem solving and generate new strategies. Both of
these areas have received little study in cognitive science. Our results should
be important to the psychology of learning in complex formal domains, the
acquisition and modification of knowledge in machine learning, and instructional
research.
