The activities described in this proposal will serve to advance the field of
spinal orthotics through the further development and eventual commercialization
of a thoracopelvic orthosis that reduces the muscle effort required to maintain
flexed postures of the trunk. The device at the heart of this proposal is a
novel thoracopelvic orthosis which incorporates a closed-loop control system to
drive an electromechanical support structure that allows for the wearer to
remain supported in a variety of postures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The continued
development of this thoracopelvic orthosis will integrate knowledge from both
biomechanics and robotics, and will expand the research and development of
powered exoskeletons (a.k.a. "wearable robots") to include accurate following of
spinal motion (cervical and lumbar, especially). The orthosis will initially be
developed as a form of ergonomic support for surgeons and other highly-trained
professionals that could reduce lost productivity and medical costs of this
population. Eventually, the novel functionality of this orthosis could enhance
general patient care through the creation of a new mode of orthotic treatment
that serves as a "bridge therapy" between current orthotic treatment physical
therapy; as the patient heals, a remote clinician could wirelessly reprogram the
orthosis mechanical response (range of motion, mechanical stiffness/damping)
that gradually reintroduces motion while lowering support, thus leaving the
patient with a more normal level of spinal mobility and reduced need for further
physical therapy.
