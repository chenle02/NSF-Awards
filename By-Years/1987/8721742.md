This research will study nonlinear partial differential equations associated
with the semiconductor device system from both an analytical and algorithmic
point of view. These equations are of elliptic/hyperbolic or elliptic/parabolic/
hyperbolic subtypes. One part of this research will continue work on a drift-
diffusion model and examine issues related to rapidly changing coefficients. A
second portion will use the TVD scheme to examine a hydrodynamic model. The
models considered in this work should increase understanding of multi-valley
semiconductors currently of interest, such as gallium arsenide.
