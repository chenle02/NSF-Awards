Dynamics of Postural Control During Precision Manual Activity&lt;br/&gt;Michael
Riley (PI) &amp; Kevin Shockley (Co-
PI)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The control of
standing balance is fundamental to other behaviors people &lt;br/&gt;perform,
such as the precise hand movements performed by surgeons or &lt;br/&gt;artists.
Since standing upright requires placing the body in an unstable
&lt;br/&gt;state, and because the neuromuscular system is highly complex and
"noisy,"&lt;br/&gt;the body's center of mass constantly fluctuates when a person
stands &lt;br/&gt;(termed postural sway). Postural sway is transmitted to the
hands and can &lt;br/&gt;thus hinder manual performance (imagine trying to
thread a needle while&lt;br/&gt;standing on one foot). The purpose of this
proposal is to determine how &lt;br/&gt;postural control is modulated when
people perform the precision manual &lt;br/&gt;action of lightly touching a
surface with a fingertip.&lt;br/&gt;The research will identify the adaptive
postural dynamics associated with &lt;br/&gt;integrating postural control and
precision manual actions. Experiments are &lt;br/&gt;planned in which postural
stability and the demands of a fingertip &lt;br/&gt;force-production task are
varied. The variability and temporal dynamics of &lt;br/&gt;postural sway are
expected to be precisely tuned to the demands of the &lt;br/&gt;touching task
under conditions in which balance is not threatened, but &lt;br/&gt;threats to
postural stability are expected to limit the extent to which &lt;br/&gt;postural
control is adapted to the manual task. The research will shed &lt;br/&gt;light
on fundamental mechanisms of balance control and will also have
&lt;br/&gt;important applications to physical rehabilitation and efforts to
develop &lt;br/&gt;fall-prevention programs.&lt;br/&gt;
