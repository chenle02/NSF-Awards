This program explores the basic phenomena that lead to the development of
crystallographic texture during hot deformation of rapidly-quenched neodymium-
iron-boron magnets. Emphasis is placed on two aspects of the texture: (1) the
intergranular phases in the magnets, how they differ in magnets made by
conventional sintering compared to rapid solidification, and how they depend on
the presence of additional alloying elements such as copper. High resolution
electron microscopy and Auger spectroscopy are used to explore these topics. (2)
Because the driving force for texture formation is believed to be a difference
in elastic energy between grains of different orientation under stress, data is
needed on the elastic constants above ambient temperatures. Sintered magnets
that are properly oriented are to be measured to determine the elastic constants
parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis as a function of temperature, up to 700
degrees Celsius. %%% Texture plays an important role in the properties of
magnetic metal alloys. This research provides important information on the
processing factors controlling texture in an important class of magnet alloys.
