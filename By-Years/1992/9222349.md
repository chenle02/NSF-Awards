Dopamine is one of the most important transmitters in the brain. Too little
dopamine leads to Parkinson's disease. Too much is associated with dysfunctional
stereotyped behavior. This transmitter is also crucially involved in
reinforcement and reward. During his previous NSF grant, Dr. Wightman has
perfected a technique for monitoring the temporal course of dopamine release
with high spatial resolution in awake behaving animals. The technique, called in
vivo voltammetry, utilizes highly sensitive carbon fiber electrodes that
register voltage changes when dopamine is released. Using this technique he will
now determine whether the different behavioral effects of dopamine on motor and
reward systems are associated with different patterns of release and uptake by
neurons in the brain systems that are associated with motor behavior and reward.
The results will have wide implications for theories of how the brain
coordinates behavior and mediates reward. This project is an example of how new
technology makes it possible to answer old questions.***//
