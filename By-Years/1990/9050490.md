The lack of laboratory experiences in molecular genetics is being remedied by
developing a laboratory course in molecular biology that is taken concurrently
with the Molecular Biology lecture component. Laboratory experiences include DNA
extractions and plasmic isolations, DNA detection and quantitation methods,
restriction enzyme digestions, ligations of restriction fragments, gene marker
selection procedures, agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA transfer and
hybridization methods. The purchase of centrifuges and rotors, power supplies
for electrophoresis experiments, fluorometers for DNA quantitation, incubators
and baths for enzyme reactions allow this laboratory to be taught to biology
majors and medical technology students. The equipment is also used by students
enrolled in honors program research or independent study. The university will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
