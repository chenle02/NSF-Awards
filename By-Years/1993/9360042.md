ABSTRACT --- III-9360042 Zamansky The PI proposes a novel improvement in
industrial waste incineration which he claims will solve all problems associated
with the incineration of halogenated materials. By the addition of Na2CO3 to the
feed, he hopes to convert all halogen contained in any halogenated organic
compound (HOC), including products of incomplete combustion (PIC), into the
corresponding sodium salt. Proposal includes experiments and calculations to
demonstrate this proposed concept. The important factors affecting this process
will be identified and attempts will be made to show that the process can occur
with reaction times, temperatures and other conditions which are in the
practical range for application to waste incineration. A very important
application would be in the aluminum smelting industry, where emissions of
perfluorinated alkanes can pose a severe environmental problem.
