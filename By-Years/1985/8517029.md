Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building construction in the
U.S. and the world. Reinforced masonry construction use is increasing in
moderate to higher seismic zones because of its apparent features of economy,
fire safety, architectural flexibility, and ease of construction. The present
state of masonry structural analysis and design and materials and construction
technologies does not enable an accurate prediction of building behavior under
lateral loads such as seismic loads. The performance of the composite grout-
reinforcing-masonry system is important to the ability of a reinforced masonry
system to resist seismic loads. This research project will investigate the
effects of shrinkage and bridging defects on the bond between the grout and the
cavity wall in the composite and the effects of shrinkage and bridging on the
bond between the grout and the reinforcing.
