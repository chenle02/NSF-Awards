A conference entitled, "Computational Biofluids in Physiology 2015 (CBP 2015)",
will be held at the University of Utah on May 14-15, 2015. Computational
biofluids is an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of mathematics,
physics, computing, engineering, and biology. Although classical biofluids
problems such as low Reynolds number locomotion have been studied theoretically
for decades, the studies were limited to problems that were analytically
tractable. These problems can now be probed with greater depth and biological
relevance using computational methods. The power of personal computing combined
with development of new algorithms has led to a revival of research in
biofluids. Problems in physiology relating to the function of heart valves, the
mechanics of blood clotting, and the mechanics of motile cells are also now
being investigated using novel applied mathematical techniques and computational
models. Integrative research on these biological and physiological processes has
the potential to lead to medical advances such as the prevention of heart
attacks, strokes, and cancer metastasis.

The applied mathematics community has played a central role in the resurgence of
biofluids by developing theories, algorithms, and models aimed at answering
fundamental biological and physical questions. While some in this community
focus primarily on computation and numerics, others stay closer to the biology
or physics of the problem at hand. This meeting on "Computational Biofluids in
Physiology 2015" will bring together mix of senior and junior researchers from
mathematics, computational science, and the life sciences in a small,
exceptionally interactive setting. Invited speakers and poster contributors will
present work on computational methods for fluid/structure interaction, cellular
mechanics, locomotion, and systems physiology.
