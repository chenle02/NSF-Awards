This grant provides support to analyze data gathered from other funding in a
region of the San Andreas fault at San Francisco bay. The data was recorded from
a USGS active marine seismic profile across the ocean-land transition and up the
East Bay. The goal is to use fan-geometry deployments to provide structural
information constraining the depth of penetration of the individual strike-slip
faults in the area. In-line geometry recordings will be used to measure
velocities across the faults to constrain the maximum depth to which velocity
differences occur across the individual strike-slip faults. This research is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
