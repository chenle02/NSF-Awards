All life on this planet is ultimately dependent on photosynthesis for its energy
requirements. At Arizona State University the Center for the Study of Early
Events in Photosynthesis, comprised of faculty in the departments of Botany,
Chemistry and Biochemistry, takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding
the energy storage process carried out by photosynthetic organisms and mimicking
photosynthesis using artificial systems. Undergraduate students will participate
in the individual research programs of the center faculty. Projects will include
organic synthesis and spectroscopic studies of model compounds, spectroscopic
studies of bacterial and plant photosynthetic reaction centers, and molecular
biology and genetics of photosynthetic systems. Structured interaction between
faculty and student participants, including the weekly photosynthesis seminar
series, research group meetings, instrumentation workshops and a concluding
undergraduate symposium, will help educate the students in the extremely diverse
modern approach to the study of photosynthesis. Student participants will be
recruited from targeted colleges and universities in the Southwest United States
with the help of local department chairs and individual faculty.
