Western Nevada Community College, a rural school, is providing its students with
state-of-the-art instruments in laboratory instruction. These instruments use
computer interfaces and software that allows for detailed visualization of
tissue, cell, and molecular samples from biological sources. Physiological
equipment gives the students the opportunity to experiment with physiological
variables such as respiration and cardiac activity. The UV-Visible
spectrophotometer allows for the analysis of biological materials such as plant
pigment extracts, and is interfaced with a computer for graphic portrayal. The
project has a great impact on students who will enter the work force in fields
such as nursing, agriculture, medicine, and nutrition in which this expertise
will be important. The college is contributing 104% of the award.
