ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0331843&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partial funds for
travel and conference costs for speakers, session chairs and organizers have
been requested to support the Symposium on New Approaches in Marine Organic
Chemistry and Biogeochemistry to be held August 28-30, 2003 at the University of
Washington Friday Harbor Laboratory on San Juan Island. The primary goal of the
symposium is to get together investigators which are leaders in the field of
organic biogeochemistry, as well as graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and
junior faculty to discuss and disseminate new approaches and progress in
analytical, methodological and conceptual questions pivotal to the field.
Subthemes of the symposium will include organic matter preservation, water
column transformations, black carbon, organic biomarkers, terrigenous organic
matter and microbial/photochemical transformations. In addition, round table
discussions will be held on the topics of marine gel processes and chemical
reference standards. It is anticipated that approximately 80 participants will
attend the meeting. Results from the symposium will be published in a special
edition of the journal Marine Chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
