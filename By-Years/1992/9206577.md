Substrate adhesion molecules (SAMs) belong to a family of adhesive
glycoproteins which occur in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of a variety of
organisms. Vitronectin (VN) is a SAM that has been implicated in cell adhesion
and migration. The PI's have established that a homolog to VN occurs in the
primary cell wall of plants, and have evidence for its role in facilitating
pollen tube extension in the style. The proposed research is a multi- faceted
approach to understanding the expression, localization, and function of
vitronectin-like molecules during plant development. The experiments proposed
will specifically test the role of VN- like molecules during pollination.
Immunocytochemical and fluorescence staining techniques will be used to examine
the relationship between components of the cytoskeleton, VN-like molecules, and
VN receptors (integrins) during pollen tube elongation and during shoot
ontogeny. Synthetic peptides that are known to mediate adhesion of VN to its
integrin will be used to determine their effect on pollen tube elongation in
vivo and in vitro. cDNA clones that encode VN-like proteins will be isolated and
characterized. The levels of VN RNA during plant development will be examined by
RNA blot and in situ hybridizations. The role of VN-like proteins during plant
development will be tested by overexpressing and underexpressing VN RNAs using
chimeric gene constructs in transgenic plants.
