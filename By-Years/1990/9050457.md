A laminar flow hood, two CO2 incubators, an ultrafreezer, a cryogenic freezer,
and an inverted microscope are allowing the development of a cell culture
facility for undergraduates. The students can establish and maintain cell lines,
culture viruses, establish lymphocyte cultures and raise and screen monoclonal
antibodies. Some of these techniques are being used in the introductory course,
while others are being incorporated into Microbiology, Cellular/Molecular
Biology, and Immunology courses. Introduction of students to these contemporary
biological techniques will help them to compete more successfully for careers
after graduation from Adams State, a school which serves a rural area with a
high minority population. The school will contribute an amount equal to the
award.
