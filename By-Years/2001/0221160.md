Under this award, the PIs will attempt to quantify the cold seep barite
contribution to the marine sediment record. This will first involve quantifying
the cold seep barite (an important carrier of Ba ) contribution to Ba and Ra
fluxes within the San Clemente basin. Secondly, the PIs will quantify the
effects of this source on the chemical signature of barite in the basin
sediments. In general, the idea is to better understand the sources and sinks of
Ba and its mass balance in preserved sediments in the San Clemente basin. The
study will involve a field component to study the water column, deploy sediment
traps, and collect core samples. The laboratory component consists of a very
wide variety of elemental and isotopic techniques to characterize sample
materials. The results of this general study of the stability, transport and
diagenesis of barite has numerous applications to a variety of related
questions, and may result in better use of Ba as a paleoproxy of productivity.
