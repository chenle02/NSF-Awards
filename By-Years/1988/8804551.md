This is a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site award. The 10-week
summer research program is designed to enlarge the very small numbers of
minority students entering the field of experimental psychology. Ten students
between their junior and senior years will be enrolled. At least five students
will be from colleges with substantial black undergraduate enrollments. In this
program, students will be assigned to laboratories in which they will help
design, carry out and analyze the results of a research project, under the
supervision of a regular full-time faculty member in the Syracuse Psychology
Department. Students will make both oral presentations and written reports of
their projects. Advisors will evaluate reports through written comments sent to
the students after the end of the program. Students will evaluate the program by
completing forms distributed at the middle and end of the summer. Information
about actual career choices and the impact of the summer program on those
choices, will be solicited from students, home departments and advisors at the
end of the academic year following the program.
