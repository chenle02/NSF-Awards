Abstract 9731384 Metzger This project, sponsored by San Jose State University,
is a five-year program which will help K-12 teachers in the San Jose Unified
School District (SJUSD) to teach earth science. The project will serve 128
teachers, including at least two from each SJUSD school, and prepare 32 teachers
to become District leaders in earth science curriculum. Teachers and
administrators will be exposed to the content of exemplary materials in earth
science and the project will connect with on-going earth science projects in the
schools. The program will consist of a two week summer workshop followed by
extensive academic year activities. There will be a separate Leadership program.
These teachers will have further content training, practice peer teaching and
help program implementation in the SJUSD schools. Additional teachers will be
served by the project through the academic year program and through mentoring by
the lead teachers. Matching funds constitute 20% of the NSF award.
