Abstract The President's White House Conference> on Science and Economics
Research Related to Global Change April 17-18, 1990 Washington, D.C. The White
House Conference, hosted by President Bush, is designed as an important step
towards substantially enhancing and broadening international understanding of
the critical science and economic research issues, framing a strategy for
implementing a joint international science and economics research effort and
linking that knowledge to the policy process. The Conference will be devoted to
science and economic issues relevant to policies on global change, including
climate. The primary objectives of the Conference are to: Improve our
understanding of the current state of international knowledge in scientific and
economic research, Identify major gaps and uncertainties in both scientific and
economic understanding, Assess the analytic tools and data that are found to be
essential to improving both national and international environmental policy, and
sensitizing the three communities involved to the activities and needs of the
others in addressing global change research, and. Develop a joint "Strategy
Document" in which the expertise, experience, and data available in the
participating countries can be brought together in a more integrated and
coherent fashion to address global change issues.
