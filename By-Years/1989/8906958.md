The research will address problems in condensed matter physics which are
concerned with explaining and predicting the physical properties of a variety of
interesting materials which are currently subjects of experimental studies and
technological promise. The properties of these materials are so unusual that new
theoretical approaches and techniques are often required. These will be
developed based primarily on the methods of quantum statistical mechanics. The
materials which will be investigated in this research project include: High-Tc
superconductors, the general class of disordered electronic substances, new
strongly- correlated metallic and magnetic materials, and quantum solids and
liquids.
