Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0113863&lt;br/&gt;Galloway&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N2001 - The
Second International Nitrogen Conference&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Production of food
and energy increases the amount of biologically active nitrogen that circulates
among the world's atmosphere, soils, forests, and waters. The world's natural
resources and environmental systems respond to nitrogen enrichment with positive
benefits such as increased production of food and timber, and negative
consequences, such as eutrophication of ecosystems, regional haze, and global
warming. The three goals of this conference are to increase scientific knowledge
about N sources and effects; stimulate communication among leaders in N
production and consumption; and explore balanced policy strategies by which to
increase food and energy production while decreasing environmental
impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
