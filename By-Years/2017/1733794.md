The goal of this project is to investigate the question of provenance in
federated distributed systems, such as networks and scientific workflows, where
several self-interested entities generate and share data, and compute and make
decisions on the shared data. Computations and decisions give rise themselves to
new shared data. Provenance analysis allows us to understand the contributions
of the various entities to the data. This project seeks to put provenance on a
sound mathematical foundation by unifying the theoretical notion of semiring
provenance with practical approaches to network provenance. The PIs would also
like to design new algorithms and compression techniques for collecting and
managing provenance data. A second thrust of the project is to compute and
associate reliability scores to each data item, in conjunction with their
provenance. In order to do this, the PIs will design techniques for assigning
reliability scores to primitive data items, as well as a calculus based on sound
axiomatic principles for assigning reliability scores to derived data items.
This project will achieve broad impact by allowing for networks to operate more
reliably and by enhancing reproducibility in scientific workflows.
