0228894&lt;br/&gt;Elser&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a U.S.-China
joint workshop proposed by Dr. James Elser, Arizona State University, on
ecological complexity and ecosystem services. The workshop will bring together
American and Chinese researchers in biocomplexity and ecosystem services in a
series of interactions designed to establish a network of international
collaboration and exchange. A preliminary meeting between U.S. and Chinese
organizers will be held in November, 2002, and a U.S. delegation of 12
scientists will visit China in spring, 2003.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit of this proposal is outstanding. The area of ecosystem
services is emerging as a topic for fundamental research. The proposed
collaborative activities would benefit ecological science and its contribution
to the management of complex ecological/economic systems. The Chinese Academy of
Sciences, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and NSF will jointly
support the cooperative activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
