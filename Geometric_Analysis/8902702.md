The Principal Investigator will study Riemannian metrics of constant scalar
curvature and related problems in nonlinear partial differential equations. He
will study the geometry of singularities for solutions of differential equations
arising from the Yamabe problem. And he will use the Calculus of Variations to
analyze blow-ups of solutions to the parabolic equation arising from the
harmonic map problem. For many years mathematicians studied geometry with
techniques which have their origins in the Calculus. Other mathematicians and
physicists used differential equations to understand motion and heat flow. The
PI will combine the two techniques to solve various geometric problems arising
from heat flow theory and cosmology.
