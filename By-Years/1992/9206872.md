During gastrulation the embryo undergoes a dramatic reorganization, as massive
morphogenetic movements and tissue differentiation result in the formation of
patterned structures arrayed along the body axis. The cells that participate in
morphogenesis at the gastrula stage must presumably "read out" information
regarding their position along the axes of the forming embryo, and use that
information as they produce patterned structures. Dr. Harden's laboratory has
focused on pattern formation during gastrulation in a seemingly simple system,
the sea urchin embryo, in order to discover general rules that all embryos use
to produce patterned structures during gastrulation. Using experimental
approaches that are unique to this system, we have found that mesenchyme cells
in that sea urchin embryo form patterned structures in response to spatially
localized target information in the ectoderm or underlying basal lamina. This
proposal is aimed at gaining a greater understanding of these target recognition
events, using molecular biology, computer-enhanced imaging techniques, and
classical embryology. Specifically, this proposal seeks to answer the following
questions: (1) What is the nature of the interaction between cells and their
targets? (2) When and how do these targets arise during development? (3) What is
the molecular nature of these targets? Our long term goal is to understand the
rules that cells use to interact with one another in a coordinated fashion to
transform the structure of the embryo during gastrulation.
