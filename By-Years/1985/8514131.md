A new fiber has been demonstrated that has a synergistic combination of
synthetic fiber mechanical properties and natural fiber surface properties, as
contrasted to the normal averaging of properties obtained from blends of
synthetic and natural fibers. Textile fabrics produced from this fiber should
maintain the crease and tear resistance of the nylon core, yet have the water
sorphirity and dyeability of the rayon skin. The goal of this research is to use
this unique fiber as a model to relate the surface and bulk properties of fibers
to the properties of the yarns and fabrics to which they will be converted. The
material properties of these fibers, yarns, and fabrics will in turn be related
to the processing conditions used to produce them. In order to produce
sufficient quantities of the fibers for conversion into test fabric pieces.
Multiple filament dies will be designed using CAD/CAM.
