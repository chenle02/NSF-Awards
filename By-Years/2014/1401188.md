With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program in
the Chemistry Division is supporting the research of Francis D'Souza of the
University of North Texas, Denton, to develop new materials that have the
potential to aid in solar energy technology. These new materials include
sensitizers capable of capturing light energy in the visible and near-infrared
region in order to make maximum use of available sunlight. The project is
focused on the development and construction of complexes between these
sensitizers and electrically-conductive carbon compounds such as graphene,
carbon nanotubes and fullerenes. The project involves collaboration between the
US scientists and other investigators from Japan, Finland and Poland. It is,
thus, having a broader impact on the training of the next generation of
scientists who must function in a global setting. It is having a further broad
impact on the development of alternative energy
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on synthesizing photo-
active, supramolecular functional materials that are capable of generating long-
lived charge separated states. The project will establish the role of covalent
and non-covalent interactions on the mechanistic and kinetic aspects of
photoinduced electron and energy transfer; the key parameters of solar energy
harvesting materials. Systematic studies are being conducted using steady-state
and time-resolved emission, and nanosecond and femtosecond transient absorption
techniques, to gain better understanding of the inter-relationship between
supramolecular structures and electron transfer properties in solution and at
the material/electrode interface.
