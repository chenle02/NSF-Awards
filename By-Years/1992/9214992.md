The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) of Michigan State
University is a national user facility for research in nuclear science. This
cooperative agreement provides funds for the operation of NSCL, for support of
its user program, and for the research of the Michigan State University staff
and the training of graduates students in nuclear science, accelerator physics,
and instrumentation physics. The facilities at NSCL include the K1200
superconducting cyclotron, the A1200 beam analysis and fragment separator
system, and a wide variety of detection instruments for use in heavy-ion nuclear
science experiments. High quality primary beams are available for the entire
mass range of ions from hydrogen to uranium. Secondary beams produced by nuclear
reactions are also available for studies of nuclear structure and nuclear
astrophysics. Instrumentation development, particularly involving
superconducting technology, is a major effort supported by this agreement.
