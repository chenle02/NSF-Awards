This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Evolution
Equations on Singular Spaces," to be held at the Centre Internationale de
Recontres Mathematiques in Luminy, France from April 25 to 29,
2016.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference focuses on recent developments in
Analysis, especially in the field of partial differential equations. A number of
distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.
The award gives early career researchers, researchers who are members of
underrepresented groups, researchers not funded by NSF a chance to attend and
participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make
this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different
