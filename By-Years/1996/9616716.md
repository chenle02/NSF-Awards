This research is exploring the development of a very different approach to image
coding based on representing an image by a large collection of statistics. The
approach is motivated by the recognition that state-of-the-art wavelet image
coders owe their superior coding performance to more accurate statistical
modeling of coefficients. The accuracy of these models is limited by the cost in
bitrate of transmitting the statistics needed to support the modeling. Our
approach makes more explicit use of model statistics to allow direct
representation of the image with those statistics. The statistics serve both to
maximize the accuracy of the statistical modeling and to represent the image
itself. Consequently, many more statistics can afford to be transmitted and
modeling accuracy is greatly improved. The approach has shown very promising
preliminary results, and promises to substantially advance the state-of-the-art
in image coding. The approach also suggests new opportunities for managing the
perceptual quality of coding algorithms through perceptually optimized
quantization of the new representation. These perceptual issues will also be
investigated.
