9424063 Flickinger This project is on research to study the polymer technology
of immobilizing cells as well as the behavior of confined cells under starvation
conditions. The immobilization system consists of three layers: a non porous
support; cells and polymer; and a thin covering skin. Cell viability after
preparation and storage, as well as the expression of different genes, message
stability, etc. will be investigated. The morphology of the matrix will also be
characterized and used to improve the biological outcome. A major goal of the
research is to maximize the viability of the immobilized cells. Also, the
periodic revival of the cells by nutrient addition will be examined. ***
