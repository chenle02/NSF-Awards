Dr. Peter Bodenheimer and his colleague at the University of California, Santa
Cruz, Dr. Douglas Lin will use theoretical techniques to study the progression
through the process of star formation to the formation of planets. The
theoretical models are constrained by the properties of the planetary system as
well as by the rich observational information now available regarding young
stellar objects. The origin and evolution of the solar nebula and the formation
of the planets provides a challenging problem for the theorist. Theories must
explain extensive compilations of observational data, ranging from meteoritic
abundance anomalies to the properties of outflows from young stars. Recently
there has been a rapid accumulation of infrared and ultraviolet data from T
Tauri stars, which has led to the strengthening of the hypothesis that accretion
disks are present around many of these objects. These disks may be
protoplanetary disks. A wide variety of physical processes is involved and must
be incorporated into theoretical studies of star and planet formation. Drs.
Bodenheimer and Lin concentrate on the formation and evolution of the solar
nebula itself. Significant progress is being made with the aid of enhanced
interdisciplinary contact and improved computer facilities.
