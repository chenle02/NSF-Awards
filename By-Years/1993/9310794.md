This is a study of American racial attitudes through 1993, building on earlier
research published in the book, Racial Attitudes in America: Trends and
Interpretations, which charted these trends through 1983. It will analyze them
in more recent data sets such as the 1992 National Election Study, the 1993
General Social Survey, and the most recent, relevant Gallup survey. Contemporary
racial issues will be included, and the project will incorporate new empirical
and theoretical work that will enrich the interpretations of important
relationships between change in racial attitudes and other variables, such as
age, attitudes toward government enforcement, and the effects of social
desirability on the validity of self-reported opinion. This research will
contribute significantly to the field of race and ethnic relations, one of the
intellectually most important areas of sociology with the greatest significance
for American social policy. The original book was very influential with both
scholars and educated non-academic readers, and the addition of a decade of data
and theoretical insights will be a substantial contribution to the knowledge
base for understanding one of the most difficult social problems in the United
States.
