This doctoral dissertation project will examine the types of geopolitical
barriers new migrants face while accessing and obtaining healthcare in the U.S.
South. This study goes beyond the usual studies of healthcare access as it
analyzes actual healthcare experiences, thereby contributing to new health
geography by focusing on how migrants experience healthcare access. This study
also contributes to migration research that examines the region of the U.S.
South as it is currently being shaped by new migration. Combining archival
research, participant observation, interviews, and focus groups, this project
answers a set of questions that address the barriers that exist for migrant
access to healthcare, how these barriers have been created, and the role that
struggling with these barriers plays in the shaping of citizenship in the U.S.

Findings from this project will be made available via a research report as the
results will be of interest to healthcare providers, advocates, as well as
policymakers. Results from this research will be included in undergraduate
teaching. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Award, this project
will provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent
research career.
