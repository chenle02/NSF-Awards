This project will advance knowledge about design of intelligent agents. It has
two objectives. The first objective is the development of mathematical insights
and procedures for automating feature discovery and learning by evolution -- two
biologically inspired forms of long-term learning -- in the construction of
automatic pattern classifiers. The second objective is the incorporation of
automated feature discovery and evolution in automatic analyzers of large-scale
image data banks and time-varying visual signals. This project will work to
achieve these objectives by building on the Principal Investigator's and his
students' techniques of adaptive hyperplane placement, window training (an
extended form of stochastic approximation), relaxed branch-and-bound search, and
genetic feature selection. The project will implement and test the resulting
mechanisms of long-term learning in three-stage neural classifiers of
handwritten numerical characters, tree classifiers of medical images in a large
data bank, and adaptive segmenter of moving objects in digitized video. This
project will contribute to the technology of long term learning in intelligent
machines and to multi-sensor robotic vision by automating the discovery of
highly discriminating combinations of features from diverse sensors.
