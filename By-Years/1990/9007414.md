This proposal seeks to investigate an interesting and robust phenomenon of
group interaction, the "discontinuity effect." This effect refers to the fact
that people interacting as group members are consistently more competitive than
when acting alone. A number of interesting possibilities will be tested in this
series of laboratory investigations, most of which make use of variables with
considerable real-world impact. In one of the studies, for example, the racial
composition of the group members will be studied. In another study, the effects
of greed and fear are studied in the group or individual allocation of
resources. The theoretical and practical implications of the work are
interesting and valuable. The investigators are first rate, and well known for
their important contributions to this area. As such, the project shows every
sign of providing an important contribution to knowledge of the actions of
individuals in groups.
