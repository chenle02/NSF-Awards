Abstract #1350841 Chong, Parkson L.

Stable liposomes have many potential uses in drug formulations (and even skin-
care products). Liposomes that can withstand autoclaving are especially
desirable for medical applications. The PI proposes to investigate highly stable
bipolar membranes (liposomes) with fluorescent tags that probe membrane
properties at different membrane depths or at different lateral positions.
Specifically, he hypothesizes that there should be significant structural and
functional heterogeneities along the membrane normal and in the plane of the
membrane, which are of critical importance in understanding membrane structure-
function relationship for these ultra-stable architectures.

The results obtained from this research should enhance the understanding of
lipid-protein interactions and solute permeation in archaeal membranes and will
have profound implications in technological applications, such as
extraordinarily stable lipid matrix for biosensors, light harvesting devices,
and nanoparticles for targeted imaging and therapy.
