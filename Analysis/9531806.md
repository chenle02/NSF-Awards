Abstract Greenleaf 9531806 Characteristic space-time estimates, previously
obtained, for solutions of wave equations will be extended and applied to yield
results on the approximate determination of compactly supported, time-
independent potentials in L^2 of 3-space from approximate knowledge of their
backscattering (or other determined sets of scattering data.) Extensions of such
results to potentials with noncompact support and of N-particle type will be
pursued. Estimates, in terms of Sobolev and Lebesgue norms, for Fourier integral
operators associated with canonical relations exhibiting cusp singularities,
both simple and of higher order, will be investigated. Such estimates have
applications to regularity properties of averaging operators associated with
integrals over generic families of lines and curves in n-dimensional space.
Finally, classes of Fourier integral operators arising from real analogues of
Goncharov's complexes of hyperplane sections of algebraic arieties of minimal
degree in n-dimensional projective space will be studied, with the goal of
obtaining composition calculi for them. The principal object of this project
will be the study of several types of singular integral operators and Fourier
integral operators. Such operators, which transform functions on one space into
functions on another (possibly different) space, have become central tools in
the study of linear partial differential equations which govern diverse physical
phenomena, such as electromagnetic fields and sound propagation. The particular
operators to be studied in this project arise in the scattering of waves by
potential functions, and in tomography, the mathematical basis for a variety of
medical imaging systems, such as CAT and MRI scanners. Thus, progress on the
problems considered in this project will contribute to the theoretical
underpinnings of procedures for reconstructing unknown quantities of physical
interest from noninvasive observations. Despite the fact that they arise in d
ifferent problems, the operators to be studied share several common features,
which involve more complicated geometry than is present in the original versions
of singular integral and Fourier integral operators. It is hoped that,
eventually, improved understanding of these operators will lead to improved
reconstruction techniques.
