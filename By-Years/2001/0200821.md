Proposal Number: CTS-0200821&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Rutgers
University&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: T. Shinbrot and B. Glasser&lt;br/&gt;Title:
Instabilities and Waves in Sheared Granular
Materials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is to
investigate the shear instabilities at the interface between two streams of
granular materials flowing down an inclined surface. The modes of instability
produce various mixing characteristics which are of interest in many
applications including pharmaceutical and food processing. The PIs will
investigate this problem through experimental and computational methods based on
MD and cellular automata simulations.&lt;br/&gt;
