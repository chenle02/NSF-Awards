Canada/USA Mathcamp is an intensive five-week summer program for mathematically
talented high school students. Every year, Mathcamp brings together 110-120
exceptional teenagers from the United States, Canada, and around the world, and
creates an environment where they can "live and breathe mathematics". Both
intellectually and socially, it is a life-changing experience for many of these
students, most of whom have never had a true peer group before coming to
Mathcamp. The program takes place on a different college campus each summer;
working mathematicians are recruited from across all specialties (and ranging
from postdocs to superstar researchers) to visit for a week and participate in
the mathematics instruction. Access to working mathematicians at Mathcamp helps
meet an intellectual need for the students, many of whom do not have the
mathematical resources at home to pursue their
interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award has two components. The first
component of the award is a "Research in Pairs" program, which will support
visits to Mathcamp by pairs of mathematical collaborators. In addition to
teaching a class, these visitors will work on their research during their stay,
with two main goals: (1) achieving progress on research, and (2) making the
production of new mathematics visible to our students. The second component of
the award provides scholarships for U.S. students from target outreach groups
(girls, underrepresented minorities, and students from underrepresented
communities of origin, economically disadvantaged backgrounds or underperforming
schools). Taken together, the two components of this award will allow talented
students from target outreach groups to interact with role models engaged in
active research at Mathcamp.
