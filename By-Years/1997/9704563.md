This proposal will develop the concept for a GGCM (Global Geospace Circulation
Model) control program. Such a GGCM control program would serve to connect and
pass data and control between various modules that would comprise the GGCM
system. The importance of such a concept study is to help determine the best
implementation strategy to undertake in a concerted GGCM development effort
which may be mounted in the near future.
