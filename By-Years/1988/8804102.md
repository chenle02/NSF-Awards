A 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer will be acquired to support research in biochemistry
and chemistry. Among the projects to be supported are organic synthesis of
heterocyclic compounds, physical, synthetic and organic chemistry of natural
products, enzyme mechanism, and peptide and protein folding. Contemporary
research methods in 1D and 2D NMR will be done using observations of homonuclei
and heteronuclei, chemical shift correlation spectroscopy (COSY), nuclear
Overhauser effect correlation spectroscopy (NOESY), and relay transfer
spectroscopy. The applications in synthetic chemistry will be of long-term value
to industrial development in general and biotechnology in particular; similarly,
the biochemical studies, on enzyme mechanism, and peptide and protein folding,
address major problems of biological interest and will have an impact in
biotechnology and in the long term in health-related research. Without this
instrumentation, some of the experiments proposed could not be carried out;
others could be carried out only much much more slowly. The instrumentation
allows a detailed analysis of physical properties of biological and organic
compounds and is essential for progress on the immediate basic scientific
questions.
