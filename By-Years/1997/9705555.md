9705555 Hood The goals of the Seattle Partnership for Family Science are to
enhance science literacy; increase parental involvement in their children's
science education; and increase the numbers and ethnic diversity of families
participating in school-based and community science programs. The Partnership
will use the existing Seattle Partnership for Inquiry-Based Science, funded by a
National Science Foundation grant for local Systemic Change, as the framework
for the proposed activities. During the planning phase, the project staff will:
* identify barriers to participation by families in their children's education
paying special attention to ethnic minorities and individuals with limited
proficiency in English; * develop and pilot-test an array of methods aimed at
reducing these barriers; * promote awareness and involvement of parents in
inquiry-based science activities; * develop new inquiry-based tools for science
investigations; and * establish collaborative partnerships among the Seattle
School District, the University of Washington, the Woodland Park Zoo, and other
informal science centers.
