Computer science has become increasingly concerned with the concept of type.
From the 60's onward this notion has demonstrated its value as an effective
organizing concept_first in programming and programming languages, then in
knowledge representation, in automated reasoning, in formal methods, and now
perhaps in computer algebra systems. Previous NSF-supported research has led to
a coherent family of constructive type theories and to the implementation of
them in the Nuprl system from Cornell and related systems elsewhere. The plan of
the investigation is to find the right concepts to explain the use of types in
computer algebra systems and in formalizations of abstract computational
mathematics (especially algebra). It is conjectured that in some cases the right
concepts are generalizations of algebraic data types to higher-order ADT's. In
other cases, new type constructors may be necessary, such as the very dependent
types. These concepts are expected to clarify both pragmatic issues and
foundational questions. Moreover, the method of investigation seeks to formalize
the object oriented features of algebra systems and generalize them to other
programming environments. The result of this research enables the design of a
new generation of computer system that integrates subsystems (such as compilers,
concrete and symbolic evaluators, transformation systems, provers, and data base
managers) around a rich notion of type used to specify and verify the linking
protocols. Investigation of computational type theory also deepens understanding
of the foundations of computer science and its links to mathematics and
computational science.
