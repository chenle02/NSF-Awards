9401193 STANTON Stanton will continue his work on holomorphic torsion, extending
it to the doubly-laced case. He will attempt to show that the formal geometric
zeta function has a meromorphic extension to the complex plane. He will examine
a number of other cases of locally symmetric or locally homogeneous geometries
to test a conjectured technique for constructing geometric zeta functions using
compactifications of the simply connected covering space. The general area of
the research is analysis on symmetric spaces. One is interested in finding
analogues of the classical special functions defined on geometric spaces that
are generalizations of classical domains in n-dimensional complex space. ***
