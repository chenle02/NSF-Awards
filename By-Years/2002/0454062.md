Computing Research Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;Title: CRI: A Community Resource for
Archiving Wireless Data At Dartmouth: CRAWDAD&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Investigators at Dartmouth College will develop an archive of
wireless network data and associated tools for collecting and processing the
data, as a community resource for those involved in wireless network research
and education. Most current research is based on analytical or simulation
models; due to the complexity of radio propagation in the real world and a lack
of understanding about the behavior of real wireless applications and users,
these models are severely limited. On the other hand, the difficult logistical
challenges involved in collecting detailed traces of wireless network activity
preclude most people from working with experimental data. The investigators will
build on experience collecting data from wireless networks that has bee released
to the research community. &lt;br/&gt;The project will construct a shared
facility for storing large data sets collected from real wireless networks,
develop common formats and tools for collecting, anonymizing, and analyzing this
data, host visiting students who want to use the archive or collaborate on tool
development, work with community leaders to encourage contribution to and use of
the archive, coordinate with other community efforts to develop network trace
formats and tools, and encourage educators to use the tools and data in course
projects, and to share course modules.&lt;br/&gt;This project will have broad
academic and practical impact in the wireless network community through enabling
research by users of the data resources, providing data and analysis software
for educators, and involving women and minorities in the project.&lt;br/&gt;
