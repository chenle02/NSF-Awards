The University of Southern California's (USC) Allan Hancock Foundation (AHF)
polychaete collection was donated to the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural
History (LACM) in 1988. The collection is the largest of its kind in the western
United States and second largest in the country, maintaining the most extensive
holdings in eastern Pacific polychaetes in the world, yet is cosmopolitan in its
total coverage. Following this acquisition, the LACM hired a polychaete
collection manager in 1988 and a curator in 1990. Along with a small wet
collection of sponges, platyhelminths, nemerteans, and tunicates donated to LACM
in 1992 by USC, the polychaete collection and staff are still housed on the USC
campus under extremely crowded conditions. As part of its commitment to these
collections and personnel, the LACM is presently constructing office/research
space for the polychaete staff, and completely remodelling an expansive ground
floor room to specifically accommodate compactors and rails for the polychaete
and miscellaneous invertebrates collections. With this collection space
utilizing compactors, the areas storage capacity can be fully minimized,
allowing ample growth of the polychaete collection. This project will support
the purchase and installation of all compactor rails, carriages, and shelves
designed for this space. %%% Collections of this sort are fundamentally
important not only as resources for primary research endeavors but also for a
broad spectrum of other activities. For example, specimens and their catalogues
are essential resources for environmental impact assessment. As well these
collections provide valuable exhibit and educational opportunities with appeal
to all levels of application.
