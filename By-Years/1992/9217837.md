Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a decapeptide that was isolated from
brain in 1971. With the development of sophisticated antibody technology, the
GnRH neuronal network was demonstrated to be a complex, heterogenous system,
comprising three or more discrete neuronal groups and spanning vastly different
regions of the brain, including the ganglion of the terminal nerve within the
olfactory bulb and nerve, the basal forebrain including the preoptic area, and
the caudal diencephalon or midbrain region. Moreover, GnRH neurons project to
targets within and outside the brain and serves as both a hormone and a
neurotransmitter. It is implicated in controlling the expression and maintenance
of neuroendocrinological traits underlying behavioral reproductive mechanisms.
This Small Grant for Exploratory Research award to Dr. Bass will facilitate the
development of sensitive and specific molecular tools which will be instrumental
in providing new insights into the cellular and molecular bases for hormonal
control of sexual differentiation of brain and behavior. He will complete the
sequence analysis and sequence comparisons of cDNAs for GnRH in a specific
species that serves as a model to examine intrasexual dimorphisms in brain and
behavior. Dr. Bass will use the antisense ribonucleic acid transcripts generated
from the cloned cDNAs and in situ hybridization histochemistry to identify the
expression patterns and quantitate levels of novel GnRH transcripts in the brain
of juvenile and adult animals with distinct reproductive phenotypes. The
development of these new sensitive molecular tools will open up new avenues into
this emerging research area. The research will lead to a better understanding of
the role that GnRH plays in basic mechanisms underlying reproducive maturation,
physiology and species-typical behaviors.
