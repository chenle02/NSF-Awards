Computational Methods in Financial Engineering Mark Broadie, Paul Glasserman and
Steve Kou

This project addresses computational problems in financial engineering.
Financial engineering deals broadly with the use of mathematical and
computational tools to model the dynamics of asset prices, to value and hedge
derivative securities tied to those assets, and to measure and control the risks
associated with these instruments. This project will address three specific
areas requiring innovative computational tools and analysis: (1) high-
dimensional stochastic dynamic programming problems embedded in the valuation of
American options; (2) numerical methods for jump-diffusion models based on
transform analysis and asymptotics; (3) calculation of price sensitivities and
related hedge parameters and risk measures using Monte Carlo methods.

The emerging field of financial engineering draws on mathematics, statistics,
economics, and numerical methods to solve modeling and computational problems
arising in the financial industry. The US is currently a world leader in this
field, which is a source of competitive advantage in financial services. This
field is also a large and growing source of employment for highly skilled
individuals in the mathematical sciences. This project is part of a larger
network of research and teaching activities through which the Principal
Investigators interact with researchers in industry and other universities to
help shape and advance the field of financial engineering. Financial engineering
at Columbia spans several departments; this project will facilitate
interdepartmental collaboration and help sustain a community of students and
faculty from different disciplines with shared interests.
