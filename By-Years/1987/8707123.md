Support will involve travel costs of speakers to a Penrose conference on the
paleoenvironmental interpretation of paleosols. Penrose Conferences are approved
after review of the Geological Society of America, and operate under strict
guidelines. Their purpose is to foster free discussion among a carefully chosen
group of experts in the field, with the aim of identifying new directions in
Earth sciences. This meeting will effect a reconciliation of two separate
scientific traditions: agriculturally-oriented soil science and geologically-
oriented sedimentology. Each research tradition has much to offer in the
exploration of what has become known as paleopedology. The fossil record of
soils can be viewed as a long term natural experiement in pedogenesis in which
there were fundamental changes in soil-forming factors. It also can be viewed as
a new line of evidence for the interpretation of major events and environments
on land in the geological past. Ten keynote speakers and twenty discussants have
been invited. Airfares and expenses for 6 foreign speakers, and airfares for 24
speakers from North America are requested.
