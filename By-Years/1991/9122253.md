This project centers on theoretical and empirical models of the labor markets.
It builds on the large collection of research on search models of the labor
market. Recent work in equilibrium search models has shown that monopsony arises
naturally in search models, with the degree of monopsony power depending upon
the matching technology. A simple model in which wage dispersion arises in
equilibrium even with homogeneous workers and firms will be considered. With
this model, the statistical issues arising in estimation will be explored, using
techniques recently introduced in the partial equilibrium search framework.
Extensions to make the model more realistic will be examined, and data from the
Survey of Income Program Participation and other sources will be fitted to the
model. Three specific applications will be studied: 1) the measurement of local
monopsony power; 2) aggregate labor market dynamics; and 3) the public finance
implications of Unemployment Insurance changes on equilibrium labor market
behavior. This approach to the study of labor markets is particularly important
because it provides a way of asking whether "thin" labor markets have an effect
on wages, and, ultimately, upon economic development in non-urban areas. For
example, planners in rural areas commonly argue that it is difficult to attract
a skilled labor force. This research provides the tools with which one can
answer this question.
