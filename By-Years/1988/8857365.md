Dr. Wisdom at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will conduct a research
program with this Presidential Young Investigator Award on the application of
the methods of modern nonlinear dynamics to physical problems in dynamical
astronomy in the Solar System. Solar system dynamics encompasses the orbital and
rotational dynamics of the planets and their satellites, the coupling between
them, and the slow evolution due to tidal friction. Dr. Wisdom has shown that
chaotic behavior has played an important role in shaping the distribution of
asteroids, that chaotic trajectories provide the pathway for the transport of
meteorites from the asteroid belt to Earth, that Saturn's satellite Hyperion is
currently tumbling chaotically, and indeed that all tidally.evolved,
irregularly.shaped natural satellites tumbled chaotically in the past. Dr.
Wisdom will continue to investigate such problems in dynamical astronomy in the
light of modern approaches to dynamics.
