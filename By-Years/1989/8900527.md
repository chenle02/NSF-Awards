This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in
analytical, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry. For a three-year period
beginning April 1989, eight (8) undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks
engaged in basic research in chemistry under the direction of various faculty
members from the Chemistry department. The REU activities include unique
features such as a joint effort with the scientific staff at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory and a concerted effort to reach out to minority and Appalachian
students. The proposed programs will run in conjunction with existing programs
that bring nearly 100 visiting undergraduate science majors and faculty to UTK.
The large scope of these programs, the extensive resources of UTK and ORNL, and
the considerable previous experience of UTK in undergraduate training are
essential ingredients in the success of this program.
