Many new designs are modifications, derivations, or variations of existing
designs. The problem of redesign is a fruitful area for research both because
the problem is better defined than for de novo design and because redesign is
common in practice. One approach to the problem of redesign in the use of
replay, that is, re-creating the steps by which the original design was created
and modifying the original decisions to meet the new requirements. This proposal
addresses reusability of a design by transforming a formal specification of the
problem into a suitable implementation by the repeated application of
transformations. It explores how a specification derived as a modification of an
existing design can be realized by replaying the transformational derivation of
the original and modifying it as required by changes made to the specification.
This notion of replay can substantially mediate the difficulty and expense of
maintenance, particularly for software systems. The Principal Investigators
propose to exhibit a replay capability for a transformational system that
designs efficient data structures. The PIs have previously developed a suitable
set of transformations for this domain and have powerful knowledge-based tools
to support this activity.
