The Full Option Science System (FOSS) is a new concept in elementary school
science education proposed by the Lawrence Hall of Science. FOSS will be an
integrated teacher-education program and classroom instructional package for
general education in grades 3 through 6. The instructional package will be based
on tested, reliable pilot activities: the SAVI/SELPH (Science Activities for the
Visually Impaired, and Science Enrichment for Learners with Physical Handicaps).
The teacher education component will be based on pilot coursework used at the
Lawrence Hall of Science. The materials used to prepare teachers to be
effective, confident science teachers will be the same materials used in the
classroom to teach students. Products of the project will include mini-units of
hands-on activities covering a broad range of science topics, student equipment
and teacher's guides, and a number of supporting documents. Research into two
important aspects of science instruction will also be conducted. The project
will focus on the problem of delivery and management of student equipment and on
the factors that encourage the replication and perpetuation of teacher education
activities.
