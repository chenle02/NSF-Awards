&lt;br/&gt;NER:New Nanoscale Probes of Molecular Motors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One
of the major objectives of the National Nanotechnology Initiative is to develop
a fundamental understanding of nanoscale biological structures and processes,
such as the mechanics of molecular motor proteins. Molecular motor proteins are
enzymes that convert chemical energy directly into mechanical work. These
proteins are found in a vast array of biological processes, such as the
contraction of smooth and skeletal muscle, cell division, and trafficking
materials inside cells and across the cell membrane. Recent experimental
advances in motor protein biophysics have resulted in unprecedented insight
&lt;br/&gt;into the mechanics of single motor molecules. For instance, it was
found that the molecular motor myosin makes discrete 5nm steps, and stalls when
opposed by approximately 5 piconewtons (pN) of force.&lt;br/&gt;Despite this
progress, a major obstacle in motor research has been the&lt;br/&gt;inability to
resolve the action of the working stroke, when the load-bearing domain of the
motor moves forward. The PI proposes to measure the dynamics of the working
stroke with sub-nanometer resolution on timescales as small as 25 nanoseconds
using a novel light-&lt;br/&gt;scattering motor assay. The PI's approach will
also provide insight into the mechanical properties of cells and cell
movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
