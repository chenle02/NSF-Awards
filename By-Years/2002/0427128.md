One of the primary research areas under the U.S. Weather Research Program
(USWRP) is to perform the research necessary to improve track and intensity
forecasts of tropical cyclones (TC). The major goal of this research is to
understand the processes that lead to intensity changes in tropical cyclones.
While there are many processes responsible for tropical cyclone intensity
change, the PI will focus on those occurring in the inner core region (within
about 150 km from the cyclone center), including interactions between inner and
outer spiral rainbands, eyewall convection; vortex Rossby waves, and eyewall
breakdown process. The working hypothesis is that the effect of any external
forcing on TC intensity occurs either directly or indirectly through mesoscale
processes in the inner core region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following
scientific questions will be addressed: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a. How does the
internally generated asymmetric structure in the inner core region interact with
the symmetric vortex and affect the TC intensity even without any external
forcing from environmental flow? &lt;br/&gt;b. How do the outer spiral rainbands
form, why they most frequently form between 80 km and 150 km from the TC center,
and how do they propagate and interact with the inner spiral rainbands and
eyewall convection, affecting the TC intensity? &lt;br/&gt;c. How does the
eyewall respond to external forcing, such as that from vertical shear in the
environmental flow, and what is the consequence of this response?
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To answer these questions, the PI will perform idealized
numerical simulations using a fully compressible, nonhydrostatic, three-
dimensional multiply nested, movable mesh, high-resolution model (TCM4)
developed by the Principal Investigator. Comprehensive diagnostics of the
numerical results will be performed to elucidate the physical mechanisms.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the research include the improved
understanding of the physical processes that affect the tropical cyclone
structure and intensity changes, leading to improved prediction of tropical
cyclone structure and intensity change, especially by numerical weather
prediction models. In particular, results from this research will address the
possible role of inner core asymmetric dynamics and their response to external
forcing in causing the intensity change of tropical cyclones. Educational
benefits of the work include the training of graduate students. This research is
of high priority within the USWRP.
