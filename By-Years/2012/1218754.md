This research centers on the problem of designing and analyzing matrix recovery
algorithms using the breakthrough "approximate message-passing" (AMP) framework
that was recently proposed in the context of compressive sensing. The matrix
recovery problems considered in this project include matrix completion, robust
PCA, dictionary learning, compressive sensing under matrix uncertainty, and
multinomial classification, where the goal is to recover a pair of matrices from
noisy observations of their product, where the observations may be warped by
element-wise nonlinearities, and where the matrices may include structure such
as group sparsity, non-negativity, and per-row/vector norm constraints. Such
problems arise frequently across many subdisciplines of engineering, science,
and medicine, and with ever increasing data sizes. Thus, there is a great need
for an algorithmic approach that is accurate, robust, and computationally
efficient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the research involves 1) the
extension of AMP methods from linear inference (as in compressive sensing) to
bilinear inference, 2) the integration of message passing strategies inspired by
turbo-decoding in communications that facilitate the exploitation of
sophisticated structural priors, 3) the development of empirical-Bayesian
methods that automatically tune the parameters modeling the signal prior as well
as the observation prior, 4) the explicit treatment of uncertainty in the
assumed model, and 5) the exploitation of the AMP state-evolution framework for
rigorous performance analysis.
