This program is intended to discuss the latest developments and progress in the
fields of product realization. These include the latest methodologies, tools,
techniques, analysis software and case studies from American industry as well as
the most current research topics, teaching methods, laboratory exercises,
student projects, problems sets and teaching aides for engineering undergraduate
courses. The material presented can be taught directly in product realization
courses or be incorporated as modules in manufacturing engineering centered
curricula. Product realization is becoming an important element of global
competitiveness in terms of achieving high quality and low cost products at the
shortest time to market. Several tools and methods have become widely used for
product realization and will be presented and discussed with classroom notes and
lectures, software demonstrations and laboratory exercises such as: quality
function deployment (QFD) or customer driven engineering for focusing the
product users' input into the design specifications of new products; reducing
cost through analyzing product design for production and assembly (both manual
and robotic) by comparing and rating alternative designs and using the
manufacturing process capability for setting the tolerance limits and quality
level for new products. Several case studies developed by world class companies
to illustrate product realization will be presented. Leading product realization
advocates from these companies will share their expertise with the participants
through open forum and plant tours. This program will increase undergraduate
faculty experience with these concepts and encourage them to develop courses,
capstone projects and incorporate modules of product realization into their
curriculum.
