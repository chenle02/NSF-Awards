This is a project to develop inexpensive programs for computing synthetic
seismograms in stratified anisotropic media, using the results of the principal
investigator's recent theoretical research on wave propagation in anisotropic
media. Two programs would be developed. One would be suitable for studying
crustal reflection, refraction, and earthquake body wave analysis; the other for
rapid computation of modal propagation. The latter technique would be valuable
in long range lithosphere studies of oceanic regions and would make wave form
inversion for anisotropic media easier. This study is directly applicable to
understanding seismic wave propagation in the oceanic crust.
