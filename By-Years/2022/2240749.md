The system for classifying objects of study in the sciences affects what can be
known about them, and how they should be treated. The categories used within
different systems of classification group the entities, processes, and systems
that are the subject matter of the science, and determine how one differs from
another. Agricultural science is a particularly important focus for studying
systems of classification because social norms such as farm productivity,
environmental quality and the economic competitiveness of farmers have long been
explicitly recognized as values that influence the content and methods in
agronomy, horticulture, and animal science. The project will apply analytic
methods from the philosophy of science to improve understanding of how social,
economic, ethical, and political values interact with biologically-oriented
science in the agricultural sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
advance the clarity and quality of social and political debates that are
currently shaping the practice of plant and animal food production with respect
to issues such as environmental sustainability, food justice, adjustments to
agriculture in response to climate change, and the welfare of livestock in
intensive production systems. The core research team will identify categories
and classification methods that proved decisive in steering the direction of
research, or its subsequent application in several case studies on the
agricultural sciences. A larger community including scholars working on
agricultural science and veteran agricultural researchers will be created to
steer, critique, and work collaboratively with the PIs. Research from the
project will be published and will serve as the basis for a course designed for
Colleges of Agriculture and Natural Resources and Colleges of Arts and
Letters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
