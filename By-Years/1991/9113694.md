This project will use workstation-quality computer graphics to aid in the
visualization of concepts in the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. It focuses
on visual presentations and real-time visual manipulations. Examples of subjects
include atomic and molecular orbitals, molecular geometry, organic dynamics and
structure, docking of drug molecules, proteins, and other biological
macromolecules, polymer structure and stereochemistry, and crystal structures
and Miller index planes. Certain concepts and visualization programs will be
developed for (or adapted for use on) personal computers coupled with
videotapes, laser videodiscs, and other media so that the images can be used in
chemistry lectures, in student tutorials, and for open-ended inquiry. The
project aims to have broad impact on and utility for undergraduate chemistry
curricula nationally. This project was funded equally by the Division of
Undergraduate Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Education, and the Division
of Chemistry.
