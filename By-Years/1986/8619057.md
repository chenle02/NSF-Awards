A model will be developed to better understand how water resources are managed
under drought conditions in the U.S. humid southeast, to examine which are the
coping mechanisms used, and to determine what are the alternative water
management schemes the region could adopt for the next droughts. The drought of
1986 will be taken as the case study. This event will be examined and
characterized, the lack of success of state government planning for and response
to drought will be determined, and the preparedness of municipalities and the
agricultural sector will be evaluated. Past regional water resources and drought
research will be considered in developing the model as well as the available
technical information on comprehensive, or separate, surface and groundwater
development, management and allocation. The responsibilities of municipalities,
other governmental entities, and the private sector in responding to drought
will be factored into the model as well. The project will be structured to
involve local, state and federal water agencies, industries, agriculture and
scientific organizations. The P.I. is highly qualified to carry out the project,
thus, an award is recommended.
