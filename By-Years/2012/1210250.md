This action funds Tyler Fleetham of Arizona State University to conduct a
research project, entitled "Temperature and light intensity dependence of
organic solar cells," during the summer of 2012 at Seoul National University in
Seoul, South Korea. The host scientist is Professor Changhee Lee.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is a comprehensive understanding
of factors that affect the photocurrent and diode behavior of organic solar
cells under various operating conditions. Through characterizing photovoltaic
parameters including the open circuit voltage and photocurrent at various
temperatures for a wide range of materials the research results promise a
greater understanding of the photovoltaic mechanisms of organic solar cells at a
molecular level and lead to understanding the effect of molecular design on
solar cell performance.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
