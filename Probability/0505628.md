The principal investigator studies special wavelet decompositions of random
processes and fields. These representations have a multi-resolution structure
and share other nice properties of standard wavelet decompositions. In contrast
to the standard case, however, the high frequency (small scale) terms in special
wavelet decompositions have an elementary stochastic structure. Random processes
and fields are considered under a wide range of assumptions: Gaussian, Gaussian
subordinated, stable, stationary, self-similar, some non-stationary, and others.
In addition to establishing and understanding special wavelet decompositions,
questions regarding their use in simulation, analysis and modeling are also
addressed.

The project adds to the recent growth of the multi-scale (multi-resolution)
approach where observed phenomena are considered at different scales
(resolutions). This approach where wavelets play a central role, has found
successful applications in numerous fields such as medical imaging, turbulence,
de-noising, astronomical and Internet traffic data analysis. The goal of the
project is to develop a new multi-resolution framework that is suitably adapted
to random phenomena. Despite some progress, such multi-resolution framework has
been missing at a fundamental level. The developed framework should provide
novel analysis tools and conceptual perspectives, for example, establish new
connections between models in discrete and continuous times, shed light on
simulation, which has become an indispensable tool of any scientific research,
or be useful in modeling through the multi-scale approach. The project should
also be of direct interest to and enhance ties between researchers in many areas
of Science such as Applied and Pure Mathematics, Physics, Signal Processing,
Probability and Statistics.
