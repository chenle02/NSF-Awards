A plant pathogenic fungus in the economically-important genus Cochliobolus is
the object of a study designed to examine the genetics of production of a
cyclic-peptide, host-selective toxin produced by the fungus. To be examined is
whether a 22kb stretch of DNA is a gene cluster encoding all of the enzymes
involved in synthesis of the toxin; insights into the evolution of host-
selective toxin production in this fungal genus should result from these
studies, as well. The production of a host-selective toxin by a plant
pathogenic, economically important fungus is to be studied by techniques
suitable for determining whether a particular region of DNA encodes the several
enzymes involved in synthesis of the cyclic-peptide toxin.//
