American researchers in technical innovation to meet with leading Chinese
researchers in technical innovation on the occasion of the Third International
Symposium on Management of Technology, Hangzhou, China, October 2002. The U.S.
and Chinese researchers will exchange information and explore opportunities for
collaborative research in an area of research, namely technical innovation, that
has been identified by NSF and the National Natural Science Foundation of China
together as a key area of policy discussion and joint research during the first
decade of the 21st century. Members of the U.S. and Chinese teams have
participated in two NSF-NSFC sponsored policy dialogues. This bilateral workshop
extends to discussions toward greater research collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;
