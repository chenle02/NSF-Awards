Prevailing interpretations of the tectonic history of the NW Indian Ocean
specify that the coast of Oman is a passive continental margin that rifted from
India during the Late Jurassic. An alternative history is supported by recently
acquired information comprising: a) magnetics data, b)seismic reflection
profiles tied to boreholes, c) paleodepth estimates, and d) deformation observed
along the Oman margin. These data imply that the Oman margin lie along a major
transform fault. Funds included in the present award will support an analysis
and synthesis of this new data in an attempt to determine which model is
correct. Understanding the evolution of the Oman margin is important to
deciphering the history of the Indian Ocean, the collision of India with
Eurasia, and the history of sedimentation on the Oman margin.
