This award initiates M2SE (Minorities in Mathematics, Science and Engineering
Regional Center). M2SE is a consortium of education, industry and community
organizations whose goal is to increase the number of minorities in mathematics,
science and engineering professions. The Center program is a comprehensive
sequence of activities designed to nurture and support minority students
interest in mathematics and science beginning in elementary school and
continuing through college. The M2SE Center activities: (1) provide students
with extended-time and enrichment experiences such as after school programs,
summer institutes and enrichment courses, advanced workshops, research
apprenticeships, high school college bridge/transition programs and retention
systems; (2) provide supplemental instruction to elementary, middle and high
school teachers to enrich resources and techniques for teaching math, science
and engineering skills; and (3) create opportunities for direct interaction
between math, science and engineering professionals with students at all
educational levels.
