Pacific Wave is a distributed open internet exchange that provides high
performance connectivity among US research and education networks and their
international counterparts through points of presence in Los Angeles, Sunnyvale,
and Seattle. These facilities are essential infrastructure providing high-
performance advanced networking that enables the large-scale data flows, access
to high performance computing, and remote visualization necessary for
collaborative research in all areas of science and engineering including
astronomy, biology, bio-medical engineering, materials science, medicine, earth
sciences, high-energy physics, and oceanography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
funds enhancement and expansion of the Pacific Wave production infrastructure to
support multiple 100 gigabit-per-second connections among US-based research and
education networks and international counterparts from countries of the Pacific
Rim including Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South
Korea, and Taiwan. Many research and education networks are developing novel
network architectures based on Software Defined Networking to better support the
demands of the science and engineering communities that they serve. Project
activities also include the development of a parallel set of network connection
facilities comprising a distributed Software Defined Exchange to interconnect
these emerging Software Defined Networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pacific Wave
Expansion project supported by this award achieves these objectives through
engagement with the 17 major international research and education networks
currently connected to the Pacific Wave exchange and through information and
technology exchange with other awardees of the International research network
connections program and the US science and engineering research community.
