Hyperbolic balance laws arise in the modeling of the nonlinear motion of fluid
flows. The extremely complicated structure of this class of systems is a source
of many open questions with practical implications in a broad class of
scientific and engineering models. This research will focus on several
fundamental questions, with the goal of bringing fresh insights and developing
new tools to break ground in the field. The project aims to enhance
understanding of these complicated but important phenomena. In addition to its
scientific goals, this project aims to foster international collaborations and
train graduate students and young researchers.

The research project follows three main themes. The first is to look for sharp
conditions for the global existence of smooth solutions to compressible, non-
isentropic, Euler equations in one dimension with large initial data, and to
continue the effort of deriving a sharp density lower bound estimate for generic
large solutions. The second is to characterize the passage of singular limits in
the isentropic approximation process for both inviscid and viscous fluids, and
to derive error estimates in such approximations. The last is to establish the
mathematically rigorous validity of nonlinear dynamical Rayleigh-Taylor type
instability in compressible fluids subject to gravity, in particular for the
compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, where heat transfer plays an
essential role. These research activities aim to break ground in several fields
where theories are lacking, pave roads in areas that are outside current
methodology, and advance understanding of the behavior of solutions in nonlinear
hyperbolic balance laws.
