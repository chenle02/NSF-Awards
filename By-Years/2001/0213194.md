Hormonal control of behavior extends to physically complex courtship displays
in many bird species, but is not well understood. In a tropical bird of Panama,
the golden-collared manakin, the males execute characteristic loud wingsnaps as
part of a courtship dance. The males have three wing muscles that differ from
those in females in size and/or biochemical composition, and there are motor
neurons in the spinal cord that show more molecular receptors for androgenic sex
steroid hormones than in females, suggesting that manakins are useful models for
evaluating steroid control of complex peripheral neuromuscular systems. This
project integrates molecular biology, biochemistry, anatomy and behavioral work
to determine how hormones seasonally regulate this behavior in this sexually
dimorphic system. Gene expression and metabolic enzyme activity provide data on
distributions of steroid hormones and their receptors, and for comparisons
between male and female spinal cords. Determining which particular muscles are
involved in the wingsnap allows determining how sexual dimorphism of the muscles
and the androgen-sensitive motoneurons in the spinal cord are relevant to the
behavior. Use of androgen-blocking agents tests whether seasonally fluctuating
androgens may cause changes across the breeding and non-breeding seasons in the
anatomy and physiology of the spinal cord and muscles. Results from this work
will provide important information on how steroid hormones act on this
peripheral neuromuscular system to control behavior. The impact of this work
extends beyond neuroendocrinology to reproductive physiology and evolutionary
biology, and may have use in bird breeding. This project also involves excellent
opportunities for student training and an important international component with
Panama.
