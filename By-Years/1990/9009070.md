The genus Lacuna is an herbivorous gastropod that uses its radula (a ribbon-
like structure covered with variably-shaped "teeth") to scrape algae. This genus
displays an unusual level of morphological variability in radular teeth, and Dr.
Dianna Padilla proposes an exploratory research project aimed at establishing
the causes of this variability. During a year of research planning, Dr. Padilla
will use enzyme electrophoresis to establish species identities and evolutionary
relationships. Controlled growth experiments using different food types will
reveal the degree to which radular morphology varies within a brood, and the
degree to which the physical nature of food items produces different radular
variations. The proposed research will find a wide audience among developmental
and evolutionary biologists, systematists, and ecologists. The various possible
sources of morphological variation are factors in diverse research areas, but
only a few studies such as Dr. Padilla's actually assess their relative
contributions.
