Professor Allen Bard of the University of Texas Austin is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study photoelectrochemical and
optoelectronic effects in solid thin films and nanoparticle dispersions. The
materials include traditional semiconductors like silicon and CdSe (quantum
dots), as well as molecular films of substituted porphyrins, conjugated organics
and inorganic salts. Low melting liquid crystals will be investigated, as well
as inorganic molecular crystals like tris (2,2'-bipyridine)ruthenium(II).
Methods include electrochemistry and electrogenerated chemiluminescence as well
as scanning probe microscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Charge transfer and
electrical characteristics of novel material films are not well understood, and
fundamental studies could lead to better high density memories, light emitting
diodes and other electronic devices. Nontraditional semiconductor materials will
be explored, with potential use in solar energy conversion and charge storage
devices, for example.
