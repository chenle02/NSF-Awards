Abstract ATM-9711602 Marland, Gregg DOE - Oak Ridge Operations Title: Modeling
the CO2 Emissions Implications of Land-Use Change and Forest Management
Alternatives This proposal is aimed at further developing a mathematical carbon
accounting model, GRAZ/Oak Ridge Carbon Accounting Modeling (GORCAM). Its
primary focus is to better represent materials that are harvested from the
landscape and to better parameterize the range of materials substitutions that
can occur. The proposal attempts to trace the effect of a policy action to store
CO2 a step or step beyond the site specific effects. This information is
important and necessary for policy makers in assessing the impact of management
practices on national and global carbon budgets.
