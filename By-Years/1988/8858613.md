This is a Presidential Young Investigator award. The specific transport of
proteins from the cytoplasm into the nucleus of eukaryotic cells will be
investigated, using yeast histones as the model system. The problem of how
proteins are specifically translocated from the site of protein synthesis to a
different site, the site of its function, within the cell is a fundamental and
important problem of cell biology. Dr. Melese will address this problem using
modern state-of-the-art approaches, including genetic engineering and
biochemical techniques.
