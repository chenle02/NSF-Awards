The development of accurate and efficient numerical methods for the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is important for the understanding of
many complex physical phenomena. The research proposed here focuses on
developing such methods, implementing them on a parallel computer, and applying
them to a class of difficult problems. The methods to be developed use domain
decomposition and are suitable for use on parallel processors. The methods will
be implemented on a Thinking Machines, Inc., CM-5 parallel processor. To
demonstrate the usefulness of the methods, they will be applied to a set of
nontrivial test problems. The test problems will be computations of vortex
shedding by either fixed or oscillating cylinders in uniform flow.
