9615306 Messac This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to examine the use
of language in the engineering design literature. Engineering design has failed
to emerge clearly as an engineering discipline in part because it has been
impeded by a lack of a clear lexicon for communication, and researchers in the
field have been reluctant to create a lexicon. Indeed, the current use of
language in design encompasses a broad range of disparate definitions for some
key words. In a few cases, the same researcher has used a word repeatedly in a
single paper, each time with a substantially different definition. The research
funded under this grant will survey the design literature and provide and
publish a collection of definitions for words that are key to the field. It is
hoped that, by providing a list of words key to the field of engineering design
together with the disparate definitions assigned to them by different
researchers, the engineering design research community will obtain a clearer
view of the confusion created by this chaotic situation. This effort could form
the basis of a dialog that will result in better communication among researchers
in the field and subsequently improve the efficacy of research in the field.
Clarity of language in itself can also lead to better design education and
improved design tools. All of these factors contribute to the success of
American industry.
