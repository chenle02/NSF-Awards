The University of Arizona will be the site of a project designed as a cladistic
analysis to resolve the phylogenetic systematics of Magnoliidae. Approximately
60 OTUs (operational taxonomic units) will be coded, including monophyletic
entities of variable taxonomic rank. Over 100 characters will be defined from as
complete an array of systematic evidence as possible, and missing data will be
supplemented by empirical collection of new data. New characters will also be
developed. Character polarization by outgroup comparison with published
cladograms of seed plant phylogeny will facilitate the recognition of ancestral
conditions in primitive angiosperms. Existing and newly developed parsimony
packages will be utilized to develop resolved cladograms depicting monophyletic
clades and concordant character evolution. The resulting phylogenetic
classification will have high predictive value for subsequent analyses and tests
of hypotheses. The research is being supported by a two-year postdoctoral
research fellowship in environmental biology.
