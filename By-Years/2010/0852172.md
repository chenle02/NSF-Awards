This CRI proposal is designed to enhance the community's computing research
infrastructure in support of smart environments. The goal of this program is to
equip physical smart environment testbeds, and disseminate the data and software
tools that are collected using the testbeds to the computer science community.
Specifically, we will create one long-term and four short-term smart environment
smart environment testbeds. The testbeds will facilitate research and education
projects in modeling and simulation, machine learning of resident behaviors,
middleware design, health monitoring, energy conservation, and sensor network
design. Performing data collection and research in the testbeds will also rely
upon the design of a number of software tools. We will make all data, software
tools, and related educational materials available online as part of our CASAS
repository. The infrastructure represents a part of the CASAS smart environment
project. The infrastructure will enable a number of research advances at
Washington State University and will facilitate advances in smart environments
research around the world. Disseminating the data will also enable world-wide
collaboration in related areas of research.
