The central goal of this effort is the investigation of fundamental issues
involved in the potential for optics to be utilized for computational purposes.
One of the systems proposed, that of the two- digit digital multiplier serves as
a basis to investigate some of the aspects of primary concern- for instance the
ability to carry out more than one operation with a single frequency, or the
isolation of the input from the output, as well as the net power consumption is
the basic operations. A two-digit multiplier is proposed via an extension of the
Goodman-Woody algorithm for the optical analog multiplication of two signals,
using nonlinear optical Fabry-Perot elements. As a second aspect of this effort,
the investigators are proposing a Gaussian beam approach to analyze the number
of resolvable interconnected addresses, the degree to which cross-talk is a
problem and the number to interconnections which can be made using the
photorefractive effect. Related to the above two areas is the issue of
appropriate sources, in particular an effort towards the investigation of
possible semiconductors for the generation of visible emission. The
investigators have initiated a collaborative effort with Mike Ruben of the
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory for the investigation of possible II- VI compounds
which would be possible. This also has the possibility of investigating new
materials and structures for the use of nonlinear elements.
