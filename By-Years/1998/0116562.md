With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin in Oshkosh will acquire
an isothermal titration microcalorimeter for the study of solution-phase
reactions, and a differential thermal analyzer for the thermal characterization
of solids. The isothermal titration microcalorimeter will be used to enhance
studies of the binding properties of heavy metal ions to polysaccharides such as
capsules that are produced by certain cyanobacteria. The differential thermal
analyzer will be used primarily for thermal characterization of nanoscale
materials. Students at this primarily undergraduate campus will be heavily
involved in these research projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Calorimetry is an
extremely useful tool in modern analytical chemistry. Calorimetric analysis is
used to measure the thermal energy (heat) exchange that occurs during molecular
interactions and reactions. The isothermal titration microcalorimetry studies
have practial implications regarding the fate of heavy metal ions and possible
bioremediation strategies on the Lake Winnebago/Fox River ecosystem. &lt;br/&gt;
