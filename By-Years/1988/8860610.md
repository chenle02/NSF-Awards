This research focuses its attention on the study of a cross-coupled adaptive
noise cancellation algorithm that is suitable for applications in which the
primary and noise inputs may be closely spaced, thus a pure noise reference is
not available for effective noise cancellation from the primary signal. The
structure of this new algorithm is based on two Least-Mean Squared (LMS) delay
line cancellers with cross-coupled feedback. The PI's overall objective is to
determine the feasibility of this novel cross-coupled adaptive algorithm to
improve the signal-to-noise ratio of data composed of recurring pulses in noise
for systems in which a pure noise reference input can not be found, i.e., in the
problem of extracting the fetal electrocardiographic (FECG) signals embedded in
muscle noise recorded from the pregnant maternal abdomen. He hopes to show that
this LMS cross-coupled canceller algorithm, which does not require a pure noise
reference input, effectively cancels maternal muscle noise from recorded fetal
ECG data without distortion of the FECG signal, thus, providing an enhanced
fetal signal for subsequent analysis or detection. The evaluation of this cross-
coupled cancellation algorithm for the real-time cancellation of muscle noise
from the FECG signal is the expected result of this research. Successful
application of this algorithm to this fetal electrocardiography problem would
suggest other applications to problems in electrical and biomedical signal
processing, since many problems of noise cancellation are difficult to solve due
to the lack of a pure noise signal.
