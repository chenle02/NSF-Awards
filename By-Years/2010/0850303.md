This S-STEM scholars program is a partnership between the Tarrant County College
District (TCCD) and the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). This project
provides scholarships to financially needy, academically talented students who
have completed basic math and science requirements at TCCD and are transferring
into the physics or chemistry programs at UTA. A feature of this project is that
scholarship recipients are given the opportunity to participate in ongoing
research projects where they will receive mentoring from the faculty and
graduate students conducting the research. The faculty and graduate student
mentors are given training in mentoring with an emphasis on mentoring students
from underrepresented groups. The project builds on the success of prior NSF
funded scholarship programs and leverages the existing partnership between TCCD
and UTA. There is a comprehensive project management team that includes faculty
and administrators from both TCCD and UTA. The project includes a formal
evaluation plan with both formative and summative components.
