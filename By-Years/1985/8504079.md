This project is concerned with the understanding of the function and structure
of a particular cutaneous mechanoreceptor. A model of how mechanical pressure on
the skin is sensed with respect to spatial and temporal stimuli will be
developed. This will be achieved by applying information theoretic methods to
study stimulus feature extraction. The results of this work should be relevant
to sensory disabled people, e.g., blind or hearing impaired, who could achieve
necessary sensory information using skin receptors as an alternate sensory
channel. Other research groups are active in the area of tactile displays so the
information from this project could be important to the accomplishment of better
sensory substitution.
