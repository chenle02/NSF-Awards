9513805 Spicer This project is to develop a high resolution model describing how
regA protein recognizes and binds to specific mRNAs. Thus, our goals are to
identify specific sites of interaction between regA protein residues and the
known gene 44 recognition element through site specific mutagenesis, and
photocrosslinking, and to collaborate with others in attempting to generate co-
crystals of regA protein and a target RNA. To identify residues of regA protein
that form critical bonds with target RNAs, structure-guided mutagenesis of regA
protein will be coupled with in vitro screening techniques to identify
informative, functionally deficient mutants. Proteins identified with functional
alterations will then be examined for changes in RNA affinity and RNA
recognition specificity using fluorescence quenching binding assays and "missing
contact" assays. Photocrosslinking of regA protein to 5-iodouracil substituted
RNA will be carried out to probe the sites of RNA contact on regA protein. We
will make a series of mutations on the surface of regA protein, particularly at
the dimer interface and test the mutant proteins for the retention of RNA
binding activity. Clones over-expressing mutant regA proteins that retain WT RNA
binding will be provided for crystallography trials. ***
