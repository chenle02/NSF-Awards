This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to Colorado State
University-Pueblo (formerly University of Southern Colorado) supports Dr.
Nebojsa Jaksic, for his work under a Nanoscale Science and Engineering (NSE)
Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) Award to improve the
undergraduate engineering education through a new nanotechnology course,
laboratory exercises and the development of affordable nanotechnology
instruments.

To attract students to engineering, retain them, and provide technologically
advanced instruments for undergraduate laboratories and research, nanotechnology
will be integrated into three facets of the curriculum. At the freshmen level,
students will use an instrument-grade scanning probe microscope available in the
Department of Chemistry to investigate the structure of a graphite sheet and
"see" individual carbon atoms. Through extensive lectures and controlled
experiments, diverse student teams will build and utilize inexpensive scanning
tunneling microscopes of their own designs. During the course of senior projects
and other undergraduate research, students will aim to improve SPM designs under
heavy engineering constraints. While the project directly supports diversity
(Colorado State University - Pueblo is a Hispanic Serving Institution with
approximately 31% minority students), the development of inexpensive
nanotechnology research/educational instruments may span an unparalleled amount
of educational and research endeavors.

The proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanoscale Science
and Engineering Education announcement, NSF 03-044, category NUE and was jointly
funded by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) in the
Directorate for Engineering and the Division of Materials Research (DMR) in the
Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS).
