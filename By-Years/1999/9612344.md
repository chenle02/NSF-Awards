9612344 Storm This grant supports a conference on the modeling of materials and
microstructure aimed at prediction of optimal properties and performance.
Scientific subjects to be discussed relate to issues in manufacturing, continuum
models, quantitative analysis of microstructure, prediction of materials
properties, modeling of defects, atomistic models, and microstructural
evolution. Scientific experts address these topics and the related modeling to
develop a cross-fertilization of ideas. The Gordon Conference on Physical
Metallurgy is held biannually. The $5.1K supports young researchers to attend
the meeting. %%% Optimum synthesis and processing of complex materials requires
knowledge of the effects of materials composition and structure on properties
and performance. This demands continued efforts on combined modeling and
experimentation to develop predictive capabilities in these areas. ***
