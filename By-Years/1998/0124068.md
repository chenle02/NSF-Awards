This research focuses on the nonsteady evolution of the convective boundary
layer (CBL) in an atmosphere with complex vertical structure. As the CBL grows,
air from the free atmosphere is entrained into the top of the CBL by turbulent
mixing. The structure of the entrainment layer and the entrainment dynamics
depend on the static stability of the atmosphere, as measured by the temperature
profile, and the vertical wind shear. Convective entrainment in conditions when
the wind and temperature vary smoothly with height has been studied extensively
in laboratory tanks, numerical large-eddy simulations (LES), and simple bulk
models of the CBL. Less studied is the development of the CBL in fluids with
more complex stratification, though there is evidence that the CBL in such cases
grows in an unsteady way, passing through a sequence of transition regimes
accompanied by strong variations in the intensity and vertical structure of the
entrainment. In this study, the CBL entrainment dynamics will be investigated
numerically, by means of high-resolution LES, and compared with observations
from atmospheric, laboratory, and other numerical studies. Emphasis will be
placed on the influence of discrete and nonlinear temperature stratification on
the entrainment characteristics with and without wind shear. Elements of the
work include: (1) improvement of the characterization of subgrid-scale
turbulence in LES models; (2) numerical studies of convective entrainment in
conjunction with analysis of observational and experimental data; (3) developing
a parameterization of convective entrainment in a heterogeneously stratified
atmosphere with wind shear.
