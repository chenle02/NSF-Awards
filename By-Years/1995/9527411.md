9527411 Staley The American Academy of Microbiology will convene a colloquium of
leading scientists to determine how to proceed in a timely and expeditious
manner to address the urgent and enormous task of understanding microbial
diversity. Issues in microbial diversity that require particular attention are
the following. How should microbial diversity be measured? How should taxonomic
studies of poorly known phyla be encouraged? What activities are most important
to assess? How can microbiologists coordinate their research activities with
botanists and zoologists? What new technologies can be developed to enhance our
study of microbial diversity? The meeting will bring together a highly select
group of microbial biology scientists, including at least five botanists and
zoologists also involved in biodiversity. The inclusion of botanists and
zoologists in these discussions will help build necessary bridges between these
two sets of disciplines and microbiologists. In addition, several European
scientists will also be included in the proceedings who are participating in
ongoing efforts in microbial diversity funded by the International Union of
Biological Sciences and the European Economic Community. The objective of the
colloquium is to develop a white paper report with an in-depth analyses of these
important issues in biodiversity studies and with recommendations for a future
plan of action. The final report and recommendations of the proceedings will be
published and disseminated to the microbiological community, to industry, to
policy makers who have concerns about biodiversity, and to the appropriate
federal and international agencies. ***
