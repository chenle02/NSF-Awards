*** 9632144 McAdams This Phase I STTR project will develop an integrated all-
optical wavelength converter for use in all-optical switches and other
applications. The effort will leverage Optivision's extensive experience gained
from building and deploying optical crossbar switches based on semiconductor
optical amplifiers and the University of Southern California's cutting edge
research in all-optical wavelength converters. Recently, wavelength conversion
has been demonstrated with semiconductor optical amplifiers based on cross gain
compression, cross phase modulation, or four wave mixing. The effort will begin
by developing a set of switch requirements based on interaction with all-optical
test beds and high end users, then evaluating the various wavelength conversion
techniques against these requirements. To demonstrate the feasibility of the
approach, Optivision, Inc. will perform both detailed modeling of the expected
performance and a proof-of-concept experiment. Optivision will also investigate
the complexity and tradeoffs of fabricating integrated all-optical wavelength
converters. The Phase II effort will involve the fabrication, laboratory
evaluation, and deployment into a test bed of integrated all-optical wavelength
converters. Network capacity is expected to grow more than an order of magnitude
by the year 2000. To support this explosive growth new networking technologies
are required. All-optical wavelength conversion and switching are two functions
that have been identified as key building blocks for future high capacity
networks. Integrated all-optical switching wavelength converters will be
required in high capacity wavelength division multiplexed networks such as
future cable television, television, and data transmission systems. ***
