The investigator will continue research on the arithmetic of hyperbolic
3-manifolds begun under DMS-9108050. His main emphasis is on the study of
incompressible surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds, representations of the
fundamental groups of such 3-manifolds, and the geometry and structure of closed
geodesics in hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Since the space of everyday life is three
dimensional, understanding the structure of objects of this dimension is likely
to be especially relevant to the real world. This world is certainly locally
Euclidean, but on a cosmological scale it may well be hyperbolic -- at issue is
the behavior of light paths of enormous length. In any event the techniques
invented to answer questions about hyperbolic manifolds have surprisingly many
applications elswehere in mathematics and theoretical physics.
