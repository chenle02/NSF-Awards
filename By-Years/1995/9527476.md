9527476 McGinnis The aim of this project is to hold a colloquium on material
handling research in the Netherlands. The will be attended by a team of
researchers drawn mostly from the US and the EC countries. At the meeting
several topics in material handling research will be covered. This colloquium is
the fourth of what is hoped will constitute a series of biannual colloquia on
material handling research. All the three previous colloquia had been held in
the US. This colloquium is the first to be held outside the territorial USA.
Attendance is by invitation only and this has been the format used in all the
three previous colloquia. The colloquium builds upon the first three colloquia
in bringing together leading researchers to present their current research in
the field, brain storm, debate, and assess the future needs and directions of
material handling research. Specifically, researchers will assess and
characterize the current state of research, identify critical research issues,
and identify the future needs and directions of material handling research. It
is hoped that the international dimension of the meeting will facilitate cross
fertilization of ideas between researchers in the US and the EC countries and
possibly foster new international collaborations. Material handling is a major
activity in many manufacturing operations. Depending on the industry, it is
often quoted that material handling accounts for about 25-75% of all
manufacturing costs. With this proportion, it is obvious that improvement in the
control of material handling functions in manufacturing will result in some
large cost savings annually in manufacturing. Improvement in material handling
control can be gained through research. Therefore, a meeting of researchers
focused on issues of material handling can lead to better system understanding
and control, improved research, and the strengthening of relationships between
researchers at various institutions
