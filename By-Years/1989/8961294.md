Computed tomography is a technique for reconstructing the interior of an object
from measurements of its projections, and is increasingly being applied in
research and in non-destructive evaluation of industrial objects. Classical
applications are to medical imaging. To handle the increased spatial resolution
and other requirements of these new applications, computed tomography scanners
may be able to use area detectors instead of the single line detectors normally
used. Phase I of this project is to develop, using Fourier techniques, an
efficient and accurate reconstruction algorithm for area detectors. Phase II
efforts would be toward a digital hardware implementation of the algorithm that
can be incorporated in a commercial image processing work station.
