The Marine Science Consortium of Wallops Island, Virginia seeks to initiate a
national, residential, Young Scholars Program in marine science for deaf and
hard-of-hearing students entering the tenth and eleventh grades. Twenty-two deaf
and hard-of-hearing students will be provided with a four-week enrichment
program involving lecture, laboratory, research, field and shipboard
experiences. Career awareness sessions will also be provided with emphasis on
the encouragement of students to pursue careers in the fields of Marine Science
or Oceanography.
