Incorporating gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) into the curriculum
at all levels will create relevant, project- style experiments that will
increase the attractiveness of chemistry. General students will extract local
soil and analyze it for ethalfluralin, a cotton herbicide. Allied health
students will explore the diagnosis of Refsum's disease. General chemistry
students will discover for themselves the principle of isotopic distribution and
the determination of molecular formula. Students in organic chemistry,
biochemistry, and instrumental analysis will use the GC/MS intensively for novel
experiments. Undergraduate research efforts will also be enhanced. The grantee
will match the NSF grant from non-Federal sources.
