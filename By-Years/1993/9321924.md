Fisch This research focusses on experimental investigations of strongly
interacting self-assembled systems. Static and dynamic light scattering
techniques will be used, at atmospheric pressure and at high pressures, to study
the physical properties of semidilute and concentrated bulk surfactant
solutions. We intend to investigate a wide variety of systems including
zwitterionic surfactant solutions, mixed surfactant solutions and solutions that
contain either rod-like or tubular micelles. The two dimensional phase behavior
of tubular aggregates on the surface or an isotropic fluid will be studied both
optically and through direct physical measurements. Studies of model systems
that consist of small particles on a vibrating table will complement these
measurements. Overall, this program will provide essential thermodynamic
information and an improved microscopic understanding of bulk semidilute and
concentrated micellar solutions and new insights and model systems for
understanding phase transitions in two dimensions. %%% The objectives of this
research are: 1) to obtain a better understanding of the properties of
semidilute and concentrated self-assembled systems by using optical and physical
chemical techniques; 2) to study the properties of these solutions when the
self-assembled aggregates form a 3-d solution and when they are confined to the
surface of an isotropic fluid, thus forming a 2-d nematic phase. Overall, this
program will provide essential thermodynamic information and an improved
microscopic understanding of bulk semidilute and concentrated micellar solutions
and new insights and model systems for understanding phase transitions in two
dimensions.
