This project is a cultural resource assessment of the East Base site on
Stonington Island on the Antarctic Peninsula. East Base was used as headquarters
for two U.S. expeditions, The U.S. Antarctic Service Expedition (1939-1941) and
the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition (1947-1948). This was the first
permanent U. S. base on the Peninsula. East Base has been designated as a
registered historic site. Because of its historical significance, two National
Park Service archaeologists have been assigned for two months to carry out a
documentation of East Base as it exists today and to make recommendations for
the protection of the site as an historic monument. A final report will be
available by September 30, 1991. This cultural resource assessment is being
carried out in connection with the Division of Polar Programs administered
clean- up of East Base which is planned for late February-Early March, 1991. A
Memorandum of Agreement between the National Science Foundation and the National
Park Service is the basis for this project.
