Measuring the earthquake response of a bridge is an important function for low
power wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Past experience with the current
generation of WSNs demonstrated that earthquakes have hit an instrumented bridge
and the network completely missed it because it was either in energy-saving
sleep mode or transferring ambient data that was collected prior to the
earthquake. The research objectives of this project are to test the hypothesis
that a wireless sensor network capable of being preemptively triggered can
capture the critical dynamic response of a bridge during and after an
earthquake, and that it can conduct distributed modal identification so that the
agility of damage characterization and the efficiency of energy consumption of
the bridge monitoring system can be improved. The impact of the project will be
in advancing discovery, multi-disciplinary collaboration, teaching, and
training. The proposed research will enable bridge monitoring not previously
possible by conventional methods, which contributes to protecting society
through transformative improvements in methods for timely detection of bridge
response to earthquakes.
