9501688 LIVINGSTON This project continues support for the Planning and
Coordination Office of the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Program (U.S. JGOFS). As
a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional scientific enterprise, U.S. JGOFS seeks
to identify and quantify the physical, chemical and biological processes
controlling biogeochemical cycling in the ocean, and their interaction with the
global atmosphere. The goal is to understand the processes governing the
production and fate of biogenic materials in the sea well enough to predict
their influences on, and responses to, global scale perturbations. In order to
achieve these complex goals, the Planning and Coordination Office serves the
needs of coordination, implementation, communication, publication, planning and
representation of the scientific issues involved, both nationally and
internationally. A major process study in the Equatorial Pacific has been
concluded and is now in its latter stage of synthesis. Another process study in
the Arabian Sea is currently underway. Measurements of carbon dioxide, plankton,
and bio-optical properties are also continuing at the Bermuda and Hawaii Time-
Series stations. In addition to providing managerial support for those
activities, the Planning and Coordination Office also coordinates the scientific
planning activities of future U.S. JGOFS initiatives.
