This Mid-Career Advancement Award (MCAA) by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Professor Webe W. Kadima
at the State University of New York at Oswego to pursue training in NMR
techniques and data analysis methods used for the determination of protein
structure. Dr. Kadima will use high field NMR technology to study the role of
metal ions, such as Cd(II) and Fe(III), in the T- to R-allosteric transition in
the insulin hexamer (R6) in solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effects of metal
ions on the association and conformational equilibrium of insulin complexes with
metal ions will be investigated and the results applied to understanding the
behavior of insulin in solution and its regulation and function in vivo. The PI
will receive training at nearby institutions in protein structure determination
methods, which will be brought to SUNY Oswego to enhance her research involving
undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;
