9630531 Hedin Mechanisms of Base Cation Cycling in Forest Biogeochemical
Systems: Application of a New Tool A priority for research in the field of
biogeochemistry in the U.S. and other industrial nations is to understand how
modern human activities are affecting the integrity and stability of natural
ecosystems. It is particularly urgent to understand how forest resources are
affected, as indicated by recent scientific reports of increasing degradation in
forest health in some areas of North America and Europe, including instances of
"forest decline." One of the most important needs for predicting the status of
forests over the next century is an improved understanding of how humans are
perturbing the natural pathways by which forests feed on mineral nutrients (so
called "base cations"). Over the past two years, a new technique has been
developed that uses non-radioactive stable isotopes of strontium (isotope 84) to
directly trace how forest nutrition is affected by human activities. This
research applies this new application to forest ecosystems where human impacts
have been minimal to better understand the sources of base cations and how these
materials are utilized and cycled.
