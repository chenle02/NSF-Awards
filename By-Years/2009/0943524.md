ABSTRACT

07 July 2009 Proposal Number: 0943524 Institution: University of Washington PI:
W. Wilcock

This proposal will be awarded using funds made available by the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).

The proposal requests numerous Shipboard Scientific Support (SSSE) items for the
vessels operated by the University of Washington; namely the R/V THOMPSON and
BARNES. The requests specifically include items that have been recommended from
past NSF inspections, Navy INSURV's, or Post-Cruise Assessments (PCA's) and have
been otherwise deferred by the operators due to cost. All of the items requested
will either improve safety, enhance science support capability, or extend vessel
service life. Due to the nature and timing of these requests, the vendor
quotation standards normally required by the SSSE Program were waived out of
necessity with many of the figures provided as estimates for budgetary purposes
and based mainly on past experience of the vessel operators for similar work.

Broader Impacts: The University of Washington vessels support federally funded
scientific research throughout the world's oceans to expand human knowledge of
the ocean environment. During operations, the vessels routinely expose graduate
and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography through the Teachers at Sea
program, real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and University
open house events. All told, the THOMPSON and BARNES are scheduled to complete
over 260 NSF sponsored days in 2009.
