This institutional infrastructure project will build on two previous CRI grants
in order to significantly enhance the current shared high performance computing
infrastructure in order to keep up with rapidly increasing research demands. The
resulting world-class computing facilities will be shared with all Computer
Science (CS) faculty researchers, Binghamton collaborators, external
collaborators, and students. Specifically, the requested infrastructure consists
of high-end PowerEdge Blade servers along with a robust and high performance
storage subsystem. These systems address the computational and storage needs
common to research projects in microarchitectural-level power and performance
assessment tool design, data center energy optimization techniques, parallel
discrete event simulation, multimedia senor networks, Grid and cloud scheduling,
data reduction of scientific datasets, large scale web database integration
systems projects, virtualization, real-time data services, and I/O intensive
simulation projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting world-class computing
facilities will benefit students, faculty, and collaborators. It will be used to
enhance a wide variety of courses, and the project includes a coordinated
education and research program that enhances the department's instruction and
student training efforts. Results will be disseminated to a wide audience
through research publications and also on a Web page devoted to the project to
advertise how the facility is being used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CS Department
where the equipment is housed is committed to increasing the enrollment of women
and students from traditionally underrepresented groups, and its involvement of
undergraduates in research (as evidenced, e.g., by a current CISE REU Site).
This equipment will help the department to advance these efforts by driving
research that will be attractive to the best students from these groups.
