9510391 Kirwan This project is on research to improve fermentation yield and
reliability by developing better methods to account for the influence of raw
material variation on performance. Media ingredients are typically of natural
origin and poorly characterized making it difficult to establish and quantify
their influence on the fermentation process. Near Infrared (NIR)
spectrophotometry will be examined as a means to quantitatively characterize
media ingredients for correlation to fermentation performance. A graduate
student is to spend a semester and summer working at the Merck &amp; Co.
facility in Elkton, Virginia, as part of a cooperative research program with the
University of Virginia. ***
