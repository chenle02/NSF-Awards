Work on this award will evaluate how the process of coevolution shapes
interactions between insects and plants over large geographic scales. Many
interactions between plants and their herbivores and pollinators occur across
multiple ecoregions. These interactions evolve in different ways in different
regions, but they are connected by movement of individuals among populations.
The purpose of this award is to understand how the large-scale structure of
these interactions develops amid this geographic mosaic of coevolution. The
results will contribute to our understanding of how biodiversity is organized
over large geographic scales, and how interactions between species may persist
in a constantly changing world. The results will therefore contribute to our
understanding of how best to conserve the earth's biodiversity through efforts
at regional and continental scales.

The research will use the moth Greya politella and its major hostplant
Lithophragma parviflorum. These species range from the U.S. Rockies to coastal
California. This is one of the most widely-distributed interactions between
plants and insects in western North America. The traits of the species, the
ecological outcomes of the interaction between them, and the genetic structure
of the populations are already known from past work to vary regionally. The
species can also be easily manipulated in the field, laboratory, and greenhouse.
This interaction therefore provides a useful model for analyses of the
geographic mosaic of coevolution.
