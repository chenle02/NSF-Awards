Abstract

Award: DMS-0943046 Principal Investigator: Zhongmin Shen

Riemannian geometry plays an important role in many areas of mathematics and
natural science. Recent study also shows that non-Riemannian geometry has
applications in mathematical psychology, general relativity, PDE, navigation
problems, imaging process, and module spaces, etc. Riemannian geometry provides
some basic tools to study non-Riemannian spaces. There are also new methods
developed exclusively for the investigation of non-Riemannian spaces.

This workshop will provide a platform for geometers to communicate with each
other and discuss the research projects for the future. This workshop will also
provide a good opportunity for mathematicians to understand non-Riemannian
geometry and find motivation to work in this area. The conference web site is
