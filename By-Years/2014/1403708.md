The collection and analysis of high dimensional data is now of central
importance in a wide range of scientific applications, including genomics,
bioinformatics, climate studies, and signal processing. There are many new
challenges in the analysis of such high dimensional data and there is much
demand for the development of new statistical theory and methodology in this
field. Although high dimensional data is often analyzed using complex models in
many applications, attention is often focused on testing specific hypotheses
that are of low dimension. In such cases new statistical theory and methodology
relies on the development of new techniques for estimating non-smooth
functionals, the topic of this project.

The focus of this research project is to establish a comprehensive methodology
for estimating non-smooth functionals and to show how this methodology can be
used in the detection and testing of multiple high-dimensional sparse sequences
encountered in genomics. The proposed research will provide scientists with new
methodologies to analyze such highly complex data. The statistical procedures
developed in this project will be implemented in a high-level programming
language and made available on the internet with the related research reports so
as to allow comparisons with other approaches.
