This project at Bay Path College is having a significant impact on the size of
the pool of qualified workers who are capable of pursuing careers in science in
the Western New England Region. One of the goals of the project is to increase
the retention and baccalaureate degree attainment of women, including minority
and first-generation college students, who will graduate well-prepared to pursue
careers or graduate programs in the life sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
program is providing scholarships to 40 students based on financial need and
academic eligibility. Group tutoring offered through the grant augments tutoring
already offered on campus. This project is providing opportunities for student
research, mentoring, co-curricular activities, and STEM career exploration and
development. The project is improving retention in the first two years,
increasing participation in research, increasing degree attainment, and
preparing graduates for work in the life sciences after graduation.
