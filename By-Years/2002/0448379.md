The DNA mismatch repair system maintains the integrity of the genome by locating
and correcting errors in DNA, and preventing recombination between non-identical
DNA sequences. Thus, it plays a critical role in DNA metabolism. Mismatch repair
initiates with the MutS protein (or MutS homologues) recognizing a base pairing
defect in the double helix, followed by stimulation of nuclease activities that
result in limited excision of the error-containing strand, and re-synthesis of
correct DNA by replication proteins. Mismatch repair proteins have been the
focus of intense study over the past several years; however, in many cases, the
mechanistic basis of their actions is not clearly understood. To understand the
workings of these proteins, the research project will address: (a) how MutS
protein specifically recognizes mis-paired DNA from the vast excess of normal
duplex DNA in the cell; (b) how MutS protein uses ATP to set in motion the
events leading to DNA repair; and (c) events occurring in the repair pathway
immediately following mismatch recognition and the role of ATP at this stage.
The primary approach in these studies will be the application of rapid kinetic
techniques to observe reactions in real time and determine the kinetic and
thermodynamic parameters governing mismatch repair protein actions. The research
project will be coupled with initiatives aimed at improving understanding and
communication of molecular biology and biochemistry among students of science
and other disciplines. Educational activities will include development of
courses on science documentary filmmaking as well as science writing,
introduction of outreach activities in science courses, and increasing
opportunities for students to engage in individual research. Thus, in addition
to improving understanding of a key cellular DNA repair pathway, the project
aims to further science literacy in the student community, within and beyond the
university.
