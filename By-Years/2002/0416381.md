J. L. Beauchamp of the California Institute of Technology is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study the mechanism of ion formation
from charged and neutral drops with applications to gas phase ion chemistry and
chemical analysis. Frontier research is planned in three areas, including (1)
continued studies of the mechanism of desolvated ion formation from small
charged droplets, expected to provide greater insights into the process of ion
formation in electrospray ionization (ESI) (2) a new initiative to characterize
a novel method developed in the PI laboratory using field induced droplet
ionization (FIDI), to extract molecular ions and clusters from neutral droplets,
based on neutral droplet instability in strong electric fields and (3)
application of these methods to studies ranging from environmental analysis to
nanoparticle chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies are expected to lead
to new and efficient techniques for ion collection and analysis, with
applications that include not only the sensitive detection of biological
molecules, but also measurements of explosives, chemical and biological weapons
agents, and chemicals of environmental interest.&lt;br/&gt;
