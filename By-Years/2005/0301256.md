The proposed research explores the development of a novel, low cost composite
material aimed at the strengthening and upgrading of reinforced and prestressed
concrete members. The proposed composite material intends to maintain and
improve on the performance and installation advantages of FRP systems, while
significantly reducing their cost. This new composite material is composed of a
knitted high-strength steel cord impregnated in a polymeric resin matrix and is
called SRP, for steel reinforced polymer. The steel cord, a commodity product
used in the radial tire manufacturing industry, has the strength and stiffness
of carbon fiber at a fraction of its cost. To support the development of this
novel, low cost composite material, the research program consists of the
following two tasks; (1) Develop the material constitutive relations, and (2)
Conduct experimental and analytical studies that can substantiate the
feasibility of SRP for implementation into the strengthening of RC and PC
structural members. At the conclusion of this research, the SRP composite could
be ready for demonstration in the field. Some of the fundamental issues such as
long-term durability would need further study, but field demonstration will
still be warranted at this phase. This project will also be integrated within a
strong education and technology transfer program, and will involve undergraduate
and graduate students in every phase of the project. In addition, UMR is home to
an NSF industry cooperation research center that deals with the retrofit and
repair of bridges and buildings with composites, and potential manufacturers of
the product and a leading concrete repair contractor will be directly involved
in this research project so that all aspects of technology transfer are
addressed in a systematic manner.
