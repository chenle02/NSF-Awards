The Association of American Geographers (AAG) requests funds to support the
participation of United States scholars in International Geographical Union
(IGU) activities from April 2004 through November 2006. The two phases of IGU
activities for which support is sought are the participation of 32 US scholars
in the 15-20 August 2004 30th International Geographical Congress in Glasgow,
Scotland, UK and of 20 US scholars in the August 2006 IGU Regional Conference in
Cairns, Queensland, Australia. &lt;br/&gt;Widespread participation of U.S.
geographers in the International Geographical Congress in Glasgow and in the
Cairns Regional Conference will augment US scholars' exposure and participation
internationally for geography and related disciplines, will enhance basic
geographic research in the United States, and will contribute to further
networking within the global geographic community.&lt;br/&gt;
