The accurate measurement of concentrations or fluxes of trace gases in the
atmosphere is crucial to many areas of atmospheric research. Instrumentation
based on tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy has wide generality for
detection of many atmospheric species. To date, however, such systems have
usually been bulky and awkward to operate and do not have adequate sensitivity
for the measurement of a number of important species in the atmosphere at low
concentrations. The goal of this program is to develop a rapid response, high
sensitivity sensor using single-mode liquid nitrogen- cooled lead-salt diode
lasers. In Phase I of this program, techniques that substantially reduce the
problem of optical fringes in multiple pass absorption cells were developed.
These fringes are often the limiting factor for achieving high sensitivity. The
major objectives of the Phase II research are to improve further the sensitivity
for infrared diode laser absorption and the study methods for simplifying
instrument design using infrared fiber optics. A prototype spectrometer will be
assembled for local field measurements of ambient hydrogen peroxide
concentrations in order to demonstrate ultrasensitve, real-time detection of
trace atmospheric species. Results of the Phase II study will provide the
required design information for Phase III commercial development of
instrumentation for atmospheric research.
