as a series of events, including partner choice, information gathering, and
haggling. The context in which these negotiations occur--the market--is critical
because individuals can adjust their demands in response to those of other
players. Animals are faced with similar decisions during reproduction: who to
court, how to approach a potential partner, at what level to display compared to
competitors and when to give up unsuccessful interactions. Thus, economic models
of negotiation in a market provide a framework in which courtship can be viewed
as a process in which males and females use a series of tactics to improve their
success. This project uses greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) as a
model species to examine the importance of tactics used by males during
courtship. A combination of experiments and detailed observations will be used,
including robotic females to serve as experimental stimuli, multiple microphones
and video cameras to record male signals and breeding behaviors. This approach
will allow for the experimental study of courtship interactions in a wild
population. Using this framework, the investigators expect to show that success
in courtship, as in business, requires an attractive offer as well as skilled
negotiation. Sage-grouse are currently being considered for federal listing as
an endangered species. This project involves collaboration with an environmental
education specialist to conduct extensive outreach addressing the role of basic
and applied science in management decisions. This work will also compliment the
ongoing applied research by the investigator to address how noise pollution may
disrupt sage-grouse courtship negotiations and contribute to their population
declines. This project involves mentorship and salary for a postdoctoral scholar
and graduate students, and mentorship for dozens of undergraduates, many from
underrepresented minorities.
