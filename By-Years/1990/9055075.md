The University of Notre Dame will initiate a six-week, commuter Young Scholars
project in the Natural Sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Earth Sciences and Physics)
and Engineering for thirty grade 12 and up to five grade 11 students.
Participants will commute daily to the University of Notre Dame campus for six
summer weeks of morning instruction, seminars/workshops, library research and
homework, and afternoon direct participation in faculty- directed laboratory
research work, and professional grade instrumentation and materials. Stipends of
$90.00/week will be awarded, with some travel subsidy. During the following
academic year each participant's High School Science class will be visited by
the corresponding faculty mentor for at least a one-period talk. One Recognition
and Awards ceremony will take place on campus in early September, followed by
one seminar-type meeting each following semester, for all participants.
