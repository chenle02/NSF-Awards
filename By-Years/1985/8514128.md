Research will be conducted on numerical experiments in fluid mechanics. The bulk
of the turbulent forces are found to be "force free," i.e., the vorticity is
nearly parallel to the velocity field. This feature might be used to model
large-scale coherent flow structures. New computational methods are developed to
investigate the geometry of chaotic flows and dynamics of direct-interactions
for anisotropic shear turbulence.
