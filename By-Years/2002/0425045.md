This proposal is to provide multi-year funding for a science journalists
training fellowship in Arctic sciences. The Science Journalism Program has been
in operation through the Marine Biological Laboratory for the past 17 years but
has been funded on an ad-hoc basis. This proposal would increase the number of
journalists that can participate in the program and that receive training in
Arctic sciences, as well as provide three years of continuous funding in order
to expand the Arctic field section of the program. The participating journalists
will receive training in the environmental sciences in a "hands-on laboratory
course" held at the MBL in Wood Hole, then they would travel to the Toolik Lake
LTER , Alaska for approximately 10 days to participate in on going scientific
projects. This program has had strong support from journalists and has proven
results through the participant's articles on Arctic
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
