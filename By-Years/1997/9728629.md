The investigator uses experimental data from the MAPSTAR medium frequency
partial reflection radar (operated during the Arecibo Initiative on the Dynamics
of the Atmosphere). He plans corrections to previously published estimates of
atmospheric turbulence in the mesopause, deduced from medium frequency radar,
applying the imaging Doppler interferometry (IDI) technique. IDI measures
positions and line-of-sight velocities of individual scatterers, so only those
scatterers close to the zenith can be chosen, minimizing contamination of the
vertical velocity by the larger horizontal components of gravity wave
velocities. His method corrects both the remaining gravity wave and finite
zenith angle contamination of IDI data. Finally, he compares Doppler broadening,
fading rate and IDI turbulent dissipation rate measurements using the AIDA data
set.
