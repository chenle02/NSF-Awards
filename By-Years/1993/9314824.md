9314824 Wood The principal objectives of this high-risk project are to test and
refine two promising spectroscopic techniques for use in hydrothermal studies of
REE complexes. The first technique involves use of nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy to study La chloride complexes using 139La over a range of
concentrations, temperatures, and pH. The second technique involves pulsed
photoacoustic spectroscopy to study Nd and Er chloride complexes under similar
conditions. Successful development of these techniques will allow for rapid
advances in characterization of high temperature metal complexes, especially REE
complexes, in hydrothermal solutions. The techniques will find application in
studies of REE mobility as relevant to radioactive waste disposal, petrogenetic
tracers, development of REE resources, and the REE budget of the oceans.
