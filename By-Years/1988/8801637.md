Under this interagency transfer, the Department of State will support, under the
U.S.-Spain Program for Scientific and Technical Cooperation, a study of the
complex structures of recently identified polyether marine toxins by Dr. Koji
Nakanishi of Columbia University. This study will utilize nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) techniques to study simple synthetic
models with the structural features encountered in polyether toxins. The results
will be compared with X- ray data when available. The NMR parameters will be
correlated with the CD data to determine both relative and absolute
configurations of these models. The basic data will then be applied to naturally
occurring complex polyether toxins to determine their full structures.
