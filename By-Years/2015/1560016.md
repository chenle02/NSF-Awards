The University of Wisconsin Madison will host an REU (Research Experiences for
Undergraduates) site in astronomy. Students will work under close supervision of
faculty and research scientists for ten weeks each summer on research projects
that span a broad range of scientific areas. This program will benefit society
by enhancing the education of undergraduates through research and professional
development programs and by extending these opportunities to students from
institutions otherwise unable to offer such experiences. Students will be
actively recruited at meetings of several national organizations and through
participation in the National Astronomy Consortium, a new partnership that
focuses on the recruitment and continued professional development of
underrepresented minority students.

Research opportunities include experimental physics, instrumentation, and
astrophysics. All faculty mentors are required to participate in a training
seminar offered at the start of each summer. The program also includes: a
lecture series in astrophysics, training in scientific presentations, web-page
and Python programming, scientific ethics, graduate school preparation, field
trips, and opportunities to participate in public outreach events.
