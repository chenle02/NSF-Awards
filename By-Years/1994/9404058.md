9404058 Thomas Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) is important to industry since it
is a means to assure safety, product quality and a company's image. Advances in
the interdisciplinary scientific areas that make up NDE can have a direct effect
on improving productivity and profits. The Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Nondestructive Evaluation was started in 1985 to develop a
research program thru industry/university interaction. Wayne State University
plans to become an addition to this Iowa State University Center expanding its
research base. This award provides funding for a planning meeting at Wayne State
University to determine if sufficient industrial support can be developed for
merging the two research programs. The Principal Investigator and his colleagues
are nationally recognized experts in their fields. The Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Nondestructive Evaluation and its industry
members have concurred in this proposal plan. This proposal has been coordinated
with Dr. Cheena Srinivasan, Program Manager, Division of Design and
Manufacturing, Manufacturing Machines &amp; Equipment. The Program Manager
recommends Wayne State University be awarded $9,880 for 6 months for a planning
meeting.
