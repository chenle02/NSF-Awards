DNA in all organisms exists in large molecules known as chromosomes. In order to
fit huge chromosomes into cells, the DNA is compacted by wrapping around
chromatin proteins. The major type of chromatin proteins are the histones. This
project will focus on Asf1, a protein that binds to histones and delivers them
onto DNA during the construction of chromosomes. During the past grant period,
it was demonstrated that Asf1 is regulated by proteins that are required for
duplicating DNA molecules. These studies will be extended by asking the
following questions: Which proteins interact with Asf1? Where on the chromosomes
is the Asf1 protein located? How does Asf1 affect the duplication of DNA
molecules? Which portions of the Asf1 protein are required for these different
activities?
