Mathematical programming is concerned with finding the best solution in some
specified sense to problems with many variables subject to many constraints.
Practical applications of such are found in virtually every branch of science,
technology, and decision science. The general goal of this project is to extend
the scope of mathematical programming methods and to make them more effective by
enlarging the size of problems that can be handled, by increasing the speed with
which the computing is done, and by improving the usefulness of the answers
obtained, including ways in which the results may be implemented to the benefit
of society.
