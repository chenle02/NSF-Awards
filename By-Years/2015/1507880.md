With this award, the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the Division of
Chemistry is funding Professor Ephraim Woods of Colgate University to study
short-lived chemical species that are generated by the interaction of light with
aerosol particles which are similar to those found in the troposphere. One goal
of the work is to determine the conditions that promote the growth of organic
aerosol particles through photochemistry. These secondary organic aerosol
particles influence climate through their effects on the Earth's radiation
balance. In terms of broader scientific impact, this research is expected to
lead to a better understanding of the processes that affect climate and help
scientists to forge improved predictive models. Another impact is the
professional development of the undergraduates at Colgate University who conduct
this work. In participating as team members on this project, undergraduates gain
experience in research methods and become better prepared for graduate work in
the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experiments in this project are designed to
examine photochemically generated transient species in aerosol systems using
photoionization methods. One type of experiment will probe the formation of
secondary organic aerosols (SOA) through the reactive uptake of volatile organic
molecules (VOCs) with particle phase triplet photosensitizers. The goal of this
work is to further understand how the structure and morphology of the air-
particle interface influences the kinetics of this newly identified SOA
formation mechanism. Another type of experiment investigates the production of
radicals from nitrate-containing particles. A third experiment characterizes
solvated electrons in environments that are unexplored and not accessible
through other experiments. The investigation of aerosol properties and surfaces
in these studies is expected to establish an improved molecular-level
understanding of these complex chemical systems.
