The pineal gland, a small organ connected to the eyes and located near the
center of the brain, produces a hormone that provides important timing
information to the body. The pineal gland accomplishes this timing function by
releasing the hormone melatonin into the blood only during darkness. Because of
this, daytime levels of melatonin in the blood are low while they are high at
night. Due to these day/night changes in melatonin, every organ in the body is
given information, even though not connected to the eyes, as to whether it is
light or dark. When day length (and of course night length change), such as
during the various seasons of the year, the melatonin message from the pineal
gland also changes accordingly. The biological mechanisms whereby the pineal
gland is able to release high melatonin levels for longer periods during winter
nights are unknown. The purpose of this research is to define how this is
accomplished. The problem is, does the brain "dictate" to the pineal gland how
long it must produce melatonin or does the pineal gland determine its own fate
and regulate the duration of melatonin release. The studies outlined will
examine these questions. The information garnered will be applicable to a number
of important biological problems, e.g. seasonal reproduction in animals,
seasonal variation in wool growth and milk production, daily variations in work
efficiency, understanding "jet lag" and the ability of shift workers to adapt to
new schedules, as well as understanding conditions such as "winter depression".
