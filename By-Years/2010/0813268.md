Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the running of
a summer workshop to train educators in effectively using the Alice programming
environment at the secondary and post-secondary education levels. The objectives
of this workshop are to (1) prepare educators to effectively use the Alice
programming environment in a Media Computation course, (2) create a course
setting that will attract Hispanic students from a variety of academic
disciplines into computing-related fields, and (3) increase the number of
Hispanic students who will choose computing-related fields as their area of
study. &lt;br/&gt;
