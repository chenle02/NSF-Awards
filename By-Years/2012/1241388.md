In 2010, the NSF Office of Cyberinfrastructure launched a new Faculty Early
Career Developent (CAREER) program to support investigators working on
interdisciplinary research in cyberinfrastructure and the application of
cyberinfrastructure for science and engineering research. This award will
support a 1.5 day workshop during June 25-26, 2012 in Arlington, VA to bring
together the community of OCI CAREER awardees. The workshop objectives are to:
(1) encourage networking and discussion among awardees; (2) provide a forum to
facilitate the discovery of new synergies and connections among researchers from
the community; and (3) provide inspiration and motivation for new research
through a series of keynote presentations from leaders in the areas of Grand
Challenges in Cyberinfrastructure, Big Data, Computational Science, High
Performance Computing, and Visualization. By bringing together leaders from
these areas with cyberinfrastructure researchers, the workshop seeks to inspire
new approaches to solving critical research problems. The results of the
workshop will be widely disseminated through a final report and website
containing project reports and presentation materials.
