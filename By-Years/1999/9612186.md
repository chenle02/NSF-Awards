9612186 Sanders Reinforced concrete hinges are frequently used at the base of
bridge columns to release moment transfer in one or both principal directions.
Hinged column bases are used throughout the country for reducing foundation
forces for thermal/shrinkage loads and other loads in the direction of the
hinge. The proposed study will investigate strength evaluation and retrofitting
of reinforced concrete pinned bridge pier to footing connections. The project is
an experimental study with ten 1/2-scale specimens. The research will study the
effects of axial load, develop and test retrofit details, and determine the
shear strength capacity in the weak axis direction under large cyclic rotations.
The design, retrofit, and repair recommendations will provide designers with a
methodology from which to evaluate and design one-way hinges in piers. ***
