maps into and between singular spaces

Abstract

The principal investigator proposes to study harmonic maps into and between
singular spaces. The classical theory of harmonic maps deals with maps between
Riemannian manifolds. More recently, the importance of considering singular
domains and targets has been discovered. Harmonic map theory in singular spaces
was initiated by Gromov and Schoen and their analysis of harmonic maps into non-
positively curved Riemannian simplicial complexes combined with Corlette's
vanishing theorem is the basis of their proof of p-adic super-rigidity. The
study of harmonic maps into singular targets was further generalized by Korevaar
and Schoen and independently by Jost. Further generalization is to consider
singular domains. In this project, we study harmonic maps from a simplicial
polyhedron to a metric space of non-positive curvature. A fundamental question
is the regularity of these maps, and our goal is to show that these maps are
smooth enough to be useful in many applications. In particular, we hope to bring
harmonic map theory and holomorphic quadratic differentials into the study of
finitely generated groups. More precisely, we will use harmonic maps from a two-
dimensional simplicial complex to understand finitely generated groups from
their actions on R-trees. This point of view is important in the study of
combinatorial group theory and three-dimensional topology. Harmonic maps will
also be used to investigate compactifications of the Teichmuller space of a
compact surface. Finally, the study of minimal surfaces will be considered as an
extension of the generalized harmonic map theory. The proposed work contributes
to the basic understanding of geometric variational problems. Mathematicians
have devoted large effort in developing variational methods and the successes of
these investigations have laid the foundations of many branches of sience. There
is a natural notion of energy associated to maps between certain spaces and, in
this project, we study its critical points which are called harmonic maps. They
have shown to be extremely useful as an analytic tool in geometry. The
generalization of harmonic maps between smooth spaces to non-smooth spaces
promises to yield many more applications. We investigate the extent to which the
classical methods in harmonic maps can be carried over to the singular setting.
The applications of the generalized theory make these questions relevant to a
broad mathematical community.
