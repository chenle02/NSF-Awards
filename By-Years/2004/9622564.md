9622564 In this project, seven problems in the general context of algebraic
geometry, quantum cohomology, and their interplay with physics are proposed to
be investigated. The main tools are Grothendieck-Knudsen-Mumford determinant
line bundles over moduli space of Gieseker semistable bundles on algebraic
surfaces and Gromov-Witten symplectic invariants. The investigation would
increase the knowledge about the geometry including the quantum cohomology ring
structure of the moduli space of Gieseker semistable bundles, the S-duality
conjecture from physics in the form of Vafa and Witten, and the deformation type
of certain minimal surfaces of general type (a conjecture due to Catanese and
Reid). This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry
is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a
revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In the origin, it treated
figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
polynomials. Nowadays, the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but
from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those
fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.
