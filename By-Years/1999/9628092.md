9628092 Hauri This project will begin a new generation of trace element
partitioning experiments at the high pressures and temperatures applicable to
magmatic conditions throughout the Earth's upper mantle and transition zone to
the top of the lower mantle. The results will have important implications for
the ancient and continuing differentiation of planetary interiors by partial
melting and crystal fractionation. Synthesis experiments, including long-
duration, time-series, and reversal experiments will be performed on the multi-
anvil presses at the Geophysical Laboratory and at SUNY Stony Brook. The
starting material will consist of a combination of natural rocks ranging from
basalt to peridotite, with trace elements doped at 1000 ppm level where
necessary. The trace element partition coefficients will be analyzed by ion
probe at Woods Hole and the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism. Many elements
will be examined simultaneously in individual experiments, focusing on about 20
key elements which are well determined in natural rocks (transition metals, REE,
high-field-strength elements, alkalis and alkali-earth elements), provide
potentially stringent tests of intramantle differentiation (e.g. pseudo-constant
ratios Ce/Pb, Nb/U, Ba/Rb, K/U, etc.) and provide crucial links to the long-
lived radioactive isotope systems (Rb/Sr, Sm/Nd, Lu/Hf, U/Pb, Th/Pb).
