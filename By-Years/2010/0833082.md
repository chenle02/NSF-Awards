Writing a program to solve a large scale computational problem on a
supercomputer is much more difficult than writing a program to solve the same
problem on an ordinary computer. DARPA's High Productivity Computing Systems
program has focused attention on a new family of parallel programming languages
that reduce the effort required to develop supercomputer programs. One of the
most widely used of these languages is Unified Parallel C (UPC). This research
project develops a way to predict how long UPC programs will run so that
programmers will know beforehand whether their programs will run efficiently.
Predicting program run times reduces the need for the trial-and-error
development of programs. This saves the time of the programmers and the
supercomputer, both expensive commodities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
advances work on a performance model for UPC implementations that run on
clusters. A model that describes the remote reuse distance for objects in the
software cache is developed. This is a natural extension of local reuse distance
for hardware cache. An analysis of remote reuse distance yields functions that
predict cache behavior and its impact on performance. The effects of problem
size, blocking factor, and the number of threads are included in the model.
Common benchmarks, such as the NAS parallel benchmarks, are used to validate the
model. The addition of a model of software cache behavior provides programmers
with more accurate information about overall run times and suggests ways to
improve software cache management for UPC and other languages in its
family.&lt;br/&gt;
