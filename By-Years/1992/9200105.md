The objective of this proposal is to further investigate the theoretical and
experimental validity of a newly discovered phenomenon by which the fluid
flowing through a polluted, unsaturated, fine-grained soil can be controlled by
a thermal- electromagnetic process. If proven correct, this technique can
dramatically improve the cost and time involved in electrokinetic methodologies
presently used to decontaminate polluted soils.
