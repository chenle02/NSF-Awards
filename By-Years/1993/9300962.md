The goal of this research is to examine the behavior of the modified barrier
method on linear and nonlinear programming in order to understand better the
relationships between empirical and theoretical behavior. A variety of modified
barrier methods will be studied. The modified barrier method of the PI is a very
general approach for solving linear and nonlinear programming problems. This
area has applications to a variety of important problems in engineering,
particularly in the design of minimal weight structures.
