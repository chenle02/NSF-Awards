SSC-9350580 The Science Place Dallas, TX Sudduth, William, Mooz, Elizabeth and
Hafey, Charles "Summer Science Camp" Since science and math skills need to be
strengthened among minority teens, The Science Place (TSP) Summer Science Camp
(SSC) is designed to provide a six-week program to this target group emphasizing
scientific and computer instruction, exposure to scientific research, career
exploration, communication skills, family involvement, and student contact with
scientists and engineers. The program is a collaborative effort involving TSP
staff, Dallas ISD students, the YMCA of Metropolitan Dallas, and the D.C. James
Learning Center. Students will be selected on the basis of questionnaires,
interviews, and recommendations. Six scientific modules will be introduced
depicting: physics, the environment, electricity, astronomy, health and biology,
and math. Other areas to be included are: visiting scientists, career
opportunities,and physical education. During the SSC, student teams will select
one area of special interest, write a report and give an oral talk at a family
camp-in at TSP. Students will be encouraged to continue contact with TSP
throughout the year with a complementary TSP membership. Students will be
tracked for their progress by DISD teachers, encouraged to educate their peers
and maintain their interest in science by volunteering at TSP.
