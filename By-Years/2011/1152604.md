The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Profs. Joel Pedersen and Robert Hamers of
University of Wisconsin, Madison. Profs. Pedersen and Hamers and their students
will investigate the interaction of well-defined peptides with metal oxide
nanoparticles as a first step toward a deeper understanding of how nanoparticles
interact with proteins. Titanium dioxide and aluminum oxide will be used as
model systems for investigation. The specific aims of the study are: (i) employ
discovery tools (phage-display methods) to identify binding motifs in short
peptide sequences (heptapeptides) that lead to high affinity for nanoparticles
of environmental relevance; (ii) investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of
peptide binding to TiO2 and Al2O3 nanoparticles, using both binding sequences
identified via phage-display methods and simpler combinations of amino acids in
tetrapeptides to elucidate binding rules; and (iii) identify the peptide
functional groups that interact with the nanoparticles and understand the nature
of peptide-surface bonds by combining experimental with computational methods.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this research will be a fundamental
understanding of the molecular level interactions that control the interactions
of peptides with metal oxide nanoparticles. Knowledge of how factors such as
peptide sequence, nanoparticle composition and structure, and solution
composition affect peptide-nanoparticle interactions will provide insights into
the physical and chemical processes that ultimately control the environmental
safety and health impacts of nanomaterials. The project will provide outstanding
educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students desiring to
understand the interface between nanomaterials and biological systems.
