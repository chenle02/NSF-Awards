The study of shapes that are in an equilibrium position was started by Lagrange
300 year ago. These special shapes are called minimal surfaces and they are
ubiquitous in Science, serving to model soap films, black holes in General
Relativity, or tensile structures in architecture. Moreover, they come in two
types: those which are stable, i.e., if perturbed they return to their original
equilibrium position and those which are unstable, i.e., if perturbed they move
away from their original position. The first type has been extensively studied
in Mathematics over the last 40 years and they have been used to solve many long
standing open questions in Geometry and Mathematical Relativity. The second type
started being studied more systematically some years ago by Marques and the PI
and they were used to solve some open problems such as the Willmore Conjecture
or the problem of finding infinitely many unstable minimal surfaces. The project
presented plans to continue the study of unstable minimal surfaces. Its goals
are twofold: On one hand to develop the theory that governs their existence and
on the other hand to study their properties as the degrees of instability become
quite large because this is expected to uncover new relations across Geometry,
Topology, and Analysis.

More precisely, the objectives of the project are to further develop the
Almgren-Pitts Min-max Theory and to study the properties of minimal surfaces
when seen as nonlinear eigenvalues to the volume spectrum. For the first part we
aim to investigate how to bound from below the index of min-max minimal surfaces
by the number of parameters and to relate that problem with the multiplicity one
conjecture. An application of that result would be to solve a stronger version
of a conjecture of Yau. The second objective is motivated by the recent Weyl Law
for the volume spectrum that the PI proved with Marques and Liokumovich. This
property suggests a stronger analogy between eigenfunctions for the Laplacian
spectrum and minimal surfaces that we intend to explore and the possibility to
prove Weyl Laws for many other nonlinear problems. The techniques involved
combine ideas from Spectral Geometry, Morse Theory, and Minimal Surface theory.
