Prof. D.J. Quesnel will conduct research work in the area of particle technology
and prepare a related short course during a sabbatical year visit at the
Elmgrove Facility of Kodak Co. Six related research/education areas will be
considered at the beginning of the visit, including powder flow, toner dusting,
toner transfer, fine toner handling, molecular dynamic study of particle
adhesion, and training in powder mechanics. Based on that experience, the P.I.
will focus his activities on a major research thrust in the second part of the
visit. This is a GOALI Faculty in Industry proposal. It is expected that the
visit will foster long term collaboration between the University of Rochester
and Kodak Co., with benefits for both research and educational programs on
powder technology.
