The Grand Challenge Application Groups competition provides one mechanism for
the support of multidisciplinary teams of engineers and scientists to meet the
goals of the High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Initiative in
Fiscal Year 1992. The ideal proposal provides not only excellence in basic
research: focussed problem with potential for substantial impact in critical
area(s) of science and engineering, but also significant interactions between
the various disciplinary and computational activities involving mathematical,
computer or computational scientists, that would have an impact in high
performance computational activity beyond the specific problem area(s) or
discipline being studied. These are the goals of this project which is a
collaboration between applied mathematics, astrophysics, computer and
computational science, engineering, geophysical sciences, to develop parallel
algorithms for problems relating to Coupled Fields and Coherent Structures and
Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics (GAFD) Turbulence. The common
denominator of the various application areas are performance measures, massive
data sets, and the visualization of multi- terabyte data sets. In addition to
the expertise at the University of Colorado at Boulder, scientists at the
National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) will contribute to geostrophic
turbulence and ocean convection research, and a sub-contract will be given to
the scientists at the University of Minnesota who will contribute expertise in
both astrophysics and visualization.
