This project will provide an opportunity for three weeks of con- centrated
study of electricity and magnetism for 30 Wisconsin high school teachers of
physics and/or physical science. The schedule calls for lecture/discussion
sessions as well as laboratory work. The instructional staff includes two
University physics professors and one master teacher from a nearby high school;
in addition, scientists from local industries will participate. As part of the
follow-up activities, the workshop director will visit the classrooms of the
teacher participants during the spring following the summer workshop. In
addition the participants will meet during the spring meeting of the Wisconsin
Society of Science Teachers to discuss their experiences in implementing the new
material covered during the workshop into their regular courses. The evaluation
plan calls for several different activities. First, the workshop will be visited
and assessed by the Science Supervisor from the State Department of Public
Instruction. Second, an opinion survey will be completed by participants near
the end of the workshop. Third, the project director will assess the impact of
the workshop on teaching practices during the on-site visits and the spring
meeting. Finally, a questionnaire completed by participants during the academic
year after the workshop will determine the extent to which ten specific project
goals were achieved. The dissemination plan will also be completed in four
steps: 1) The project director will report results at a convention of the
Northwest Wisconsin Education Association. 2) Reports will also be given at
meetings of the Wisconsin Society of Science Teachers and the American
Association of Physics Teachers. 3) The instructional materials used during the
workshop, all developed locally specifically for this workshop, will be supplied
to interested teachers on request. 4) Participants will be encouraged to write
articles about the influence of the workshop on their teaching for professional
journals. This is a well-designed project. It promises to make a major impact on
high school physics teaching in Wisconsin. In addition, it includes several
innovative features, and the evaluation plan is sufficiently thorough to allow
assessment of the effectiveness of these innovations.
