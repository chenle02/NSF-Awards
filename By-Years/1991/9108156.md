This is a travel grant for a USA-China-Japan Symposium/Workshop on Advanced
Adsorption/Separation Science and Technology. This workshop takes place in May
13-15, 1991, in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China (People's Republic) and is organized
by Profs. Ma (U.S.), Wu (China), and Suzuki (Japan). The workshop follows the
first one, held in Sept. 1988 in the same place. The goal is to stimulate
research, research interaction, and information exchange among scientists and
engineers of the three nations. Adsorption/separation technology is very
important in gas separation (air, water, pollutants, etc.) heavy metals, liquid
pollutants, and biochemical (proteins, aminoaicds, etc.) The grant covers
partial travel support for U.S. academic participants U.S. industrial
researchers also participate and benefit from this workshop.
