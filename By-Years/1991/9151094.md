This project establishs a dedicated Computer-Aided-Design Electronic Laboratory
for Electronic Engineering Technology and Computer Technology Programs at
Central Michigan University. The Llaboratory supports the four core course
sequence for these two majors. The laboratory hardware consists of ten IBM
PS/2-50Z computers, one HP laser printer and five Epson dot matrix printers. The
software includes PSPICE analog simulator, OrCAD/EDV digital design package and
MS-DOS 4.0. These facilities are used for practical and complex circuit
analysis, application of advanced design techniques, concept clarifications,
investigation of advanced topics as well as classroom demonstrations.
