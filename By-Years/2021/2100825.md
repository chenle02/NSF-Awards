In this project, the effects of collective action and collective efficacy on
health literacy are investigated. This is undertaken for local and remote
groups, including those native to their area and those who have relocated into
the region. Data are collected in two ways, through surveys, which are analyzed
statistically, and through interviews. The goal is to produce new theoretical
insights for future scholars, researchers, and practitioners working on social
determinants of health and population movements and their intersections at the
local and global levels. The project will also provide under-represented
students with hands-on research experience by providing them with the
opportunity to undertake fieldwork. Findings from this study contribute both
theoretically and empirically to the study of collective efficacy and health
literacy and are relevant to public health practitioners and decision
makers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study, sequential mixed methods are used to
understand the relationship between collective efficacy and health literacy.
Drawing on a community-engaged approach for partnership building with community
members, data are collected using, surveys, focus groups, and interviews for
both local and relocated groups. Specifically, the main components of collective
efficacy – social cohesion, informal social control, and social participation –
and their relationship with health literacy are measured in both groups’
contexts. A sample size is estimated based on Mixed Methods Test. Data analyses
use hierarchical statistical methods and qualitative coding methods as
appropriate. This project is supported jointly by the Sociology Program, the
HBCU-EIR Program, and the Build and Broaden Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
