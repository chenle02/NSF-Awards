Representation theory is the study of symmetries in algebra. An understanding of
symmetry allows us to reduce complicated problems to simpler ones. Algebra can
be used to describe a wide range of phenomena and structures throughout
mathematics and the real world, and consequently representation theory has many
important applications. Sheaves are geometric objects that generalize the usual
notion of functions and have proven to be extremely effective in advancing our
understanding of representation theory. This research project aims to uncover
finer information about sheaves and applications of this information to
representation theory.

Parity sheaves were introduced by the PI and his collaborators as a tool for
studying the representation theory of reductive groups in positive
characteristic. The study of parity sheaves has also suggested the existence of
new structures in categories of perverse sheaves. The PI will explore these
structures in some special, important, cases and their expected applications in
a number of areas including the representations of Hecke algebras and modular
representations of finite groups of Lie type. The geometric spaces to be studied
are nilpotent cones and their generalizations for symmetric pairs and in gauge
theory, as well as (generalized) flag varieties and toric varieties. The
proposed methods include utilizing cohomological parity vanishing properties,
nearby cycles and hyperbolic localization functors.
