The underlying theme that unifies this project is the development of inference
for multidimensional statistical analysis. This work has several different
thrusts, some of which have been of continuing interest to the principal
investigator, others new. The primary area of interest is the generation of
multivariate distributions with given marginal distributions. This will include
research on bivariate distributions generated from Bernoulli distributions;
families of bivariate distributions; families of distributions generated from
mixtures; bivariate uniform distributions; bivariate logistic distributions; and
bivariate distributions with constraints. Multivariate models with structured
parameters and measures of inequality will also be investigated.
