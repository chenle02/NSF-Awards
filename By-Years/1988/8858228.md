Dr. Vahala has been selected as a Presidential Young Investigator. He is active
in fundamental research on the application of nanostructure physics to solid
state devices - either to create novel devices or to improve existing devices.
In the research program for the National Science Foundation he will pursue
studies to include the following: (1) to create entirely new optical material
properties by nanometric patterning of substrates in two dimensions (or three
dimensions if a multiquantum well substrate is patterned), (2) to use individual
nanometer scale structures such as quantum boxes to study scaling limitations in
solid state devices. These new properties result from the onset of carrier
quantum confinement effects in two or three dimensions (at room temperature
onset requires structures on the order of 100-200 angstrom units in size. The
research in this grant will have impact on optical communications and signal
processing technology. The interactions with industry which are inherent with
Presidential Young Investigator grants will have implications for national
competitiveness in the opto-electronics field.
