This Phase-II research examines sodium-sulfur battery, a leading candiadate for
application in electric vehicles. A critical component in sodium-sulfur battery
is the electrolyte, Na-B-alumina. In the state-of-the-art sodium-sulfur
batteries, electrolyte thickness is approximately 1.5 mm which contributes
nearly 40% to cell specific resistance. Two approaches are proposed to favricate
thin (20 to 100 um) Na-B-alumina membranes which can reduce electrolyte
resistance by a factor of - 30. This should substantially increase power density
and energy efficiency. The two techniques proposed are: 1.) electrochemical
vapor deposition (EVD), and 2.) fabricate thin membranes of Na-B-alumina by
direct conversion of a-aluminia ; 3.) measure conduction properties of thin
membranes; 4.) explore the current carrying capacity of Na-B-alumina membranes
in electrochemical tests by sodium-sodium tests; 5.)explore the mechanism and
the kinetics of the EVD and direct conversion processes, and 6.) supply thin
electrolytes to a battery developer for evaluation in sodium-sulfur cells.
