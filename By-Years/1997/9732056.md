9732056 Leslie-Pelecky The University of Nebraska will continue a Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site on the interdisciplinary theme of
nanostructured materials. It proposes to target underrepresented groups in the
sciences and engineering, with the Midwest as the base of recruiting. Students
will participate in research projects on the synthesis and optical, electronic,
structural and magnetic properties of nanostructured materials. In addition, REU
participants will be offered several workshops on experimental techniques and
will attend weekly seminars. %%% The REU site, with a regional focus whereby
high quality undergraduates will be recruited from the Midwest, will provide an
interdisciplinary research experience to students who would not normally have
access to a research environment. ***
