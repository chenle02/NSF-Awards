Funds are provided to better constrain in-situ pore pressure, relationship
between pore pressure and porosity and compaction state of sediments in the
Nankai margin using existing 3-D seismic data. Pore pressure and compaction
state of underthrust sediments may be a key control on fault behavior because
the decollement localizes at the top of these sediments. The work will provide
important information necessary for the drilling of the Nankai seismogenic zone
under IODP.
