Stream data processing and mining represent an important, emerging class of
data-intensive applications where data flows in and out dynamically, in huge
(possibly infinite) volumes, adaptive to only single-scan algorithms, but often
demanding fast or even real-time responses. Based on the observation that a
majority of stream data resides at the primitive level of abstraction, but most
interesting patterns may need to be discovered at certain high levels of
abstraction in multi-dimensional space, this project focuses on the issues on
stream data mining and develop effective, efficient and scalable methods for
mining the dynamics of data streams in multi-dimensional space. The scope of
this study includes the discovery of changes, trends, and evolutions of
characteristics, clusters, classification models, and frequent patterns in data
streams. The methodology is to capture sufficient statistical, compact and
aggregate information in concise data structures to facilitate the efficient
processing of both continuous and ad-doc stream mining queries. Several
strategically important applications are being explored, including network
intrusion detection, telecommunication and Web data flow analysis, and financial
data flow analysis. This effort's results will contribute to the development of
the principles and new methods for real-time data mining systems and promote its
strategically important applications, including timely discovery of terrorist or
criminal activities for homeland security, intrusion detection, multi-
dimensional analysis of data-intensive, fast-changing events, and other areas
with broad impact. The research results will be published timely in conferences
and journals (and be made available at
http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~hanj/projs/streamine.htm) for wide dissemination,
industry adoption, and education of new generation of information technology
students and workers.
