The design and analysis of two-dimensional VLSI processor arrays to solve
problems in computational geometry are being carried out. Computational geometry
is concerned with finding efficient algorithmic solutions for computing
geometric properties, such as the convex hull of a set of multidimensional
points and various distance or intersection properties of a set of geometric
objects. The goal of this research is to optimally map algorithms in
computational geometry into two-dimensional VLSI processor arrays. Although
efficient sequential algorithms exist, they are not suitable in real-time
problems. The current VLSI technology provides a tool for implementing fast
parallel algorithms for real-time applications. This research extends our
current knowledge on mapping algorithms into VLSI processor arrays, which are
mainly based on linear recurrences. The principal investigator is a new Ph.D.
who already has significant progress in his research. The research focuses on
important and timely topics. Support is highly recommended.
