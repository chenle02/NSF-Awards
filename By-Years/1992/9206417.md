The northern and southern polar regions exhibit striking differences in ozone
depletion and polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) formation. They are also
significantly different in terms of energetic electron precipitation in the
upper atmosphere. The suggestion has been made that PSC formation is stimulated
by electron participation by creating bremsstrahlung X rays that penetrate to
the stratosphere and ionize atmospheric constituents there which become
nucleation centers for droplet formation. If correct, this would partially
explain why ozone depletion and PSC formation occur almost exclusively in
Antarctica: energetic electron precipitation is a common phenomenon there, but
rarely occurs in the Arctic polar cap. An experiment to investigate this
suggestion is to be conducted. A balloon payload with a strong, localized
ionization source will be flown through the cold Arctic stratosphere; a
photographic record would reveal whether the ionization had caused droplet
formation to occur. A positive result from the experiment would have wide
ranging implications. It would indicate that current models of stratospheric
chemistry need to be revised and that additional experimental investigation of
the stratosphere is needed.
