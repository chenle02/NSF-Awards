This project addresses the grand societal challenge of achieving large-scale,
transformative climate change adaptations in agriculture while mitigating
further climate impacts and supporting sustainable rural livelihoods. This
project will investigate the social processes that influence farmersâ€™ choices to
adopt (or not) climate smart agriculture (CSA) practices and the effects of
those choices on land-atmosphere interactions and changing regional climate.
This approach has the potential to identify leverage points to mitigate
anticipated climate change impacts on small to medium U.S. farmers and generate
spillover benefits to local rural economies.

The goal of this project is to develop the new, convergence research approach of
socio-agroclimatology linking social processes that influence farm management
choices with land-atmosphere feedbacks. This will be accomplished through the
identification of leverage points for systemic change, integration with coupled
atmosphere-land surface and cropping system models, and Participatory Action
Research (PAR) experimental co-design with community partners. PAR experiments
will explore the effectiveness of intentionally bridging farmer networks as a
deep leverage point for scaling-up adoption of CSA practices. Potential
thresholds in CSA adoption leading to beneficial climate feedbacks will be
analyzed by advancing the understanding and modeling of land-atmosphere
interactions and crop productivity. Integration of these project elements will
support development of a CSA decision-support tool, implementation of a
convergence assessment of current and proposed policy options, and production of
actionable recommendations.
