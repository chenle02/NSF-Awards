This project will utilize magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the
magnetosphere-ionosphere system to examine the sensitivity of MHD simulations to
variability of the solar wind driver. The work will compare the variability
induced by intrinsic, internal magnetospheric dynamics with the variability
caused by both temporal and spatial variability in the solar wind. Case studies
will be done with real events to allow for comparisons of the simulations with
realistic conditions. This work will provide a mechanism for determining the
accuracy with which MHD models might in the future be able to predict space
weather conditions.
