9600699 Morton This award renews support of the International Culture Collection
of Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhyzal fungi (INVAM) at West Virginia University.
The collected organisms are soil- borne organisms that grow in beneficial
symbiosis with the roots of most higher plant species. 154 species of such fungi
have been identified; 64 are represented in the collection, along with 44 as yet
unidentified strains. Because of their intimate association with plants, such
fungi are likely to play an important role in development of sustainable
agriculture practices and, potentially, in bioremediation. The award provides
partial support for the INVAM's efforts in maintaining and distributing over
1000 strains now in the collection as well as the continued accession of new
species and geographic isolates. In 1995, over 1000 samples were distributed to
users world-wide. The INVAM receives additional support from the University and
from fees charged to users. ***
