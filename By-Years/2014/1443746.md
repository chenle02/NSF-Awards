This award provides funds from the United States Global Change Research Program
(USGCRP) to support the International START Secretariat?s regional research and
capacity building programs in Africa and Asia during the 5-year period
CY2015-CY2020. Continued USGCRP support for START?s regional GEC research
programs will serve to strengthen global change research and assessment through
which capacity building for GEC science in Africa and Asia is enhanced. This
support is essential for meeting the significant need for GEC research in the
developing world, and for leveraging resources that build lasting partnerships
for advancing regional knowledge. With continued support, START will be able to
promote research and capacity building that contributes to and advances the
interests and strategy of the USGCRP agencies and that advances the objectives
of the Belmont Forum and the Future Earth Initiative. This program directly
supports the USGCRP mandates to 1) Coordinate U.S. activities with other nations
and international organizations on global change research projects and
activities; 2) Promote international cooperation and access to scientific data
and information; and&lt;br/&gt;3) Participate in international global change
research by developing nations.
