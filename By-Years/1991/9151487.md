This project is intended to improve the laboratory experiences for students in
two related areas of modern biology: cell and tissue culture and advanced
microscopic technology. The project has an impact on laboratory exercises, class
projects and independent student research projects. The acquisition of a class
II, type A biological safety cabinet, and a humidified C02 incubator allows
students to learn the techniques of starting cultures directly from plant or
animal tissues and maintaining cell lines once established. The six-foot work
space also permits multiple student use and access for physically challenged
students. A quality photomicroscope equipped for phase contrast, fluorescence
and darkfield microscopy, with a video display screen permits observations of
cultured and other cells and real time tape recording or recording on 35 mm
film. The video display is useful for learning disabled students who have
difficulty processing visual information.
