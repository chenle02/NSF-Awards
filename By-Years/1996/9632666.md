9632680 Kahl This initiative represents a timely new cooperative initiative
between the University of Maine and the Maine Department of Environmental
Protection (DEP). It will assess the statewide extent and magnitude of surface
water contamination from organic and inorganic toxins, and provide a mechanism
for creating further cooperative research at the University, and between the
University and state agencies. To facilitate this collaboration, the University
will construct a clean room for processing samples with trace concentrations of
toxic substances, and install a high resolution Gas Chromatograph-Mass
Spectrometer for trace organic analysis. The addition of an analytical chemist
and support staff will enhance long-term research interactions among University
researchers, industry and state agencies. Thus, this project is ideally suited
to the ESPCoR goal of improving long-term research competitiveness.
