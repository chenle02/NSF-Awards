The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at the University of Pennsylvania
supports a broad range of interactive and inter- disciplinary materials research
in four primary thrust areas. The thrust on molecular and surface dynamics is a
new effort involving chemists and physicists who are employing ultrafast laser
spectroscopy to study dynamic molecular processes at surfaces and in condensed
phases. Design and synthesis of advanced polymers and ceramics brings together a
group of faculty whose principal interest is the development of new synthetic
methods and new materials. The thrust on non-periodic states of matter addresses
unconventional materials that exhibit quasi- periodicity, glass-like properties,
incommensurability or other aspects of disorder. The research on structure and
micro- mechanics of interfaces aims to develop a fundamental understanding of
the role of interfaces in determining the mechanical properties of materials,
with increasing emphasis on composite materials and thin films. In addition, a
new initiative on ultra-thin films uses advanced surface science techniques to
study the geometric, electronic and vibrational structure of atomically abrupt
interfaces in ultra-thin materials. The MRL also supports the development,
operation and maintenance of major central materials research facilities, and
provides seed funds for new faculty and high-risk research related to its
overall program. The program currently involves 43 faculty members, 12
postdoctoral research associates, 12 other technical and scientific
professionals, 45 graduate students and 7 undergraduates. The University of
Pennsylvania MRL is under the direction of Professor Gregory C. Farrington.
