Prolonged or repeated stress leads to allostatic overload that mediates various
cellular changes in the hippocampus, the area of the brain important for
learning and memory. These changes result in reduced hippocampus function and
deficits in learning and memory. Chronic stress-mediated memory deficits in
humans and animals are well documented. Less is known about the molecular
mechanisms underlying adverse effects that cause reduced hippocampus function in
response to chronic stress. It is becoming increasingly evident that dynamic
changes to the histones, the proteins that DNA is coiled around, are molecular
mechanisms important for the physiological reaction to environmental stressors.
Deciphering information encoded in histone modifications in the hippocampus in
response to chronic stress is critical for understanding the molecular
mechanisms of regulation of memory by stress. This project will identify novel
histone changes that are modulated in response to chronic stress and negatively
impact hippocampus function. Furthermore, the project is designed to investigate
the effects on memory as the functional output of these modifications. By
studying epigenetic changes and the mechanisms of these changes, these studies
will define a novel common point of convergence as a mechanism to control
transcription of genes that are regulated by stress and involved in learning and
memory. Such information will fill the gap connecting histone modifications in
the hippocampus to memory impairments caused by chronic stress. Students working
in this lab will gain valuable research experience at the undergraduate,
masters, and doctoral levels. These students participate in experiment planning,
performance and analysis, as well as manuscript preparation and presentation at
national and international meetings. Training provided by the research in this
proposal is particularly important for science education in Louisiana, which is
currently designated as an NSF EPSCOR state.
