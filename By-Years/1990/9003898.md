The goal of this fellowship will be to advance knowledge of the ecological role
of Neotropical Chrysomelidae through field studies concentrating on identifying
hostplants and on larval studies. This research will be performed in Guanacaste
National Park, Costa Rica, because it has a rich and easily accessible fauna and
because Costa Rica is an international center for the study of tropical
biodiversity. The research will be done in cooperation with local scientists at
the Costa rican National Institute of Biodiversity and made available through
the Institute to the international scientific community and to Costa Rican
institutions. The Chrysomelidae are the second largest family of beetles and are
particularly diverse in the American tropics. Almost all are plant feeders and
many are crop pests. Their role in wild tropical ecosystems is largely unstudied
and hostplant and life history information is available for only a small
minority of Neotropical species. By concentrating field work at Guanacaste
National Park, the PI will be able to take advantage of a large body of
accumulated botanical and ecological knowledge of the Park; at the same time,the
diversity of habitats in the park will make findings from this project relevant
to many other areas of Central America.
