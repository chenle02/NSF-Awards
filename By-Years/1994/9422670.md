SBR-9422670 William Brock In real-world economic markets, traders base their
actions on their predictions about the future. The choice of predictor,
furthermore, is purposeful. That is, it is based on how ell the predictor has
performed in the past. Predictors that do well relative to other predictors are
gradually adopted. But their increased popularity reduces their predictive
power. It follows that the distribution of predictors is determined by a complex
dynamical system that can be expected to behave chaotically. In the first part
of this multi-project study, the P.I. studies this dynamical system both
analytically and through numerical simulation. The second project examines the
equilibrium production of information in speculative markets. Information here
means the ability to detect noisy signals and equilibrium means a rational
expectations equilibrium. Superior information translates into higher profits
but this information is costly to acquire. The P.I. applies the methods of the
first project on adaptive dynamics to the study of the evolution of this market
to an equilibrium. The resulting model predicts many stylized facts about actual
speculative markets, such as those for stocks.
