This award will facilitate cooperation between Dr. Frederick H. Mies, Molecular
Physics Division, Center for Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics, National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and Professor Hiroki Nakamura,
Department of Theoretical Studies, Institute for Molecular Science (IMS),
Okazaki, and members of their research groups. Collaboration between these two
research groups provides a unique opportunity to exploit two complementary
skills in molecular scattering theory. The NIST group generally employs the
fully quantal close-coupled approach to calculate inelastic and
photodissociation cross-sections. The IMS group has devoted its research to the
complementary semiclassical description of such processes. The objective of this
collaborative project is to borrow the best features of each method to obtain a
more complete description of molecular dynamics and spectroscopy. The two groups
have already begun an extensive collaboration at this common interface of the
two methods with extremely encouraging preliminary results. During this project,
the scientists will visit each other's two laboratories to transfer computer
codes, compare results, and analyze the data. This collaborative project has two
major goals. First, the scientists will explore the limits of the quantal and
semiclassical methods with numerically tractable examples. Second, they will use
this experience to develop hybrid techniques and new approximations that enjoy
the benefits of both methods. The goal is to use semiclassical theory to provide
the necessary MQDT (multichannel quantum defect theory) parameters to treat the
dynamics and photodissociation of triatomic systems. The focus will be the
photodissociation of strongly bound triatomics, using atmospheric molecules as
candidates for study.
