Navigation methods using multi-sensor systems are considered for terrains whose
geometric models are known only in certain parts. Exact navigation algorithms,
as well as those that obtain approximate paths with lesser computation time
while compromising the optimality are studied. Navigational methods for
terrains, where polygonal approximations are inefficient, are explored based on
fractal interpolation and approximate path planning. The navigation process
involves the problem of extracting information about the geometry of the terrain
by suitably combining the sensor outputs. Techniques for (a) extracting
integrated information, and (b) fusing the new information into the existing
terrain model, are investigated. Two new paradigms for sensing: (a) active
sensing where sensor operations are repeated using sequential statistical
methods, and (b) learning fusion rules from examples where the system is trained
with examples using the methods of empirical and structural risk minimization,
are proposed. These two methods, together with the existing Bayesian-based
methods, provide the design paradigms for the multi-sensor system. For
computational purposes, a general distributed sensor system specified by a set
of first order propositional sentences is proposed. This system encompasses, as
special cases, the distributed versions of Bayesian inference, and geometric
reasoning with logic and algebra. In the case of sensors whose outputs are real-
valued vectors, the entire process of sensor integration is shown to be
implementable in hardware using combinational circuits and comparators. This
implementation is particularly suitable for real-time applications. Also
implementations on several other computational systems are studied.
