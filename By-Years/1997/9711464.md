9711464 Carey Funds are provided for the support of core and rock sample
repository at University of Rhode Island that is maintained for the benefit of
marine geological community at large. The prime criteria for continued funding
of these facilities remain the extent and types of studies supported by the core
and rock samples and steps taken by the institutions to maintain and archive the
materials in pristine condition for future use. Funds will support the URI
facility for three years and allow it to provide continued service to the marine
geoscience community.
