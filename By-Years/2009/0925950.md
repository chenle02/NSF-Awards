&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This project is aimed at experimental and
theoretical investigations of linear and nonlinear optical phenomena in the
presence of multiple scattering and photon localization in random media. The
amplification of weak optical signals, such as linear and nonlinear Raman
scattering, due to greatly elongated wave trajectories in strongly scattering
optical samples will be explored. Disordered nanostructures in GaP and InP
exhibiting controlled microscopic/ mesoscopic disorder and light scattering
efficiency will be employed to study their linear and nonlinear optical
response. The precise material and structural characteristics in these samples
will be optimized to achieve the enhancement of Raman signal that is comparable
to the state-of-the-art techniques and is enough to detect environmentally
significant concentrations of hazardous chemicals in water solution. The
ultimate design of Raman sensor developed in this proposal will be implemented
as a prototype that will be tested at the sewage facilities for continuous
monitoring of the water quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This
research brings together collaborators from optical and material sciences to
create a unique climate for the active student participation in research and
science/engineering education and for the preparation of the future scientists,
engineers and educators. Students from the largest and diverse urban centers in
Texas and Wisconsin, including those of underrepresented groups, will be able to
gain interdisciplinary experience and training in optics, materials, biological
and chemical sciences. The significant improvement of chemical sensor
architecture, aimed as a part of the proposed research, will have an immediate
impact on society and economy through established partnerships with local
industrial companies and communities.
