There is no substitute for exposure to real observations of astronomical
phenomena. Most students, however, are either unfamiliar with the night sky or
familiar only with a night sky that is severely compromised by city lights.
Planetarium software, while useful, provides an artificial and synthetic
experience. A global network of fisheye night-sky web cameras, the CONCAMs, has
developed recently, and it takes real and continuous images of the entire night
sky. These images, freely available over the web, can be used to demonstrate
clearly and forcefully many basic scientific concepts in introductory astronomy.
This project is developing the CONCAM Undergraduate Education Project that
leverages CONCAM images to teach a variety of astronomical concepts to
undergraduates. As part of this initiative the project is developing modules
that supplement standard introductory textbooks with real all-sky images from
http://concam.net . This is a Proof of Concept project during which two
prototype modules are being developed and evaluated
