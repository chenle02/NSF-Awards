The University of California @ Los Angeles (UCLA) will initiate a four-week,
residential Young Scholars project in the Life Sciences which will offer science
enrichment activities for 25 physically disabled precollege students entering
grades 9,10. This summer program will emphasize research participation in
biology, microbiology, physiology and marine science. Participants will research
and debate ethical issues. Nonacademic scientists, executives and career
planners will help inform the students about colleges and careers and will aid
them in setting challenging and realistic goals. More than half of all senior
academic and professional staff will be individuals with disabilities.
