The study will document the response to Hurricane Andrew warning process;
ascertain residents' beliefs about the safety of their residences, the need for
code improvement and better code enforcement, and regulation or prohibition of
mobile homes; evaluate the impact of concerns about safety upon people's
evacuation behavior in future hurricanes; and assess the changes in concerns and
beliefs with the passage of time. The research will include observed changes in
the process of reconstruction. These results will be beneficial to researchers
and officials involved in the recovery efforts.
