The inclusion of more polymer chemistry in the standard physical chemistry
laboratory course is among the added capabilities provided by the recent
acquisition of a differential scanning calorimeter and gel permeation liquid
chromatography equipment at St. Olaf College. Gel permeation is being used to
determine the molecular weight distribution of polymers while phase changes in
polymers are being studied via differential scanning calorimetry. These
experiments are complemented by a study of copolymer composition using NMR and
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy.
