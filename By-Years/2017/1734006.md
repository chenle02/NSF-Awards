The next quantum revolution will involve understanding and controlling the
properties and dynamics of increasingly large-sized quantum systems. A better
understanding of universal rules governing many-body quantum systems and deep
understandings of more and more complex molecules will impact areas of science
beyond quantum physics, including condensed matter and material physics,
chemical and biophysics, high-energy physics, astrophysics, and nuclear physics.
The Physics Frontiers Center (PFC) award to the JILA PFC will continue work
begun during past PFC awards to harness interacting and interconnected atoms,
molecules and photons to address frontier challenges presented by the complexity
of quantum matter, and to probe elusive secrets of nature. The center program
will also train a large number of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars
with cutting-edge expertise in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical related physics,
and it will develop tools and techniques to enhance the Nation's technological
infrastructure. The JILA PFC will contribute to connecting scientific
communities, by hosting workshops and schools and through the JILA visitor
program. Continuing efforts to expand the undergraduate research program and a
predominantly minority-serving after-school program will allow the JILA PFC to
contribute to attracting the next generation of all students into
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The JILA PFC will capitalize on the development of
extreme light sources and spectrographic techniques that have allowed the JILA
PFC investigators to precisely engineer quantum states, probe complex
interactions of atomic nuclei and electrons, and control matter in dynamic
states far from equilibrium. The JILA PFC research is organized around four
areas of research. The first two focus on aspects of many-body physics,
including the construction of quantum matter from basic constituents and the
development of quantum resources for precision measurements of physical systems
including strongly interacting quantum many-body systems. The third area focuses
on observations of coupled dynamics in different forms of matter, mainly solids
and molecules, as well as the formation and transformation of constituents on
unprecedented time scales, ranging from hundredths of a femtosecond to
microseconds. The fourth area looks for opportunities to exchange ideas and
technologies that could lead to projects outside of the central focus of the
JILA PFC, but which would benefit either the core work of the PFC or other areas
of science.
