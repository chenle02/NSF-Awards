This research is aimed at improving the Geotechnical Engineer's capability of
characterizing in situ soil properties. The potential of artificial neural
networks in site characterization is explored using several types of in situ
test data from selected National Geotechnical Experimentation Sites (NGES). A
new methodology is developed that utilizes both the `unstructured` knowledge
generalized with neural networks and the `structured` knowledge is available in
the form of local experience, engineering judgment, and expert rules. Comparison
is made between the results obtained from the neural network approach and the
probabilistic approach. Several issues are further explored using developed
neural networks: 1) correlations among design soil parameters, 2) cross-checking
design soil parameters obtained from different in situ tests, 3) averaging the
profiles of soil parameters from different in situ tests, 4) possible reduction
of the number of `hard` data needed, and 5) probabilistic neural network
learning. The research findings are then synthesized into a design methodology
for site characterization. Guidelines and procedure for applying this design
methodology are established and documented. /¥Á ÂÁÁ┤╣>À ╝/¥Á¢ Â╝?_ └╣┤Á?
