Via a Japanese, American, and European collaboration, this study will analyze
major, trace and volatile elements (H2O, CO2, S, Cl, F) and B and H isotopic
composition in melt inclusions and lavas from the Izu arc using petrographic,
electron microprobe, ion microprobe and laser-ablation ICP-MS techniques. Melt
inclusions will provide primary constraints on the major, trace and volatile
element contents and boron and hydrogen isotope compositions of primitive Izu
arc melts, and this data will test and constrain geochemical, petrological,
geophysical and thermal models for subduction in this region, one of the MARGINS
program selected study areas, and elsewhere.
