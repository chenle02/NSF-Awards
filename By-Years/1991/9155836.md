Design is being incorporated into the engineering curriculum as a focusing and
attracting mechanism from the very first engineering courses up to the
traditional capstone courses. This pilot project begins with the introduction of
design concepts in the required freshman algorithms and computer programming
course. This new design paradigm is comprised of three phases or stages: (1) By
Design: Captivating Engineers- -the student will solve broad-area or concept
problems using computers to simulate the results of his/her actions; (2) By
Design: Creative Engineers--at this stage the student integrates what he/she has
learned and is encouraged to work in groups; (3) By Design: Analytical Engineers
--at this stage the student investigates the design considerations in fine
detail, integrating the tools gathered throughout his/her undergraduate studies,
and learns how the tools formerly employed are fashioned. A thorough outcomes
assessment plan is designed to track student's performance.
