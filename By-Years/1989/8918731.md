One of the key objectives of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) is
to determine the global ocean circulation by collecting adequate measurement of
the density and velocity fields. In addition, the atmospheric-oceanic
interactions must be better determined. This proposal will provide three
important activities in support of these objectives. First, a development of a
robust pressure measurement capability for use on surface drifters will be done.
Second, a large set of drifters will be deployed and tracked via satellites.
Third, a center will be established to insure the deployment and data streams
are well coordinated with other elements of WOCE.
