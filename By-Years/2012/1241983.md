TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2013
Macromolecular Materials Gordon Research Conference (GRC) (formerly Polymers
West) is being supported in part through this award to help enhance
participation of young faculty members, postdoctoral researchers and senior
graduate students in the meeting. This GRC will be focused on state-of-the-art
research in materials science, polymer chemistry, nanocomposites, and
biomaterials science and technology. In keeping with the past tradition of this
GRC the programmatic themes of this conference cover a range of important and
timely topics spanning the range nanostructured polymers, to polymer physics and
engineering, to targeted polymer materials for delivery and repair, and the
mechanics and assembly of polymer structures. These themes, combined with the
diverse array of speakers and attendees, promise a GRC of strong technical merit
and broader impact. The invited speakers are internationally known, world-class
experts in their respective areas of polymer synthesis, polymer physics, polymer
engineering, nanocomposites, and polymer biomaterials. In addition to the
invited talks, poster sessions will offer an exceptional opportunity for
scientific discussion in an informal setting, where early career researchers
interact with established experts from academia, industry, and government
laboratories. The GRC will be preceded by the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS),
which will provide a special opportunity for postdoctoral researchers and
graduate students to present their latest results and benefit from the feedback
and interactions with the other participants of the GRS and GRC.
