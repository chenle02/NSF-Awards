This project will model several aspects of magmatic and hydrothermal activities
at the mid-oceanic ridges by application of percolation theory. An important
question the P.I.s will address is the longevity of hydrothermal vents. They
will also their model for phreatic eruptions on land to megaplume formation at
the ridges.
