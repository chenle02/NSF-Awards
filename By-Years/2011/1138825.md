The purpose of this project is to investigate the use of social media during a
crisis and during post-catastrophe relief and recovery efforts, in circumstances
in which much traditional communication infrastructure has been disrupted.
Specifically, the goals of the project are (a) to better understand how
internet-based interactive communication tools can increase preparedness for
disaster and (b) to understand how public perceptions of social media as a focal
point for volunteerism may be changed by their use in a crisis context. Ikegami
will visit Japan to study the effects of the disaster on-site, collaborate with
Japanese researchers, meet with key persons in government agencies and NGOs, and
analyze reports in the Japanese language. She will study how agencies as well as
NGOs used rapidly shifting social media to handle this unprecedented disaster.

Intellectual Merit: The project will integrate theoretical research on social
capital with research on virtual networks created by new media. The findings
will inform the areas of crisis management, volunteerism, social networks, and
other areas of human-centered computing.

Broader Impacts. The project will lead to new knowledge about the role of social
media in crisis response as well as inform policy makers and nonprofit
organizations about how to best use social media to engage civic involvement in
disaster relief efforts.
