Abstract Bellissard

Following a program initiated in 1979, the PI's project concerns some
mathematical problems in the theory of aperiodic solids. The main tools used are
coming from the Noncommutative Geometry, the theory of Random Matrices, the
theory of Schrodinger operators, and the K-theory of C*-algebras. The project is
divided into the following sections: (i) Phonons in Aperiodic Solids, (ii)
Spectral Properties and Random Matrix Theory, (iii) Transverse Geometry of the
Noncommutative Brillouin zone, (iv) Schrodinger's Operators on Tilings, (v)
N-body Problem and Noncommutative Fermi Surface, and (vi) K-theory: toward a
physical interpretation.

This program develops a self contained general theory liable to describe all
possible solids from their microscopic structure. This framework is a
unification of various point of views developed by physicists specializing in
different types of materials. On the other hand, it brings into the theory the
most advanced mathematical theories, such as Noncommutative Geometry, K-theory,
Dynamical Systems, Noncommutative Probability, Random Matrices. It is a truly
interdisciplinary program between Physics and Mathematics. Such an
interdisciplinary program helps bring problems and ideas from one community to
the other. K-theory is a tool that is appealing already in the field of string
theory. This project shows that K theory applies also in other area of physics,
where experiments are available. Conversely, the recent solution of the so-
called "gap labelling conjecture" is an example of the impact of such research
in mathematics.
