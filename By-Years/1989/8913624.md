In the past three years they have made significant progress in the study of
conductence fluctuations in small devices (mesoscopic physics) and in
understanding the metal-insulator transition in terms of the scaling of Fermi
liquid parameters. They will extend the studies of mesoscopic physics to the
quantum Hall regime. They will study finite size corrections to the Quantum Hall
Effect and perform finite size scaling studies of the behavior of the extended
state. For fractional Hall steps, their analysis of the data suggests the
existence of a novel fractionally charged Fermi liquid state which they hope to
describe microscopically, For the metal-insulator transition problem, they
propose to study the critical behavior of the Hall constant to see if it can be
fitted into the Fermi liquid framework. They will also study the cross-over from
hopping to conducting behavior in layered materials, a problem of considerable
interest in the oxide superconductivity community.
