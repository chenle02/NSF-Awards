This award supports an ongoing U.S.-Japan collaborative research project
between John Beavan and Chris Scholz of Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory,
Columbia University, and Teruyuki Kato, Earthquake Research Institute,
University of Tokyo. This project is part of a five-year collaboration to
resolve several major problems related to the active tectonics of the Philippine
Sea Plate and its boundaries through collection and analysis of Global
Positioning System (GPS) measurements at sites strategically placed along the
eastern, western, and northern boundaries of the Philippine Sea Plate in
southeast Japan, the Ryukyus, Taiwan, and in the Bonins, Marianas, and
Micronesia. During the two-year period of the grant, the following specific
topics will be addressed: (1) determination of accurate Philippine - Eurasian
Plate and Philippine Sea-Pacific poles and rotation rates; (2) the magnitude of
plate driving forces at trench boundaries; (3) the mechanism of back-arc
spreading; (4) the mechanism of strike-slip in the forearc; (5) the mechanics of
arc-continent collision; and (6) the distribution of deformation and seismic
hazard in southeast Japan and Taiwan. In addition to the principal
investigators, others involved in the project are Dan Davis, SUNY Stony Brook;
Steven Roecker, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; Kazuro Hirahara and T. Tanaka,
Kyoto University; and I Murata, T. Kato, and S. Nakao, University of Tokyo. This
grant complements a grant from the NSF Earth Sciences Program, which is funding
the research in the United States.
