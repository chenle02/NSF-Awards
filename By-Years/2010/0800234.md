This project involves a series of experiments with interacting cold atoms in
far-off-resonance optical lattices. Arrays of coupled and independent one-
dimensional gases of bosons will be prepared and studied to help resolve some
outstanding mysteries of quantum statistical mechanics and quantum phase
transitions. Prior experiments by this group have explored the physics of Bose-
gases in one dimension, demonstrating that these gases never thermalize. New
experiments will relax the one-dimensional confinement of atoms in several ways
and explore the crossover between one-dimensional and three-dimensional
behavior. These experiments will address a long open theoretical question of the
existence of a threshold for chaos in a many-body quantum system, as there is in
classical mechanics. This project may clarify how irreversibility of macroscopic
behavior arises from the reversible behavior of individual atoms. Additionally
the research will involve studies of arrays of coupled one-dimensional gases, an
analog of Josephson junction arrays. Various phase transitions and dimensional
crossovers will be studied with a high degree of control, allowing them to serve
as models for a wide range of phenomena observed in more complicated systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of these experiments lie in the
ability of cold-atom experiments to provide answers to long-open questions in
nonlinear dynamics and mathematical physics. The research project will also
improve the technology for creation and manipulation of Bose-Einstein
Condensates with all-optical techniques. They will train undergraduate,
graduate, and postdoctoral researchers in technologically important areas of
physics.
