In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Physical Chemistry Program
of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Ondrechen will test models for bridged-valence
dimers of ruthenium and back-bonded complexes of transition metal systems. The
near-coincidence of infrared and Raman frequencies in the Creutz-Taube ion is
treated with inclusion of electron-electron repulsion and hybrid terms. The
model will be extended to polymeric one-dimensional chains and two-dimensional
nets, and tested to see if the hybrid terms give rise to a novel purely
electronic mechanism for superconductivity. A model for systems with dimeric
bridges will be used to study complexes with both pi-bonding and back-bonding
interactions between the metal ion and a conjugated bridging ligand.
