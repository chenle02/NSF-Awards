Much remains unknown about the origin and evolution of the elements that
comprise the universe beyond those created in the Big Bang. Making significant
advances in these areas requires investigations at the intersection of nuclear
physics and astrophysics. Through this Physics Frontiers Centers (PFC) award the
Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics - Center for the Evolution of the
Elements (JINA-CEE) will focus on answering closely connected open questions
related to the origin of the elements and the properties of dense matter probed
by neutron stars. JINA-CEE will build on the expertise and technical
developments from its past two PFC awards and use innovative laboratory
experiments, combined with theoretical and computational approaches, to address
the broad range of nuclear physics and astrophysics challenges underlying these
science goals. The resulting insights will be integrated into comprehensive
physics models of element creation and neutron stars that are then compared to
existing and new observational data. JINA-CEE will continue to have educational
and research impacts within the nuclear astrophysics community through its
interdisciplinary workshop, school, and visitor programs. In addition it will
create new multi-institutional graduate course modules and undergraduate course
components while reaching out to K-12 students, teachers, and the general
public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The transition from a three element (hydrogen,
helium, and lithium) universe, with a small number of isotopes, to a chemically
diverse cosmos containing eighty-two long-lived elements with hundreds of
isotopes, is significant and not well understood. Neutron star matter plays an
important role for the origin of the elements, as it shapes the synthesis of
many of the heavy elements in nature produced in core-collapse supernovae and in
neutron star mergers. JINA-CEE will explore two closely interrelated questions
through experimental, theoretical, and computational approaches: "How were the
elements beyond hydrogen and helium created during the first billion years after
the Big Bang?" and "What are the properties of neutron-rich nuclear matter and
how can it be probed by observations of neutron stars?"
