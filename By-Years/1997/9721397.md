*** 97321397 Turley Brigham Young University will establish a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Physics. Special efforts will be made
to recruit students from underrepresented groups in physics and those from two
year and four year colleges in our geographical region. The participating
students will participate in a ten week summer physics research program in
computational plasma physics, optics, microfabrication technology, solar power,
sonoluminescence, or advanced physical methods applied to archeology. The
students will receive instruction in experimental and computational techniques,
participate in an ongoing research project, and present oral and written reports
of their research activities. ***
