Professor Phillip C. Wankat of Purdue has been a leading investigator in the use
of absorption as an industrial purification method. His latest research proposal
covers a series of experiments to determine better methods to scale up this
important process. The theory he has developed indicates that the ratio of
column length to the square of the absorbent diameter, and cycle period to
column length should be kept constant as mass through-puts are increased. This
method should be an improvement with strong economic implications for commercial
practice. The applications would include absorption, ion-exchange, and
chromatography. I recommend that Purdue Research Foundation be given a 3-year
continuing grant to support Professor Wankat's research. The amounts recommended
are $56,517 for FY86, $55,197 for FY87, and $55,117 for FY88.
