This very ambitious proposal received three VG reviews and one G. It is truly
an interdisciplinary effort involving people involved in structural mechanics,
computer science, and optimization, and cuts across four departments at the
University of Colorado, Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering,
Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science. The overall goal is to implement
methods appropriate for parallel processing which are necessary to solve large
structural mechanics problems, e.g., a projected space station. Even the lowest
reviewer stated that "this is an interesting proposal". This is indeed an
"interesting" proposal and deserves support, but not at the inflated amount
originally requested. The realities of program funding make it necessary to fund
this for only two years, and consideration of the current support of the faculty
involved makes it necessary to eliminate them from the funding. As recommended
by one of the reviewers, this means that the scope of the research will have to
be cut back considerably, but it is still "an already complicated problem". One
of the major aspects of this support is the inclusion of four graduate students
in the work. This is an excellent opportunity for these students to be exposed
to a significant amount of cross disciplinary effort during their education. The
new budget was negotiated directly with the PI's, and approved by the
university. I recommend funding as a standard grant for two years since the
CSE/NT program is already heavily committed into the future, and further program
funding prospects are uncertain. The two year funding levels will be: Year 1 - $
138,548 Year 2 - 154,420 --------- $ 292,968
