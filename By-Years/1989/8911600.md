Professor Konkowski will study the behavior of particles and fields in
spacetimes which contain mild singularities. Theorems in general relativity
predict singularities in large classes of spacetimes but the nature of these
singularities is mostly unknown. If mathematical tests prove that a singularity
is present in a spacetime, then it can be classified as one of three types
depending on its strength: Quasiregular, nonscalar curvature and scalar
curvature. The first two types are mild. Konkowski plans to study physical
processes in spacetimes with mild singularities since they have unusual effects
on particles and fields.
