The second order differential equations of motion governing the vibrations of a
linear, viscously damped, discrete system are generally mutually coupled. The
damping is said to be classical if and only if the equations of motion can be
uncoupled by an undamped modal expansion. This proposal examines the problem,
for the case when the viscous damping is nonclassical, of how best to uncouple
and solve the governing equations of motion by approximation, with a real-valued
coordinate transformation. It is proposed that the matrix equation of motion,
with its mass matrix transformed to a unit matrix, be transformed by an
orthogonal coordinate transformation to a new generalized coordinate system in
which the bound on the norm of the error introduced in the response by
discarding all the coupling terms is a minimum. A trial evaluation of this
method is computationally effective for solving certain types of nonclassically
damped systems. The proposal describes the general approach and delineates the
research plans for a comprehensive study of the proposed method. The proposed
method has application to large, multi-degree-of-freedom vibration problems in
aerospace, civil and mechanical engineering.*** //
