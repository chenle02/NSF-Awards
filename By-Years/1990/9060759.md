The objective of this project is to investigate methods for forecasting "lumpy"
demand for products and services. Lumpy demand is usually zero but
intermittently non-zero. Standard forecasting systems cannot cope with lumpy
demand, which is a common problem in production and inventory control. The
firm's interest in the problem is a response to their customers in
manufacturing. Existing approaches to lumpy demand forecasting either convert
lumpy data into conventional data for conventional treatment or make parametric
models of the lumpy demand (e.g., a Poisson Model). There has not been a
systematic comparison of these alternatives. The researchers will empirically
assess the appropriateness and accuracy of these alternatives. They will also
investigate two innovative approaches. One is to explore whether associations
across series occur in real data and how they might be exploited. The other is
to analyze the method used most often in practice: "sales-force composite"
forecasting, which totals the estimates of demand made by the sales force for
each potential customer. Combination of sales force estimates with time-series
techniques may have special merit when statistical data are sparse, as with
lumpy demand. This research will lead to the development of computer software
for PC-based forecasting of "lumpy" demand in manufacturing.
