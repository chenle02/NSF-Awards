The Department of Chemistry is integrating the applications of computer
interfacing and computer modeling throughout the curriculum. Data acquisition
systems are being used in the accelerated general chemistry and junior level
physical chemistry laboratories. Molecular modeling applications start in the
first-year course and extend through the whole curriculum.
