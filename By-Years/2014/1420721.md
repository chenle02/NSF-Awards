U.S. social movements in the latter half of the 20th century have increasingly
used litigation as they worked to broaden legal rights. Yet we know little about
how they pursue cases in the courts, particularly when and how they litigate
strategically and whether and which litigation strategies are successful. This
study will examine litigation in the federal courts by the U.S. women's movement
from 1970 until the present, asking a) whether and how they develop and deploy
litigation strategies and b) whether strategic litigation is successful in
winning court cases and influencing broader social policy.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will draw on qualitative case studies of key
legal advocacy organizations and a quantitative data set of federal court cases.
The work will further our understanding of how social groups gain greater legal
equality in the judicial arena. The project will give greater agency to actors
by moving "inside" movement advocacy organizations, through interviews with
litigators and organizational archival data, to assess the development and
deployment of litigation strategy and whether such litigation succeeds in
winning legal cases and influencing broader policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will bring wider understanding of social science research and advocacy
lawyering and litigation to broader audiences in two ways. First, through
Vanderbilt University's Center for Science Outreach, the project will recruit
four high-school students for summer internships, mentoring them in social
science inquiry and study of advocacy litigation. Second, the PI will share
research findings with two broader audiences, a) high school, college, and law
students in Nashville and at Vanderbilt University, and b) national and local
legal professional groups and litigation advocacy groups.
