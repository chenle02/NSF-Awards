This research team will use the New Solar Telescope (NST) of the Big Bear Solar
Observatory (BBSO) to investigate the origins of solar chromospheric features,
such as spicules, "rapid blue shifted events," and so-called "anemone jets," as
well as the tiny intergranular jets recently discovered by BBSO staff using the
NST. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, this team will constrain the driving
mechanisms of chromospheric upflows by analyzing high resolution NST and
spacecraft observations of coronal holes and "quiet Sun" areas. They will study
chromospheric jet properties (such as velocities, association with the solar
magnetic field, and time evolution), as well as chromospheric response to solar
photospheric dynamics. The research team will also organize several joint
observational and data analysis campaigns involving NST and selected spacecraft
for capturing the details of solar surface phenomena with unprecedented clarity,
revealing the dynamics of small scale magnetic fields in the Sun's photosphere
and chromosphere. This team expects their analysis to provide new insight into
coronal heating and related processes in the lower solar atmosphere, as well as
to advance our understanding of solar wind
acceleration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team members will provide their new NST
data to the wider solar community and perform specific solar observations upon
request from outside researchers. They note that recent high quality NST imagery
has already generated significant interest among the general public (for
example, making the list of National Geographic's "Best Space Pictures of 2010")
and they anticipate that this form of outreach will continue. This research
activity will also support the further education and professional growth of a
graduate student.
