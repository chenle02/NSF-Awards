The Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at Texas A&M University is
sponsoring a NSF-Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site for undergraduate
research in biochemistry during the summers of 2002 - 2004. The major goals of
this program are to prepare students to pursue graduate training and careers in
research and to instill in those students an appreciation of the effort and
satisfaction involved in this pursuit. Students will be trained in a diverse
array of modern biochemical methods in a vibrant department, and will develop
effective oral and written communication skills to describe scientific projects.
Up to fifteen students will be selected to participate in a 10-week summer
program that will coincide with the summer session at the university (typically
from the end of May until early August). Although not strictly limited to this
geographical area, we will focus our recruiting efforts on students who have
completed their junior or sophomore year at colleges and universities in Texas
and mid-Southern states, particularly those from institutions that do not offer
doctoral degrees. Applications from students in underrepresented minority groups
are particularly encouraged. Undergraduate participants will perform cutting-
edge research in biochemistry while integrated into pre-existing laboratory
groups of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, undergraduate students and
technicians. At the conclusion of the program the students will present their
research accomplishments in both written and oral reports.
