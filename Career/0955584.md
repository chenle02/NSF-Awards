The investigator will study combinatorial models that arise in connection with
certain structures on two-dimensional lattices, such as domino tilings, Young
tableaux and alternating-sign matrices. One focus of the research will be
enumeration questions, where the goal is to derive exact formulas for the number
of combinatorial objects satisfying certain properties. Another emphasis will be
on a probabilistic analysis of random combinatorial objects, and in particular
their limit shapes, which are geometric shapes that arise in the asymptotic
limit when the size of the model becomes large. More generally, the study of
combinatorial models in a probabilistic setting raises many fascinating
questions, for example questions about limiting fluctuations and about
connections to random matrix theory. The technical toolbox of techniques that
the investigator hopes to employ to attack such problems is very varied and
involves both algebraic methods (e.g. generating functions, linear algebra),
analytic methods (for example the calculus of variations) and general
probabilistic techniques.

The scientific and educational value of the project is manifold. The
combinatorial objects of interest have delighted pure mathematicians for many
years for their inherent beauty and elegant structure. But also, amazingly, such
seemingly "useless" mathematics has turned out to have deep connections to
branches of physics and to some very applied mathematical disciplines like
probability theory and random matrix theory. Thus, for example, alternating-sign
matrices are related to "square ice", a simplified model for an ice crystal
studied by statistical physicists, while at the same time appearing in the study
of an algorithm for computing matrix determinants, which are a ubiquituous
concept used in practically all the sciences and engineering disciplines. And
Young tableaux, which originated with the mathematical study of symmetry, have
been found to be related to random matrix theory, an important mathematical
theory which has its origins in attempts by nuclear physicists to model the
complex interactions in the nuclei of heavy elements. The combination of
theoretical elegance and applied utility makes these research topics highly
attractive from a scientific standpoint, and also very suitable as the focus for
educational activities planned by the investigator, which would have as their
goals to attract promising students to mathematics and the sciences and to
promote public appreciation of the value of scientific research.
