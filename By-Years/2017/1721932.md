This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an
environmentally benign yet highly effective marine antifouling coating for the
American yacht market. The coating is a non-biocidal, foul release surface which
does not require the vessel to move to obtain antifouling protection. It is a
non-ablative multi-modal coating that will deter settling marine larvae when the
vessel is stationary and will eliminate any attached marine organisms, such as
barnacles through self-cleaning (e.g. fouling release) while underway. The
commercial impact of the innovation will be in reducing consumption of non-
renewable resources through increased fuel efficiency and possible expansion
into additional markets. Such additional markets would include those for
commercial vessels, Navy vessels, bridges, windmills, etc., while successfully
reducing harmful chemicals in the marine environment. The market for these
coatings is expected to double in the next four years, currently being at $10.2
billion. The findings from this development work will also be incorporated into
research based educational programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit of this project is the development of a promising synthetic conopeptide
analog to the noradrenaline (NA) molecule. Prior art has shown that NA, when
bound to a surface (or included as part of a coating covering a surface), deters
fouling marine invertebrates from settling, thus preventing biofouling. Another
distinct advantage of using conopeptide based systems is their stability in the
marine environment. The current efforts are focused upon improving the efficacy
and antifouling performance of these molecules. The phase I research objectives
are (1) conjugation of the bioactive conopeptide additive to the current foul
release coating; (2) demonstration of antifouling efficacy and proof of concept
by bioassay; (3) development of batch coatings for scale-up for marine field
tests. The results will be useful for designing new test coatings for scale up
and testing in the marine environment.
