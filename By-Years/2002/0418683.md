Micro-holes, holes of 200-300 um diameter, have applications in MEMS, pneumatic
sensors and manipulators, fluidic filters, fuel injection nozzles, bio-medical
filters, ink jet printer nozzles, optical apertures, high pressure orifices,
standard defects for testing materials, micropipettes, guides for wire-bonders
and spinning nozzles. Various micromachining methods such as microdrilling and
micro-EDM can produce these holes with a high degree of accuracy. However, their
production rates are often insufficient for production line use. The objective
of this SGER research is to create microholes by means of a high-pressure liquid
pulse instead of solid punches. The research strategy is to suppress the natural
ductility of the sheet material by hydrodynamic pressure and create shear
localization at the die corners to initiate a straight and burr free hole. It is
proposed to start with copper sheets followed by aluminum and stainless. There
are many scientific and technological challenges in this approach including the
design and assembly of tooling with precision in the mesoscale, sealing of the
tooling for dynamic high pressure pulse, dynamic behavior of the sheet material
at a scale where the grain size and micro-hetrogeniety effects cannot be
ignored, and micro-tribological issues such as friction at the sheet /blank
holder interface. Knowledge and understanding generated in this research will
benefit micro and meso manufacturing research and teaching in general, and
microforming in particular.
