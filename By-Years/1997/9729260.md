Spanier DMS 9729260 Monte Carlo & Quasi-Monte Carlo methods are very active and
pervasively influential areas of applied mathematics in which highly
sophisticated uses of mathematical modeling, simulation and probability theory
are used to solve a wide variety of real-world problems not amenable to other
solution methods. Conventional Monte Carlo methods provide tools for studying
such problems on a computer, making use of probability theory and statistical
error estimation. Quasi-Monte Carlo methods are essentially deterministic
versions of Monte Carlo methods, based not on randomly chosen samples but
carefully chosen deterministic nodal sets. Their analysis utilizes number
theory, combinatorics, abstract algebra and even algebraic geometry. And in the
past several years, exciting new hybrid methods, combining the best features of
both stochastic and deterministic models, have been developed for application to
many of the most difficult of today's problems. The Third International
Conference on Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods in Scientific Computing,
to be held in Claremont, California June 22-26, 1998, will assess recent
progress in Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo theory and address the application
of these methods to a range of problems challenging scientists, engineers and
economists today, problems arising in nuclear physics and engineering,
semiconductor and computer modeling, cryptanalysis, oil exploration, and
financial engineering - to name just a few important applications.
