Bacterial infections often accompany biomedical implants and indwelling
catheters. These infections are resistant to treatment and they persist and
recur until removal of the prosthetic material. The aim of this cross-
disciplinary project is to understand the pathophysiology of implant-device
related infection, and to develop materials that are tailored to reduce
bacterial adhesion and are resistant to infections. Cell-binding protein studies
will determine the role of preadsorbed proteins, monoclonal antibodies and
receptor-deficient mutants of the infectious agent on staphylococcal adhesion
and neutrophil activation. Novel polymers with different physicochemical
properties will be synthesized in order to examine how these properties
influence staphylococcal and neutrophil adhesion. These studies should aid the
development of materials that are resistant to infection, leading to the safer
use of implant devices for many surgical applications.
