Processing of geometric information is a major concern in applications such as
computer-aided design of mechanical parts, computer-aided process planning,
computer-aided manufacturing, and programming of industrial robots. Existing
geometric models consist of rigid data structures of record-oriented databases
with static relationships that often reflect a prime concern for efficient
graphic rendering. This approach to geometric modeling restricts users to
inadequate means of expressing and manipulating geometric concepts. A new
approach is developed which will apply deductive reasoning for processing of
geometric information at an abstract level within a geometric database. This
database needs an object-oriented semantic data model tailored for geometric
reasoning. The objective of this research is to develop a prototype geometric
database with adequate reasoning capability and to study the fundamental
concepts that must be incorporated in such a database to allow automatic
inference of geometric properties. Logic programming and semantic data modeling
techniques will be used for representation and manipulation of geometric
information.
