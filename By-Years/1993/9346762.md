The Longitudinal Study of American Youth (LSAY) began to follow probability
samples of 7th and 10th graders in 1987, in order to determine student skills
and knowledge in science and mathematics. In addition, the survey has gathered
detailed information on student attitudes toward these subjects and toward
possible careers in science, mathematics, engineering, and medicine, on parental
attitudes and influences, and on aspects of schooling and the community that may
affect student mastery and attitude. The present grant provides funds for
further research on the original cohorts, taking them into college age, and
supports additional analyses for interpretation of the evidence accumulated to
date.
