Prejudice creates barriers for the learning and development of children from all
racial and ethnic groups. With the increasing diversity of youth in North
America, it is particularly timely and important to make progress toward
understanding and reducing racial prejudice. Recent social and developmental
research clarifies the multifaceted nature of prejudice and the need for an
inter-disciplinary approach to addressing prejudice. This program of research
integrates and expands advances in social psychological research on attitude
change with advances in developmental research on children's cognitive
capacities and limitations into the Social-Cognitive-Developmental Model of
mechanisms underlying racial attitude change. This integrative model will be
examined via multiple methods including observations, social-cognitive skill
training, longitudinal assessments, and meta-analyses. The project will make
theoretical and empirical contributions to social and developmental research on
mechanisms underlying racial attitude change and will produce concrete
recommendations for age-specific prejudice reduction interventions that benefit
children who live and learn in a diverse society.&lt;br/&gt;
