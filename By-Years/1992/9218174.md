PI and collaborators (Greene, Wardlaw, Schweickert) will map, describe, and
attempt to correlate Paleozoic-age, continental-margin rocks in roof pendants in
the Sierra Nevada. Issues to be addressed include: a) geographic extent of
continental margin rocks, b) original orientation of the margin, c) stratigraphy
and depositional settings of outer-continental margin ("eugeoclinal") rocks and
their relation to the "miogeoclinal" rocks in the White-Inyos, d) middle
Paleozoic structural evolution, especially as sedimentary record relates to the
Antler orogenic belt, and e) late Paleozoic and Mesozoic tectonic history of the
outer continental margin, including effects of the Sonoma orogeny and
truncation/displacement history of the margin.
