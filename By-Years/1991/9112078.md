The Offshore Technology Research Center, a National Science Foundation
Engineering Research Center is a joint venture between Texas A &amp; M
University and the University of Texas, will design, build and install a current
generating system in its new multi- directional wave basin. The objective is to
provide a more realistic, scaled, approximation of conditions found in the
offshore environment. The conclusion of currents in the wave basin will further
the study of deep ocean engineering problems by permitting the controlled and
reproducible combination of waves and currents in the laboratory. The current
generator will expand the OTRC laboratory capabilities to include the physical
model study of interactions between waves, currents and offshore structures.
Within the context of the OTRC research agenda the most affected thrust areas
are in (1) Hydrodynamic Loading and (2) Structural Integrity of Deep Water
Systems. The expanded experimental capability to incorporate currents will
result in advances in: o the study of the kinematics of long-crested and
shorted- crested seas in currents, o the study of hydrodynamic-structural
interactions affected by both waves and currents, such as wake formation,
shielding, vortex shedding, and structural vibrations, and o the study of the
wave and current effects on the drag, added mass and damping coefficients of
vessels, offshore structures and rigid and complaint members within structures.
