Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-0416091&lt;br/&gt;Sadtchenko/George
Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Sadtchenko and his coworkers in the
Department of Chemistry at the George Washington University are examining the
thermal and UV photoinduced chemistry of small oxygenates trapped in dynamic
water ice thin films. Using a rapid thermal desorption method coupled with time
of flight mass spectrometry, the chemistry of this dynamic molecular interfacial
system is being examined. Fundamental information from these studies is relevant
to many questions of heterogeneous chemistry in the atmosphere and the
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program, Professor Sadtchenko and his coworkers at George Washington
University are studying the thermal and photochemistry of small organic
molecules trapped in water ice thin films. A novel rapid thermal desorption
method developed by Professor Sadtchenko is being applied to studies of the
reaction kinetics of these systems, which are relevant to atmospheric and
environmental chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
