Abstract: This award funds research in the economic theory of information. The
objective of the research is to obtain a better understanding of the reasons why
people fail to take advantage of available information in strategic settings.
The PI develops new models that organize observations about how people share and
use information. He then works out the formal implications of these models and
frames hypotheses that can be used to test the models and distinguish between
them. This project contributes to game theory, develops concepts and a taxonomy
to give rigorous foundation to ideas about coordination, conventions,
argumentation, and social comparison, and suggests ways to structure economic
environments to improve performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Failures to share
information within and between groups can lead to significant costs in the
decision making of committees, juries, and corporations. The research will
provide new insight into how to structure the organizing rules of such
committees to reduce communication failures.
