9701057 Kunz Populations of social mammals typically are subdivided into semi-
isolated breeding groups maintained by behavioral impediments to dispersal. Such
socially-mediated constraints on genetic exchange have been proposed to increase
the magnitude of random drift (chance fluctuations in the frequencies of gene
variants from one generation to the next) and genetic divergence among breeding
groups, thereby enhancing rates of evolutionary change. According to this
hypothesis, the diversifying influence of random drift, operating independently
within behaviorally-segregated breeding groups, is of sufficient magnitude to
overpower the homogenizing effect of genetic exchange within and among
populations. The objective of the present study is to test this prediction by
analyzing the distribution of genetic variation in natural populations of a
highly social mammal, the short nosed fruit bat (Cynopterus sphinx), in
peninsular India. The degree of genetic subdivision within and among populations
will be assessed in terms of (2) the frequencies of gene variants encoded by the
nuclear genome and (2) the frequencies and genealogies of mitochondrial DNA
sequences. The genetic consequences of social structure will be examined by
assessing the distribution of genetic variation within and among three levels of
hierarchical subdivision: individuals, harem social groups, and geographic
populations. This nested hierarchy provides a framework for examining the way in
which patterns of mating, dispersal, and new social group formation influence
population-genetic structure.
