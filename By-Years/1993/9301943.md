Three-dimensional modeling of industrial metal forming processes using an
Eulerian reference frame will be performed. Common processes such as rolling,
drawing, and extrusion will be evaluated. These processes all involve a high
degree of mechanical-thermal-material coupling. A model which accounts for this
coupling and an algorithm for handling this coupling is being developed. A
finite deformation theory for the elastic-plastic kinematics must be used to
handle the large deformations being considered. The planning stage of this
project, the model, algorithm, and code development will be handled in
collaboration with colleagues at Rensselaer and Alcoa Laboratories.
