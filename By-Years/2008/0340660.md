0340660 &lt;br/&gt;Jhon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the
participation of American researchers in a U.S.-Korea workshop on nanoscale
science and engineering to be held in Seoul, Korea in October 2003. The U.S.
organizer is Professor Myung S. Jhon of Carnegie Mellon University. The workshop
will allow for broad ranging discussions on state-of-the-art research, and is
intended to identify opportunities for U.S.-Korea collaboration in this rapidly
advancing field. Experts from both sides will make presentations on nanoscale
science and engineering in relation to policy and education, simulation,
fabrication, devices, electronic applications, information technology,
biotechnology, and energy and the environment. The exchange of ideas and data
with Korean experts will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and
will set the stage for future collaborative projects. Seminar organizers have
made a special effort to involve both senior and junior researchers. &lt;br/&gt;
