This proposal was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering
initiative, NSF 01-157, category NIRT. The work focuses on the exploration of a
new paradigm for a quantum information and storage device, the atom chip. In
this paradigm, neutral atoms are suspended above nanofabricated current carrying
structures. This work will advance the atom chip concept by investigating two
important new technologies for introduction into atom chips: (1) to use
superconducting materials in atom chip devices and (2) to investigate means and
methods for the creation and control of Rydberg atoms confined on atom chips. In
this component of the research the atom chips will be used to study the nano-
science of the atom-surface interaction and to explore how they may be used for
nano-technology. For application to quantum information, the work on atom chips
will address two strategies: First, the use of atomic ensembles and collective
atomic states, such as a BEC and, secondly, the use of single atom quantum
control. In order to accomplish the goals of the project a three-member
interdisciplinary team spanning three academic departments at the University of
Rochester has been assembled. This award is jointly funded by the Divisions of
Physics and Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences
Directorate and the Division of Computer-Communications Research in the
Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.
