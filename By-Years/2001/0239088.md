The objective of this proposed research is to develop and implement a novel,
combinatorial protein engineering strategy called random domain insertion to
couple two proteins functionally to create a protein molecular switch. The
design of molecular switches to modulate or report on biological functions has
enormous potential for a variety of applications including the creation of
biosensors, regulators of gene transcription, modulators of metabolic and cell
signaling pathways, chaperones for drug delivery, facilitators of drug
transport, and novel biomaterials. The efficacy of the random domain insertion
strategy will be demonstrated in two models, "proof-of-principle" systems using
well-characterized proteins. The kinetic, structural, and fluorescent behavior
of representative molecular switches will be characterized so as to develop
models on how the switching behavior was achieved. These models will be tested
experimentally. The combinatorial methods and models developed will be utilized
to initiate engineering a molecular switch for drug transport. The scientific
insights gained from this will provide a rational basis for engineering switches
for a variety of applications as well as provide a unique platform for
addressing questions of structure-function relationships. For the education
component, the PI will be developing an integrated program for infusing the
Chemical Engineering Undergraduate Program at Johns Hopkins University with the
proper components to prepare graduates who have a basic understanding of biology
and who can apply quantitative and non-quantitative approaches to biological
problems. This will include the development of a Biological Engineering
Laboratory course.
