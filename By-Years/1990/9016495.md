This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports
the continued work of Dr. Edward Rosenberg of the Chemistry Department,
California State University at Northridge, for the investigation of the role of
ligand mobility in metal cluster reactions. In particular, Rosenberg will study
the transfer of hydrogen between oxygen or nitrogen and metal carbonyl cluster
systems and investigate the source of the kinetic isotope effect previously
observed for this reaction. He will also study substitution and addition
reactions of some osmium and ruthenium clusters containing face-capping nitrogen
ligands in order to elucidate the role of stereochemical nonrigidity in this
reaction. These studies will potentially provide new insights into the mechanism
of activation by metal surfaces in catalysis. One mechanism for protonation
consistent with the observed kinetic isotope effect is proton tunneling, but an
alternative mechanism is intermolecular transfer. Low temperature protonation
reactions of ruthenium carbonyls by deuterated acid will be studied in order to
determine the extent to which proton transfer is intra- or intermolecular. In
related work, a series of dinuclear rhenium compounds will be studied to see if
cluster fluxionality can result in a symmetrical hydrogen transfer intermediate,
a usual requirement for proton tunneling. For the stereochemical nonrigidity
studies, a trinuclear ruthenium cluster will be reacted with diazomethane and
its deuterated analog to investigate the unexpected room temperature oxidative
addition of CH in this reaction and the involvement, if any, of the bridging
hydride.
