This standard renewal project involves six three-week workshops (2/summer)
spread over three summers. There will be approximately 25 teachers/workshop.
Thus, a total of 150 elementary teachers (2 per school) will be trained to
become science mentor specialists for 75 Los Angeles area elementary schools.
The workshops will provide the mentor teachers with lesson plans and kits of
materials for hands-on physical science units, as well as training to
effectively utilize the units in inservices for colleague teachers at each grade
level. Two support sessions for all mentor teachers will occur during the
academic year following the workshop. This leadership project is appropriate for
the Teacher Enhancement Program because it enhances the physical science
education of elementary and middle school teachers and because it includes a
practical plan for participants to provide science inservice for all of the
teachers in their respective schools. Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 30%
of the amount requested from NSF.
