In this project the PI will collect and analyse water samples for Helium-3
concentration on WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) hydrographic lines in
the Pacific. The focus will be on samples from the deep layers in order to study
circulation related to hydrothermal venting along active sections of the mid-
ocean ridge system such as the East Pacific Rise and the Juan de Fuca Ridge. In
combination with other WOCE tracer measurments, a more complete description of
the circulation of the deep Pacific Ocean is expected.
