The study of language draws from a wide range of disciplines, and its
interdisciplinary nature is particularly strong in the study of bilingualism.
With funding from the National Science Foundation, two workshops to be held at
The Pennsylvania State University, each devoted bilingualism in the context of
English and a variety of Hispanic languages. The Workshop on Linguistic
Convergence will focus on how bilingual speakers, regardless of fluency, show
subtle differences from monolingual speakers in terms of their language
performance. These differences provide important evidence on how two languages
are managed, and possibly merged, in the mind of a bilingual. The Workshop on
Language Processing will focus on the moment-by-moment processing of language in
the mind of a bilingual, with particular attention to issues surrounding the
acquisition of two languages, and the consequences of neurological language
disorders for bilinguals. These workshops will bring together experts from a
range of disciplines, including linguistics, speech science, psychology and
neuropsychology, to discuss a misconception of bilingualism that places Hispanic
youth at a disadvantage in our educational and testing systems. The
misconception is that, while bilingual language development may be different
from monolingual development, it is by no means deviant or deficient. The
research to be discussed at these workshops is aimed at, among other things,
dispelling this misconception.
