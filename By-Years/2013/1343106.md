The goal of this project is to investigate wave forcings originating from the
lower atmosphere including their sources, wave interactions and coupling, and
their impacts on ionospheric/thermospheric variability. Meteorological sources
of wave energy from the lower atmosphere are responsible for producing
significant variability in the upper atmosphere, which impacts space weather.
Vertical wave coupling is a fundamental atmospheric process that has profound
effects on the variability of the ionosphere and thermosphere. This project will
utilize existing and ongoing lidar and Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR)
observations to collectively study atmospheric waves in both the neutral
atmosphere and ionosphere, and the Whole Atmosphere Model (WAM) to understand
and interpret these rich datasets. In particular, the project will focus on
characterizing 1-9 h period gravity waves by comparing observations with
simulations in terms of magnitude, vertical and horizontal wavelengths,
propagation direction, and latitudinal distribution. The tidal modulation of
fast gravity waves will also be studied, and the source regions identified.
