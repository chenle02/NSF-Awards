This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry
Program supports the efforts of Professor Jon A. Zubieta of Syracuse University
for the construction of hybrid materials using clusters, chains, networks, or
frameworks of metal oxides, along with organic partner-materials including
ligands, tethers, counterions, secondary metal coordinating cations, and
structure-directing subunits. Their general synthetic approach employs an
organic component at low temperature to modify the surface of growing hybrid
crystals in a solvatothermal medium. These new materials have application in gas
storage. Professor Zubieta encourages high school students and their teachers
from William Nottingham High School as well as Native American undergraduate
students from Onondaga Community College to be active participants in the
research program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
