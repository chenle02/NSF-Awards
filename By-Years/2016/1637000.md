Tribal Nations Research Group (TNRG), a federally recognized and Tribal 501c3
non-profit organization, is proposing an 18-month planning project that will
gather the necessary information to design a study to determine the
effectiveness and the impact of a Tribal Colleges and Universities Program
(TCUP) funded outreach project, the Sunday Academy Model (SAM). Sunday Academy
is a collaborative and culturally sensitive STEM learning outreach model that
from 2001 to 2015 was partially supported with funding from TCUP. The North
Dakota Tribal Colleges in partnership with North Dakota State University (NDSU)
administered the project. Additionally, the proposed project will explore ways
to explain the role the NSF Tribal College Rural Systemic Initiative (1994-2005)
had in establishing the necessary and preliminary environmental and academic
atmosphere for the Sunday Academy project at the participating tribal colleges
and the American Indian communities being served.
