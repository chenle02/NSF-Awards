Networking and AI are two of the most transformative IT technologies --- helping
to better peopleâ€™s lives, contributing to national economic competitiveness,
national security, and national defense. The Institute will exploit the
synergies between networking and AI to design the next generation of edge
networks (6G and beyond) that are highly efficient, reliable, robust, and
secure. A new distributed intelligence plane will be developed to ensure that
these networks are self-healing, adaptive, and self-optimized. The future of AI
is distributed because AI will increasingly be implemented across a diverse set
of edge devices. These intelligent and adaptive networks will in turn unleash
the power of collaboration to solve long-standing distributed AI challenges,
making AI more efficient, interactive, and privacy-preserving. The Institute
will develop the key underlying technologies for distributed and networked
intelligence to enable a host of future transformative applications such as
intelligent transportation, remote healthcare, distributed robotics, and smart
aerospace. It is a national priority to educate students, professionals, and
practitioners in AI and networks, and substantially grow and diversify the
workforce. The Institute will develop novel, efficient, and modular ways of
creating and delivering educational content and curricula at scale, and to
spearhead a program that helps build a large diverse workforce in AI and
networks spanning K-12 to university students and
faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the AI Institute will be
on edge networks, which will constitute the majority of the growth of future
networks. This edge includes all devices connected through the radio as well as
data centers and cloud computing systems that are not at the core of the
Internet. A critical component of the Institute is to shorten the time-scale of
interactions between Foundations and use case research across multiple
disciplines. This will result in a virtuous cycle that will have a cascading
impact dramatically accelerating the time it takes from research to
implementation and technology transfer. The research tasks will be enhanced and
fleshed out by exploring three wireless edge use cases in depth: (1) Ubiquitous
Sensing/Networking; (ii) Human-Machine Mobility and (iii)
Programmable/virtualized 6G networks. These use cases are important in their own
right and connect the key research thrusts and their validation to specific
experimental platforms. The Institute will work with its industry and DoD
partners to facilitate translation and adoption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
