Dr. Braja K. Mandal, Department of Chemistry, Illinois Institute of Technology
is jointly supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
program in the Division of Chemistry and the Solid State Chemistry program in
the Division of Materials Research to create new photonic materials based on the
self-assembly of metallo-organic building blocks into organized nanoscale
assemblies. This research builds on his recent construction of fused multi-ring
phthalocyanines ligands by a Diels-Alder reaction between a diene bearing
solubilizing groups and a quinone dienophile containing sites for the
incorporation of nitrile groups. These phthalocyanines will contain helicene,
perylene and benzoperylene groups to solubilize them in organic solvents,
facilitate self-assembly and promote linear and nonlinear optical properties.
These highly conjugated molecules will be capable of modification to tune their
optical, and electron and energy transfer properties.

New cyclic molecules with high aromaticity will be prepared to facilitate self-
assembly into aggregates capable of electron and energy transfer that can be
integrated into electronic devices.
