This grant is a travel request to enable eleven US researchers to attend the VI
Iberoamerican Conference on Phase Equilibria for Process Design (EQUIFASE 2002).
This meeting will be held from October 12 -16, 2002 in Foz de Iguazu, Brazil and
is being organized by Professor Marcelo Castier (Universidad Federal do Rio de
Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and Professor Esteban Brignole (PALPIQUI,
Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahia Blanca, Argentina). The purpose of the VI
Iberoamerican Conference on Phase Equilibria for Process Design (EQUIFASE 2002)
is to share research results in the area of phase equilibrium and
thermodynamics. The conference organizers are anxious to include researchers
from North America who traditionally have not attended this meeting. This travel
grant will include full funding for two young researchers and partial funding
for nine senior researchers. The proposal for this grant is a direct result of
the Pan-American Workshop to Promote Collaboration in Chemical Engineering that
was held in Rio de Janeiro in August 1998.
