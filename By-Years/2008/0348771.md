This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
create a robust software system for performing uncertainty analysis of process
simulations for manufacturing. For simulations that are large or that contain
many parameters, even the best Monte Carlo, or importance-based sampling methods
for uncertainty analysis can be prohibitively expensive. Consequently,
systematic uncertainty analyses are rarely implemented for complex systems. This
proposal presents a plan to produce a commercially viable package of a new
method for quantifying simulation uncertainty, based on polynomial chaos
expansions. The method can determine the probability density functions of black-
box model responses and can identify quantitatively which of the parameters
contribute most to uncertainties in responses for multivariate inputs and
outputs. The unique sampling approach enabled by the use of polynomial chaos
expansions allows more accurate resolution of probability distribution functions
at a very small fraction of the cost to achieve similar results with more
traditional uncertainty-analysis methods.

While illustrative examples from the chemical manufacturing industries will be
used to demonstrate the software functionality, the methodology has broad
application to such fields as circuit design, risk management, allocation of
experimental resources, chemical plant design and operation of production
systems. Due to the ability to handle arbitrary or black-box simulations, the
methods can be applied as easily to economic market analysis, or global climate
modeling, as to chemical process design.
