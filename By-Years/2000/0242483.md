The REU-Site in Physics and Astronomy at the University of Rochester offers
sophomores and juniors the opportunity to take part in forefront research in
eight subfields: astrophysics, biological and medical physics, condensed matter,
particle physics, nuclear physics, plasma physics and fusion, quantum optics and
lasers, and physics education. On-site housing and stipend support are provided
to all participants. Over 10 weeks, each student works with a faculty adviser on
a specific project in the context of an active research group. Mini-courses in
machining and electronics are offered. REU participants gather informally for
weekly lunches with University faculty, tours of university research facilities
(such as the Laboratory for Laser Energetics and the Mees Astronomical
Observatory), and outings to sites of local interest. Students may take part in
community outreach activities, including a physics program for high school
students and public tours of the Mees Observatory. The program concludes with an
informal symposium at which students present their projects; students also
submit written reports of their research experiences. REU students are
encouraged to continue their projects toward publication and to present their
findings at both student and professional conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An
8-week RET program runs in parallel with the REU program, sponsoring teachers
from local-area high schools and middle schools. RET program activities engage
teams of REU students, high school teachers, and their students in projects with
supervising faculty, focusing in two main areas: instrumentation for high energy
physics detectors, and geo- and astrophysics data analysis using web-based
databases. Both projects are designed to enable teachers and students to
continue the research in their high schools. The REU/RET program thus aims to
provide a model in which forefront research activities are integrated with
teaching, mentoring, and outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
