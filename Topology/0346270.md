Abstract: During the last 100 years there has been tremendous interest in
understanding the topology and geometry of 3-dimensional manifolds. In part,
because a 3-manifold is (roughly speaking) a mathematical object modeled on our
familiar 3-dimensional environment. A 3-manifold has the property that
sufficiently small subsets can be parametrized by 3 coordinates.

The problem of characterizing the geometry and topology of surfaces, i.e.,
manifolds of dimension 2, was completely answered nearly a century ago. It was
determined that the only closed orientable connected surfaces are the sphere,
torus, and the multi-holed tori. Furthermore, such surfaces can be given
geometries of constant curvature, +1 for the sphere, 0 for the torus, and -1 for
the other surfaces.

Although great progress has been made during the last century, the situation for
dimension-3 is not nearly so well understood. Nevertheless a conjectural picture
for the structure of 3-manifolds emerged almost 25 years ago (by Thurston) and
there has been much theoretical and experimental evidence supporting his
conjecture. The hyperbolic 3-manifolds, i.e. the manifolds of constant -1
curvature, play a central role in this picture. In this proposal the PI in
collaboration with various other mathematicians, plan to investigate the
structure of hyperbolic manifolds and the structure of manifolds which are
conjecturally hyperbolic. In particular they will study the structure of the
diffeomorphism group of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and the structure of hyperbolic
3-manifolds of low volume. They will also address whether or not a closed
aspherical, atoroidal, 3-manifold has a Gromov negatively curved fundamental
group. A positive resolution would imply that a 3-manifold which is
conjecturally hyperbolic, has at least the coarse algebraic structure of a
hyperbolic 3-manifold.
