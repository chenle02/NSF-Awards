In this project in the Theoretical and Computational program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Mead proposes to develop a new general theory to describe
the detailed way in which molecules interact with each other and with applied
magnetic fields. A general theory will be developed which will enable one to
correlate rovibronic states with nuclear spin states for clusters of any size.
In addition, the role of Kramers degeneracy will be investigated. The definition
and determination of quasidiabatic basis sets, which facilitate computation of
coupling between electronic states, will be investigated, as will a new elegant
and convenient way of describing the magnetic shielding of the nuclei by
electrons.
