9500494 Foreman Foreman will work on two types of problems in this research
project. The first kind lies within ergodic theory and has to do with conjugacy
of invertible measure-preserving transformations. In particular, Foreman will
use the tools of descriptive set theory to attempt to determine whether every
invertible ergodic transformation with finite entropy is conjugate to a smooth
transformation on a compact smooth manifold. The second kind of problem concerns
the strength and consequences of very large ideals on cardinals such as the
second uncountable cardinal. Foreman intends to use these ideals to investigate
partition relations. In the early twentieth century, ergodic theory arose as a
technique for studying complicated models of physical phenomenon by looking at
the statistical behavior of the associated flows. Dynamical systems arising in
physics with otherwise intractible behavior were amenable to this kind of
analysis. A prominent problem in ergodic theory deals with the extent to which
the general statistical behavior of measure preserving systems models the
behavior of physically realistic situations. Foreman will continue to
investigate these problems using the tools of descriptive set theory, an
unconventional approach which brings logic to bear on the problem. ***
