9706644 Zhou The project includes the study of Sobolev space bijectivity of
inverse scattering transforms, long time asymptotics for integrable systems
related to Riemann-Hilbert problems on Riemann surfaces, the zero dispersion
problem for focusing NLS, infinite dimensional perturbation theory for
integrable systems, certain integrable statistical models--random matrices--
orthogonal polynomials, and other problems related to inverse scattering theory.
The inverse scattering theory provides a method for analyzing many nonlinear
phenomena of mathematical and scientific importance described by so-called
integrable systems. Many of these systems originated from statistical physics
and nonlinear optics. For instance, the focusing NLS equation is a model for
soliton transmission in optical fibres, which may be adopted by industry for the
new generation of information transmission systems. This project aims at further
developments of certain mathematical tools originated by the PI and his
collaborators. These tools allow one to obtain very detailed information on the
solutions of integrable systems and a deeper understanding of the related
nonlinear phenomena.
