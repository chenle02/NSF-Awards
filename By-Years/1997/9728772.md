9728772 Ma Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that is essential for
the sexual reproduction of all eukaryotic organisms. Plants are excellent
systems to study meiosis because the cells that undergo meiosis are easily
accessible and multiple male meioses occur nearly synchronously. A male sterile
mutant has been isolated from Arabidopsis, 1176-306, whose phenotype is the
production of microspores of variable size and containing variable amounts of
DNA. The mutated gene has been identified and characterized. The protein encoded
by the gene has strong similarity to human and yeast SKP1 proteins, which are
known to be regulators of the mitotic cell cycle, but have not yet been
determined to be involved in the meiotic cycle. It is proposed that the
Arabidopsis SKP1 gene is essential for male meiosis. That hypothesis will be
tested by characterizing the Arabidopsis skp1 mutant in detail using genetic,
cytological and biochemical methods and by analyzing the SKP1 gene and gene
product using molecular, cell biological and biochemical approaches. The
existing mutants will be characterized using fluorescence microscopy and the
SKP1 RNA and protein expression patterns determined using in situ hybridization
and immunolocalization. Possible SKP1 function in mitosis at other stages will
be tested. Genetic interactions between SKP1 and other genes will be determined
and interactions at the protein level investigated. Suppressors and enhancers of
the skp1 mutants will be identified. Other alleles of the SKP1 locus as well as
other related genes will be isolated and characterized. These studies will
result in greater insight into the genetic control of meiosis at the molecular
level, a mechanism which is central to sexual reproduction in all organisms,
including plants.
