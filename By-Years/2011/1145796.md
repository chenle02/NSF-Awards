Despite the fact that most animals sleep, it is still unclear what function
sleep serves. In humans and other mammals, one of the key functions of sleep is
likely to improve learning and the ability to retain what was learned. This is
indicated by the fact that sleep deprivation leads to learning and memory
deficits. In humans, sleep is made up of sleep cycles that last approximately 90
minutes. Within these cycles, sleep alternates between different types of sleep
or sleep stages, such as rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) and non-REMS. These
stages are present in a specific sequence within each cycle and it is believed
that these sequences are important for memory. For this research, we will study
a laboratory animal model (the rat) in which we can experimentally disrupt the
normal sequence of sleep stages without inducing sleep deprivaation. We predict
that this disruption will result in deficits in memory, providing evidence for
the role of a normal sequence of sleep stages in learning processes. We will
also study the molecular mechanisms by which this effect on learning may take
place. Our studies will help understand how challenges to normal sleep, that are
a common feature of our modern society, affect learning and may help develop
strategies to improve learning performance in people that are commonly exposed
to sleep disruptions. This project will also include the training of
undergraduate and graduate students in research methods and techniques.
