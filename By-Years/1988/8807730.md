Successful research on fundamental properties of nonlinear systems will have
important ramifications in applications. This is especially true in control
system design and in particular, those designs in which it is important to have
the model retain its validity over a wide range of values of the parameters.
This proposal deals with such problems by incorporating recent developments in
Center Manifold Theory with the stabilizability concerns that exist in most
control system design.
