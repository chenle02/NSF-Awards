ABSTRACT Considerable economic loss is suffered at the hands of mechanical
designs that do not incorporate sufficient knowledge about tribological
processes. Yet because only a handful of academic departments offer study in
tribology, there remains a critical national need to produce experts in this
rapidly emerging field. Funds are requested from the National Science Foundation
to sponsor five (5) students for graduate study leading to the Ph.D. in the
field of tribology. With five faculty in the tribology area, a selection of
courses covering tribological topics as well as extensive laboratory facilities
for tribological experimentation, the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical
Engineering, is well equipped to provide academic training for sponsored GRTP
students. The School will aggressively recruit outstanding students will seek to
promote awareness and interest in the tribology field among undergraduates. The
School will also take advantage of a number of special programs to identify and
attract talented students from underrepresented groups. The GRTP students will
receive a comprehensive educational experience, including: (1) quality mentoring
from a faculty advisor; (2) formal training in tribology fundamentals; (3)
access to high quality laboratory facilities; (4) participation in a graduate
seminar series; (5) travel to and presentation at national conferences; and (6)
involvement in tribology instruction to undergraduates.
