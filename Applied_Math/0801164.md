This award provides support for meetings, held at the University of Memphis and
at Mississippi State University, on current research topics in differential
equations. The meetings are part of the successful, well-attended regional
Differential Equations Weekends series. The conferences encourage and
financially support participation by students and recent Ph.D. recipients.

The meetings include plenary lectures on topics of current research interest but
strongly encourage lectures by students and recent Ph.D. recipients. The
conferences bring together workers in a variety of different areas of research
in differential equations, with emphasis on providing opportunities for new
researchers to present their work. The conferences will be especially beneficial
to young researchers, including graduate students and postdocs.
