In the absence of effective vaccines or treatments, social distancing has been
shown to be effective in controlling the initial spread of a pandemic. While the
decision on when to start social distancing can be based on the occurrence of a
few positive test cases, the decision on when to ease such measures during
pandemic recovery is considerably more difficult due to the possibility of a
second wave. Our goal in this project is to develop new artificial intelligence
(AI) algorithms to support this decision-making, by making more efficient use of
limited test availability and also drawing on novel data sources (and physical
models) not limited by testing. The research will be divided into two inter-
related thrusts. The first thrust in on efficient ways to determine the status
of individuals in the community through new AI based methods for group testing.
The second thrust is focused on community level pandemic assessment using a
data-driven quickest change detection (QCD) framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project, if successful, will have a direct and obvious impact on pandemic
recovery, for COVID-19 and future pandemics. This will in turn have significant
social and economic impacts. The goal is to rapidly deploy research results via
relationships in government and industry. Broader impact activities include:
navigating the ethical tradeoff between equity and accuracy in group testing
designs; supporting a diverse cohort of undergraduate researchers in this
topical area; developing a new, general educational module for laboratory-based
data science classes (at Illinois and around the world); integrating diversity
by training a diverse cohort of graduate students; and public outreach via
established media presence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
