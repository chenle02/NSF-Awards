A special triaxial loading system is purchased for studying granular materials
(soils) under multi-axial stress conditions. The loading system will accommodate
large samples (250mm high, 200mm inside diameter and 250mm outside diameter).
The system is capable of independent application of confining pressure, axial
compression, and torsion. A true triaxial state of stress with prescribed
directions of the principal stresses can be achieved.
