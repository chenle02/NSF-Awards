Yngve Ohrn and Erik Deumens are supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to develop electron nuclear dynamics, a general
approach to find approximate solutions to the time-dependent Schrodinger
equation. By solving this equation in a non-Born-Oppenheimer way, that is, by
placing the nuclei and the electrons on an equal footing, their method avoids
the extensive computation of potential energy surface points and nonadiabatic
coupling terms required by traditional approaches. The trade-off is an increase
in the number of particles to be treated, but due to advances in computational
power, this method is economically competitive. Applications include hydrogen
abstraction reactions and dissociative recombinations of polyatomic molecular
cations. Elementary chemical reations are dynamical events involving the
participating electrons and atomic nuclei. Such dynamics are described at the
most fundamental level by the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. A general
approach to solving this equation will yield reaction rates for elementary
chemical reactions which are difficult to obtain experimentally.
