Many engineered systems, such as those in the automotive and chemical
industries, have dynamic performance or system outputs. The overall performance
of such systems cannot be captured by a single number, but is instead
represented by a response profile over time. Conducting experiments on these
systems is costly and time-consuming; as a result, improving system performance
through experimentation is difficult. This project will overcome these
challenges through novel experimental design methodologies for engineered
systems with dynamic outputs. The project is expected to impact a broad range of
engineering applications. The academic research team will work closely with
industrial partners to ensure applicability to real life
settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of this project is to
improve experimental design methods for systems with dynamic response. The
project will make advances in (1) dynamic response modeling, (2) optimal
experimental designs, and (3) computational algorithm development. A novel
hierarchical mix effect modeling approach will capture both the dynamic behavior
of response variables and the effects of experimental factors. At the
experimental design stage, the optimal sampling locations of the spectrum
variables and design points in the experimental factor space will be
investigated. Finally, fast computer algorithms that take advantage of the
properties of B-spline basis function and the patterns in design matrices will
be developed.
