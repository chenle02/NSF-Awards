9320483 Featherman This workshop, organized by the Social Science Research
Council, in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution and the African Academy
of Sciences, brings together African and U.S. scientists from a range of
disciplines to examine the question: how has human occupancy of African
landscapes affected the biodiversity found within those landscapes? Active
researchers from the biological sciences, social sciences, and humanities will
consider the relevance of this question and the feasibility of pursuing research
initiatives to answer it. The specific research interests of the participants
include agriculture and drought, forestry, agroforestry, and rangelands
management. The African participants come from 7 different countries,
representing a broad cross-section of the continent (Nigeria, Uganda, Zimbabwe,
Tanzania, Namibia, Cameroon, Kenya). The role of humans in managing and perhaps
creating biodiversity has been neglected so far, and Africa, as the place where
humans originated, and where the dynamic effects of those interactions are
currently highly visible, is the logical place to begin examining the question.
The workshop on this novel, important, and timely theme will strengthen
collaboration internationally (between US and African scientists), regionally
(among scientists in different parts of Africa), and across disciplinary
boundaries. ***
