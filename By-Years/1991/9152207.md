The biochemistry program is being updated and expanded to keep abreast of the
ACS program developments and new techniques associated with biotechnology.
Specific changes in our program include: (1) expansion of the biochemistry
course from one to two semesters, including laboratories; (2) introduction of
new experiments involving chemical and molecular biological instrumentation
including new emphasis on biochemical spectroscopy; (3) early entry into
undergraduate research; and (4) introduction of a biotechnology lecture and
laboratory course involving hands-on experience with gene recombination
procedures. Biochemical equipment acquisitions include centrifuges,
electrophoresis equipment, and microbiological equipment. The grantee will
overmatch the NSF award from non- Federal sources.
