9452066 Mehta To enable the mathematics and computer science faculty of Saint
Xavier University to incorporate technology into their courses and to better
serve their commitment to collaborative learning, they plan to create a
departmental computer center consisting of two laboratory classrooms. These
classrooms will be dedicated to closed laboratory instruction. Goals of this
project include the attraction of more mathematics and computer science majors
and greater retention in all mathematics and computer science courses. Based on
the results of a recently conducted pilot study, the faculty expects increased
use of technology in a supervised setting (i.e., closed labs) to enable students
to focus on mathematical and algorithmic concepts. The pilot study was
successful to the extent that current University computer resources allowed. In
order to expand the mathematics and computer science curricula the department
has two dedicated local area networks, each consisting of twenty computers. One
contains Macintosh Quadras with an Apple Workgroup server, while the other
consists of Hewlett Packard 486 PCs. The labs are adjoined by a common resource
and work area. Each lab is equipped with a projection device as well as the
software necessary to accomplish networking and instruction. The faculty also
requests computers for developmental use in their offices.
