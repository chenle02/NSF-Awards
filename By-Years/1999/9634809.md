This research project deals with two basic issues associated with the drive-by-
wire nonlinear control of internal combustion engines; the nonlinear modeling of
the engines for feedback controller design; and the roust nonlinear control of
engine torque. The nonlinear modeling incorporates the structure of the engine
as an odd polynomial with coefficients that are transfer functions. These
transfers functions are identified using frequency rich inputs. The nonlinear
nature of engine is absorbed in the quadratic, cubic, and higher-order terms,
and hence the identification task of transfer functions is reduced to a linear
system identification. The development of nonlinear feedback controller design
is carried out in the frequency domain using an inverse deseriking function
approach. Hard time- domain constraints representing quantitative output
performance and actuator saturation are directly incorporated in the design
methodology. The performance specifications appear as nonsymmetrical tolerances
which leads to a constrained system design. Experimental verification of these
technologies is performed on a Ford 4.6 L V-8 engine available in Herrick
Laboratories.
