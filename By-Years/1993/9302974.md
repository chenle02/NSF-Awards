This award supports a 3-day meeting of 45 recent Ph.D. recipients and doctoral
students in statistics and probability. The purpose of the meeting is to
facilitate the exchange of research ideas among new researchers in diverse areas
of statistics and probability and to assist in the professional development of
new researchers. Those attending will actively participate in the program by
either presenting their research in a short talk or in a poster. The program
also include overview talks on cutting-edge research and a panel discussion on
how to initiate an active research program, where senior researchers will have
an opportunity to shape the research potential of these new members of the
mathematics community. The conference is to be held prior to the joint annual
meeting of the IMS and American Statistical Association (ASA) in August, 1993.
Conference attendees will be encouraged to participate in workshops held on
writing skills, the professional development of new women researchers, and
special topic workshops in probability and genetics held the weekend between
this conference and the annual meetings of the Institute of Mathematical
Statistics.
