The objective of this project is to study the performance of a rehabilitation
scheme which can be used to correct the "weak links" in a frame system, but will
simplify the construction process and reduce the time and inconvenience
associated with most rehabilitation projects. The procedure is based on the use
of precast wall segments to make up the infill between columns and floors and to
supplement the axial tensile capacity of the existing columns through the use of
post-tensioned tendons extending vertically through the structure at the
columns. The research is divided into three parts. The first part involves a
study of techniques for constructing the panel closure strips and evaluating
their performance. The second part is directed toward a study of various methods
for transferring forces at the infill panel-existing frame interface. Finally, a
large-scale model comprising several stories of the structure with infills will
be constructed to verify performance and provide data on overall system
response. This project is a part of research initiative on "Seismic Repair and
Rehabilitation of Structures."
