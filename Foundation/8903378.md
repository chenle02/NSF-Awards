In the last two decades a very powerful structure theory has emerged for
totally categorical theories. It was shown that they are all built around
projective spaces over finite fields. It was expected that a similar but much
deeper theory exists for aleph-one categorical theories; here the corresponding
geometries would include algebraically closed fields. Recently a non- classical
geometry controlling an aleph-one categorical structure has been constructed.
The proposed research would proceed in two directions. The first would directly
investigate the limits of such constructions and attempt to create a new picture
of the subject. The most important test-question here is whether Cherlin's
conjecture that every simple group of finite Morley rank is an algebraic group
over an algebraically closed field is still viable. The second direction
involves a given geometry inside an ambient structure; in the simplest case the
structure is obtained from a strongly minimal set by blowing up each point to a
finite set; the question is how the structure may be expanded without disturbing
the base. This would have applications both to the classification of the totally
categorical theories and to the general theory. The immediate results of such a
project in abstract model theory are likely to be mainly of foundational
interest, but the refined combinatorical techniques developed in order to prove
them may have much wider appeal and utility.
