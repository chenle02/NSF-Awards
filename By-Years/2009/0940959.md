Engineering - Electrical (55) This collaborative project between the University
of Massachusetts Amherst and the Massachusetts Maritime Academy is evaluating
and dissemination a new interactive instructional circuit analysis computer
environment (CIRCE) for college physics and engineering laboratories. CIRCE
includes interactive, on-line software that provides immediate feedback, which
is known to increase student learning and mastery of concepts. It also provides
students with hands-on experience with electrical measurements and their
interpretation. CIRCE includes an authoring tool that allows faculty to modify
the environment to fit their own laboratory apparatus and curriculum goals. The
project seeks to improve student learning by (1) providing immediate feed-back
of the laboratory report and an opportunity for students to correct their
errors, (2) freeing instructors from the task of checking student work so they
can provide higher-level supervision of the laboratory exercise and (3)
supporting the educational community by enabling flexible creation of new
laboratory software. A consortium of faculty from 4-year colleges and the
University of Massachusetts Amherst are introducing the software into their
circuit analysis classes and evaluate its efficacy.
