Michael Hurley will carry out research in dynamical systems. In particular he
will study cellular automata. These are related to the magnetic storage of data.
Hurley's objective is to investigate the mathematical explanations of various
recent empirical observations. One reason for interest in cellular automata is
that some of them exhibit self-organizing behavior. In mathematical terms this
suggests the existence of attractors. A cellular automaton can be thought of as
a map on doubly infinite sequences which commutes with shifts. Hurley will study
the dynamics of such maps. Self-organization manifests itself in the observation
that random sequences become more highly patterned under repeated iterations and
the asymptotic pattern is independent of the original sequence. The two major
goals of Hurley's research are to understand the hierarchy of the collection of
attractors of an automaton and to describe the dynamics of its restriction to
its interesting attractors.
