Professor Goss will work on a number of topics in the arithmetic of function
fields in characteristic p, including: the cohomology of motives, L-series
attached to motives, and the analogues in this setting of the classical gamma
function and rings of divided power series. This research is work in the
Algebraic Geometry of finite characteristic. Although the field originated with
notions of continuously varying geometric structures like lines and planes, in
this context the Discrete takes over, and methods akin to those from the theory
of whole numbers are most useful. Reciprocally, the algebraic geometry of finite
characteristic is now having great influence on the Theory of Numbers, and is
finding application in Computer Science and Coding Theory.
