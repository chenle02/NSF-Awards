The project is awarding thirty scholarships per year for four years to students
enrolled in a computer science and engineering science transfer programs, and
digital/computer and mechanical technology programs. The scholars are being
provided with a variety of quality support structures that emphasizes community
building. Included are weekly study sessions to increase student connections
with instructors, breakfast orientations, chat rooms, student mentoring,
discipline specific one-hour refresher courses, and common enrollment in
classes. Students are keeping journals and sharing the information with their
advisors and/or the study session instructor, which is providing information
about students' needs and the effectiveness of student support activities. The
scholars are being supported through an Angel account, a course management
software package similar to WebCT or Blackboard, which is fostering inter-group
communication, group project work, and communication with the students' mentors.
The students are making professional connections through strong connections with
local industries, which lie mainly within the manufacturing sector.

The program is targeting women and underrepresented classes of students. Female
faculty members in physics, math and computer science are serving as role
models. Techniques that are being employed to support and retain women includes
hands-on active learning styles in the physics curriculum, forming lab and study
groups that respond to gender needs, and providing a family friendly atmosphere
in an open lab where students gather to work on problems, eat lunch, or listen
to music. A conceptual physics course is being offered to recruit female
students to pursue technology or science as a field of study.
