This is an investigation of zeolite (aluminosilicate) crystals with oliophilic
cores and oliophobic shells and the use of such materials to promote terminal
photochemical chlorination of higher hydrocarbons. Synthesis conditions and
reactor designs are established to produce zeolites with surfaces high in
aluminum and cores devoid of aluminum. Previous results show that such materials
produce strong regioselectivity for the terminal methly group in
photochlorination of long-chain hydrocarbons. The mechanism and scope of this
effect is probed. A fluidized-bed chlorination system to exploit this phenomenon
is being designed and built. This work suggests that a technology based on
continuous regioselective photochlorination processes is feasible. This would
make available new (or more efficient synthesis of old) moieties for
surfactants, polymers, lubricants, textile finishes, flame retardants, and other
materials.
