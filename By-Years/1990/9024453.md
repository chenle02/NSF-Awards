This project is part of a collaborative effort to obtain long- term (2 years)
observations of ocean circulation and atmospheric forcing, in anticipation of an
intensive experiment planned for the Western Pacific Warm Pool in late
1992/early 1993, called TOGA-COARE (Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response
Experiment). Long- term measurements will begin in late 1991, and continue until
well after the intensive experiment is completed, providing the overall
environmental context for the intensive experiment. In this component, the
P.I.'s will test the feasibility of attaching conductivity (salinity) sensors to
drifting buoys, in order to obtain better descriptions of the upper ocean
density. Conductivity fluctuations are a major source of variability in the
density structure, and hence greatly affect the ocean response to atmospheric
forcing in the Western Pacific Region.
