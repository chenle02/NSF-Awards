This award provides support that enables graduate
students&lt;br/&gt;andpostdoctoral fellows to participate in the
Seventeenth&lt;br/&gt;International Conference of Few-Body Problems in Physics.
The&lt;br/&gt;conference is sanctioned by the International Union of Pure
and&lt;br/&gt;Applied Physicists (IUPAP). It is the most highly attended
meeting&lt;br/&gt;of experts in the area of few-body physics, averaging about
250&lt;br/&gt;physicists in the last three meetings. Theintellectual scope of
the&lt;br/&gt;conference covers topics on quantum few-body problems at
all&lt;br/&gt;distance scales, ranging from subnucleonic to molecular systems.
&lt;br/&gt;Traditionally, this conference has served as a catalyst in
the&lt;br/&gt;formation of international collaborations that have addressed
some&lt;br/&gt;of the most challenging problems in the field. Giving
young&lt;br/&gt;scholars the opportunity to engage in these exchanges is
a&lt;br/&gt;significant investment in the future of the field. An
important&lt;br/&gt;outcome of the conference is the setting of short-term goals
for the&lt;br/&gt;field. The proceeding of the conference will be published in
the&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Physics A journal and will be available to the
broader&lt;br/&gt;research community.&lt;br/&gt;
