This award is to support the activities of a Mathematical Sciences Research
Group in Linear Analysis and Probability at Texas A&amp;M. The activities of
this group (whose fields cover Banach space theory, probability, operator
theory, and operator algebras) are focused by a workshop where graduate
students, postdoctoral students, invited researchers, and the faculty of the
group meet to discuss their ongoing research. Funds from the grant would go
towards the expenses of the workshop, and the graduate students and postdoctoral
scholars in residence.
