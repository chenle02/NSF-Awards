This award provides funds to the Department of Biochemistry at Colorado State
University to develop a modular approach to teaching state-of-the-art
undergraduate biochemistry laboratories. Rather than the traditional one
semester lecture- oriented lab course, the new curriculum involves a semester-
long introductory module that emphasizes hands-on mastery of the fundamental
techniques and instrumentation used in present-day biochemical and molecular
biological research. Students then progress into three modular courses which
apply the fundamental techniques and instruments (Protein Purification and
Characterization; Recombinant DNA Technology; Cellular Biochemistry). The basic
methods module and three specialized modules will provide undergraduate
biochemistry majors and other molecularly-oriented bioscience majors with a
strong laboratory background that will enhance their competitiveness and
productivity. The equipment purchased through this award will also be used in a
thoroughly revised and updated lab course for non-majors that services about 250
students per year. Acquisition of state-of-the-art instrumentation will not only
permit installation of the new modular curriculum, it will also be crucial in
designing and instituting the laboratory portions of a Secondary School Science
Teacher Workshop that is currently planned. The grantee is matching this award
with non-Federal sources.
