The proposed study will address two problems in solid Earth dynamics:
&lt;br/&gt;(I) How to reconcile the geochemical distinctions between mid-ocean
&lt;br/&gt;ridge basalts (MORBs) and hotspot ocean island basalts (OIBs) which
&lt;br/&gt;are widely interpreted in terms of a chemically layered mantle, with
&lt;br/&gt;geophysical evidence for whole mantle (i.e., single layer)
&lt;br/&gt;convection. (II) Determining the origin of the geographic variations
&lt;br/&gt;in lava geochemistry observed at hotspots. The hypothesis is that
&lt;br/&gt;variations in melting and ductile flow of a compositionally
&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous mantle cause many of the key geochemical
&lt;br/&gt;characteristics of OIBs and MORBs. This hypothesis will be tested
&lt;br/&gt;using numerical models that simulate the three-dimensional viscous
&lt;br/&gt;flow, heat transport, and melting in the upper mantle. Models will be
&lt;br/&gt;constructed based on the assumption that hotspots are formed by
&lt;br/&gt;buoyant upwellings, or mantle plumes, interacting with the base of
&lt;br/&gt;the lithosphere. The melting calculations will incorporate laboratory
&lt;br/&gt;experimental data on the pressure-temperature conditions for melting
&lt;br/&gt;of materials with different compositions. Computational results will
&lt;br/&gt;quantify the relationships between specific physical conditions and
&lt;br/&gt;predicted geographic variability of trace-element and Sr, Nd, Pb, and
&lt;br/&gt;He isotope geochemistry in erupted magmas at three tectonic scenarios
&lt;br/&gt;where adequate data sets exist for comparisons: an intraplate
&lt;br/&gt;hotspot (Hawaii), a hotspot centered on a mid-ocean ridge (Iceland),
&lt;br/&gt;and a hotspot off of, but near a mid-ocean ridge (Galapagos).
&lt;br/&gt;Problem (I) will be addressed by determining whether models do or do
&lt;br/&gt;not require mantle plumes--which could come from the lower mantle--to
&lt;br/&gt;be compositionally distinct from the upper mantle. Problem (II) will
&lt;br/&gt;be addressed by determining the physical conditions needed to explain
&lt;br/&gt;the nature of spatial geochemical variability observed at the above
&lt;br/&gt;types of hotspots. The origin of hotspot islands and the question of
&lt;br/&gt;whole- versus two-layer mantle convection are of broad scientific
&lt;br/&gt;interest, as evidenced by their treatment in high school and college
&lt;br/&gt;textbooks. The investigators have given, and will continue giving,
&lt;br/&gt;lectures and extracurricular seminars on these topics to local high
&lt;br/&gt;school and undergraduate students. Most of the requested budget will
&lt;br/&gt;support a Ph. D. student, providing funds needed for a comprehensive,
&lt;br/&gt;cross-disciplinary dissertation. &lt;br/&gt;
