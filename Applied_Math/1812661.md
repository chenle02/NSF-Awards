This project studies stochastic models applied in social sciences as well as
their mathematical foundations. The first part concerns the economics of climate
change. Climate change could be a very impactful global risk; its mitigation
becomes an interdisciplinary challenge involving a multitude of sciences and
agencies. The second part studies how collective behavior can result from
individual preferences in stochastic games; this is useful to understand
macroscopic effects in systems with many decision-takers, such as financial
crises in securities markets. The third part investigates the emergence of
speculative price bubbles in asset markets as a consequence of heterogeneity
among market participants. The fourth part studies the existence of probability
densities for certain stochastic processes and produces estimates for these
densities.

The complexity of the climate response and its interaction with the economy
gives rise to model ambiguity and stochastic uncertainty in decision making.
Nevertheless, the existing literature largely relies on deterministic models.
This project aims to emphasize the impact of uncertainty and ambiguity on risk
assessment and policy making, as well as initiating a transfer of knowledge from
fields such as mathematical finance where stochastic models are routinely
employed. Regarding stochastic games, the project studies models with mean field
interaction which, at least formally, correspond to games with a continuum of
players. It is expected that multiplicity of equilibria is related to coalitions
of agents, and a notion of stability may be useful to understand why certain
equilibria of mean field games are limits of N-player games but others are not.
The third project will continue recent work that aims to develop a robust
stochastic model for speculation among heterogeneous agents and investigate how
market regulations and the distribution of beliefs among market participants
influence prices and speculative trading in a bubble. The study of probability
densities for stochastic processes follows a novel approach based on optimal
control theory. It allows for remarkably general processes, including non-
Markovian ones, while being elementary in nature.
