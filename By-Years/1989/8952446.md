This project will support the purchase of computing equipment which will be
used to enhance a course in applied mathematics which emphasizes software for
mathematical experiments. It is being funded under the Instrumentation and
Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of improving the
quality of the undergraduate curriculum by supporting projects to develop new or
improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory and/or field courses in
science, mathematics, or engineering. In particular, the purposes of the course
which will be supported are (1) to encourage an experimental attitude towards
mathematics in the students, by using the computer as a laboratory for
strengthening intuitive insight, suggesting conjectures, and illuminating
theory, (2) to deepen the understanding of theoretical concepts and methods by
motivating students by what they learn experimentally, and (3) to make students
appreciate the relation between mathematical analysis and the
algorithmic/computational activities made possible by current advances in
computer technology.
