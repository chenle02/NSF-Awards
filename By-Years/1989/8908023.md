The goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the effects of amino acid
mutations on the fluctuation properties of T4 phage lysozyme (T4L) proximate to
the active site cleft. Dr. Hudson will focus on mutations of minimal
perturbation as regards size change, and will perform constrained molecular
dynamics calculations beginning with either an x-ray or a predicted crystal
structure. A component of the research plan involves using the extensive data
base of T4L mutant structures to further extend the ability to test structure
predictive techniques. The importance of particular networks of nonbonded
interactions in determining the overall dynamics of the region proximate to
tryptophan 138, the fluorescence probe in the experimental work, as well as that
of the active site itself will be probed. The complex decay of the fluorescence
of the single tryptophan of T4L mutant forms and other single tryptophan
proteins will be analyzed. The development of models will be guided by the
results of dynamics simulations. The juxtaposition of experiments and
calculations will establish the nature of large amplitude tryptophan dynamics on
the interior of a protein. The previous simulation work on T4 phage lysozyme to
include a realistic solvent environment will be extended. Finally free energy
perturbation methods will be applied to determine the free energy differences
for series of common structural/conformational changes observed in several room
temperature simulations of mutant T4L. This will provide an enthalpic/entropic
decomposition of the thermodynamic driving forces associated with the enhanced
fluctuations gating the transition. The nature of nonbonded interactions in
mutant proteins will be compared with the thermodynamic properties and
fluctuation correlation functions to glean general principles.
