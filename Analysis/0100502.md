Professor Shapiro will continue his long-term collaboration with Paul Bourdon on
problems arising from the interaction between the modern theory of linear
operators and the classical theory of analytic functions. Shapiro and Bourdon
will study problems involving norms, numerical ranges, decomposability, and
chaotic behavior for operators that occur naturally on spaces of analytic
functions, most notably composition operators and operators that commute with
backward shifts.



The theory of linear operators originates from mathematical physics, especially
from quantum mechanics, and has more recently found significant application in
control system theory. The numerical range is a convex subset of the plane that
has proven useful to engineers in determining the stability of control systems
associated with linear operators. The chaotic behaviour of dynamical systems has
recently become an important subject spanning mathematics, physics, engineering,
and biology. It has only recently been discovered that significant classes of
linear operators can give rise to chaotic systems, and this has led to
unexpected connections between operator theory and dynamical systems. The idea
of decomposability---the study of how to break a complicated linear system up
into simpler ones---has recently been shown to have surprising connections with
such chaotic behaviour. The research of Shapiro and Bourdon arises from, and has
contributed to, these developments: it is anticipated that the project outlined
in this proposal will further enhance our understanding of the connection
between dynamical systems and operator theory.
