Work in the structural theory of computation, especially nondeterminism,
probabilistic complexity, interactive proof systems, counting classes and
program verification is continued. Newly developed techniques of algebraic
structure of complexity classes and Gap-P counting functions to further
understanding of these areas are used. A theory of program verification to
enable an implementation of simple verification schemes is enhanced.
