An international workshop will be held on the major progress in the last decade
on the basic understanding of schemes especially for nonlinear problems in one
space dimension. This involves applications to many practical problems. However,
as the problems get more difficult, e.g. hypersonic flow, combustion, nonideal
gases, ect. there is an increasing need to extend the basic theory to these more
complicated phenomena. This workshop will summarize the achievements of the past
decade and the challenges of the next decade.
