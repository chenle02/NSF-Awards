Several recent reports converge on the need for a National Center for
Ecological Synthesis and Analysis. The PIs will run a workshop, sponsored
jointly by the Ecological Society of America and the Association of Ecosystem
Research Centers, to assess and summarize the ideas of ecologists about such a
center. The workshop is designed to sample a broad spectrum of ecologists
anddeliver a summary report to NSF in timely fashion. Major goals are to (1)
identify the kinds of questions that can only or best be addressed by such a
center, questions that are impossible or very difficult to solve under extant
mechanisms; and (2) identify and assess possible alternative administrative
structures for such a center.
