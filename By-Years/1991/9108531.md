The beam physics of soft vacuum generated electrons, the plasma chemistry of
hardening and dry development and electron- induce polymer changes will be
examined in a unified manner. Soft vacuum electron beam sources will be
characterized, fully accounting for modification of the beam energy spectrum by
the background gas. Both well known, electron-sensitive polymers and new
polymers will be processed using appropriate gaseous media that enhance polymer
surface chemistry and gasification reactions. The techniques promises to
increase the curing speed and pattern resolution of the semiconductor resist
patterns which are used in microelectronic processing. This may allow increased
circuit density. Applications in electronic and semiconductor manufacturing will
be explored with industrial collaborators.
