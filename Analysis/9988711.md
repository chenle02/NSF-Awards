In this proposal,the PI will concentrate on the study of "locally flat" sets,
the geometry of the measures that they support,and the connections with harmonic
measure.Also,the PI will study boundary value problems under minimal smoothness
conditions,and the existence and regularity of solutions to two-phase free boun
dar problems.The PI will also study non-linear evolution problems,focusing on
Liouville theorems for parabolic regularizations of conservation laws,and on the
connection between oscillatory integrals,restriction theorems for the Fourier
transform,and the well-posedness of solutions to non-linear dispersive equations
and systems.

The main guiding principle in the proposal is the development of various aspec
ts of harmonic analysis,potential theory and geometric measure theory,with a
view to applications to a number of challenging problems in linear and non-lin
ear partial differential equations,and the implementation of these applications.
It is expected that this research will lead to the development of new graduate
courses,to Phd dissertations,and to the sposoring of a number of postdoc's reas
erch.
