The Workshop on Early Child and Brain Development will be held in Bucharest,
Romania June&lt;br/&gt;12-15, 2002. The primary objective of the workshop is to
open a dialogue between Romanian&lt;br/&gt;researchers, academics and
practitioners and their American counterparts. The state of&lt;br/&gt;knowledge
in Romania on early child development and brain development has suffered as
a&lt;br/&gt;result of long communist rule, and has advanced slowly in the decade
since the fall of Nicolae&lt;br/&gt;Ceausescu. As such, the workshop will also
provide an introduction to the Romanian participants&lt;br/&gt;to state-of-the-
art knowledge in early child development and early brain development.
The&lt;br/&gt;Romanians and Americans participating in the workshop will be able
to work together to&lt;br/&gt;determine the specific information and resource
needs of the various fields represented by&lt;br/&gt;Romanian workshop
participants. Finally, the workshop will enable the American participants
to&lt;br/&gt;make connections with possible collaborators and/or likely
recipients for future&lt;br/&gt;academic/research support.
