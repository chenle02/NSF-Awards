This award supports the study of rocks of Jurassic age (Ferrar Group) which cap
the Gondwana sedimentary sequence in Antarctica and are interpreted to be a
manifestation of the thermal processes associated with supercontinent breakup.
Correlative magmatism is recorded in Australia and southern Africa. The age of
crystalization of all these igneous rocks is not well established because of the
difficulties in age determination of tholeiites and altered silicic rocks.
Recent work on feldspar separates suggests that at least the Ferrar lavas may be
older that currently accepted. The results will have implications for: (1)
petrogenesis of the Ferrar rocks; (2) age relations of Ferrar magmatic along the
Transantarctic Mountains; (3) temporal and spatial relations between magmatic
events across southern Africa-Antarctica-Australia associated with Gondwana
breakup; (4) the tectonic history of the Transantarctic Mountains.
