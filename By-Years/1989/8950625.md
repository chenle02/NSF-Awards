A modern transmission electron microscope (TEM) with TV imaging system will be
used to introduce biology and microbiology students to electron microscopic
methodology and provide them with hands-on experience in imaging cells and
tissues. New laboratory exercises will be introduced in courses in Cell Biology,
Developmental Biology, and Electron Microscopy. Students will also use the
instrument in undergraduate research projects. The university will provide 50%
matching funds.
