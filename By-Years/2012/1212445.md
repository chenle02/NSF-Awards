Quantum information science (QIS) is the interdisciplinary field that
investigates how to use systems obeying the laws of quantum mechanics to perform
information-processing tasks. This research project provides the core funding
for the Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC), based at the
University of New Mexico (UNM), with a major component of experimental research
at the University of Arizona (UA). CQuIC brings a quantum-information
perspective to physics-based research. In particular, research within CQuIC
applies the new ideas and techniques of QIS to the state-of-the-art laboratory
tasks of controlling the behavior of quantum systems, so these systems can be
engineered to do what scientists want them to do, instead of doing only what
comes naturally, and of making high-precision, quantum-limited measurements.

CQuIC specializes in the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows
for research careers in QIS. Students at UNM and UA are exposed to a full range
of courses and other activities, which provide an interdisciplinary integration
of information-theoretic and physics perspectives. CQuIC partners with six
external institutions: Sandia National Laboratories; Los Alamos National
Laboratory; the Joint Quantum Institute at the University of Maryland, the
Australian Centre for Engineered Quantum Systems, headquartered at the
University of Queensland; Caltech's Institute for Quantum Information and
Matter; and the Brazilian National Institute of Science and Technology for
Quantum Information. These partnerships provide a two-way flow of ideas and
people and thus expand the theoretical and experimental capabilities available
to CQuIC and the partnering institutions. CQuIC is the administrative home for
the Southwest Quantum Information and Technology (SQuInT) Network. A consortium
of 22 node institutions, including research universities, undergraduate
colleges, national and industrial laboratories, and international centers for
QIS, SQuInT promotes QIS research at and collaborations among its node
institutions.
