Lehigh Carbon Community College (LCCC) is providing scholarships each year
to&lt;br/&gt;approximately 36 to 50 academically talented, financially needy
full-time students enrolled in&lt;br/&gt;associate degree programs in the fields
of computer science, computer technology, engineering,&lt;br/&gt;engineering
technology, and mathematics. These CSEMS scholarships enable students, including
those from underrepresented groups, to reduce their dependence on loans to meet
their living expenses and decrease the number of hours they work, allowing them
more time to study and receive support services in very demanding disciplines.
The scholarships are also an incentive for part-time students to enroll full
time and for students in one-year certificate programs to change their major to
an associate degree program.&lt;br/&gt;
