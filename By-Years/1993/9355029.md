9355029 Sorooshian The University of Arizona's Department of Hydrology and Water
Resources will expand its research and teaching efforts to the target key area
of hydrology to augment current areas to include (Figure 1): o
hydroclimatology/hydrometeorology o environmental hydrology o water resources
engineering Accelerated degree programs, including Bachelor-to-Doctorate and
Master's thesis-alternative options, will support new research initiatives, as
well as retrain current professionals to bring them into the work force.
Multidisciplinary research will train a more diverse group of new scientists in
hydroclimatology, to investigate global climate change, its effect on regional
water resources, and ensuing political and social alterations, and in
hydrometeorology, to deal with surface-atmosphere interaction in a new and more
integrated manner. Environmental hydrology will integrate surface- and
subsurface-water study for better understanding of these interactions, as well
as contaminant transport phenomena and water chemistry processes. In this
respect, an accelerated option will provide an excellent retraining program for
degreed professionals currently unable to contribute to an environmentally-
focused world: petroleum engineers, exploration geologists, and other resource
scientists. Water resources engineering will prepare students for nonstructural
aspects of rebuilding the national water resources infrastructure and
improvement of water supply reliability and remediation activities through use
of more sophisticated technologies. ***
