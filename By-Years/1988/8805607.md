This research seeks to develop and calibrate new microelectronic temperature
measurement devices and test sections for basic heat transfer studies. Using
monolithic circuit technology, arrays of temperature sensors will be developed
to determine the temperature fields on the integrated heat source. The devices
to be investigated will include thin and thick film (metallic) resistors,
diffused resistors, diodes, bipolar transistors, junction field-effect
transistors, and metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors. Bipolar and
MOS analog circuit techniques and signal conditioning circuitry will be
explored. Traditional large scale thermometers such as thermocouples can
interfere with the thermal field being investigated. In addition, the
underlining microscale phenomena cannot be quantified. This research program
will develop the sensors to measure the temperature on the scale of a few
micrometers. Since the associated boundary conditions become very important at
these scales, the research will also investigate the integration of these
temperature sensors with heat sources.
