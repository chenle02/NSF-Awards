This project provides 15 scholarships per year for academically talented,
financially needy students in Computing and Mathematics. It also provides
student support structures, student research, departmental tutoring resources,
and specific student support services that ensure the maximum likelihood of
success for all CSEMS scholars. The program materials and dedicated web site
provides current information on graduate study, internships, Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), and careers. Faculty and administrators
across Stetson actively support the goals and outcomes of this project.

Intellectual merit: the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science has a
strong record of graduating qualified individuals who go on to reputable
graduate schools or industry. All programs in the College require a yearlong
senior research project, selected by the student and completed under the
direction of a member of the faculty.

Broader impact: Stetson's College of Arts and Sciences has prepared students for
informed, compassionate, and engaged lives. The required curriculum in liberal
studies develops breadth of understanding and serious engagement with principles
of ethical decision-making.
