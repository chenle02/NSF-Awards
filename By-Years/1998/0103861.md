The PI proposes to carry out experimental and numerical investigations of flow
instabilities induced by cavitation as often found in hydraulic machinery, and
in flows around hydrofoils and propellers. Attention will be paid in the
following four ares: (1) the formation of cloud cavitation and its effect on the
wake structure of hydrofoils, (2) detailed study of erosion mechanisms caused by
the collapse of such cavities, (3) comparative study of the acoustics of cloud
and bubble cavitation, and (4) analysis of the periodic oscillations of the
reentrant jet and their scaling. Experiments and numerical simulations will be
carried out in an interactive manner to enhance the progress in both endeavors.
