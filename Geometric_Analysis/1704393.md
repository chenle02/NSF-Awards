Abstract

Award: DMS 1406337, Principal Investigator: Xin Zhou

The physical description of a soap film spanning a wire boundary leads to an
important class of surfaces in geometry, called "minimal surface", because the
energy-minimization condition that the soap film satisfies corresponds to a
surface of least area, at least among nearby surfaces. Also as intrinsic
geometric objects of the underlying space, minimal surfaces can be viewed as
non-linear analog of the eigenstates in Quantum Mechanics. The mathematical
problem that amounts to showing that every bounding wire is spanned by at least
one soap film has been studied in detail for many years and admits many
important generalizations. Most of the previous techniques for proving such
existence properties focused on the "minimizing theory", which corresponds to
finding the ground state in Quantum Mechanics. One natural but very difficult
technique, called the "min-max theory", corresponding to finding the excited
states in Quantum Mechanics (i.e. the eigenstates with energy higher than the
ground state), has had striking recent successes, and will be one of the major
objects of study in this research program. Another project will study geometric
inequalities in general relativity, particularly aiming to understand the mass
angular momentum inequalities for axisymmetric initial data sets which model
rotating galaxies in astrophysics.

More specifically, the principal investigator will study the min-max theory for
minimal surfaces via both the geometric measure theory approach and the harmonic
map approach. Concerning the geometric measure theory approach, some of the
aspects of the min-max theory to be studied in this research program include
extensions of the PI's index bound theorem beyond positive Ricci curvature
conditions, as well as versions of the Almgren-Pitts min-max theory for more
general ambient spaces, including manifolds with boundary and smooth metric
measure spaces (where the Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor plays a role). Certain
geometric problems related to the Min-max theory will be studied, such as
Hersch-type estimates for higher-dimensional minimal hypersurfaces with bounded
Morse index. Concerning the min-max theory via harmonic maps, the PI intends to
study the issue of Morse index and branch points of the min-max minimal surfaces
constructed by Colding-Minicozzi and himself, and the corresponding free
boundary problem.
