The objective of this research by Professor John E. Bercaw at the California
Institute of Technology, which is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Oganometallic Chemistry Program, is to develop new, highly reactive enantiopure
precatalysts that show improved selectivity and substrate generality for chiral
alpha-olefins. Due to their extreme activities in polymerizing alpha-olefins,
optically active ansa-zirconocene polymerization catalysts are excellent
prospects for effecting kinetic resolutions, preferentially polymerizing one
enantiomer of a chiral olefin and leaving behind the less reactive enantiomer.
This not only resolves the two enantiomers, but also leads to a new class of
optically active polymers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New catalysts will be developed
to resolve right- and left handed molecules, which is essential for synthesizing
chiral molecules such as pharmaceuticals. By using a polymerization catalyst,
one type of "handed" molecule is incorporated into a new type of "handed"
polymer.&lt;br/&gt;
