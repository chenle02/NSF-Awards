This project is devoted to a mathematical study of some nonlinear partial
differential equations (PDE) arising from physical and biological sciences. The
principal investigator plans to address a singular activator-inhibitor system
modeling the regeneration phenomena in biology. The project seeks to understand
the mechanism of pattern formation, so the long-time behavior, stability, and
bifurcation of the solutions will be analyzed. The principal investigator will
also study various free boundary problems with applications to thin film
dynamics, liquid crystal configurations, and crystal solidification processes.
Here the focus is on the structure and dynamics of the singular set and the
existence, uniqueness, and regularity of the free boundaries involved. Due to
the inherent singularity and nonlinearity of the problems, it is necessary to
use analytical tools from nonlinear elliptic and parabolic PDE theory, harmonic
analysis, the calculus of variation, geometric measure theory, and geometric
analysis.

Partial differential equations have been broadly used to model a wide variety of
phenomena in physics, biology, chemistry, and finance. Many mathematically
challenging problems arise when the equations involve singularities. Examples of
singularities include dry spots of thin films, sharp corners in liquid/solid
interfaces, and unbounded physical quantities. This project will develop novel
ideas and methods to study singularities in the relevant nonlinear partial
differential equations and hence yield new understanding of the underlying
physical and biological processes. The project will also have an impact on the
development of human resources: it will supply teaching materials in graduate
courses and provide advanced training for undergraduate and graduate students,
thereby allowing them to participate in various aspects of the project.
