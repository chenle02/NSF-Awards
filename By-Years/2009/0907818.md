This proposal focuses on dynamical bifurcation phenomena for which it is
necessary to use a combination of theoretical and rigorous computational methods
in order to study the global attractor structure for complicated systems. The
investigators consider specific phenomena which are not robust under
approximation, such as the occurrence of an infinite number of bifurcations, or
solutions for systems of partial differential equations converging to one point
in phase space as an associated parameter increases. Specifically, the proposal
addresses the appearance of period-doubling cascades in bifurcation diagrams as
well as the occurrence of equilibrium clusters in extended systems, and aims at
the development of rigorous computational tools for establishing heteroclinic
connections. The developed methodology will be applied to the study of
transitional states in Cahn-Morral systems for phase separation in
multicomponent alloys, and the study of complicated transition patterns in the
Ohta Kawasaki diblock copolymer model. The methods developed for these examples
are of general interest. They will serve as prototypes for solving similar
intractable computational problems. In addition, the numerical tools developed
for rigorous computation are general purpose and widely applicable.

This work is focused at the boundary between theory and computation, such that
each method fails individually, but theory and computation together yield
successful results. Several of the examples focus on answering specific
questions in materials science, including models for soft materials in synthetic
chemistry such as block copolymers used as additive in adhesives, and phase
separation for binary and multicomponent metal alloys. The research enables the
better understanding and development of new materials. One of the studied models
is immediately relevant in atmospheric science, as it is used to study the
creation of raindrops within a cloud. In the longer term, there will be
additional applications of these methods to a variety of pattern formation
problems arising in chemistry and biology. Students will be incorporated into
this project from within an already existing research group of undergraduate and
graduate students. Both investigators are committed to recruiting students who
are women and members of underrepresented minorities.
