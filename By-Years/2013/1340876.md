This award will support student travel to the ninth ACM/IEEE Symposium on
Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS), which will be
held in in October in San Jose, California. ANCS is a top conference in the
fields of computer architecture and networking. The funds will help support U.S.
students, focusing on Ph.D. students at an advanced stage in their program and
students who would otherwise not be able to attend ANCS. Supporting student
travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important
mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include training the next generation of
researchers in this important research area.
