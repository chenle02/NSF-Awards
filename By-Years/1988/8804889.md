The "Research Experiences for Undergraduates" program provides support to give
undergraduate students an opportunity to be directly involve in hands-on
scientific research. At Utah State University such a program exists where up to
12 students receive scholarships to design and build experiments that are later
flown on space shuttle missions in self contained canisters called "get-away-
special" canisters. With support from this grant the program is being broadened
to include packages to be flown on balloons, and other atmospheric science and
space science experiments. The USU REU program is becoming a valuable regional
resource to give undergraduates a unique involvement in research, and has a good
prospect for encouraging talented young people to adopt a career in scientific
research.
