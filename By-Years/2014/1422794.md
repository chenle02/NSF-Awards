Many networking protocols have been designed without security in mind, and many
cryptographic schemes have been designed without practical deployments in mind.
Moreover, most of security-enhanced communication protocols still lack the
provable-security treatment and hence the security guarantees. This project aims
at bridging the gap between protocol design, implementation, deployment, and
security guarantees by developing a novel general security framework that
facilitates the provable-security analyses of practical networking protocols.

The project has an interdisciplinary approach as it combines concepts from
applied cryptography and algorithms with implementation and empirical analyses
to provide a unifying framework for studying and developing secure communication
protocols. This joint design effort yields both new cryptographic foundations
and fundamentally secure networking protocols.
