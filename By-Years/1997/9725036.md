EEC-9725036 Pamela A. Eibeck Northern Arizona University "Integrating Practice
into Advanced Engineering Education" ABSTRACT This award provides funding for a
practice-oriented Master of Engineering degree to be developed, coordinated, and
implemented among three Arizona state-supported universities: Northern Arizona
University, Arizona State University, and the University of Arizona. This
graduate program is a shift from a "university-centered" research-oriented
graduate education to a "student-centered" program in which practicing engineers
define individualized programs of advanced study, choosing among course
materials at any of the three state universities and obtain instruction,
delivered via multiple delivery modes, as one-credit hour modules. This award
will develop 36 one-credit hour modules of instruction and support dissemination
of project outcomes through conference presentations and a workshop to be held
at Northern Arizona University. The participating universities will contribute
instructional technology equipment and market analysis; industry will contribute
employee time for collaborative activities, including course development and
instruction.
