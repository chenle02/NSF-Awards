Cell surface interaction during the early phase of nerve-muscle contact is of
crucial importance to the development of the neuromuscular synapse. This
research will center around the molecular mechanisms underlying two early events
during the initial nerve-muscle contact, namely, the contact-dependent induction
of acetylcholine release from the embryonic Xenopus spinal neuron and the
development of nerve-muscle adhesion. It will be determined whether muscle
surface acetylcholine receptors and other cell surface components are involved
in these two events. It will also be determined whether there is specificity for
nerve-muscle interaction among subpopulations of spinal neurons and myotomal
muscle cells that depends upon the axial position or the lineage of the cells in
the embryo. Finally, the study will focus on what effect the interfering of
these two early events will have upon the structural and functional development
of the synapse. Results from these studies will help us to understand the
cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the development of specific
neuronal connections.
