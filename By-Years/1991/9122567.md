Research has found that auditors exhibit recency effects in revising initial
beliefs or hypotheses. This project will investigate factors which may moderate
auditors' susceptibility to order effects. Research has also found that auditors
are predisposed to focus on negative evidence as compared to positive evidence.
These two effects may interact. This project will test the Belief Adjustment
Model of Hogarth and Einhorn as a basis for predictions about how recency
effects can be eliminated or mitigated in settings in which auditors are highly
sensitive to negative information. The study should provide insight regarding
the prevalence of order effects among professionals exposed to unique decision
environments who may respond to risks in the decision setting by using adaptive
belief revision strategies to moderate the recency effects found in earlier
research. The results could then be used to develop procedures for improving the
quality of the decision process.
