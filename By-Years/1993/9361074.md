9361074 McAllister The objective of the project is to show the feasibility of a
totally new antigen-antibody sensing technology, acoustic emission chemistry,
that requires no initial sample or sensor preparation. Many biochemical dynamic
systems are acoustically active with some of the energy released as an acoustic
wave. It is hypothesized that such chemical reactions propagate an acoustic
emission spectra during the antigen-antibody reaction. The proposed
investigation would attempt to prove the hypothesis by determining a frequency
spectrum, amplitude and time duration of the acoustic emission signals from
antigen-antibody reaction as a function of reactive antigen-antibody
concentration for the given experimental condition. ***
