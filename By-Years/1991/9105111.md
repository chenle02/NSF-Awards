The long-term goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms that control
cellular polarity during the eukaryotic cell cycle. The PI used the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to study this process because it
displays two different aspects of cellular polarity and is a relatively simple
eukaryote that can be easily manipulated both physiologically and genetically
using both classical and molecular genetic techniques (9). The goal of this
research is to characterize the biochemical functions of the S.cerevisiae CDC42
(CDC42Sc) gene product, a putative GTP-binding protein. The PI will purify wild-
type and mutant Cdc42Sc proteins and investigate (i) their capability to bind
and hydrolyze GTP and (ii) their potential phosphorylation states. He will also
isolate and characterize new proteins that interact with the Cdc42Sc protein.
The existence of a human homolog of CDC42Sc, which he and others have shown to
function in yeast (78,112) and to be an excellent in vitro phosphosubstrate for
the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase (44), suggests that
the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of cellular polarity could be
conserved between yeasts and higher eukaryotes. Correlation of information
obtained in S. cerevisiae to that from higher eukaryotes could provide valuable
clues to the nature and function of low-molecular-weight GTP-binding proteins
and to the intracellular signal-transduction mechanisms that control cellular
polarity.
