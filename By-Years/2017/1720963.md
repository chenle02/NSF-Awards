The Women and Mathematics Program (WAM) at the Institute for Advanced Study is
an annual program with the mission to recruit and retain more women in
mathematics. WAM aims to counter the initial imbalance in the numbers of men and
women entering mathematics training as well as the higher attrition rate of
female mathematicians compared to their male counterparts at every critical
transition stage in mathematical careers. WAM encourages female mathematicians
to form collaborative research relationships and to become active in a vertical
mentoring network spanning a continuum from undergraduates to emerita
professors, which provides support and reduces the sense of isolation
experienced by many women in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is
organized around a mathematical topic of current research interest. The
scientific program is comprised of lecture &lt;br/&gt;series accompanied by
daily problem sessions designed to offer top quality instruction and research
experience; research seminars by post-doctorates and advanced graduate students;
and colloquia by prominent women mathematicians. In addition, evening Women in
Science seminars explore wide ranging topics of concern to women mathematicians.
Since 1994, both the scientific and mentoring aspects of WAM have had a lasting
impact on over 1000 women mathematicians. In bringing WAM into its third decade,
the following are seen as the key new aims in broadening the reach and longevity
of the program and its effects on the national STEM community: expand the
footprint of WAM so that more women benefit from both mathematical and mentoring
aspects of the program; increase visibility of women mathematicians to both the
mathematics community and the society at large; spread effective paradigms
developed at WAM to the wider mathematical community; facilitate opportunities
for women mathematicians in both research mathematics and careers outside
academia.
