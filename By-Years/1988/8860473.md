The research described in this proposal will test the feasibility of expressing
the antibacterial protein cecropin in plant cells. The gene will be synthesized,
and then the peptide produced in E. coli. This protein will be used in antibody
preparation and in lethality tests against bacterial plant pathogens. The
cecropin gene will then be engineered for expression in plant cells, and
introduced into tomato leaf disc cells by Agrobacterium transformation.
Transformed callus tissue and transformed plants will be evaluated for the
expression of cecropin protein. The research has the potential of enabling the
production of vegetable crops with resistance to post-harvest disease.
