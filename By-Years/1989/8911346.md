In 1863, US Secretary of Agriculture Isaac Newton wrote that "It should be the
aim of every young farmer . . . to make two blades of grass grow where but one
grew before." From 1863 to 1940, increases in agricultural production were due
largely to increases in the acreage cultivated and partially to enhanced
production per acre. Since 1940, however, a "green revolution" has occurred in
which, through scientific plant breeding methods, production per acre has
increased not just two fold as Newton aimed for but four fold so that "four
blades of grass grow where but one grew before." Dr. Perkins is continuing his
examination of this green revolution and the impact it has had on human social
life: globally, we are becoming a species that lives primarily in urban areas
with only a minority of people left in production agriculture in the rural
areas. This transformation is essentially complete in industrialized countries
and is still underway in less industrialized nations. As a science, plant
breeding has been fundamentally dependent conceptually upon the genetic theories
first proposed by Mendel. In order to function productively, plant breeders were
dependent upon insights from statisticians, plant physiologists, soil
scientists, plant pathologists, agricultural engineers, and food technologists.
Most breeders found their institutional homes in government and university
laboratories, but some worked for private companies. Issues of war and national
security shaped the political economic context in which plant breeders worked.
Events in World War I set the stage for the growth of plant breeding as a
national asset. World War II, the demise of colonial empires, and the cold war
provided enormous boost to plant breeding as nations sought increased security
through enhanced food production. It is now impossible to understand the
treatment of plant breeding by political institutions without discussing the
strategic implications of the science. Dr. Perkins is examining all these issues
in the context of a comparative study of the complexities of the agricultural
industry, especially wheat breeding, in Britain,India and the United States. The
research is being carried out through examination of primary archival sources,
oral interviews and search of the published literature.
