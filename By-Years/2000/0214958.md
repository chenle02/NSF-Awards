This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project is aimed towards
the development of comprehensive engineering equipment capable of measuring
droplet sizes, velocities and temperature simultaneously in a manufacturing
environment. The innovation of the project is multifold, as the proposed
equipment will be capable of measuring diameter sizes, velocities, and
temperatures simultaneously using a novel concept referred as Laser Induced
Fluorescence Thermometry (LIFT). Under LIFT molecules are excited in the
electronic levels by a light source emitting a secondary emission (excited
state) that is sensitive to temperature. The commercial application will
initially be in the powder production industry and the ink-jet industry. These
industries require the full characterization of in-flight droplets.
