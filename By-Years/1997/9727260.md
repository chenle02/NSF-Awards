ABSTRACT EEC-9727260 RINGO This Research Opportunity Award (ROA) funds a two
year project for a researcher from Gonzaga University (RUI/PUI) to work with the
University of Washington research site of the Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Design of Analog/Digital Integrated Circuits located at
Washington State University. The project is entitled, "Modeling Thermal and
Electro-thermal Behavior Integrated Circuit Devices." The study will address
numerically solving the heat transfer problem for a "generic" integrated circuit
investigating the effects of the geometry, material properties, and
boundary/initial conditions on the temperature response.
