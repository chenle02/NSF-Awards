Recently, significant temporal variations in local earthquake coda decay rate
(coda Q-1) have been observed associated with (1) the long-term migration of
seismicity in China, (2) the Round Valley earthquake of 1984, (3) the North Palm
Springs earthquake of 1986, (4) the Misasa earthquake of 1983 and (5) an
eruption of Mt. St. Helens. Some of these variations have different patterns
depending on the frequency of coda waves and the depth of earthquakes. The
understanding of these phenomena is urgently needed because of their potential
use as a much wanted reliable precursor for intermediate-term earthquake
prediction. In order to promote the understanding, we propose to: (1) Continue
work on systematic determination of spatial variation in coda Q using the USGS
Central California network and the USGS/Caltech/USC southern California network.
(2) Perform case studies of temporal variation in coda Q in California, such as
the San Jacinto fault zone, where focal depths range from 0 to 20 km (similar to
the North Palm Springs area).
