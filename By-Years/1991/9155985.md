A new course titled Consequences of a Chemical World is being offered to both
science and non-science majors in their freshman year in the university. Novel
and innovative aspects of this course include an assumption that a course on
chemicals in the environment does not depend on a pre-existing base of chemical
facts, and is best introduced at the start of a university curriculum, a belief
that laboratories associated with the course should be completed outside of the
university itself, in the arenas in which the real business of environmental
assessment, monitoring, and regulation is achieved, that continued involvement
of the students in environmental issues, and magnification of the impact of the
course, can be accomplished through presentations by the students of selected
aspects and topics of the course to others in local school and community forums.
The course is divided into parts so that sub-sections, or even individual
lectures and demonstrations, can be repeated in other universities, in high
schools, and in community meetings.
