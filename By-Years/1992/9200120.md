A Research Experiences for Undergraduates site will be established through this
award to support six undergraduate researchers engaged in mathematical research
in the area of computer algebra. The focus of the work will be on the
description of surface intersections and the relationship of Grobner bases to
the development of effective algorithms to solve algebraic and geometric
problems. Symbolic computation will play a major role in the advancement of this
research. The location of the project, the Institute for Computational Sciences
and Informatics is ideally suited for this undertaking. Students will be
encouraged to report on their findings at regional meetings of the professional
societies.
