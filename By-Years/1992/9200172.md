The goal of this project in Structural and Geotechnical Engineering at the
University of Maine is to encourage more outstanding undergraduates to pursue
research careers. The key aspects include: 1) a successful recruitment program;
2) careful matching of student interests with available research projects; 3) an
effective management structure; 4) research assignments the students can quickly
grasp and complete in the time frame; and 5) follow-up procedures designed to
maintain student interest in research. The four research projects involve finite
element analysis, state-of-the-art soils testing, scale modeling, structural
testing, and soil-structure interaction. Two students will be involved in each
project to allow for student interaction. Interaction will also be fostered by
group seminars and meetings. Extended funding for this site allows the school to
continue its long standing commitment to undergraduate research.
