9502086 Appelquist The 1995 Aspen Winter Conference will devote one week to
condensed matter physics. The focus will be on the physics of reduced
dimensionality systems. The conference will be interdisciplinary, and will bring
together leading scientists from academia and industry to critically assess the
current level knowledge and what remains to be learned in the future. NSF
support will provide financial assistance to graduate students and young
scientists. % % % The 1995 Aspen Winter Conference will devote one week to
