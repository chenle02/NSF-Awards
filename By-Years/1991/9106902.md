The PI has recently published the "Global Ocean Surface Temperature Atlas"
(GOSTA) in conjunction with colleagues in the U.K. Met. Office, which includes a
compilation of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies from January 1856 to
December 1989 (where available). He proposes to check the corrections applied to
bucket temperatures before 1940, with help from the Woods Hole Sea Educational
Association Students who presently have buckets from the Met Office Museum at
sea. This will help to estimate potential errors when the data set is used to
estimate long term temperature changes. GOSTA data will be used together with
surface energy fluxes from the Consolidated Ocean Atmosphere Data Set (COADS)
and microwave sounding unit (MSU) data on free air temperature to study the
mechanisms of sea-air interaction and climatic fluctuations. Example of such
studies include: the space-time structure of sea surface temperature fields, air
temperature fields and surface flux fields; the correlations between these
fields and between the fields and regional SST values; the association between
latent heat flux variations and air temperature changes; estimation of the
fraction of variance of marine air temperature changes attributable to
atmospheric turbidity changes, Southern Oscillation Index changes and other
changes involving atmospheric circulations; the relative importance of
cloudiness changes, wind speed changes, sensible heat loss and latent heat loss
in procuring SST anomalies. The research is important because it should add to
our understanding of climate processes important to climate change and to our
information base required to detect climate change.
