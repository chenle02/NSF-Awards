The Balansieae are widespread fungal associates of grass plants. All grass
communities are likely to contain at least some individuals that are infected by
members of the Balansieae group, and many communities in North America are
composed of predominantly Balansieae-infected plants. Some of these fungi have
been shown to enhance insect resistance, drought tolerance, and in some cases
vegetative growth of host plants. Endophytic Balansieae are now routinely
employed in turfgrass breeding programs to improve hardiness of commercial
varieties and reduce turf requirements for water and pesticides. Balansieae also
have major impacts on the livestock industry worldwide. Toxic syndromes
affecting cattle grazed on endophyte-infected tall fescue frequently occur in
the United States, while sheep grazed on endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass
experience toxic syndromes in New Zealand. %%% Taxonomic knowledge of the
ascomycetous fungi grouped in Balansieae is rudimentary, and classification
schemes are based upon very few and potentially unreliable morphological
features. Representative samples of species of the genera Balansia and Epichloe
are being collected from North and South America, in order to determine more
reliable morphological markers of the species and to correlate these with mating
patterns in the laboratory. Reproductive compatibility groups, where correlated
with morphological features, provide the basis for discriminating species. These
basic taxonomic studies will prepare for future determination of phylogenetic
relationships among the fungal taxa and the analysis of possible coevolution
with host grasses.
