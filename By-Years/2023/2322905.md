The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of an advanced
electromechanical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt system for the treatment and
monitoring of hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is caused by an accumulation of CSF
occurs within the brain, often causing an increased pressure inside the skull.
Most shunts used to remove this pressure fail within a few years of placement,
often with significant diagnostic uncertainty, which leads to both poorer
patient outcomes and higher, often multi-billion dollar healthcare costs. The
development of a smart shunt that more appropriately drains CSF and monitors
function may reduce shunt failure rates and diagnostic uncertainty, thus
reducing healthcare costs and improving patient outcomes.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances the
development of a smart shunt for CSF drainage. Electronic-based control may
improve shortcomings in shunt drainage as the currently used valves are
vulnerable to gravity, altitude, activity level, and abdominal pressure
fluctuations. The proposed multi-system technology is designed to (1) measure
intercranial pressure (ICP) to determine when shunts require drainage, and (2)
accurately and intelligently perceives the difference between transient pressure
spikes vs. sustained, elevated ICP and respond appropriately (e.g., remain
closed vs. drain CSF, respectively). The new technology will further allow
patient and physician interaction to obtain on-demand ICP readings, monitor CSF
dynamics, and non-invasively adjust valve settings. In this Phase II project,
final development testing will be conducted, system performance and safety will
be verified, and physician and patient usability will be analyzed.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
