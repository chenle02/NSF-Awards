This research is focused on several existing models of the dynamics of colliding
rigid bodies. Although recent work has revealed energy inconsistencies in the
classical Newton-Whittaker method, there is insufficient experimental supporting
evidence of the behaviors implicit in the model structures. To test some of the
more recent approaches a series of laboratory experiments involving load cells,
kinematic chains and a high-speed camera processor will be carried out. The data
set will include normal force at collision point, coefficients of friction,
coefficient of restitution as well as pre and post-impact velocities. Analysis
of the experimental results and the several existing models will serve to
advance our understanding of two and three dimensional impact dynamics.*** //
