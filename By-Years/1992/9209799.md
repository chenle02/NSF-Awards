This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
the University of California - Irvine. The student will study the Asian-American
community in three places in Alaska -- Anchorage, Kodiak and Nome. The project
gathers demographic information and studies migration patterns, employment and
occupations, and cultural retention and changes, and interracial ad inter-ethnic
interactions. It will use multiple methods including respondent interviews,
participant observation, survey questionnaires and key informant protocols. This
research is important because inter-ethnic and inter-racial strife is a major
fact of life in many areas. This case study of how a complex Asian community
fits into a complex Alaskan social setting can help us understand general
principles of community conflict and adaptation.
