The San Antonio Urban Systemic
Program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The San Antonio Urban
Systemic Program (SAUSP) plans to promote full implementation of K-12 standards-
based, inquiry-centered curricula in a coalition of nine school districts
through the organization of elementary, middle, and high schools in K-12 school-
feeder patterns served by teams of coaches. In order to increase the competency
of the instructional workforce to accomplish this goal, San Antonio plans to
implement a comprehensive professional development program in close
collaboration with local institutions of higher education. A Citywide Monitoring
System will provide for evaluation of student understanding of mathematics and
science. This system will include a set of performance tasks to evaluate
instructional practices and curriculum implementation, a web-based curriculum
network to support excellence in instruction providing high-quality assessments
and examples of standards-based instruction, and the use of district-based
equity teams to specifically address the achievement gaps between ethnic and
socioeconomic groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consistent with this end,
participating districts have proposed the development of a new assessment system
that is fully congruent and supportive of effective implementation of standards-
based curricula. Furthermore, in order to secure a permanent coordination of a
community coalition comprised of K-12 educators, business and community members,
and the university sector, the SAUSP will establish a K-16 Implementation Team.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A comprehensive evaluation plan will enable the leadership
to assess progress in every component of the Initiative; gather, interpret and
use data to inform the planning and decision-making
process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
