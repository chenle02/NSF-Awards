This project is a study of the effects of basement topo- graphy, rock creep,
lithology and thermal structure on the development of thin-skinned mountain
belts. Data from the com- pressional belts of Pakistan will be used to model
these parameters. The belt is active, and many of the geodynamic modeling
constraints are available. The work will involve refinement of existing
analytical theories of thin-skinned mechanics, scale models and extensive
application of finite element modeling to explore relations between complex
geometries and rheologies in the development of mountain belts. Results should
be applicable to many compressional orogens, particularly those involving salt
detachments.
