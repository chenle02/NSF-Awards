9413547 Plank This award provides 47 per cent of the funding required for the
acquisition and installation of an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer
(ICP-MS) system to be installed and operated in the Department of Geology at the
University of Kansas. The University of Kansas is committed to providing the
remaining funds necessary to complete the project. The ICP-MS will be operated
as a multi-user facility dedicated to trace element and isotopic analysis in a
variety of geological materials for research and teaching purposes. The
instrument is uniquely capable of measuring a large number of elements in the
periodic table with high precision, high sensitivity, and rapid throughput. The
University of Kansas and regional users' applications of ICP- MS will include
research in groundwater flow, water-rock interactions in aquifers, mantle
melting, rock-fluid partitioning, carbonate diagenesis, and the study of fluid
inclusions. ***
