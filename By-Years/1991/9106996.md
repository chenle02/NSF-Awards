The objective of this workshop is to provide a forum for the exchange of views
and information, to assess the state of the art, and to identify research issues
and needs in the area of soil bioengineering systems. Predictive models
accounting for the reinforcing/stabilizing role of roots and other natural
fibrous inclusions in the ground, durability and long term stability,
conjunctive use of vegetation and synthetic textiles, cost effectiveness
comparisons with conventional systems will be discussed by leading soil
bioengineering practitioners and experts.
