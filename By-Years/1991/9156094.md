This proposal seeks funding for a week-long, faculty workshop, LABSHOP, for 36
participants, to develop laboratory exercises suitable for introductory,
multiple-section biology courses that promote an active student involvement via
a problem- solving or SAAW0K-type approach. The problem-solving instructional
approach, best employed in the laboratory classroom, can provide a more self-
directed, investigative, learning environment that can help solve the science
education problem. LABSHOP will bring together an interdisciplinary group of
participants to work in teams on selected topics. The final products of LABSHOP
will be a variety of student-ready, laboratory exercises that employ a
problem/solving/investigative instructional approach. To encourage a continuing
dialogue among LABSH0P participants, to explore new approaches and teaching
techniques, to encourage communication among biologists concerned with the
quality of introductory laboratory instruction, to disseminate the LABSHOP
products, and to promote innovation among an even larger, interdisciplinary
group of biologists, a free, computer bulletin board, BIOLAB, will be
established by this project.
