In this project, we are taking advantage of the superior optical and chemical
properties of tellurite glasses to produce microstructured fibers using
extrusion. Extrusion is a very versatile technique for the fabrication of fibers
composed of soft glasses, i.e. with low melting temperatures. It will facilitate
a relatively easy exploration of several different optical microstructure design
simply by changing the die. The nonlinear optical properties of several new
optical microstructures (nonlinear index, stimulated Raman scattering and Four
Wave Mixing) will be characterized. The outcome of the work will be the
determination of the key features that provide a tight confinement of the light,
(for highest optical densities and higher nonlinearities) and a flat dispersion
(necessary for phase matching in nonlinear optical processes).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we are exploring a new method to
fabricate novel optical fibers with extrusion. Because of their microstructure,
these fibers possess unique (nonlinear) optical properties that can be used in
applications ranging from medical imaging to optical communications. Extrusion
is a well known technique for the forming of metals which will be applied to
soft glasses for the fabrication of these novel fibers.
