In order to address the low achievement of some special education students, the
goal of the proposed project is to disseminate the findings of the Accessible
Mathematics project by producing professional development materials to help
teachers improve the quality of mathematics teaching and learning in inclusive
classrooms. The audience for these materials will be general education teachers,
their special education colleagues and pre-service teacher candidates. The
materials developed by the proposed project will illustrate and
describe&lt;br/&gt;aspects of inclusive mathematics classrooms that help
students with disabilities succeed. They will be flexibly designed as three 2-3
hour workshop modules. They will not be designed to provide simple answers, but
to allow teachers to carefully consider the issues of inclusion. The module
topics will be: 1) Organizing the Classroom and Instruction to Build Community,
2) Linking Assessment and Teaching, and 3) Making Mathematics Explicit. The
videotapes, featuring teachers from Accessible Mathematics, will offer images of
practices and will be focused on differentiating mathematics instruction. The
written materials, some&lt;br/&gt;authored by teachers and others by TERC staff,
including guidelines for workshop use, will help&lt;br/&gt;teachers reflect on
their practice, offering them examples of successful strategies and
approaches.&lt;br/&gt;
