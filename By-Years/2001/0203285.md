PROPOSAL NUMBER: 0203285 TITLE: Testing UML Designs PI: Robert France

The proposed research is concerned with developing mechanisms that support the
generation of design-level test cases from UML design models. The generated test
cases are intended to be used in UML design reviews and inspections as a means
for evaluating UML models and identifying errors in software designs.

Developing a UML design testing approach and test generation support requires
addressing the following issues: (1) Providing an analyzable representation of
UML models and test artifacts, and (2) providing a flexible test generation
mechanism. To address these issues the proposed research effort is structured
into the following research activities:

(1) Deriving test objectives from test-oriented formalizations of Class and
Collaboration Diagrams.

(2) Defining strategies for creating test objectives. These strategies will be
expressed in terms of model coverage goals.

(3) Providing techniques that can be partially automated for systematically
generating test cases from test objectives.

(4) Assessing the effectiveness of the design testing technique developed in
this research.

This research will produce results that can be used to develop industrial-
strength techniques and tools for evaluating UML designs. The results produced
by this research will also deepen understanding of how OO designs can be
formally interpreted and evaluated.
