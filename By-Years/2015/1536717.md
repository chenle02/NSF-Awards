Medical treatment for diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis C, and
cancer often requires the administration of doses in multiple sessions. Higher
doses achieve better disease-control but have a higher risk of side effects.
Lower doses have lesser side effects but may lead to inadequate disease-control.
Since each patient's response to treatment is uncertain, the need to effectively
balance this trade-off pervades all of medicine. Consequently, within the field
of personalized medicine, there has been a recent surge of interest in the idea
of response-guided dosing. The goal is to administer the right dose to the right
patient at the right time, based on the observed evolution of each patient's
disease condition. To attain this goal, it is crucial to better-learn patients'
dose- response as treatment progresses. Expert panels and government regulatory
bodies have therefore called for analytical tools to facilitate such learning-
while-doing. The research objective of this award is to develop a mathematically
rigorous, theoretical and computational framework for optimal dose-response
learning while treating a cohort of patients in clinical trials for response-
guided dosing. Millions of patients in the U.S. suffer from diseases that
require multiple-session treatments. Thus, if successful, the mathematical
framework in this award has the potential for a considerable societal impact.

More specifically, this project plans to use Bayesian stochastic dynamic
programming formulations and approximate solution methods rooted in convex
programming to facilitate response-learning and dosing decisions. The state in
these models equals the cohort's disease conditions and decisions equal the
doses administered. Disutility functions model the cohort's aversion to doses
and to the disease conditions reached at the end of the trial. The decision-
maker's prior belief is assumed to be conjugate to the dose-response parameter's
distribution. The information state thus equals the prior's hyperparameters and
updates via a simple formula. The decision-make's goal is to minimize the total
expected disutility of the doses administered and of the disease conditions
reached. Exact solution of this formulation is computationally intractable. Two
approximate control schemes called semi-stochastic certainty equivalent control
and certainty equivalent control are therefore planned. Structural properties
such as monotonicity, stationarity, and separability of the resulting dosing
policies will be analyzed and exploited for efficient solution. Variations such
as optimal stopping problems, model selection problems, and problems with
imperfect measurements will be studied. Clinical data on rheumatoid arthritis
will be employed to calibrate the models, and to validate and compare the dosing
policies derived via computer simulations.
