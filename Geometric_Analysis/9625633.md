9625633 Kuranishi This project deals with a number of topics in several complex
variables, exterior differential systems and differential geometry. In
particular, the investigator plans to pursue the Cauchy-Riemann embedding
problem, curvature prescription problems, the Radon transform on symmetric
spaces and its application to isopectral rigidity, and kernels on weakly
pseudoconvex domains and holomorphc extension problems. Many problems in
differential geometry and complex analysis can be couched in the language of
exterior differential systems - exterior differential systems are a
generalization of systems of partial differential equations allowing them to be
defined globally on curved spaces without having to introduce local coordinates.
Several of the proposed problems deal with applications of exterior systems
theory. The curvature prescription problem, in particular, seeks to find spaces
satisfying a given set of curvature properties by solving an associated system
of exterior equations on a smooth but otherwise bare space.
