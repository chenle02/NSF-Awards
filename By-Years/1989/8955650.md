The Dordt College will initiate a two-week, commuter, Young Scholars project in
engineering for 30 students in grades 8-9. The purpose of this project is to
motivate students to consider engineering as a vocational goal. The project
includes a series of coordinated lectures and laboratory experiences which
stimulate the students' interest in engineering, develop the necessary skills
and talents, and inform the students as to the essential high school courses
required to pursue an engineering degree. Field trips to cooperating industries
reinforce classroom activities. Students are assigned a project which requires
them to use what they have learned in the classroom, laboratory, and workplace.
The academic year follow-up activities demonstrate completed projects, and
provide motivation for peers to pursue the workshop in the future.
