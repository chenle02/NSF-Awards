Two very successful cruises were taken to the Florida Escarpment during 1986
that are yielding very stimulating data. Two sites were surveyed with "Deep-
Tow", representative sections of the escarpment were seabeamed, and twelve ALVIN
dives were conducted mostly at sites of chemosnythetic "seep" communties where
detailed geochemical and geological sampling was conducted. The program
objectives are: 1) to detail the morphology and processes of generation of the
steep (-45o) limestone escarpment, and to establish the relationship between the
escarpment itself and the sulfidic/methanogenic pore-fluids which seep out onto
the seafloor at its base, 2) to determine the source of the reduced chemicals in
the seeping fluids and to understand the range of processes which are occurring
at the seafloor associated with the seeps, and 3) to characterize the nature of
the deposits generated by these processes, and to establish the criterion for
their recognition in the rock record. %%% Previous work on this project has
revealed an anonymously steep escarpment off Florida that appears to be the
result of erosion. Samples from the base of the escarpment reveal sulfide
deposits that have formed in response to venting of fluids from the limestone
rocks. The chemistry of these fluids will be investigated using the chemical
precipitates they have left behind in order to better understand the venting
process. The results from the modern record will allow better recognition of
these processes in the rock record.
