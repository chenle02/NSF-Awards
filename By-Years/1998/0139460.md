This award provides funding to Duke University for a five-year REU Site Program
for Increasing Diversity at Duke University's Pratt School of Engineering, under
the direction of Ms. Martha Absher. This nine-week summer program will provide
in-depth research opportunities for 8 women, underrepresented minorities, and
disabled undergraduate students in projects covering a wide range of topics
including diagnostics and biomaterials, medical imaging, cochlear implants and
drug transport in solid tumors. The REU Fellows will work closely with a Pratt
researcher and/or graduate studentmentor on individual research projects
especially designed for them in laboratories on the Duke campus.
