x @ \ X @ 2 0 F Z : This award supports the participation of 11 U.S. scientists
in a U.S. Japan Photoconversion/Photosynthesis Seminar on Photoinduced Electron
Transfer at Semiconductor Interfaces Fundamamentals and Applications. The
seminar, which will be held March 12 14, 1995 in San Diego, CA, is being co
organized by Professor Thomas Mallouk, Department of Chemistry, Pennsylvania
State University, and Professor Kohei Uosaki, Department of Chemistry, Hokkaido
University, Sapporo, Japan. The seminar will focus on recent advances in the
fundamental science of light dirven electron transfer at semiconductor surfaces,
and new applications of semiconductor photochemistry. Seminar sessions will be
organized around themes of fundamental studies of charge transfer,
photoelectrochemistry, photosensitization and photocatalysis, new materials and
devices, and novel applications of semiconductors. Understanding electron
transfer and chemical reactivity at the interface between semiconductors and
solutions is key not only to emerging energy conversion technologies, but also
to a variety of newer applications including environmental remediation,
microlithography, optical computing, and information storage. Both the
fundamental and applied sides of the problem are now the subject of intense
research and development efforts in both countries. The seminar will bring
together U.S. and Japanese specialists from strong research programs to exchange
information o n new developments in this field.
