This proposed research would determine the feasibility of an educational
software package, for use by undergraduate and graduate level engineering
students, which would demonstrate and aid in teaching physical and computational
fluid dynamics. The software will be used as an adjunct to classroom lectures
and would support three levels of usage: introductory fluid dynamics
simulations, the underlying computational methodology, and user- defined flow
situations. The initial version of the software will be introduced to university
students. It is proposed that a commercially viable education tool will be
developed and marketed to the university community.
