Fundamental Rayleigh-Benard type experimental and theoretical studies are
performed to measure for the first time the effect of interfacial phenomena on
the stability and structure of thermocapillary and buoyancy driven conection in
low Prandtl number liquid metal and semiconductor fluids. The experiments will
be carried out on liquid tin and lead heated from below and will utilize an
ultrahigh vacuum system with an ion sputter gun and a unique Auger and ELS
analysis capability for establishing and maintaining atomically clean surfaces
at working temperatures for extended periods of time. The system allows for
measuring monolayer concentration levels of surface active materials. Stability
limits and surface morphology will be verified for low Prandtl number fluids
experimentally for both the onset of convection and the nonlinear transition to
oscillatory convection modes as a function of solute concentration, evaporation
rates and aspect ratio. Theoretical studies designed to guide and interpret the
experimental work will include two and three dimensional analyses of instability
and bifurcation phenomena in fluid layers. The effect of interfacial phenomena,
including surface concentraion, vapor recoil, surface adsorption and deflection
will be studied in detail.
