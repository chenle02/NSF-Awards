&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to formulate design principles for
and demonstrate, via prototyping, the feasibility of a new sensor network of
everyday objects based on radio frequency identification (RFID) system
components. The vision exploits the advantages of RFID while addressing two key
challenges, namely the lack of sensor integration onto RFID tags and the need
for careful redesign of the transceivers (i.e, down and up links as well as the
multiple access protocol). Central to the success of the proposed research are
two key advances already in place at University of Washington-Intel Research
Labs. First, a new class of passive RFID tags, called wireless identification
and sensing platforms (WISPs), integrated with appropriate sensors and designed
for enhanced power harvesting are available. Second, a software-defined reader
(SDR) that allows innovation of link and medium access control (MAC) protocols
is available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to intellectual merit, the
research pursues an integrated systems solution to RFID network design at
various interacting levels of abstraction. As an example, the research considers
coupled circuit and electromagnetic simulation that characterizes the back-
scattered uplink signal at the reader, which in turn can suggest link and MAC
layer components, such as modulation and coding as well as collision avoidance
dedicated to interference mitigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With respect to
broader impacts, the research has the potential to accelerate academic research
into RFID networks via freeware distribution of the SDR code and limited
availability of WISPs as well as dissemination via topical tutorials. Successful
execution of the project can move RFID technology from its intended application
of reading tag IDs within a supply chain environment toward the more ambitious
goal of realizing a ubiquitous "internet of things."
