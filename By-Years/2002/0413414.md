Malaria parasites has a life cycle that involves two hosts, a vertebrate and
insect vectors. Different species of malaria can infect humans, lizards or
birds. The infection in the vertebrate may consist of a single genetic clone of
cells, or a mixture of different clones. This project will use a malaria
parasite of lizards to study how the number of parasite clones influences how
the infection behaves (the rate of the parasite's reproduction, the number of
parasites in the host, and the ratio of male to female parasites), the harm the
infection does to the host, and the ability of the parasite to infect a biting
insect vector. These effects are currently almost completely
unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Malaria parasites are of enormous public health
importance for humans, and are also important pathogens of wildlife species. For
the past century, researchers have assumed that the number of different clones
of parasite in an infection is an important factor that determines the harm
caused by the parasite. However, suitable genetic markers were not available to
identify the number of clones. This research will use markers that have just
been discovered for the specific lizard malaria parasite. This study will thus
open a novel window into the biology of malaria parasites.&lt;br/&gt;
