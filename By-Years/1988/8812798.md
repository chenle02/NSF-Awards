Modern information systems technology has already had considerable impact on
the operation of financial markets, but the most fundamental changes are yet to
come. It is only in the last year or so that modern technology has begun to
transform the core trading functions in major financial markets. In 1987, the
London Exchange replaced its traditional specialists by a computer-aided trading
mechanism. Most observers believe that the New York Stock Exchange and others,
will make similar changes in the next few years. Yet there is too little solid
understanding of electronic trading mechanisms to guide the fundamental changes
that are now beginning to take place. This research contributes to our
understanding of these mechanisms by investigating, through laboratory
experiments, a number of the fundamental problems inherent in these electronic
markets. Specifically, the researchers set up computerized laboratory markets
employing three principal mechanisms: the continuous Double Auction (as
presently used in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange); the Specialist Dealer System
(as used in the New York Stock Exchange); and, the Call market (used to open
many financial markets). The researchers test for systematic effects of the
market mechanism on important market performance measures such as price errors,
price volatility, allocational efficiency, the bid-ask spread and trader
profits. Such evidence should help inform important policy decisions regarding
the adoption of new information technologies in financial markets, and may also
inspire new theoretical and empirical advances.
