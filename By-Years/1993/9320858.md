9320858 SARAT This project will convene an international conference of
sociolegal scholars to examine the role of the legal profession in social and
political processes. The conference will focus on the involvement of the legal
profession, in various countries and in the international arena, in developing a
wide variety of rights claims and other policy goals. A special focus is the
transnational development of human rights claims. Three questions will be
addressed. First, what parts of the legal profession engage in these activities
and why do they seek to use their legal practice to these ends? Second, what are
their strategies and tactics and how do they differ (if at all) from those of
conventional practice? Third, what are the conditions that facilitate or inhibit
the political uses of legal practice? A number of social scientists across the
world who have been studying these questions will present the results of their
research at the conference. These papers and the other proceedings of the
conference will be published as a book. ***
