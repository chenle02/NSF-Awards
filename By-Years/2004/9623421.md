9623421 Olmstead Graduate student Alan Yen, with direction from adviser Richard
Olmstead at the University of Washington, is studying the large sedge genus
Carex, with an emphasis on collecting new molecular data from nuclear and
chloroplast gene sequences. Large genera, by virtue of the sheer number of
species, are intimidating subjects of taxonomic research, and Carex is one of
the largest with over 2,000 described species worldwide. It is also considered
an ecologically significant group of plants, especially in wetland habitats, and
for such purposes as wildlife forage and shelter and storm water retention. To
enhance reliability of species recognition in the genus, improve sectional
classification, and infer a phylogeny for the group, research is being conducted
to add new molecular evidence to existing morphological features used in Carex
taxonomy. Field work in Malaysia and Taiwan has provided samples of critical
exemplar taxa, and colleagues in other parts of the world are supplying valuable
materials for study. Preliminary molecular data are promising; DNA nucleotide
sequence data will provide direct measures of mutation differences between taxa,
and allow inference of phylogenetic relationships among the species. The project
adopts an exemplar approach to taxon sampling, with the hope that analysis of
75-100 species can provide a robust phylogenetic framework for the genus as a
whole. For a large genus like Carex, with 2,000+ species and with a limited
suite of morphological and anatomical characters available for taxonomic
discrimination and phylogenetic resolution, new sources of evidence are needed.
This project offers gene sequencing of nuclear and chloroplast DNA as a source
of new data, from a wide sample of species collected throughout the world.
Analysis of the new molecular data and integration with traditional
morphological characters hold promise for providing a phylogenetic framework for
the group, in turn useful for future intensive investigations in systemati cs
and ecology of these plants.
