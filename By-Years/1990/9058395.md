This is an award to provide support for research to be initiated by this
Presidential Young Investigator who was nominated under conditions contained in
the Program Announcement NSF 89-58. The goal of this investigator's research is
to increase her understanding of biological treatment processes used in
treatment of wastewater as components of ecosystems. This approach will be used
by her to study the interactions of chemical, physical and biological processes
including interactions of involved microorganisms with each other and with the
environment. Examples include extending her work on the role of pH variations in
algal biofilms to nitrification, denitrification and methanogenesis in
wastewater treatment processes. Results of this research are likely to be
utilized in engineering design of processes and systems for removal of
contaminants from wastewater. The results may be useful in determining how
nitrogen can be removed from wastewater by use of a single biofilm that includes
both aerobic and anaerobic processes within it.
