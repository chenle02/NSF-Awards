This three-year award for US-UK cooperative research in physical experimental
chemistry involves David W. Pratt of the University of Pittsburgh and W.G.
Richards and J.P. Simons at Oxford University. The objective of their research
is to study supramolecule assemblies of enzyme catalytic sites and bound
substrates, including structure and properties of the supramolecule assemblies
and interaction among its components. Enzyme and enzyme substrate mimics,
designed to model the behavior of the enzymes, serine and cysteine proteases,
will be studied in experiments using laser-based electronic spectroscopy and
other techniques. They will also use the enzyme mimics to investigate selective
binding of xenon at enzyme catalytic sites, thereby providing insight into its
potential as a site specific stain in magnetic resonance imaging. The US
investigator and his group bring to this collaboration expertise in
characterization of enzyme structures using theoretical techniques. This is
complemented by British expertise in enzyme mimic preparation and
characterization using ab initio techniques. These studies will provide new
information about molecular interactions which are responsible for enzyme
function.
