This award funds research that will experimentally test hypotheses from
development and political economics related to social capital, political
enfranchisement, and trust in government using the unique circumstances of a new
democracy in Libya. The causal relationship between democracy and economic
growth is hotly debated. While some argue there is a causal relationship between
the two, others claim an underlying characteristic of a given society jointly
determines both governance and economic growth. One candidate for such a
characteristic is social capital. This project sheds light on this question by
examining whether, once a democratic election takes place, the stock of social
capital in a society can be affected by who wins in that election. The project
uses innovative laboratory-style methods from experimental economics conducted
in the field in a country that is engaged in free elections for the first time
in many years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will help us to understand
mechanisms that support free elections and political enfranchisement in a
fragile democracy, and deepen our understanding of the relationship between
governance and economic growth.
