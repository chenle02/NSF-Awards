A diblock copolymer molecule is a linear chain of an A-monomer block grafted
covalently to a B-monomer block. Because of the repulsion between the unlike
monomers, the different type sub-chains tend to segregate, but as they are
chemically bonded in chain molecules, segregation of sub-chains cannot lead to a
macroscopic phase separation. Only a local micro-phase separation occurs: micro-
domains rich in A monomers and micro-domains rich in B monomers emerge as a
result. A nano-sized pattern formed from micro-domains is known as a morphology
phase. The investigator develops singular limit methods to study morphology
phases that concentrate on points, curves, and surfaces in space, and that might
not be found by existing free energy methods. These methods reduce complicated
nonlinear, nonlocal, variational, and partial differential equation problems to
simpler geometric problems. They analyze the saturation phenomenon: a process of
elongation, deformation, and breaking off of a small number of large objects to
form a large number of small objects. They also explain defects in morphological
phases caused by local-nonlocal competition or topological constraints. In the
case of block copolymer vesicles the investigator studies the bending rigidity
in the free energy. The singular limit techniques are extended to problems
without variational structures, such as the Gierer-Meinhardt system for
biological morphogenesis in development.

Block copolymers are soft condensed materials that in contrast to crystalline
solids, are characterized by fluid-like disorder on the molecular scale and a
high degree of order on a longer length scale. An almost unlimited number of
molecular architectures can be designed by modern nano-technologies to produce
materials with particular mechanical, electric, barrier, ionic and other
physical properties. Common box tapes use triblock copolymers to achieve
pressure-sensitive adhesion. Block copolymers are blended with asphalt in road
construction to reduce pavement cracking and rutting at low and high temperature
extremes. In this project the investigator studies pattern formations within
block copolymers that are related to changes in the morphology phase of the
material, and hence to larger-scale material properties. The project includes
graduate students, who develop skills and knowledge in both mathematics and
materials science.
