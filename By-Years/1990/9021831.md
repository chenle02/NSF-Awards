This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
for the renovation and repair of Cogswell Laboratory which houses the research
and research training activities of the Department of Chemistry. This building
was constructed in 1970 and has not been renovated since that time. The ARFMP
grant of $600,000 and $4,900,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be
used to modernize these research and research training facilities. This project
will address the need to improve the current research infrastructure by
upgrading the air-handling system and increasing the hood capacity. An increase
in the size, productivity, and quality of the research program and compliance
with modern health and safety standards are changes expected to accrue from this
renovation. This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by providing
an improved environment for the conduct of research and for the training of
quality undergraduate and graduate students. Renssalaer Polytechnic Institute
has a Chemistry Department which has strength in fundamental research and yet at
the same time is also highly applications-conscious. Thus the students trained
in these laboratories are in demand in both basic and applied research fields.
