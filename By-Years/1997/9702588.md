9702588 Peeples This Career Proposal describes research and educational plans
that will enhance the skills of engineering students to work on
interdisciplinary programs at the interface of engineering and the life
sciences. The research area involves mechanisms of stability used by
thermophiles to stabilize proteins and lipids to heat and acidity. The
production of heat shock proteins and the rigidifying of the membrane lipid
molecules are two such stabilizing mechanisms. The stabilizing mechanism will be
investigated by using electron spin resonance on appropriately labeled portions
of the membrane molecules. Once the stabilizing mechanisms have been identified,
attempts will be made to extend these mechanisms to enzymes outside of their
natural environments, i.e., for use in biocatalysis. Stabilized proteoliposomes
will be synthesized and tested to determine their stability. The educational
goals will be achieved by a variety of methods including: use of campus
resources such as the interdisciplinary Biocatalysis and Bioprocessing Program;
use of group problem and design situations, specific courses, and a mentoring
program to increase diversity and the utilization of underrepresented groups.
