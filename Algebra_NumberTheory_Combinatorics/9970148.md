This proposal continues investigations into groups of rational points of simple
algebraic groups over number fields and of their S-arithmetic subgroups. One of
the goals of the project is to prove the centrality of the congruence kernel for
new classes of groups. In conjunction with the previous results of G.Prasad and
A.Rapinchuk describing the metaplectic kernel, this will provide a definitive
answer to the congruence subgroup problem for these groups. The PI will also
study the rigidity property for finite dimensional representations of finitely
generated groups in order to prove that discrete Kazhdan groups have finite
representation type.

This research lies in the meeting ground between algebra and number theory.
Questions related to the normal subgroup structure of linear groups have
historical roots in the previous century (Jordan, Klein), and have been an area
of active research in this century. In the last 10-15 years tools have been
developed to study a central problem about arithmetic subgroups of algebraic
groups. This problem, known as the congruence subgroup problem, is connected
with other fundamental problems in number theory for which new applications are
being discovered in such areas as data transmission, data processing, and
communication systems.
