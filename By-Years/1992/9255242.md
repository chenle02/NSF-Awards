Michigan University seeks funds to investigate what is involved in trying to
teach mathematics for understanding in an elementary classroom, and to develop
tools for inquiry into and communication about this kind of teaching. The
project has three interrelated purposes: to study the kind of mathematics
teaching and learning envisioned by the current reforms; to construct new
approaches for teachers and teacher educators to learn about this kind of
teaching; and to educate teacher educators in reforming the aims, content, and
discourse of teacher education. The proposers will develop a collection of
scenarios/vignettes of elementary mathematics classrooms, and will place them
into a hypermedia environment for investigation and use by other mathematics
educators. These materials will contribute to understanding teacher/ student
dialogues and classroom interactions and will help researcher learn more about
how children construct mathematics. The implications for teacher preparation
include the use of materials for instruction in courses for teachers, both
preservice and inservice. In addition, the instructors of the courses for
teachers will learn from the materials, their interpretation, and the research
results. Cost sharing amounts to over 12% of NSF funding.
