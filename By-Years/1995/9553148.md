9553148 Gajdardziska-Josifovska This project focuses on the study of surfaces
and interfaces of metal oxides by electron microscopy and electron holography.
The goals are to solve the atomic structure of polar surfaces which exhibit
reconstructions stable in air, to elucidate the reasons for this unusual
stability, to discover new reconstructions via systematic study of different
oxides, to explore if such reconstructions enable growth of novel epitaxial
films, and tm explore if these polar surfaces have useful catalytic properties.
The educational component of the program will aim towards fusion of knowledge
from electromagnetism, optics, quantum mechanics, solid state physics, and
surface science. %%% The long term goal of this project is to form an integrated
educational and research program in structure and properties of condensed
matter. The main theme will be structures of ceramic surfaces and interfaces.
Electron microscopy and holography will be the primary experimental methods. The
scientific goal of the project will be to solve the atomic structure of polar
oxide surfaces which exhibit unusual reconstructions stable in air. While
searching for new surface reconstructions, this project will attempt to
elucidate the reasons for their stability and to explore if such reconstructions
have properties suitable for application in catalysis and opto- electronics. ***
