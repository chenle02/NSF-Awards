This research studies data recorded in time that is count-valued, e.g., the
annual number of Californian wildfires, yearly Alaskan polar bear sightings,
monthly flu deaths, annual North Atlantic severe hurricanes, etc. The data may
be correlated in time, implying that counts observed today may be influenced by
(correlated with) counts occurring in the immediate past. This work develops
time series methods that take into account the particular type of distribution
appropriate for the counts, e.g., Poisson, geometric, binomial, etc.. Using the
correct distribution facilitates accurate forecasts and inferences. The models
developed here allow both positive and negative correlations, a feature absent
from current statistical count time series models. For example, annual Pacific
and Atlantic hurricane counts are well described by a Poisson-type distribution,
but are negatively correlated: when Atlantic hurricane counts are high, Pacific
counts tend to be low (and vice versa). It is important to account for such
correlations to make accurate climate change conclusions.

On technical levels, a discrete-time renewal process is used as a general model
for a binary (zero-one) series. The renewal process is rendered stationary by
selecting a special initial renewal life length. Copies of the stationary binary
sequence are then superimposed in various ways to build the marginal
distribution sought. It is easy to construct stationary series with Poisson,
geometric, and binomial marginal distributions. The methods easily generate
stationary count series with negative correlations and/or long-memory ---
aspects not achievable from classical integer autoregressive moving-average
count techniques. Inference issues, covariates, and multivariate series are also
considered.
