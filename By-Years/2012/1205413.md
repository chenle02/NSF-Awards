This award is to acquire an 8 node multicore hybrid CPU+GPU system in support of
research in use of multicore-based, GPU-based and hybrid high performance
computing applications in the areas of large and complex system modeling and
their solution methods, computational fluid dynamics, high performance data and
stream processing, and dependable and high integrity methods on hybrid multicore
and GPU methods. The proposed configuration also includes one front node and one
storage server node with 80 TB disk capacity interconnected by an existing
Infiniband network for multi-tiered, hierarchical parallel computing. Each
compute node consists of Quad AMD new Interlagos processor 6220 with 8-core
operating at 3.0GHz (can go up to 3.6GHz) and 512 GB of RAM, and a dual 448-core
Tesla Fermi GPUs with 6 GB memory. The system will be used to support CISE
centric interdisciplinary high performance computing research.&lt;br/&gt;This
project establishes a computational instrument deploying multiple multicore
hybrid CPU+GPU systems to support applications requiring hybrid high performance
computing machinery. The instrumentation facilitates research in multicore- and
GPU-based high performance computing in the context of the diverse set of
applications at the frontiers of research: modeling of large and complex systems
and their solution methods, such as high performance data and stream processing,
dependable and high integrity methods on hybrid multicore and GPU, and
computational fluid dynamics.
