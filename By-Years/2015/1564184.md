This award will help support student and postdoctoral attendance at the Annual
ACM/SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms Science (SODA) 2016, in Arlington, VA
on January 10 to 12, 2016. SODA is co-sponsored by the Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM) and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) .
SODA is the premier annual research conference in the field of discrete
algorithms and one of the three premier conferences in theoretical computer
science. SODA has been meeting annually since 1990 and in a typical year has
over 300 attendees. It is co-located with two smaller workshops, ALENEX (Meeting
on Algorithm Engineering and Experimentation) and ANALCO (Meeting on Analysis of
Algorithms). SODA is attended by researchers from all over the world. The field
of algorithms is a vibrant one, with high participation rates from young
researchers, and many papers with student authors. For these student authors and
student attendees, the conference serves as a valuable educational experience,
both for the technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for
networking that it provides.

The award will provide partial support to approximately twenty students, partly
defraying the cost of travel and lodging. Efforts will be made to support
students from under-represented groups.
