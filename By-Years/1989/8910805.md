This project will investigate and improve the trade-off between accuracy and
cost of the numerical solution of the transport equation, when (a) the driving
flow is unsteady and strongly non- uniform, and (b) the period of simulation is
much longer than the smallest time scales that must be resolved (due to
"physics"). The research focus is on particle methods (PMs) and on Eulerian-
Lagrangian methods (ELMs). One part of the research will concern numerical
accuracy, emphasizing (a) the understanding of the accuracy properties of
alternative algorithms for particle tracking, as a function of the flow
complexity, and (b) the influence of these properties on the global accuracy of
the transport equation by PMs and ELMs. The other part of the research will
concern numerical efficiency: investigation of implementations of selected PMs
and ELMs on alternative types of computer architectures: serial and parallel
(with shared and distributed memory). The different pairs of numerical methods
and computer architectures will be compared with regard to (a) "cost" (CPU and
user time) for fixed accuracy, and (b) accuracy for fixed "cost." Research will
blend (a) theoretical analysis of numerical methods, (b) algorithm development
(with emphasis on parallel algorithms), and (c) numerical experimentation.
Direct motivation is provided by long-term simulations of tidal transport in
estuaries and coasts, but results should also benefit other scientific and
engineering fields.
