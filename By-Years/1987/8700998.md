This project will continue work on problems of partial differential equations
and geometric questions centering on the theory of several complex variables and
complex geometry. Work will be done on restrictions of holomorphic functions to
submanifolds. These are functions which always satisfy certain equations known
as the tangential Cauchy Riemann equations. The investigations to be carried out
on this project involve the converse question: What local geometric conditions
on a submanifold of complex Euclidean space guarantee that each function
satisfying the tangential Cauchy Riemann equations is locally the restriction of
holomorphic function? Methods of complex geometry and analysis will be applied
in studying this fundamental question. The geometric conditions are described by
curvature conditions as measured by the Levi forms and sector property
conditions on the submanifold. The analytic disc technique and the FBI transform
will be used to construct the extension of a given CR function. Work will also
be done in applying the technique of analytic discs to prove Hardy Littlewood
maximal function type estimates on domains in complex Euclidean space whose
boundaries possess some weak form of convexity. Results of this research are
expected to have application to the theory of partial differential equations and
to differential geometry.
