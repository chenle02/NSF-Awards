The primary objective of this U. S.-Poland cooperative research project between
Dr. Henry Lubatti of the University of Washington and Dr. Andrzej Eskreys of the
Institute of Nuclear Physics, Krakow, is to enhance our understanding of nucleon
structure functions by studying deep-inelastic scattering of muons. This will be
done by investigating the momentum distributions of quarks and their
interactions in nuclear matter. The researchers will employ a streamer chamber
which records the trajectories of the charged particles emanating from the
collision vertex and permits determin- ation of a vertex point as well as
measurement of the momenta of the low energy particles. These efforts should
yield detailed and reliable data useful in building realistic, theoretical
models for quark interactions. This project in elementary particle physics
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
experts in the United states and Eastern Europe to complementary talents and
pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
