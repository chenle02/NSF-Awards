Richard Matzner will carry out research in gravitational physics
and&lt;br/&gt;relativity, utilizing the tools of mathematical analysis,
comparison to&lt;br/&gt;observation, and computational modeling. He will apply
these techniques&lt;br/&gt;to understanding the possible configurations of
massive objects as&lt;br/&gt;described in general relativity, concentrating on
black holes. He will&lt;br/&gt;study the way in which these objects can be
described in computational&lt;br/&gt;terms, and the dynamics of these objects in
interaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main part of this work will concentrate
on developing evolutions of&lt;br/&gt;black hole interactions. These are the
strongest possible gravitational&lt;br/&gt;sources, and will produce strong
gravitational wave events. They are a&lt;br/&gt;testbed in which our
understanding of strong gravitational fields is&lt;br/&gt;exercised, and in
which new theoretical concepts are developed. They are&lt;br/&gt;a difficult
computational problem (large operation counts, large&lt;br/&gt;numbers of field
variables), and require special techniques, very&lt;br/&gt;careful numerical
handling, and very large computational resources.&lt;br/&gt;Thus they are an
excellent domain to develop new computational&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure. And they
may provide detailed predictions of the&lt;br/&gt;waveforms detected in the
current and in future generations of&lt;br/&gt;gravitational wave detectors.
