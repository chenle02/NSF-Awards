Computer aided geometric design is the design and representation of curves,
surfaces, and volumes in an interactive computer graphics environment. This
project focuses on design and will include work in two areas: (1) geometry
processing and (2) nonuniform rational B-splines (NURBS). Geometry processing is
the calculation of geometric properties of curves and surfaces. NURBS are
becoming a de facto industry standard for geometry representation because both
polynomials and conics can be represented exactly. Both areas are of prime
importance in many fields such as computer aided design/computer aided
manufacturing. Both areas also have considerable theoretical interest as well.
Research subtopics under these two principal headings include the following: (1)
surface/surface intersection, offset surfaces, surface triangulations and (2)
curve and surface fairing, automatic weight generation for NURBS, and the
investigation of stabiblity issues associated with rational shape
representations.
