8902811 Lasiecka This project is to investigate a coherent set of boundary
control problems for systems described by wave-type and plate-type partial
differential equations, defined on a bounded domain in higher dimensional space.
Both linear and nonlinear dynamics are considered. Problems for investigation
include: exact controllability; uniform stabilization by means either of
explicit dissipative feedback operators or else of nondissipative feedback
operators based on algebraic Riccati operators; optimal quadratic cost problems
and related Riccati equations; asymptotic stability properties for nonlinear
models; robustness of asymptotic stability properties under nonlinear structural
perturbations; well-posedness of nonlinear wave equations with nonmonotone
nonlinearities in the Neumann boundary conditions. The emphasis throughout is on
the optimal setting where the solutions and their relevant properties are
studied in the spaces of optimal regularity, or, alternatively, in the spaces of
finite energy. There are many applications for the theoretical developments
described above. For instance, the control of robot arms and the reduction of
damaging oscillations in large flexible structures on Earth or in orbit, are
examples of practical benefits resulting from this work.
