0106853&lt;br/&gt;Samson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Substantial advances have been
made in recent years in the understanding of the geological evolution of several
major North American and European 'pan-African' Neoproterozoic (750-550 million
year old) terranes, but there is still a fundamental gap in the knowledge of
'pan-African' orogenic belt evolution in Africa itself. Much of the uncertainty
about the accretionary history of the African Neoproterozoic orogens stems from
the limited database of reliable radiometric ages of structurally important
units, combined with a lack of detailed modern kinematic analysis in these
deformed regions. These critical data are being collected by performing combined
structural, uranium-lead geochronological, and neodymium-lead-hafnium isotopic
analyses of one of the pivotal Neoproterozoic African orogens, the Anti-Atlas
orogen of Morocco. Through a detailed structural analysis of the deformed rocks
in the region, combined with high precision uranium-lead zircon age
determinations, many significant questions about the accretionary history of the
southern Anti-Atlas belt are being answered. Such questions include the age and
timing of obduction of ocean-floor crust (ophiolites), the relationship of these
ophiolites to one another, the connections between arc-terranes to the north
with ophiolites and an associated blueschist belt to the south, the age and
nature of the basement of these terranes, the degree of interaction of basement
with Neoproterozoic magmas, and the timing of accretion of these terranes to the
West African Craton. Through modern, multi-disciplinary studies the geological
'family-tree' of the circum-Atlantic terranes with the orogens surrounding the
West African Craton is being established.&lt;br/&gt;
