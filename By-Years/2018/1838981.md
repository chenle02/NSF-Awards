An approach to scientific data interoperability and reuse is through global,
persistent, and uniquely identified data types that can be assembled to
characterize research data sets. This project proposes to identify data types
using persistent identifiers (PIDs). The PIDs resolve to records that specify
the way in which metadata, such as the provenance of the data, is structured and
recorded. The basic premise is that machine interpretable data is a critical
goal to achieving FAIRness (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and
reuse) of data as data discovery at a global scale depends on automated
processing of the information in digital form. A type based approach to data
interpretability that utilizes persistent IDs at the granularity of data types
can overturn the Internet and stimulate an ecosystem of new tools for FAIR data.
This pilot effort involves evaluating the approach through, in part, by
constructing a critical mass of use cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is
supported by the National Science Foundation Public Access Initiative which is
managed by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure on behalf of the
Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
