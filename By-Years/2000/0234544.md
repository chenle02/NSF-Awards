This award will support a Field Workshop to measure and sample volatile
emissions from volcanic centers in the Nicaragua and Costa Rica segments of the
Central American Volcanic Arc. This workshop is the 8 th Field Workshop
organized by the IAVCEI Commission on the Chemistry of Volcanic Gases (CCVG) and
will take place in March 2003. The overall theme of the workshop is sampling of
volcanic volatile emissions using direct sampling methods and newly developed
land-based and space-based remote sensing techniques. Organizers and attendents
will compare techniques and identify methods to improve current measurement
strategies. The focus of this workshop is Poas volcano in Costa Rica, and
Masaya, Momotombo and Cerro Negro volcanoes in Nicaragua. Because subduction
zone parameters show significant changes between Costa Rica and Nicaragua
(amount of sediment contributing to arc magmas, slab angle) comparison of the
volatile emissions from these volcanic centers is expected to be interesting. By
involving a large number of specialists we hope to most accurately resolve
variations in volatile compositions and fluxes between the different volcanoes
and eliminate problems related to sampling and measuring techniques.
