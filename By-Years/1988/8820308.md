The colleges of Carleton and St. Olaf request support in the form of hardware,
software, and communication services to connect their campus networks to the
Minnesota Regional Network (MRNET). Direct connection to MRNET, which has a line
to NSFNET, will provide researchers with improved access to national networks
such as CSNET, Bitnet, and USENET. Improvement is sought in reliability, speed,
turn-around, flexibility, and functions such as file transfer, remote login, and
teleconferencing. By linking to MRNET (and thus to NSFNET), Carleton and St.
Olaf propose to set an example for other private colleges in Minnestota and
maintain leadership in professional productivity and technological innovation.
The link, once in place, will greatly facilitate research by students and
faculty, and will provide a valuable resource to supplement course work.***
