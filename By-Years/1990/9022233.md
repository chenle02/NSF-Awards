A broad program of research on the basic physics of atoms, ions, and simple
molecules and their interaction with electromagnetic radiation is carried out.
New methods of using lasers and coherent light sources in spectroscopy are
explored. These methods are used in a range of applications including tests of
the validity of fundamental symmetries of nature, stringent tests of quantum
electrodynamics, the spectroscopy of sharp special features in metals, and the
manipulation of DNA with lasers.
