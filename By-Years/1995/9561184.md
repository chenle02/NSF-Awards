This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
the use of in-situ, real-time film thickness monitoring and in-situ, real-time
uniformity manipulation to improve process uniformity of Chemical Mechanical
Polishing (CMP). Improved process uniformity will enhance the yield and
effectiveness of the CMP process, which is increasingly used as a semiconductor
planarization process. Phase I will develop a five-channel, real-time CMP active
uniformity control system capable of compensating for center uniformity defects.
Individual components will include: opto-electronics, software, five-channel
optic access, and a back pressure system. Commercial application of the
technology will focus on the CMP process used in semiconductor manufacturing. In
addition, other potential applications include micromachining and optical
circuit and fine optics production.
