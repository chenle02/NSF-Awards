Project 2061: Education for a Changing Future is a long-term effort by the AAAS
to contribute in a significant way to the reform of K-12 education in science,
mathematics and technology. Phase I of Project 2061 recommends the fundamental
knowledge, skills and habits of mind that all students should possess by the
time they leave secondary school. In this project, which is Phase II of Project
2061, the teacher enhancement component will address the broad content
preparation of 125 school educators, 100 teachers and 25 administrators. These
participant-teams will be selected from five school districts around the country
focussing on the provision of leadership for reforming the K-12 curriculum as it
bears on science, mathematics and technology. School districts, state
educational facilities and universities will participate in this collaborative
project. The goals of the project are to (1) improve teachers' ability to teach
science, (2) have significant input into the design of curriculum models and (3)
provide leadership for the reform of K-12 science, mathematics and technology
education. In addition to this grant, an amount equivalent to at least 75% of
the requested NSF budget is being contributed by other sources, principally, the
Carnegie Corporation which funded all of Phase I of Project 2061.
