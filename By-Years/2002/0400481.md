Texas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal
investigators propose to further advance the theory of&lt;br/&gt;conformal
systems as well as its applications and connections to areas of mathematics such
as the number theory, geometric measure theory,&lt;br/&gt;probability theory,
and complex analysis. Of special interest is the&lt;br/&gt;development of
analytical tools required within the context of conformal&lt;br/&gt;graph-
directed Markov systems, infinite iterated function
systems,&lt;br/&gt;iterations of transcendental entire and meromorphic functions
and&lt;br/&gt;holomorphic endomorphisms. The proposed work involves graph-
directed&lt;br/&gt;Markov systems with infinitely many vertices and edges,
interpretations&lt;br/&gt;between counting functions, approximations and
asymptotic limits, the&lt;br/&gt;properties of various dimensions and measures
within the context of graph&lt;br/&gt;directed Markov systems. Applications
involve Gauss' circle problem and&lt;br/&gt;Steinhaus' lattice problem,
Diophantine approximation and self-conformal&lt;br/&gt;measures, return times,
Kolmogorov's superposition theorem, the geometry&lt;br/&gt;and dynamics of the
Fatou function, Gibbs measures for elliptic functions,&lt;br/&gt;critically
pseudo non-recurrent elliptic functions, multifractal analysis&lt;br/&gt;of
hyperbolic exponential functions, and multifractal analysis of Axiom
A&lt;br/&gt;holomorphic endomorphisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
