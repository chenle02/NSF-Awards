9523188 Weber This research is to develop an automated biosensor-based
Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) analysis system. This system will contain a
sampling module, a sensor module, and a control-data acquisition module. The
sampling will take place through flow injection, with the option of batch
sampling. Biosensors will be placed in this cell to detect a wide range of
compounds. Sensors to measure pH, conductivity, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen
may also be included. An embedded microcomputer will control these components
and be designed to acquire, display, analyze, and store data. The successful
completion of this instrument will solve the current inability to do reliable
measurement of BOD organics in real-time for water and waste treatment. This
will allow maximization of waste remediation and minimization of waste discharge
to reduce pollution of waterways.
