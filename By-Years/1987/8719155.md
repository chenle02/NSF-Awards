Professor Semmes is a young researcher who has already established himself as a
world leader in broad areas of modern and classical analysis. His important new
results run through such subject matter as operator theory, nonlinear Fourier
analysis, complex variables, partial differential equations, and geometry. This
Presidential Young Investigator award is based upon the substantial evidence
that Professor Semmes' career as a research mathematician will have a profound
impact on the future of mathematical analysis.
