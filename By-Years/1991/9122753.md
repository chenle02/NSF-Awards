Nehorai This research focuses on new theoretical and algorithmic solutions to
three problems in the general area of signal modeling and system identification:
1. a computationally-efficient high-order Yule-Walker estimator and its adaptive
counterpart; 2. fitting rational transfer function models to frequency response
data; and 3. hypothesis testing and detection with the optimal instrumental
variable method.
