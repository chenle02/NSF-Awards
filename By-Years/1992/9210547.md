The Department of Chemistry at Purdue University will use this award from the
Chemical Research Instrumentation Program to help acquire a state-of-the-art
Electron Spin Resonance (ESR)/Spectrometer. The areas of chemical research that
will be enhanced by the acquisition include the following: 1. EPR Studies of
Copper Proteins. 2. Conducting Polymers in Zeolite Hosts-Design of Electronic
Nanostructures. 3. EPR Studies of Biologically Relevant Metal Complexes 4. Weak
Carbon-Carbon Bonds. The Characterization of Diradical Triplet States and
Mechanisms of Electron Pair Coupling. 5. EPR Studies of the Photosynthetic
Apparatus. Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) Spectroscopy is the primary technique
for studying molecules which contain unpaired electrons. An ESR spectrometer is
useful in areas such as solid state chemistry, surface chemistry, solid state
physics, electrochemistry, and material science.
