The purpose of this proposed research is exploring hypotheses in immunology at
the mathematical level. The emphasis will focus on chemotherapy treatments to
help answer controversies regarding early disease stage treatment versus late,
large dosage versus small, duration of treatment, side effects, scheduling, and
resistance. We can explore these questions for a variety of diseases ({\it e.g.}
AIDS, cancer, etc.). We use differential equations to describe these dynamics
and examine them both analytically and numerically.
