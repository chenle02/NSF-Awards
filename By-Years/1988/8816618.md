X-ray diffraction studies will be carried out on two bacterial enzyme systems
each involving oxidation-reduction and electron transfer reactions. An electron
density map for crystals of p-cresol methylhydroxylase has been computed at 3.0
A resolution and the paths of the polypeptide chains have been traced. After the
amino acid sequence has been fitted to the density, the structure will be
refined and the binding of substrate and inhibitors studied. Crystals of
amicyanin, methylamine dehydrogenase and of their intermolecular complex have
been prepared. Their structures will be analyzed by anomalous scattering,
multiple isomorphous replacement and/or molecular replacement methods Dr.
Mathews has engaged in structural studies of biological macromolecules using
X-ray diffraction methods for many years. His work on b type cytochromes has led
in part to a working hypothesis of how electron transport proteins interact and
pass electrons from one to another. His approach is unique in that one of the
systems under study has both the donor and acceptor electron transfer groups in
the same molecule, while the other system contains a novel prosthetic
group.***//
