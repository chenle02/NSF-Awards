The synthesis of complex natural products such as the antibiotics requires
highly selective reactions. This work, which will provide new organometallic
reagents derived from relatively simple starting materials, is supported in the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program. Several new aspects of
organocopper chemistry are to be studied including (1) a search for chiral
induction using chiral higher order cuprates; (2) a study on the effect of
gegenions on cuprates, including the generation of the first non-lithio and non-
magnesio-containing agents; (3) a study on the role of Lewis acids in cuprate
chemistry; (4) the first example of the exchange of ligands between a metal and
copper, with subsequent cuprate chemistry; and (5)the utilization of these new
reagents in the synthesis of the polyene macrolide antibiotic roflamycoin.
