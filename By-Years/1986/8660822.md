This is a recommendation for an award to support research on biodegradation of
pollutants that have contaminated soil in the vicinity of states where coal tar
residues have been buried. Coal tar is a by- product of a process used to
produce coke and "manufactured" gas. Estimates are that there are over 1500
sites in the United States where these residue were produced and buried. This
research will address the possibility of biologically degrading compounds that
each from these buried deposits and reduce their polutional potential with
respect to groundwater. The proposal leading to this recommendation was
submitted in accord with NSF 86-I9, Small Business Innovation Research. This
proposed work has objectives consistent with those of the Propam in
Environmental Engineering and the investigators have qualifications appropriate
for the work to be done. Award is recommended in the amount of S4O,OOO for six
months starting on February 1, 1987. This will be for Phase I as described in
NSF 86- 19.
