The National Conference on Hispanics in Engineering will bring together over 300
participants for a national discussion on the best practices of promoting the
engineering professions within the Hispanic community on the continuum from K-12
education, undergraduate, graduate school and engineering workforce development.
The information obtained on best practices along the conferences five tracks
will serve to provide this information to ABET accredited, as well as non ABET
accredited, engineering colleges who seek to increase their Hispanic student
enrollment and employers in their quest to increase their Hispanic engineering
workforce.
