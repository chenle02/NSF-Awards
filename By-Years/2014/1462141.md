Authorship Analysis (AA) is the task of extracting characteristics from written
documents that can help to determine authorship of a document, generate a
profile of the author, or identify cases of plagiarism. AA can be used for
historical purposes, to settle disputes over the original creators of a given
document, and to build a prosecution case against an online abuser.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Most previous work in AA assumes the availability of samples with
known authorship that closely match the domain of the documents of interest. A
strong assumption like this one limits the applications of AA approaches. This
program addresses this key outstanding challenge by designing robust frameworks
for scenarios with different cross-domain degrees: cross-topic, cross-genre and
cross-modality (text vs. transcribed speech). The project leverages the large
amounts of free text available representing each cross-domain setting to learn
general lexical and syntactic distributional correspondences. These
correspondences are used to map the out-of-domain texts to a representation that
is closer to the target domain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Direct contributions of
this research include new approaches to extract and embed cross-domain prior
knowledge into AA models in the form of distributional trajectories; and a solid
understanding of the influence of topic, genre, and modality in the feature
engineering process for AA that will also be helpful in other text processing
tasks. This research will make direct contributions to the field of forensic
linguistics, which is of major relevance for national
security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will design an advanced seminar in
computational approaches for forensic linguistics and will expand her ongoing
educational and outreach activities for underrepresented groups in the STEM
disciplines. The PI will integrate opportunities for international visits to key
research labs for the graduate students involved in the program that will enrich
their training and provide great networking opportunities.
