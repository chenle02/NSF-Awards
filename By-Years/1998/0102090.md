This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2001. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled
"Using the Tools of Molecular Biology and Chemistry to Characterize Pigment
Biosynthesis in the Chestnut Blight Fungus." The goal of this research is to
analyze the pathway for production of polyketide pigments in the fungus
Cryphonectria parasitica. Genes required for biosynthesis of emodin and other
related anthraquinone compounds are being cloned, sequenced, and characterized
from an ordered cosmid library and by PCR amplification of PKS genes. These
approaches will permit analysis of genetic diversity within a conserved pathway
present in numerous fungi and plants.&lt;br/&gt;
