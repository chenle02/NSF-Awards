The PI's objective is to explore a novel way of searching large video data
collections semi-automatically for instances of people expressing emotions, by
engaging the user's intelligence in the search process in conjunction with an
automated search assistant (agent) that would not only perform searches but also
help the user phrase queries and define new search concepts. To lay the
groundwork for development of such a high-level system that would support
searching for complex concepts in digital video libraries beyond the reach of
current search technologies, the PI will focus in this exploratory study on
running extensive user studies to elicit information on how to categorize and
define emotions such as happiness or fear in terms of observable features of a
video scene (e.g., facial expression, pitch of voice, gestures, etc). Because
considerable research has been done in the domain of expressing emotions in
faces, the PI will begin by exploring the use of facial features for describing
emotional states. Later on, he will investigate other aspects of human behavior
relevant to emotion, such as physical motion, as well as emotions in speech, in
an effort to develop an extensible vocabulary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: This research has the potential to play a key role in developing a
foundation for searching abstract concepts such as emotional states in large
video data collections and digital libraries, which could have profound and
broad impact on numerous application domains.
