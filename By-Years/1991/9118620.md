This award supports a systematic study of new fossil vertebrates collected in
the Beardmore Glacier area of Antarctica. Material from the upper Fremouw
Formation, that includes several new therapsids and temnospondyls, will be
prepared. The current project will also include the preparation, study and
description of a new assemblage of dinosaur fossils collected from the Falla
Formation. These specimens are of particular importance becuase they represent
the only early dinosaurs (Late Triassic to Jurassic) known from Antarctica and
the only dinosaurs of any kind from the Antarctic mainland. They represent only
the third terrestrial vertebrate fauna from the Transantarctic Mountains.
