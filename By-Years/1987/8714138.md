Professor Donnelly proposes to administer the distribution of funds to enable
U.S. low temperature physicists to attend the Eighteenth International
Conference on Low Temperature Physics and satellite conferences to be held in
Japan in August, 1987. In view of the leading role U.S. scientists have in low
temperature physics, it is felt that there should be a reasonable number of U.S.
physicists present. It is not intended that applications for funds will be
accepted from principal investigators already supported by a Federal agency for
low temperature physics research.
