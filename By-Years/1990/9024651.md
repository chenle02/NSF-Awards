The investigators propose continued operation and development of the Flatland
Radar Observatory, near Champaign- Urbana, Illinois. The principle instrument at
the Flatland Observatory is the 50 MHz ST radar; it is presently supported by a
surface meteorological station, a radiosonde, and an array of eight
microbarographs. This instrumentation will be supplemented with a 915 MHz lower
tropospheric radar and an accompanying Radio Acoustic Sounding System (RASS) to
measure wind and temperature profiles in the lower troposphere. The scientific
objectives are: (1) to investigate mesoscale dynamical processes in the
troposphere and lower stratosphere and their effects on larger scale dynamics;
(2) to study microscale processes, including turbulence and stratified
irregularities of refractive index, and to assess their effects on the accuracy
and precision of ST radar measurements; and (3) to assess the capabilities of
the ST radar technique, particularly its potential for measuring vertical
velocities over extended times.
