Larissa Minn, the Principal Investigator, an early-career writer, proposes to
look at Antarctica and Antarctic science from the developing world's
perspective, by juxtaposing a non-fiction narrative of Antarctic science with
the fictional experiences of a girl living in poverty in Amazonia. The work will
examine ?wondering? as experienced as part of the scientific imagination--How
does this happen? What factors govern this process or that? How can / do we know
this or that is true?--and by the fictional protagonist. Stressing the human
relationships between the regions and the very different realities of each
situation, she proposes to contrast differences as well as reveal connections
between two delicately poised and interconnected systems and reframe readers?
understanding of how they understand and perceive these separate lands
