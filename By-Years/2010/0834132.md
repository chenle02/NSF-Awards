The advent of multicore platforms has led to renewed interest in multiprocessor
real-time systems, with considerable recent work directed at scheduling issues.
Unfortunately, the equally-important topic of synchronization, in comparison,
has been somewhat neglected. Indeed, the most influential work on this topic was
done decades ago, at a time when multiprocessor real-time applications were
deemed to be mostly of "academic" interest only. The objective of this project
is to re-visit the issue of real-time synchronization in light of the ongoing
multicore revolution, with the goal of devising mechanisms that can be
practically applied. The fundamental thesis of this project is "simplicity
wins." Specifically, real-time synchronization mechanisms, though generally
applicable, should be designed with common-case scenarios in mind, using simple
techniques that can be reasonably analyzed. This begs the question: What is the
common case? To determine this, trace data is collected in this project
concerning the synchronization behavior of a wide range of real-time
applications. This data is then being used to produce real-time synchronization
benchmarks, which will guide development efforts. These efforts consider: real-
time multiprocessor locking protocols; techniques for supporting read-mostly
synchronization; the use of transactional memory and non-blocking
synchronization in real-time applications; and synchronization techniques that
can be applied in settings where both real-time and non-real-time components co-
exist. Broader impacts include joint research with industry colleagues at
AT&amp;T, Honeywell, IBM, Intel, and Sun, and the development of publicly-
available open-source software that can be used by other institutions for
research and teaching purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
