The genus Viburnum contains some 170 woody plant species in temperate and
subtropical forests around the Northern Hemisphere and in Latin America and
Southeast Asia. Over 70 Viburnum species are used in horticulture, and many are
ecologically important. Building on years of prior research, and based directly
upon herbarium specimens and new collections, the goal of this project is to
resolve all remaining species-level taxonomic problems and to produce a
comprehensive description of the entire group, with geographic range maps and
richly-illustrated interactive identification keys that can be deployed on the
web and in the field. All data will be internet-accessible and integrated into
global biodiversity databases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will produce a
global treatment of a widespread, taxonomically confusing, and horticulturally
important plant lineage. In doing so, it will generate data and informatics
tools of general value to the scientific community. This work will greatly
increase the value of Viburnum as a model for addressing fundamental issues in
evolutionary biology, ecology, and global change. The project will be
transformative in modeling the use of knowledge of evolutionary relationships in
producing a species-level taxonomic monograph. It will provide hands-on training
in modern, collaborative, cyber-enabled systematic biology to students at all
levels.
