9417048 Hickey In this project, the PI will complete the analysis of data
obtained during the winter, 1990-91, in a study of the Columbia River Plume.
Formal data reports for CTD and moored array data will be prepared, along with
publications on plume dynamics. Focus will be on the momentum balance in the
plume, effects of the plume on wind-driven circulation over the inner shelf,
merging of tidal fronts into the plume, and the importance of interfacial mixing
to plume dispersion. ***
