The purchase of an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer will enable a series of
laboratory exercises in courses ranging from Crime Lab Chemistry to Modern
Scientific Methods. The exercises will enable students both to learn laboratory
skills and to design independent research projects. The Institute for Science
Education and Science Communication has a well established history of training
individuals in the media communication and teaching professions. A significant
proportion of these students are minorities and women. The Institute for Science
Education and Science Communication sees as its mission the ongoing education of
the public in science through the education of Columbia College communications
and teaching degree program students. Students are encouraged to incorporate
their major fields of study, personal interests, hobbies and cultural
backgrounds along with the use of state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation in
projects that may take the form of Paintings, films, videos, dances, theatrical
performances, poems, photoessays or even sculptures.
