This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
meteoroid paths and properties. The collaboration involves Cornell University
planetary scientists, led by Joseph Burns, and astronomers, Alessandro
Morbidelli and Christiane Froeschle, at the Nice Observatory. They will study
numerically the tortuous paths that meteoroids traverse on their routes from
their source bodies to Earth. In particular, they will focus on 1) the
interpretation of numerically derived trajectories using analytical models, and
(2) realistic simulations of the meteoroid histories (incorporating collisions,
radiation forces). The US investigators bring to this collaboration expertise in
planetary science and numerical computation. This is complemented by French
strengths in celestial mechanics and modern dynamical systems. The project will
advance understanding of the complicated paths that meteoroids travel through
the inner solar systems and conditions at the solar system's birth.
