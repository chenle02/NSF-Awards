This research addresses the degradation and subsidence resulting from permafrost
thawing. These events must be taken into account in the designing of cold region
structures like roads, railroads, airfields, dams, pipelines, and buildings. A
predictive model will be developed where the permafrost thaw consolidations will
be described, taking into account the simultaneous phenomena in water, ice and
of heat flow in consolidating porous media. This unique problem of multiphase
transport is governed by nonlinear equations and will be solved by the developed
finite element technique. The results will give the temporal and spatial
distribution of pore water pressure, temperature, ice content, and displacments
in an unsaturated, thawing, deformable soil.
