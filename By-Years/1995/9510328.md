A state of flux exists when organizations can be characterized by frequent
changing of roles and titles, high rates of personnel turnover, task force
organizing based on critical expertise, and a lack of bureaucratic hiearachy.
Under these conditions, ad hoc organizations may form in response to rapidly
changing situations. This award supports a Research Planning Grant to formalize
a set of research questions and conduct a preliminary study into the processes
underlying the establishment of ad hoc organizations within governments. This
RPG will assess the feasibility of collecting information on the fit between the
operation of governmental organizations and the organizational theory of ad hoc
groups. If appropriate, a detailied research plan will follow. The specific
focus of the planning grant is on the operations of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) and their responses to unanticipated events such as the
Los Angeles/Northridge earthquake of November 8, 1993.
