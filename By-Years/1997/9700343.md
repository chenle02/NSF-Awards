The main objective of this proposal is better understanding of underlying atomic
and molecular processes involved in the microstructural evolution of
polycrytalline TiS2 and other powders synthesized using the thi-sol-gel process
previously proposed by the P.I. A secondary objective is to investigate the
electrochemical properties of the resulted thin layer, the influence of heat
treatment and of charging on the particulate microstructure. The effects of
particle size, shape, crystallite size, orientation and stoichiometry on the
elctrochemical properties and the mechanisms involved in the evolution of the
microstructure will be investigated using differential thermal and
thermogravimetric analyses, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. If
successful, the research may provide a method to synthesize an engineered
microstructure with optimal electrochemical properties. Applications include
electrochemical batteries. The preliminary test have indicated a dramatic
increase of the number of charging cycles for a given reduction in performance.
