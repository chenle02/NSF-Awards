This award supports participation in the conference "1st Northeastern Analysis
Meeting" to be hosted by The College at Brockport, State University of New York,
Brockport, NY, from October 14-16, 2016. The purpose of the conference is to
disseminate and exchange the latest ideas and developments in analysis, very
broadly defined. It is designed to promote communication between people from
different branches of Analysis. The organizers hope to establish an ongoing
conference series which will meet in the fall of every year and compliment the
Southeast Analysis Meeting which occurs in the spring of every year.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The scientific focus of the conference will cover the following
topics: Differential Equations, Probability, Dynamical Systems, Wavelets and
Analysis Methods in Image Processing. The conference will have thirteen plenary
talks, a large number of twenty minute time slots for contributed talks and two
open problem panel discussions. More information can be found on the conference
