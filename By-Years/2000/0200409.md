This grant provides funding for developing innovative algorithms for solving
scheduling problems with due dates. Almost every manufacturing and service
enterprise must schedule something; jobs through a shop, customers to
appointments, or trucks to delivery stops. Often a specific time for each job,
customer etc., called a due date, is promised. Meeting these due dates is very
important both for customer satisfaction and economic reasons. It is well known
that these are among the most difficult problems to solve optimally. Optimal
algorithms, which can solve realistically sized problems, will be developed for
basic models, e.g. single processors. These algorithms will combine mathematical
programming with traditional scheduling approaches. They will then be extended
to more complex models such as flow shops. The algorithms will be
computationally tested to verify their efficacy. These tests will also be used
to explore what factors make an instance difficult to
solve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will lead to improved
ability to schedule in both manufacturing and service environments. The
resulting schedules will have better on-time performance as well as reduced
costs. To verify results, one of the algorithms will be incorporated into a
larger production control software package being developed for the Tunisian
textile industry. Additionally, the solution methods proposed for these problems
should also have application to other difficult combinatorial problems, such as
routing, network design and analysis, reliability and project selection.
