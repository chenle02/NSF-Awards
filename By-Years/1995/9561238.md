9561238 Putnam This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project develops
an economic model and accompanying software with which to measure the dollar
value of an arbitrary international patent portfolio. The discrete choice to
file a patent application in each of a set of foreign countries is held
constant, and the cross-sectional variation in market size and the quality of
patent protection is exploited to recover the underlying value distribution.
Although this method is not without flaws, it possesses several advantages over
the only other method that has been used to assign dollar values to the
distribution, namely patent renewal models; for example, it generates ex ante
value estimates of the worldwide return to patent protection, even for countries
with zero renewal fees, rather than ex post estimates for a single country. The
principal focus of Phase I research is determining the feasibility of
transferring this method to the level of the firm. After appropriate
modifications to the model, it is to be tested in three contexts: (1) cross-
sectionally, on four critical technology datasets from the l990s; (2) over time,
on a set of pharmaceutical patents from the last 15 years; (3) in conjunction
with firm-level total factor productivity estimates, employing a subset of the
pharmaceutical data. There are as many potential applications for this method as
there are current uses of R&D input data and patent statistics. Firm-level uses,
which are the focus of this project include: estimation of firm- and business
unit-level productivity; valuation of patent portfolios for licensing, merger
and acquisition, and securities analysis; strategic R&D management; competitive
intelligence assessment; and policy analyses of international competitiveness.
