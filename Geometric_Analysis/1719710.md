This award supports speakers and participants in the conference "Groups and
Computation: Interactions between Geometric Group Theory, Computability and
Computer Science," to be held at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken
NJ, June 26-30, 2017. The conference will bring together experts in geometric
group theory, computability theory and computer science to discuss recent
developments and interactions between these subjects, and to create a roadmap
for future cooperation. The junior faculty, postdocs, and graduate students
attending the conference will benefit from interacting with senior researchers
in several disciplines and establishing valuable professional connections and
collaborations. In addition to the regular scientific program, the conference
will feature a presentation and a discussion on Wikipedia editing in
Mathematics, including a practical how-to guide and demonstration.

Interaction with computation permeated the development of geometric group
theory, from the work of Max Dehn in the 1910s, through the work of Turing in
1930s, the Novikov-Boone Theorem in the 1950s and the theory of word-hyperbolic
and automatic groups in the 1990s, to the present day. Now group theorists are
interested not just in decidability of various problems but in specific low-
complexity estimates. Various data compression techniques (such as straight-line
programs, power circuits, etc.) have found amazing applications to group-
theoretic decision problems. In turn, geometric group theory has repaid in kind
and produced powerful ideas that have found applications in computer science and
computability theory. Thus, the notion of "generic-case complexity" as a way of
capturing the practical behavior of an algorithm on "most" inputs (and distinct
from average-case complexity) was born in geometric group theory. This notion
has led to the development of the theory of coarse and generic computability in
computational complexity, which is now transforming that subject. The ideas of
CAT(0) cubical geometry, coming from geometric group theory, are finding useful
applications in computational topology, robotics, and computer science. The
conference aims to take stock of these developments and map possible future
venues of interaction between geometric group theory, computer science and
computability theory.
