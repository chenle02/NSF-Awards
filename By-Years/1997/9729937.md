9729937 Wu Males and females from different species have different means of
communications in the form of sound, odor or visual display. Such differences
usually preclude members of one species from recognizing members of another
species as potential mates. As a result, a barrier to gene flow, commonly
referred to as reproductive isolation, is established between diverging species.
Without this reproductive barrier, nascent species will exchange genes freely
and different forms of life will merge into intermediate types. Thus, the
biological mechanisms of reproductive isolation are essential for maintaining
biodiversity. Understanding the genetics of reproductive isolation also has many
practical implications in conservation biology and in pest control. However, the
genetic basis of male-female communications has never been rigorously explored.
This may be due to a lack of species that i) are amenable to genetic analysis;
ii) show strong reproductive isolation; and iii) are at an incipient stage of
speciation. We have discovered a new system in the model organism for genetic
research, Drosophila melanogaster , that would alleviate all these problems.
Females of this species from Zimbabwe (Z-type) and males from the cosmopolitan
collections (M-type) fail to communicate properly. All the modern tools of
molecular genetics can be applied to the study of the genetic control of male-
female communication in this system.
