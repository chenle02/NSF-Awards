This award will support the attendance of early career researchers at the Gordon
Research Seminar on Centromere Biology, which will be at on July 28-29 2018 at
the Mount Snow Center in West Dover, Vermont. The format of the meeting is a
combination of talks and posters, which will promote scientific exchange in both
formal and informal settings. One session is devoted to the professional
development and mentoring of early career scientists. There will be ample
opportunity for sharing the latest research results and for
networking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Centromere is a region on a eukaryotic
chromosome at which the kinetochore is assembled. Kinetochore and centromere to
which it attaches jointly drive chromosome movement during cell division. This
conference establishes centromere biology as a distinct field of study with a
coherent research community, working across scales from understanding protein
assembly and biochemical pathways to defining patterns of inheritance. A
specific aim of this research seminar is to provide young scientists with a
welcoming environment and provide an opportunity to actively and openly discuss
their research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
