The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable the
realization of extremely small, light, high frequency, high inductance, low
interference, and cost effective passive electronic devices and components,
through the self-rolled-up membrane nanotechnology. The novel form factor for 3D
electromagnetic energy storage and confinement could enable breakthrough
applications for consumer electronics, smart cities, and the Internet of Things.
If successful, this technology can revolutionize the market for high frequency
low noise system-on-chip, portable communication devices at 5G and beyond, and
wearable electronics, power electronics, wireless sensors for medical imaging
and positioning, and wireless body area networks.

This I-Corps project is based on the self-rolled-up membrane (S-RuM)
nanotechnology for extreme miniaturization of passive electronic devices and
components. It provides a novel fabrication pathway for realizing devices in 3D
that are extremely small and light, with significantly enhanced functionalities.
The overarching principle of S-RuM nanotechnology is strain-driven spontaneous
deformation of 2D membranes into 3D architectures. For coil inductors, instead
of spiraling the metal wires in plane to increase the inductance, the S-RuM
inductors have the metal wires spiraling normal to surface, which naturally
minimizes the in-plane footprint. The ultra-small enclosed footprint inevitably
enables high frequency operation because of the minimum overlap capacitance with
the substrate. Much higher inductance can be achieved because of the strong
positive mutual coupling between the turns. In particular, on-chip 3D radio
frequency (RF) /microwave/millimeter wave passive devices can be realized that
are 1 ? 2 orders of magnitude smaller than those fabricated with conventional
CMOS-compatible 2D processes.
