The proposed research proposes to develop novel image processing and machine
learning algorithms for the detection and segmentation of cancerous regions from
high-resolution images of tissue slides, distinguishing them from healthy/benign
regions. The proposed research plans to advance (i) A reliable framework for use
in the accurate segmentation of cancerous regions in tissue slides; (ii) New
algorithms for texture analysis; (iii) Innovative representations that can
increase the system throughput; (iv) Effective machine learning techniques and
transparent user interfaces to assist in the reduction of the time that a
pathologist needs to examine each slide; and (v) Extensive testing to a variety
of cancers including prostate and breast cancer.

The proposed work has the potential to yield algorithms to facilitate the design
of systems that can increase the likelihood of cancer detection. The work is
supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members
of the center and has the potential to extend the center?s portfolio. The PIs
plan to introduce the research content into summer robotic camps for middle
schoolers from underrepresented groups, create a website along with a wiki,
visit local groups and K-12 schools, and include the research products into the
curricula of the participating institutions.
