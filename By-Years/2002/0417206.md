DMS-0134938&lt;br/&gt;Brooke E. Shipley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
component of this proposal involves several questions which fall into two
overall projects. One project is to consider &lt;br/&gt;when an equivalence
between derived categories is induced by a &lt;br/&gt;more richly structured
equivalence. The goal here is to develop &lt;br/&gt;an obstruction theory for
realizing derived equivalences by &lt;br/&gt;underlying structured equivalences.
In particular, this may have applications to the question associated to Broue's
Conjecture in &lt;br/&gt;representation theory of which stable equivalences lift
to derived equivalences. The second project is to develop homotopy theoretic
algebraic models. One piece of this project is to continue work &lt;br/&gt;with
John Greenlees on algebraic models for rational equivariant cohomology theories.
More generally, the investigator proposes &lt;br/&gt;to develop algebraic models
for various stable homotopy theories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
research projects involve the interplay beween the &lt;br/&gt;study of algebraic
structures and topology, the study of shapes &lt;br/&gt;or spaces. Algebraic
topologists use algebraic structures to &lt;br/&gt;describe and simplify
topological phenomena. In a project on&lt;br/&gt;realizing derived equivalences,
the investigator hopes to use techniques developed in algebraic topology to
attack questions &lt;br/&gt;which originate in algebra. These techniques include
the use &lt;br/&gt;of a theory of obstructions, which determines whether certain
constructions are possible. In another project the &lt;br/&gt;investigator plans
on extending existing algebraic models to &lt;br/&gt;include structures
involving symmetries. The educational &lt;br/&gt;component of this proposal also
includes several parts. &lt;br/&gt;The investigator will be involved in the
summer research &lt;br/&gt;programs for undergraduates at the University of
Chicago &lt;br/&gt;and Purdue University. With Lucho Avramov, she will organize
&lt;br/&gt;a workshop on topics related to derived categories of interest
&lt;br/&gt;to a broad range of algebraically related fields. With &lt;br/&gt;Jim
McClure and Guershon Harel, the investigator will develop &lt;br/&gt;a new
course for mathematics education majors based on Euler's ``Elements of Algebra".
The goals of this course are to help mathematical education students master
skills in algebra, &lt;br/&gt;develop confidence for teaching algebra, and
understand the &lt;br/&gt;motivation for material contained in a standard
abstract &lt;br/&gt;algebra course. The investigator will also participate in
several aspects of the Women in Science Program at Purdue University.
