This project will develop an integrated computer laboratory for general science
education at Palomar College. The project involves design, implementation, and
evaluation of an integrative curriculum for three cohorts of students enrolled
in the designated general education biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy,
geography, geology, and oceanography classes. Organized around the theme of
oceanography, collaborative research projects and daily assignments are
integrating industry-related curricula into introductory science courses and
addressing career awareness and student interactions with the professional
scientific community. The computer lab is bridging scientific theory with
industry applications. The project is facilitating student learning in an open
computer lab environment. It also provides a model for a four-part faculty
enhancement program. Faculty have the opportunity to develop relationships with
scientists and others in industry, integrate curriculum, and develop learning
communities. A Teacher's Resource Guide and a train-the-trainer program are
ensuring local and national project information dissemination.
