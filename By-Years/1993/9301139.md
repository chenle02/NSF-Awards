This is an award to provide support for exploratory research on a highly
specific immunoassay assay procedure using a monoclonal antibody bioassay
procedure for detecting the presence of nitrifying bacteria in water, wastewater
and soil. The research extending developing a collection of monclonal antibodies
from Nitrosomonas europaea, labeling these antibodies with a commercial
secondary antibody, and quantifying the selectivity of the nitrifier antibodies
against all known fresh-water nitrifying bacterial genera and a select group of
common environmental heterotrophs. Nitrification is currently an important
objective in treatment of wastewaters and is likely to become mandatory by the
turn of the century. This project addresses the problem of obtaining a clear
means of establishing and identifying the potential for achieving nitrification
within biological wastewater treatment processes. It was submitted under
conditions outlined in NSF 89-85, Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER).
