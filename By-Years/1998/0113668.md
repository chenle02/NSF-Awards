&lt;br/&gt;For the next generation Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) circuits,
the signal delay will be dominated by parasitic resistance (R), capacitance (C),
and inductance (L) of the interconnect. The ability to extract
RCL&lt;br/&gt;parasitic quickly and accurately is crucial to the design and
verification of large VLSI circuits. This project will develop innovative
algorithms and software for fast and accurate extraction of RCL parasitic of
VLSI&lt;br/&gt;circuits. The main goal of the project is the design of
preconditioned iterative methods for solving the linear systems arising in
inductance and capacitance extraction problems. Solvers for the inductance
problem will&lt;br/&gt;use a novel solenoidal basis approach to precondition a
reduced system implicitly, leading to rapid convergence of the iterative
methods. Fast approximations to the matrix-vector products with dense system
matrices&lt;br/&gt;will be computed using efficient hierarchical methods.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parallelism in the algorithms will be exploited to develop
high-performance software that is capable of tackling large problems. Software
developed for this project will be portable across a variety
of&lt;br/&gt;parallel architectures. It is anticipated that the code will
deliver the performance necessary for parasitic RCL extraction of deep sub-
micron VLSI circuits of realistic sizes. &lt;br/&gt;
