INTERDISCIPLINARY (99) This project builds upon the well-established benefits of
Calibrated Peer Review (CPR) for implementing a writing-to-learn pedagogy in
STEM courses. Four institutions collaborate to extend both the software platform
and the instructional model to include visual communication and oral
presentation within engineering courses. The team develops and field-tests a
library of learning activities that fully exploit the CPR web-delivered
workspaces that (1) teach students how to recognize levels of accomplishment for
specific assignments, (2) guide peer review sessions that produce both
quantitative and qualitative formative assessment for students, (3) encourage
deep-structured student self-reflection both on task production and on task
process. Changing realities in the workplace have resulted in added emphasis on
professional skills within engineering education. More specifically, the
Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) includes an explicit
criterion that engineering graduates need to demonstrate the ability to
communicate effectively. However, instructors in content-intensive engineering
courses may be reluctant to add to their already heavy load of teaching /
grading by including communication exercises. As an asynchronous, online
learning environment, CPR helps engineering faculty to include engaging
communication assignments without dramatically increasing the workload. The
project starts with taxonomy of task types that encompass varieties of effective
visual and oral communication used in engineering practice. Performance criteria
are then extracted, and the CPR learning modules are designed upon this
framework. The materials and methods are disseminated through a website and by
workshops at national conferences.
