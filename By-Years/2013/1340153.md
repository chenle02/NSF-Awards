This project plans to develop and explore potential value of selenium nucleic
acids in 3D structure studies and drug discovery of the longer nucleic acids and
their protein complexes, especially drug target characterization. Nucleic acids
and their protein complexes have been recognized as important drugs targets in
cancer treatments. DNAs are frequent targets of many small-molecule drugs with
anticancer activities. High-resolution structures of DNAs and their ligand
complexes are critical in drug design, discovery, and mechanism study. X-ray
crystallography is one of the most direct and powerful tools for structure
determination of these macromolecules and complexes. Moreover, crystallography
is one of the best strategies to provide structure information of these
macromolecules with high resolutions. The research team is developing novel
selenium strategies to increase structure resolutions of nucleic acids and their
complexes with ligands (including proteins and small molecules) for drug target
study and drug development. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop and
commercialize the SeNA strategies for determining high-resolution crystal
structures of nucleic acids and their complexes with small molecule drugs (or
potential drugs) and protein complexes for disease study (such as cancer
research) and drug development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Se-nucleic acid research
will provide insights into nucleic acid chemistry and biochemistry, and the
structural and functional properties, which are of great interest to scientific
community as well as to the general public. Se-nucleic acids may lead to novel
materials and applications. Furthermore, this proposed project will allow the
widespread access to these valuable new materials. These potential discoveries
could encourage their widespread use and allow broader access to these unique
materials for function and structure studies.
