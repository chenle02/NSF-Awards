This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant biology for two
years. The project entitled "Gene expression during DNA endoreduplication in
Maize endosperm development" is to be carried out in the laboratory of Ronald L.
Phillips at University of Minnesota. The applicant, whose Ph.D. training focused
on the traditional genetics and breeding of potato, will carry out the molecular
cytogenetics studies of endosperm development in corn. The Postdoctoral
Fellowships in Plant Biology are designed to increase the number of outstanding
young investigators in plant biology.
