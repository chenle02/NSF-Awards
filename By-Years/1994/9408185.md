This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Facilities Program will
assist the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University in the purchase of an
upgrade of their computational facility using DEC Workstations. This equipment
will enhance research in a number of areas including the following: (1) Dynamics
and Structure in Complex Molecular Systems, (2) High Performance Computing for
Biophysical Spectroscopy, (3) Electronic Structures of Active Sites, (4)
Chemical Reactions Far From Equilibrium, (5) Molecular Dynamics Computer
Simulations, and (6) Theoretical and Computational X-ray Absorption
Spectroscopy. A workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a
new way to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a
"computer network" also serves as a development environment for new theoretical
codes and algorithms, and provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization
facilities.
