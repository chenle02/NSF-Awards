9724571 McDaniel A scanning nuclear microprobe users facility will be developed
at the University of North Texas. The users facility will be available to
universities, government laboratories and industry. Potential users have
applications in a variety of topics, including surface analysis, electronics,
art and archeology, biology, environment and geology. A workshop to be held in
conjunction with the yearly International Accelerator Conference in Denton, TX,
will train scientists and students on the uses of this facility. %%% The
microprobe being built is the finest instrument available at the time and the
center of a relatively unique facility in the country. ***
