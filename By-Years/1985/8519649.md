The research is an engineering approach to the solution of two fundamental
problems in designing systolic arrays, namely, restructuring of algorithms for
increased parallelism and efficient mapping of algorithms into systolic arrays.
Two major limitations in the state-of-the-art of existing transformation systems
are the nonexistence of powerful systematic semantic transformations and the
inability to systematically achieve optimality in the resulting designs. Efforts
are underway to investigate: new syntactic and semantic transformations on
complex algorithms for optimizing area, time, input/output and other parameters
in the systolic architecture; efficient methodology for mapping algorithms onto
two- or three-dimensional systolic arrays with feedbacks, replicated data,
general timing and limited or full broadcasting and other architectural
constraints; design of macropipelines of systolic arrays and the related
problems in interconnection, buffering, timing, and closure property; and design
of macropipelines of systolic arrays for image processing and pattern
recognition. Emphasis is on both theoretical and practical approaches in this
research. With the theory developed, an automated design tool will be
implemented so that it can be interfaced with existing VLSI design tools.
