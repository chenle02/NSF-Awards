This project is a dental microwear analysis of over 8000 specimens of the Plio-
Pleistocene cercopithecoid primates of East Africa. High resolution dental
impressions will be taken of teeth from most of the major East African sites.
Impressions will also be taken from museum collections of modern African
monkeys. As in previous dental microwear analyses, epoxy casts will be examined
under a scanning electron microscope (SEM); measurements of the size, shape, and
orientation of microscopic wear features will be computed from SEM micrographs;
measurements of macroscopic wear patterns will be computed with a three-
dimensional measuring microscope; and all measurements will be used in
statistical comparisons within and between modern and extinct taxa. The study of
dental microwear is one of the promising new techniques for obtaining detailed
information on the diet of fossil animals and humans. This analysis should lead
to new insights into (1) the methodology of dental microwear analysis, (2) the
phylogenetic change and adaptations of the Plio- Pleistocene cercopitheoid
primates, and (3) the paleo-ecology of the early hominid fossil sites of East
Africa.
