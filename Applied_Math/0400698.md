This research project continues development of mathematical techniques that are
motivated by applications to analysis of traffic on large networks and to
medical tomography. The problems under study require the use of ideas from
complex analysis in one and several variables, integral geometry, harmonic
analysis, and commutative algebra. A unifying factor is that there are two
technical elements that appear almost everywhere, residues and Radon transforms.
In the recent past, ideas dependent on the properties of residues over fields of
arbitrary characteristic were employed to study the complexity of solving large
systems of polynomial equations in many variables. These results have
applications to robotics, systems engineering, and communications. One of the
problems under study is the monitoring of large networks to detect early signs
of jamming or failure. The ideas used are akin to those in tomography, more
precisely, the inverse conductivity problem and the Radon transform in the
hyperbolic plane.

This project further develops sophisticated mathematical techniques that play a
central role in tomographic imaging and analysis of communication networks. The
results have potential application to improvement of three-dimensional medical
imaging and to increased understanding of internet traffic patterns and security
threats.
