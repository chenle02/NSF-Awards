ILI - Instrumentation Project: Economics Title: Economics Computer Laboratory
This project is designed to develop an computer laboratory where simulation
models can be used to create an active learning environment for economics
students. The principal investigator has written five software programs for
economics courses at Pomona College and will continue refining these programs
and writing other simulation software. However, there is currently no place at
the college where economics students can use these programs with each other and
with their professors. This project will develop a computer laboratory
(consisting of 5 IBM computers, 10 Macintoshes, and 1 printer) in the building
that houses the economics department, so that students will be able to work on
projects and assignments together--learning from each other and building a
shared sense of accomplishment.
