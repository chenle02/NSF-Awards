This dissertation research project supports an anthropology student from
Stanford University studying how people in British society interpret racial
differences, in light of the upcoming national census in that country where
racial identity will be recorded for the first time. Using an ethnographic
methodology, the student (who is Black) and a research assistant (who will be
White) will study how people living in Liverpool use concepts of national
identity like "Englishness" as implicitly racial terms, as well as explicitly
racial terms like "Asian" and "Black". In depth interviews will be conducted
with community activists and census officials on the political controversy over
racial categories in the census as well as with a sample of individual life
histories focusing on their perceptions of race in British history. The
investigators will also observe the teaching of British history in a senior
(high) school. This project is significant because it attempts to understand how
a democratic society similar to ours experiences racial change in their
population. Understanding how race and nationality are experienced in a similar
but less racially mixed situation will help us understand the sources of our own
values and behavior.
