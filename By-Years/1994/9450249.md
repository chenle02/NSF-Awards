9450249 Finkral There is an increasing need for instructional materials which
integrate mathematics, science and technology education. This project produces
several instructional packages for secondary school students which are
consistent with the standards from each of the disciplines. The units are
published as supplements in journals, such as TIES Magazine, The Technology
Teacher, The Mathematics Teacher and The Science Teacher, to reduce the lead
time from development to use. They are developed in a collaborative effort among
teachers, subject specialists, and practitioners from science and industry.
Local and national support is available to help teachers and groups of teachers
use the materials. The research and evaluation component measures the impact of
the units and provides models for increased use. The products include the units,
teacher guides for use of the materials and support via electronic means. Themes
to be engaged include science and technology of sports, biotechnology, music,
fire prevention, control systems, etc. ***
