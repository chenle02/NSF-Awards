*** Lee 9704090 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will
develop neuro-dynamic programming (NDP) methods to address a commercially
important complex stochastic control problem--that of supply-chain management.
The Phase I research successfully established that NDP algorithms could lead to
significant savings over well-accepted heuristics on a class of supply chains
that was used as a testbed. This Phase II program will further develop and
streamline the NDP methodology. Furthermore, algorithms will be generalized so
that they apply to a very broad class of realistic supply chains, including
manufacturing and distribution networks. Performance on these new problems will
be assessed through extensive experimentation and comparison with current state-
of-the-art heuristics. Once the NDP methodology is fully developed, licensing
arrangements will be sought to integrate NDP-based optimization modules into the
many supply-chain management products currently in widespread use. An improved
approach for addressing the logistics of supply-chain management will be of
great commercial interest to companies across all industries. Integration of the
technology into existing commercial supply-chain management softuare products
widely used in manufacturing can enhance the efficiency of numerous U.S.
corporations. Furthermore, the general NDP methods developed in this research
have a much broader potential scope, in that they can be used to address other
complex stochastic control problems that arise in many areas of national
importance, including process control, queuing and scheduling, and data network
optimization. *** p:/sbir/yhashimi/abstracts/9704090.doc
