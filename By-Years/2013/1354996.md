As the land bridge between the North and South America emerged, the fauna of the
region had opportunities to diversify into novel ecological niches. The ants of
the Mesoamerican corridor were particularly successful in rapidly diversifying
over these new mountain ranges and plant communities. This project will develop
a detailed biodiversity map for this ecologically dominant group of insects in a
biogeographically important region of the world. The investigators will build on
previous ant biodiversity collections and apply the latest techniques in
genomics to identify species and investigate how geological history and
contemporary ecological factors influence the distribution of biodiversity on
tropical mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genomic methods for identifying species
and their evolutionary relationships will revolutionize taxonomy and
biodiversity studies, with subsequent benefits to other fields of science,
agriculture, food inspection, public health, and invasive species detection.
Improved understanding of the origin and distribution of mountain species within
Mesoamerica is critical to evidenced-based conservation efforts and evaluation
of the impacts of habitat conversion and climate change. Training in
biodiversity science will occur at graduate and undergraduate levels at two
public universities. The researchers will partner with the Natural History
Museum of Utah to recruit undergraduates to science and reach out to the broader
public, with an emphasis on underserved groups and quantifiable assessment of
outreach activities.
