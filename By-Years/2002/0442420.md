Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is refining course
materials from a new top-down approach to teaching computer graphics and is
developing ways to assist others in adopting this new approach. The approach is
based on analyzing and implementing graphics applications with real-world
complexity. It is motivated by students' interest in computer graphics because
of their experience with graphics-based applications and their desire that their
courses will be directly applicable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit
of this project lies in facilitating a better understanding of fundamental
computer graphics concepts in real-world applications, resulting in improvements
of student motivation/retention with efficient
learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project lies in
creating a model for computer graphics courses in most existing
IT/CS/Engineering degree programs that supports working adults in both self-
learning the concepts and in practicing implementation of computer graphics
applications.
