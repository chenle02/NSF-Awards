This Research Opportunities for Women Research Planning Grant is in the general
area of inorganic chemistry. Dr. Sharon M. Palmer of the Chemistry Department of
Smith College will explore the use of metalloporphyrins as dye sensitizers on
metal oxide semiconductor electrodes in photoelectrochemical cells.
Metalloporphyrins have the long-lived excited states and high absorption
coefficients in the visible region necessary to harvest solar energy. Various
metalloporphyrins will be tested for photoefficiency and a stable chemical means
of attaching the porphyrins to the metal oxide electrode will be investigated.
Two undergraduate students will be involved in the project which, if promising,
will lead to a proposal for sustained study.
