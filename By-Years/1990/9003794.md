Dr. I. Y. Chan is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program to study electron signals from matter under very high pressure. These
measurements provide valuable insight into the properties of electrons in
molecules, generally, and the ability of electrons to dictate the structural and
dynamic properties of molecules in solids, specifically. This research involves
three areas of activity: (1) the extension of the high pressure spin-echo
technique to conventional microwave detection. This will greatly increase the
utility of magnetic resonance under pressure; (2) investigation of pressure
effects on the molecular properties of organic triplets, such as photophysical
processes and charge-transfer interactions; (3) pressure will be employed as a
new dimension in elucidating dynamical processes in molecular crystals such as
tunneling, spin-diffusion, libration and exiton transport.
