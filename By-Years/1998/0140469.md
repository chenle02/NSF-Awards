0140469&lt;br/&gt;Morin&lt;br/&gt;This award to Texas A&amp;M University
provides instrumentation to update, improve and expand the capabilities of the
TAMU Technical Support Group in conducting analysis of nutrients in seawater.
Specifically, it provides colorimeters, peristaltic pumps, a chart recorder, a
computer, and components for data acquisition. These shared-use systems will be
of substantial advantage to marine scientists using this group to support their
programs in ocean nutrient research during 2002 and future
years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
