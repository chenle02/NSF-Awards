The Board on Physics and Astronomy (BPA) serves as the focal point in the
National Research Council (NRC) for activities related to physics and astronomy
and their interactions with engineering, medicine, chemistry, biology, and other
sciences. The BPA's principal objectives are to maintain an awareness of the
status of research in physics and astronomy, to identify emerging needs, and to
initiate studies that address these problems and that foster continued progress.
The BPA fulfills these objectives by working closely with the physics and
astronomy communities in academia, federal agencies and their advisory
committees, government laboratories, industry, relevant scientific and technical
societies, and other boards and committees of the NRC.
