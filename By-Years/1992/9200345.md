This award provides funds to continue support for another year in the Department
of Biology at Augustana College. The program will support undergraduate
participation in a focused research program which integrates the research
activities of ten investigators from Augustana College (6), Univ. Nebraska (1),
The Nature Conservancy (1), South Dakota State Univ. (1), and Black Hills State
Univ. (1). The projects are integrated at the scientific level because of the
common interests in prairie ecology and paleoecology, and because aspects of
each project benefit from the applications of the stable isotopes of C and N to
the research methodology. A coherent group and a unique methodology will be used
to continue ecological and archeological reconstructions in a geographic area of
rich ecological resources and to encompass growing interest in diets and
physiology. Ten students (half women, half from off-campus) will study field and
laboratory problems with a common focus. They will be expected to gain some
mastery of the theoretical basis for their study as well as the experimental
design and ultimate interpretation. Weekly seminars and workshops will review
each project's theoretical basis and research design; enhance the students'
library, laboratory, data handling, and scientific writing skills; and broaden
their understanding of the related projects. The ten- week summer program and
academic year independent study will culminate in an REU Symposium in which each
student will present his/her interpreted results and conclusions and help
develop the hypotheses and research designs for next summer's projects.
Outstanding women in the field will be selected as seminar speakers and serve as
role models for all students and faculty. We will invite 20 high schools to
select an outstanding woman student to attend the REU Symposium and return for
one day in the summer.
