9412465 Hill Emory University Dr. Craig A. Hill, Chemistry Department, Emory
University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division for research into the development of
heteropolyoxometallates (HPOM) as homogeneous catalysts. The transfer of oxide
from an HPOM to alkanes will be developed because of its central importance to
any process which involves oxidative functionalization. The factors which
influence HPOM catalyzed oxidation using the environmentally advantageous
hydrogen peroxide will be evaluated. As catalysts normally have a finite
lifetime, new systems will be sought which will heal defects which occur in them
as they operate. Finally, the ability of HPOM's to induce reactions of very
unreactive materials such as diamond surfaces and to catalytically oxidize
hydrogen sulfide will be determined. Oxidation reactions are very common and
important in many areas of chemistry. On the industrial scale they are often
plagued by environmental problems because they either use or produce toxic,
potentially polluting substances. In this project a new class of environmentally
benign catalysts will be developed. The basic way in which they function will be
assessed and this knowledge will be used to design processes for oxidations of
very non-reactive materials and for the conversion of toxic hydrogen sulfide
into sulfur.
