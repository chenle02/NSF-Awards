All industries suffer the effects of biodeterioration. Any industry that moves
water and/or some other liquids can have problems related to the growth of
microorganisms on the exposed surfaces, i.e., biofilm formation. While the cost
of this deterioration problem is hard to assess, the figures available for the
corrosion component are estimated at $105 billion per year for the U.S.; the
microbial component of this cost is considered a major factor. Research
addressing this area can provide data for technologies to reduce the
deterioration. This project is studying the feasibility and viability for an
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Biofilm Research at Montana
State University. Alternative organizational structures, operations, and
policies, for this Center are being investigated. The research interest and
needs of industry is a major study focus. The potential for this proposed Center
to become self-sufficient with industry funding is being determined.
