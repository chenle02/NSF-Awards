The 2023 and 2024 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),
sponsored by the IEEE Communication Society, are to be held in Rome, Italy
between May 28 and June 1, 2023, and in Denver, CO on June 9-13, 2024,
respectively. IEEE ICC is a premier international conference of the IEEE
Communications Society and a major event in wireless communications and
networking that brings researchers and practitioners of every aspect of
digital/wireless communications and networks together to present up-to-date
results and achievements in the field. It is widely attended by researchers and
practitioners in the field. Participation in events like this is an extremely
important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to
interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading-edge work in
the field. Participants have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel
and keynote sessions, and interact with hundreds of other leading-edge
researchers in the field.

This proposal provides travel support for approximately twenty-six graduate
students in the United States to attend this premiere conference either in 2023
or in 2024. The travel awards will target first-time attendees and under-
represented minority students, since attending conferences is an important part
of their educational experience, and they often have limited travel funds. The
research community and the Engineering workforce benefit from the improvement of
students in the pipeline, and the introduction of new researcher perspectives.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
