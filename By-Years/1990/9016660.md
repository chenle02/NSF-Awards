This award supports a joint workshop between the U.S. and Argentina on fracture
and welding. The workshop will include 8 invited experts from the U.S., 4 from
Argentina and 4 from other Latin American countries. A large attendance is
expected from government labs, universities and private companies from different
Latin American countries. The workshop will be held December 9-13, 1991. During
the following week, December 16-20, the U.S. participants will be visiting other
research facilities in Argentina: INTEMA, Universidad de Mar del Plata; CONEA,
several locations in Buenos Aires and Instituto Balseiro in Bariloche. The U.S.
participants include the co-organizers: Dr. Hugo Ernst, Georgia Tech, Atlanta,
GA, and Dr. John Landes, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN. M. Luis de
Vedia of the Latin American Welding Foundation in Buenos Aires will be the
Argentine co-organizer. The main workshop theme is fracture and welding at both
ambient and high temperature. It will combine the latest work in fracture
characterization and prediction and apply it to problems of welded structures.
This workshop will benefit all sides involved by bringing together experts in
fracture and welding from the U.S. and several Latin American countries with the
goal of developing future cooperative work.
