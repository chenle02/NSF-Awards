The aims of the project are to develop implementation architectures and
conceptual foundations for SYNCHRONIZERS -- programs that reconcile copies of
replicated data after disconnected updates. More specifically, the project's
goals are (1) to develop high-level SPECIFICATIONS for various forms of
synchronization, in particular for the domains of file system synchronization
and synchronization for more general structured data presented as XML; and (2)
to build and distribute IMPLEMENTATIONS embodying these specifications. These
activities are tightly connected, and will proceed in parallel throughout the
project's lifetime. The results of the research will both be disseminated in the
form conference and journal publications and embodied in publically distributed
software. The long-term intention is both to advance the conceptual foundations
of synchronization tasks (in filesystems, databases, ad hoc network protocols,
and cooperative middleware layers) and, by offering clean designs and compelling
prototypes, to improve engineering practice in the area.
