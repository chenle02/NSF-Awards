EAR-9525336 Stern, Libby A. The oxygen and hydrogen isotope systematics of non-
carbonate minerals in altitudinal transects will be compared with oxygen isotope
values of cogenetic calcite and meteoric water. These data will: (1) quantify
the isotopic effects of soil water evaporation, and (2) test which soil minerals
are more useful as climate indicators. The assumption behind the method is that
soil minerals record the isotopic composition of meteoric water at the time of
their formation. The oxygen isotope value of pedogenic calcite has been used as
a proxy for climate, but the climate record preserved in other soil minerals is
largely unexplored. Because calcite does not form in soils in relatively humid
climates, this work, if successful, will greatly expand the environments in
which climatic indicators can be utilized.
