This award supports participation of students and junior researchers in the
Second Sectional Meeting of the Texas and Louisiana Section of SIAM (Society for
Industrial and Applied Mathematics) to be held in Dallas, Texas on November 1-3,
2019. The conference will be hosted by Southern Methodist University. The
conference program is available online at
http://faculty.smu.edu/sxu/SIAMTXLA19/index.html The conference program contains
three plenary talks: one on applications of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine
and two others on on the mathematics of imaging and seismology. There will be a
wide-ranging list of minisymposia on applications to biology, medicine, computer
science, materials, communications, and energy science, as well as current
topics such as machine learning. In addition, there will be an industrial panel
which will address job opportunities for applied mathematicians outside
academia. The conference format makes it easy for undergraduate students,
graduate students, and young investigators to directly interact with the leading
mathematicians who work on interdisciplinary problems at the frontiers of
science. Every effort has been made to ensure participation of women and members
of other under-represented in mathematics groups, thus increasing the diversity
of the regional applied mathematics research community.

The scientific topics to be discussed at the conference include artificial
intelligence in medicine, uncertainty quantification in hydraulic fracturing,
inverse problems and their applications to medical imaging, numerical methods
for nonlinear waves and turbulence, simulations of biological and complex
fluids, graph regularization of high dimensional data, modeling population
dynamics in ecology and epidemiology, as well as new research topics such as
mathematics of machine learning.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
