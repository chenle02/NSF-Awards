This project will attempt to develop new neural network approaches to solving
geometric combinatorial optimization problems. It will focus on the classical
Traveling Salesman Problem (with Euclidean distances) as an easy to state, NP-
complete problem needing efficient procedures yielding consistently good tours.
The much publicized Hopfield neural network approach to the TSP disappoints
operations researchers as cannot guarantee feasibility; hence, this project will
investigate adaptive neural network procedures which correspond to geometric
heuristic approaches, which exploit the "neural" property of learning, and which
have shown great promise in application to the problem. The procedures to be
considered will have to potential to be implemented as a neural system. Such
systems consist of processing units and weighted connections among them. They
exploit parallelism, and computations use local information (thus storage is
minimal). As chip technology expands and so-called "neural" chip become
available, the ability to find amendable methods will yield improved solution
approaches to many combinatorial optimization problems.
