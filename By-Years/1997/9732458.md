9732458 Morgan This experimental program investigates Rydberg atoms and
molecules in an electric field using scaled-energy spectroscopy. Combined with
closed orbit theory, the experiments permit a semi-classical parameterization of
photoabsorption which leads to a new way to examine Rydberg Stark states of
atoms and molecules in terms of classical closed orbits. Initial results on the
helium atom will be extended to other atomic and molecular sytems.
