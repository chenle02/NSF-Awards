Gastrotrichs are a poorly known group of aschelminths ("sac worms") that inhabit
the world's oceans. Their minute size (roughly a millimeter long) has hampered
their study, but Dr. William Hummon proposes an ambitious survey of gastrotrichs
from the Mediterranean and Red Seas. This collaborative effort will bring
together many European specialists and will result in a computer database of
species names, a synthesis of distribution data for Europe, and new protocols
for sampling, preserving, and studying gastrotrichs. Dr. Hummon will be testing
the use of video recording and computer digitizing specimens before they are
preserved and their original morphology is distorted. The proposed research will
represent a significant advance in gastrotrich taxonomy, and in our
understanding of the minute life forms that exist between sand grains. More
complete documentation of the diversity of marine life will have direct impact
on biogeographers, marine ecologists, and ecosystem scientists interested in the
coastal zone.
