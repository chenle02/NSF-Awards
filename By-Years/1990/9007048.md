This research is concerned with two projects in matrix theory. For the first
project, G is an undirected graph on n vertices and M(G) is an associated convex
cone. The principal investigators will examine the structure of the extreme
matrices, particularly when M(G) has extreme points of large rank. The second
project is concerned with determining the extreme points of a collection of
certain semidefinite matrices. They will investigate whether the rank and
sparsity pattern alone determine if a matrix is an extreme point. A matrix is a
rectangular array with possible entries from a wide variety of rings. This is a
field which originated in the nineteenth century as part of algebra. It is
currently very active in view of its many applications and connections with
other parts of mathematics and other scientific and technical disciplines.
