0423213&lt;br/&gt;Koranyi&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports a
U.S.-India cooperative research project on homogeneous operators on Hilbert
space between Professors Adam Koranyi, City University of New York (CUNY) H. H.
Lehman College and Gadadhar Misra, Poornaprajna Institute of Scientific
Research, Bangalore. They will address a number of open questions on homogeneous
operators, including the classification of Cowen-Douglas operators. Combining
Koranyi's expertise in representation theory with that of Indian collaborator
Misra on homogeneous operators has considerable potential for solving basic
problems in a difficult, high-risk, high-gain area of investigation. This
collaboration could contribute significantly to fundamental knowledge and lead
to substantial progress in solving well-known problems in operator theory.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The US and Indian investigators are distinguished
mathematicians with complementary backgrounds and will join forces in trying to
solve difficult technical problems. The collaboration is likely to advance
operator theory and broadly impact those working in the field. It will have a
beneficial effect on the teaching and research activities at both the CUNY
Graduate Center and at the Poornaprajna Institute in Bangalore&lt;br/&gt;
