High peak power laser radiation focused onto a solid target can generate soft
x-rays from the laser-produced plasma with high conversion efficiency. These
x-ray sources are an attractive laboratory-scale alternative to synchrotron
radiation sources, stationary anodes, and pinch plasmas for the 0.3keV to 1KeV
region. The goal of this research program is to investigate the laser-produced
plasma as a source for x-ray lithography and microscopy. The Stanford group
estimates that with 200 watts average power from their compact solid-state slab
laser which is currently under development in this project, they should generate
sufficient soft-x-ray radiation for production-level integrated circuit wafer
exposure. They also seek to demonstrate that the plasma source will allow soft
x-ray microscopy with resolution below 1000 Angstroms.
