9407205 Siebenaller The low temperatures and high hydrostatic pressures of the
deep sea influence the structure and function of proteins and membranes in
marine animals. These environmental factors represent an important selective
force shaping the molecular evolution of organisms colonizing and inhabiting the
deep sea. This project addresses the influence of these environmental parameters
on the transduction of extracellular signals into intracellular effects. How
extensive are the effects of hydrostatic pressure on transmembrane signaling in
cold-adapted fishes? At the molecular level, what are the loci at which pressure
acts? How are species which live in deep water adapted to cope with the high
pressure? These studies will be conducted in marine teleost species which are
abundant at different depths. The effects of pressure will be examined for
membrane receptors which are coupled to adenylyl cyclase via guanine nucleotide
binding proteins (G proteins). Both receptors which negatively modulate adenylyl
cyclase and those which stimulate adenylyl cyclase will be examined.
