This award supports a planning project to develop a "Research and Study Abroad
Program" to avail U.S. undergraduate students access to the world-leading
research facilities at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN),
the World Health Organization and the various operations of the United Nations
based in Geneva, Switzerland. A facility is envisioned to house approximately
sixty American students in the greater Geneva community, to provide them with
proper supervision and security, to provide a structure for repatriating to
their U.S. institutes course credit for their participation in cutting-edge data
collection and analysis efforts at these facilities, and for any approved
courses they take during their research and field study abroad period. It is
expected, based on the experience of the CERN REU program, that the students
will contribute in real and meaningful ways to the research program underway at
CERN, and by extension, to the World Health Organization and other institutions
based in Geneva.
