This project will implement the initial phase of a multi-year, international
cooperative project to collect deep seismic reflection data across the
Himalaya/Tibet Plateau collision zone, the type example of a continent-continent
collision. The goal of the project is to delineate the major structual features
of the Tibetan lithosphere that have evolved during the collision process, and
through this contribute substantially to an understanding of the evolution of
continental lithosphere as a whole. During the initial phase of the project the
principal investigators intend to carry out, in cooperation with the Ministry of
Geology and Mineral Resources of the People's Republic of China (MGMR), a test
survey of approximately 100 km length in order to (1) define the logistical
requirements for deep reflection profiling in this unique area, and (2) address
a key geologic problem relating to the evolution of the plateau. This initial
test is an essential prelude to full scale profiling across the Himalaya/Tibet
Plateau region.
