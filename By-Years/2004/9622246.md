9622246 Gupta A proper encapsulation is essential for high-assembly yields and a
long-term reliability of the chip in the semiconductor manufacturing. However,
if the mold-geometry, encapsulating material and the processing conditions are
not selected properly, the flow during the transfer molding of plastic may
produce a gapwise movement of the microchip/leadframe assembly as well as deform
the connecting wires. Currently, the mold design is based upon trial-and-error
approach. This collaborative GOALI award will develop a software tool for flow
simulation of the encapsulation process so that the mold designer will be able
to predict the defects in the molded device and modify the molding process
accordingly to reduce the assembly defects during production. This work is
likely to provide significant advancement in the development of a combined
fluid-flow/curing model which is expandable to other applications outside of the
encapsulation processes.
