Abstract The Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held spring and
fall since its founding in 1989, a total of 41 times. The conference has become
an extremely successful semiannual event in the Southwest. The next series of
conferences will have six primary sponsoring universities: The University of
Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, Rice University, the University of
Houston, Texas Tech University, and Texas Christian University. The conference
is designed to enhance both the educational and the research atmosphere of the
active community of geometers and topologists in Texas and the surrounding
states. The conference is committed to bring researchers of national and
international stature to discuss their research and to interact with
mathematicians from Texas and surrounding states. Summaries of talks with
notation of important results have been publicly reported for some time and will
continue similarly in the future. By design, the Texas Geometry and Topology
Conference has two high-impact foci. First, the conference makes it possible for
the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states (a
huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular basis. This
both stimulates individual research and generates productive cooperative efforts
between schools. Second, the conference is committed to the strengthening and
enrichment of the mathematics personnel base. In order that there be no barrier
to participation, the conference is widely advertised, participation is open,
and there are no registration fees. Graduate students, junior faculty, women,
minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to
participate and to apply for support. Furthermore the conference is partnering
with two historically black universities (Fayetteville State University and
Prairie View A&M University) on a pilot project to foster research opportunities
for junior faculty.
