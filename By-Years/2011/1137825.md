This award will support an NSF/CMBS regional conference to be held at the
University of California at Santa Cruz in the summer of 2012 on the topic of
statistical model uncertainty and multiplicity. The principal speaker will be
Professor James Berger from Duke University. This award will support 29
participants at different stages of their careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
conference will address longstanding methodological challenges of statistical
model uncertainty and multiplicity along with the recent developments in the
area that have been driven by 21st century scientific applications such as
complex models and large data sets. The conference aims to attract new
researchers to this field by providing a well-organized overview and also
intends to strengthen links and collaborations between multiple groups of
researchers in the western United States.
