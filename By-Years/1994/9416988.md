Abstract United Health Services Hospital - M. Donnelly Connection to NSFNET
Proposal No. NCR-9416988 United Health Services Hospitals is a not-for-profit
organization, located in Upstate New York and composed of two, community,
teaching hospitals, an urgicenter, and five primary care clinics. UHSH fosters a
strong primary care physician base referring to medical and surgical specialties
in an atmosphere of commitment to education and research. Through Internet, many
clinicians, educators, researchers and administrative personnel at UHSH will
have global electronic mail, immediate access to electronic publications, active
membership in discussion lists, on-line search from extensive databases, instant
transfer of files and software from remote sources, and entry to network and
remote computer services. There is already an optical fiber connection between
the two hospitals. There are plans for the parent company to implement a similar
connection for the Ideal Senior Living Center by the end of 1994. This will
enable Internet access for three institutions. This proposal presents the
significance of the connection to clinical care, education and research at UHSH
and shows the methodology and hardware for making the connection effective.
