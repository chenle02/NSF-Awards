This research explores algorithms and techniques for symbolic analysis of large
linear or linearized integrated circuits in the complex frequency domain. The
approach is to extract transfer functions of circuits in symbolic form. In the
case of large circuits, approximate symbolic network functions, in expanded or
nested format, are generated. Both perturbation-based, and tree enumeration
approaches are being used. The symbolic algorithms and simulators are being
integrated into an analog design automation system.
