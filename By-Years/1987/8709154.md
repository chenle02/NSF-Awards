Large-eddy breakup devices have been shown to reduce substantially the viscous
drag in turbulent boundary layers. This study investigates the modification of
the heat transfer characteristics of turbulent boundary layers by such devices.
Both averaged and instantaneous measurements of the heat transfer will be
performed. The measurements will be obtained by a two-dimensional array of sub-
miniature thermocouples, and will allow the determination of the instantaneous
spatial thermal field and its evolution in time.
