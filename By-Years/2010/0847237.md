This CAREER project focuses on the problem of intergroup bias and considers the
way that gender affects its expression. Drawing from two influential theories
within social psychology known as social identity theory and social dominance
theory, the proposed research examines the psychology of antipathy towards men
of social out-groups. In carrying out this research, the PI tests a major
component of social dominance theory previously dubbed "the subordinate male
target hypothesis," and extends it to a more general "out-group male target
hypothesis" that is consistent with the aims of the proposal. Specifically, this
highly innovative project examines the way that men and women psychologically
represent intergroup bias differently, and the way that the gender of the out-
group target affects how those representations are expressed. Do men and women
have different motivational systems that account for extreme reactions to out-
group males? The research proposed addresses this question and other related
ones with a rich methodology that includes eight experiments that (a) employ
aversive conditioning protocols using group/gender categories as target stimuli,
(b) assess the effect of menstrual cycle timing on implicit bias against out-
group men, and (c) explore reasoning biases in moral dilemmas that require
behavioral responses with life or death consequences of individuals from various
social categories within artificial, yet realistic virtual environments.
Ultimately, this research will permit a fuller understanding of the
psychological mechanisms underlying this particular form of out-group animus,
and shed light on the impacts of gender, physiological states, as well as
judgments and actions in moral dilemmas on the expression of bias.
