Recent research in operating systems has led to major strides in the
structuring of services using microkernels. Leading researchers and developers
agree that future systems will be based on microkernels and will rely on
customization of specific operating systems services to a specific application
environment. In response to the trend toward customizing operating systems, this
project focuses on developing an undergraduate operating systems laboratory
built upon a network of dedicated Power PCs using the IBM Microkernel. The
department is replacing its existing undergraduate-level operating systems and
computer networks courses with two new courses, Operating Systems I and II, that
use the IBM microkernel-based system as a reference point and a medium to
perform system-level experimentation. Class materials, including lab exercises
based on the microkernel, can be made available over World Wide Web. This
project is securing a network of IBM Power PC workstations.
