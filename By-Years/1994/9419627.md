The objective of this application is to replace inoperative equipment and to
upgrade obsolescent equipment of the shared instrumentation facility of the
department. Each of the investigators on this application is involved in the
preparation of pure proteins and nucleic acids and the study of their
properties, structure, and function. These purifications require both low and
high speed centrifugations. Most also involve the separation of complex mixtures
of biomolecules into pure constituents. Recent technological innovations have
made such separations much faster and simpler. To this end, we are requesting a
perfusion chromatography apparatus with suitable detectors. Many of the activity
measurements and most of the sequencing reactions involve radioactive assays. To
this end, we are requesting a scintillation counter. All instruments will be
used on a shared basis. Experience shows this to be the most cost-effective way
to use modern instrumentation. Individual users will contribute to the
maintenance contracts of these instruments once the warranties expire. The
sharing of maintenance contracts is also the most cost-effective way of using
the equipment.
