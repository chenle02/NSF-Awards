This award to Professor Frank Gomez of the California State University, Los
Angeles, is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the
Chemistry Division. A primary objective is to couple on-column reactions with
affinity-based separations for the dual purposes of high-throughput synthesis
and rapid analysis. In addition, capillary electrophoresis will be further
developed to assess binding constants for substrate-protein and substrate-DNA
interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New analytical techniques are needed for the
study of disease and improve public health. The proposed studies will focus on
developing these new techniques by examining model biological systems with the
long-term goal of developing useful techniques to study diseases including
cancer, Alzheimer's, and Parkinsons. In addition, the proposed research effort
will provide undergraduate and minority students a solid background in chemistry
by examining problems at the interface of chemistry and chemistry-related
disciplines. The research projects planned for the participants are aimed at
demonstrating the interdisciplinary nature of CE and its importance as a new and
exciting instrument in solving broad scientific problems.&lt;br/&gt;
