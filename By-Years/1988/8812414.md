This project provides support for continuing work on boundary problems
associated with families of first-order systems of overdetermined, elliptic
differential equations. The corresponding differential operators originate in
the generalized potential theory in harmonic analysis on both Euclidean and
Riemannian symmetric spaces. Applications to Euclidean Hardy-space theory and to
explicit realization of unitarizable exceptional representations of semi-simple
Lie groups will be made. Because of emphasis on group invariances, polynomial
invariant theory will play an increasingly important role in these
investigations. Further work on the group-theoretic connections will also be
carried out. The ellipticity of the systems ensures the completeness of the
normed spaces in which the solutions can be found while the over-determinedness
allows one to study just the harmonic real parts of the (complex) functions
under consideration.
