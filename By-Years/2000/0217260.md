Over the past decade, wireless sensor networks have evolved from primarily
unidirectional star networks into a wide variety of forms, with large-scale
research programs and significant commercialization activity. These systems will
increasingly connect the physical world to wide-area networks for monitoring and
control purposes including homeland defense and industrial applications. Yet
relatively little is known on the fundamental limits to how efficiently a
network can glean useful information from the environment to process it and
relay it to the larger public network. Research is being conducted on
fundamental limits in four areas: the rate distortion region for correlated
sources, capacity for distributed nodes, packet delay across networks, and the
dependability of heterogeneous wireless networks. These four topics collectively
address many of the important parameters in sensor network design and will allow
practical algorithms to be tested against fundamental limits.
