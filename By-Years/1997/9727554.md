Papitashvili abstract The investigators will develop an electromagnetic model of
ionospheric conductivity at high latitudes at both the northern and southern
hemispheres for variable interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. Two
existing IMF-dependent models - the Geomagnetic Linear Regression model and the
Spherical Harmonic Electric Field model derived from spacecraft data - will be
used together with the Spherical Harmonic Field-aligned Current model for
variable IMF, which is now under development. The major new element in the
proposed research is a statistical model of ionospheric conductivity for
variable IMF and solar wind conditions. This model differs from available
statistical ionospheric conductivity models and will provide additional insight
and better understanding of the ionospheric convection responses on the large-
scale interaction of the solar wind with Earth's magnetosphere. The model can
also be used for calibration purposes between a variety of satellite-based,
radar, and ground magnetometer models of the ionospheric potential and
convection. These models are important elements in improving predictive
capabilities for space weather.
