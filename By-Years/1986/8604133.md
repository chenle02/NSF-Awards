The phenomenon of hydrodynamic instability, which gives rise to transient
"fingers" through the vadose zone will be studied. A systematic set of
experiments will be performed to define the factors and circumstances causing
fingering, the consequent flow patterns (spatial and temporal) for water and
solutes. Laboratory experiments will be followed by field trials. The ultimate
aim will be to use the data in developing a physically based mathematical model
describing recharge processes which can be tested in the field. The model will
also serve as a predictive tool in guiding the location and lining of waste-
disposal facilities.
