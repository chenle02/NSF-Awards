9306485 Simon In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of
the Chemistry Division, John Simon will apply a variety of experimental
techniques to investigate the photochemistry of chlorine oxides and nitrogen
oxides in solution in order to determine information about their gas-phase
behavior. The photodynamics will be followed by time-resolved electronic and
infrared absorption as well as electronic emission. Samples will be examined in
polar and inert nonpolar solvents as well as in optically transparent glasses.
The PI will interact with scientists at other research institutions in order to
develop a more complete understanding of the photoreactivity of these species.
%%% Many chemical reactions give different products when they take place in a
liquid phase than the same reactions do in the gas phase. This work will help
determine the effect of solvents on chemical reactivity. These solution-phase
studies will also offer a means of determining in a controlled manner the
chemical behavior of atmospherically important chemicals under the influence of
light source such as the sun. As a result of these investigations our
understanding of tropospheric and stratospheric photochemical processes will be
enhanced. ***
