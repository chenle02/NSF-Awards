This Accomplishment-Based Renewal project continues the PI on a new approach to
brain-like intelligent control called `Model Based Adaptive Critics.` It will
attempt to unify our understanding of this approach as it relates to competing
approaches such as brute-force optimization over time, classical methods,
backpropagation through time, and so on. It will develop and investigate new
designs based on this approach. In addition, it will attempt to generate a
deeper understanding of stability and convergence issues important to real-world
industry applications.
