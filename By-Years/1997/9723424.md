Dickinson 9723424 Flight in insects is a complex form of locomotion that
requires an array of physiological and morphological specializations. The
research to be done under this award to the PI will focus on how muscles,
skeletons, and brains function together to enable flying animals to perform
elaborate aerial maneuvers. The research in this proposal focuses on flies,
which although using relatively simple brains, are capable of elaborate flight
behavior. Flies are unique among all flying animals in possessing specialized
sensory structure called halteres that serve as a gyroscopes during flight. The
first goal of the research is to study how the halteres are used to increase
flight stability. These experiments will employ a mechanically-oscillating
flight arena to characterize the behavioral responses elicited by angular
perturbations. The second goal of the project is to use a large scaled model of
a flapping fly to determine how changes in wing motion effect the production of
aerodynamic forces. The third goal of the research is to combine
electrophysiology with high-speed video imaging to characterize how steering
muscles act to change the motion of the wings during flight. These first three
sets of experiments will determine how animals use corrective reflexes to
maintain stable flight. The final portion of the project is to determine how
animals initiate voluntary maneuvers when they are actively searching their
environment for food or mates. This research will contribute to the
understanding of the rapid neural processing and aerodynamic mechanisms that are
required to produce sophisticated flight behavior.
