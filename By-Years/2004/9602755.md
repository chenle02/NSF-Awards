Funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will be used to support
the restoration of research laboratories, shared facilities, and basic
infrastructure for four basic science departments at the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine. The University has undertaken a multi-phased
initiative for modernizing facilities dedicated to the basic sciences. This
project will support Phase II renovations within three buildings of a five
building complex: the Woods Basic Science building constructed in 1961, the
Physiology building constructed in 1929, and the Biophysics building constructed
in 1959. The three buildings share many deficiencies such as outdated
infrastructure, particularly air handling, electrical and plumbing systems, and
substandard and dilapidated laboratory and shared facilities. Existing
conditions of research space has affected research programs including, but not
limited to: computational biology, cell signaling, control of cell division,
regulation of metabolism, bio-energetics of mitochondrial enzymes, studies of
membrane transporters, pumps and channels, developmental neurobiology, molecular
mechanisms of visions, and molecular biophysics of protein structure. Upon
completion, 19 laboratories and eight shared facilities will be modernized,
complying with health and safety codes. Improved facilities will allow the
Departments to initiate new interdisciplinary programs, retain and recruit the
highest quality faculty and students, and sustain the highest quality of
research into the next decade.
