This project supports a workshop hosted by the Air &amp; Waste Management
Association (A&amp;WMA) entitled 2016 Atmospheric Optics: Aerosols, Visibility,
and the Radiative Balance. The objective of the workshop is to provide a
technical forum on advances in the scientific understanding of the effects of
small particles on urban, regional, continental, and global scale haze and
climate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will take a multipronged approach
by encouraging scientific submissions (e.g., related to measurements, modeling,
etc.) as well as submissions addressing regulatory and policy issues. Key
sessions include one on black and brown carbon, since recent research has shown
the importance of these particles for radiative forcing, and sessions related to
the synergistic and increasing concerns of the effects of atmospheric nitrogen
and carbonaceous material on haze, climate change, and nitrogen deposition on
ecosystems. This NSF project supports the registration, travel, and lodging
expenses for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty
from universities and research institutes within the U.S.A. who would otherwise
be unable to attend.
