This award provides partial support for construction of a new multipurpose
building at the Alice L. Kibbe field station located on the Mississippi River
near the Illinois border with Iowa and Missouri. The 4200 sq. ft. building will
include dormitory accommodations for 48, and a combination dining hall and
auditorium and associated kitchen. The facility will be constructed with using
insulated concrete forms, which provides a building with significantly increased
energy efficiency over standard frame construction, and protection from tornados
and strong storms, which the existing station facilities do not provide. The
Kibbe station has an active undergraduate and graduate research program, a long
tradition of summer field classes, and an increasing number of K-12 educational
and service-oriented programs. Ongoing research includes long-term studies on
the population dynamics and diversity of freshwater mussels, turtles, fish,
amphibians and fungi as well as, studies about the wintering ecology of bald
eagles, and the influence of white-tailed deer browsing on herbaceous and woody
diversity are in progress. Undergraduate and graduate level classes in a variety
of biological fields have been offered since 1966.
