This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project will provide The
Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) emergency funding for the
reestablishment of research capabilities that were lost or damaged during the
passage of Hurricane ANDREW in August 1992. NSF funds will be used to permit the
acquisition of shared-use equipment and rebuild the nutrient analysis
laboratory. This facility supports several ongoing NSF-funded research projects.
Funds will also be used to design a new marine operations building that will
better protect the equipment, supplies, and electronics activities from storm
damage. The NSF funds are aimed at assisting the basic research programs that
LUMCON conducts.
