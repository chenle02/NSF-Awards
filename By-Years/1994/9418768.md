9418768 Chapman This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the Promotion
of Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Michael Chapman, Department of
Physics and Astronomy, University of New Mexico, at the KEK National Laboratory
for High Energy Physics, Tsukuba, Japan. Dr. Chapman will work with Dr.
Yoshitaka Kuno and Jun Imazato of the Department of Physics, on a research
project entitled, "Japan JSPS Program: Time Variance in the Decay of Neutral
Kaons." The research team will study the time reversal operation of the CPT
theorem of symmetry operations. In this general theorem C is the charge
conjugation operation, P is the parity operation, and T is the time reversal
operation. Previous studies have shown that C and P change in the weak decays of
neutral Kaons, however, to date no experiments have observed time variances.
Drs. Kuno and Imazato are experts in proton synchrotron experimentation and Dr.
Chapman will work with them to search for a T violating signal of decaying
Kaons. ***
