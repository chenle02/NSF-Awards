This is a research in the field of algebraic geometry. The project addresses
four problems providing novel interfaces between complex geometry and string
theory and quantum physics. The first problem aims to construct new Hodge
theoretic invariants of symplectic and complex manifolds. The building and
computation of these invariants requires the development of new foundational
formalism of Deligne cohomology, Griffiths groups, and normal functions in non-
commutative geometry. The second problem seeks a new method for analysing the
fine geometric structure of the moduli of objects in differential graded
categories of Clalabi-Yau type. The third problem applies the method to a
problem in symplectic topology and introduces a new concrete geometric
description of the Fukaya category. The fourth problem addresses the
construction of the mirror map for del Pezzo surfaces, and describes a strategy
for proving the homological mirror symmetry conjecture in this context. The
understanding of these questions is essential for unifying various linearization
procedures in algebraic geometry, symplectic topology, theoretical and
mathematical physics. The project sets the stage for understanding the basic
structure of algebraic varieties in a way suitable for pragmatic use in a broad
spectrum of applications. Aside from the natural applications to algebraic
geometry and topology, the work proposed will be immediately relevant to deep
questions in quantum gravity and cosmology. The project outlines concrete
interdisciplinary applications to string dualities and the quantization of three
dimensional field theories.

The project also aims to organize a concentrated effort on enhancing and
building a new geometric arsenal of techniques applicable to the theory of
algebraic cycles, symplectic topology, and high energy physics. This will be
achieved by training a group of young researchers, and graduate students in
mathematics and physics, and by a curriculum development of a course on Mirror
Symmetry, non-commutative geometry, and algebraic constructions of Fukaya
categories. Specific research opportunities on the interface of geometry and
string theory for graduate students and postdocs are also discussed.
