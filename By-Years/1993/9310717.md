9310717 Johnson This award provides partial support for participants to attend a
conference and discuss research ideas and results on the topic of "Danger, Risk
and Safety: Ideas and Practices in Industrializing Societies." The conference
will occur at the Hagley Museum and Library in Wilmington, Delaware. The Center
for the History of Business, Technology, and Society at the museum, and the
Society for the History of Technology and the American Association for the
History of Medicine are co-sponsoring the conference. Penn State Press has
expressed interest in publishing the papers. The conference will bring together
scholars from a variety of backgrounds to share ideas about the historical
construction of the concept of risk and its current policy implications and to
consider directions for future research. Despite increasing social attention to
questions of risk and safety, and changing conceptions and expectations about
social attempts to deal with these dangers, the historical study of risk remains
a relatively neglected area of scholarship. Isolation within historical
specializations of labor, technology, or occupational health results in little
in the way of synthetic overview of the topic. This conference will help to
forge connections between graduate students and established scholars in a
variety of these specialities, and to create a richer and more focussed exchange
on these issues. ***
