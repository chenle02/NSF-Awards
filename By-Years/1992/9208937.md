This grant, under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) Program,
provides funds to analyze electric field data that has been collected in
Antarctica, mostly at South Pole. The goal is to relate the electric fields to
solar wind parameters, principally sector boundary crossings. The investigator
believes that it is possible that if the sector boundary crossings have a large
effect on the high latitude electric field, then that in turn, will effect the
global electric field, which then may control the formation of clouds. That
might provide a viable mechanism for the much sought "sun-weather" connection, a
belief by many scientists that the variability of the sun is a driving force in
the variability of Earth's weather. This is a very controversial and multi-
disciplinary study.
