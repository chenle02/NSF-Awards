Datasets that are collected in physical and engineering applications, as well as
social, biomolecular, commercial, security, and many other domains, are becoming
larger and more complex. In many cases, such data is analyzed manually or using
methods that extract only superficial information and can lead to subjective and
non-reproducible conclusions. There is thus an urgent need for the development
of methodologies that formalize analysis of complex data. Graphs provide a
natural formalism to capture complex interactions that govern the structure of
the data in many applications. However, a rigorous framework for signal and data
processing on graphs has been lacking. This proposal aims to develop the
fundamentals of signal representation, sampling and recovery on graphs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Signal and data processing has been the focus of the
principal investigators? work for many years. In this project, the team will
develop a mathematically rigorous framework for signal processing on graphs that
offers a new paradigm for the analysis of high-dimensional data with complex,
non-regular structure. By extending fundamental signal processing concepts such
as filtering, Fourier and wavelet analysis to data residing on general graphs,
the framework will offer principled solutions to a number of data analysis
problems, such as data compression, recovery, localization, detection, and
others. Specifically, the team will 1) develop efficient succinct
representations for signals on graphs, 2) design efficient strategies that
leverage the graph structure for sampling signals on graphs, and 3) develop
near-optimal and computationally efficient estimators for recovering graph
signals from samples.
