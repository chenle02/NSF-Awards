Recent years have seen important progress in the understanding of
two&lt;br/&gt;dimensional statistical physics. The rigorous study of
macroscopic&lt;br/&gt;random geometric structures generated by microscopic
random inputs and&lt;br/&gt;interactions has been greatly stimulated by the
introduction of&lt;br/&gt;Schramm-Loewner Evolutions (SLE) and related objects.
This enabled to&lt;br/&gt;establish results predicted by Conformal Field Theory
(CFT) in Theoretical&lt;br/&gt;Physics, most often without matching the
techniques. The P.I.'s research program&lt;br/&gt;is primarily directed at
realizing CFT concepts from SLE based&lt;br/&gt;constructions. The methods and
issues involve an interplay of&lt;br/&gt;geometric, functional analytic and
representation theoretic aspects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal
is to analyze mathematical models of the&lt;br/&gt;physical phenomenon of phase
transition. A phase transition describes a sharp&lt;br/&gt;qualitative change in
a physical system under variation of an external&lt;br/&gt;paramater, such as
freezing of water (transition from liquid to&lt;br/&gt;solid phase as
temperature decreases). At the phase transition, a random macroscopic
geometry&lt;br/&gt;may emerge, akin to the wiggly interfaces separating non
mixing fluids&lt;br/&gt;like oil and water. The study of those fluctuating
interfaces is&lt;br/&gt;rooted in both Probability Theory and Theoretical
Physics. Special focus&lt;br/&gt;will be placed on the interaction between these
two approaches, and&lt;br/&gt;other areas of mathematics involved in the
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;
