The principal investigator is requesting funds for equipment to pursue research
on the two-dimensional electron gas in strong magnetic fields. Specifically to
study the fractional Quantum Hall effect and the nature of the even denominator
structure such as 1/2, 3/2, and 5/2. There is also the intention to initiate
microwave absorption measurements over a sizeable frequency range. The principal
investigator wants a new dilution refrigerator and various microwave equipment
to cover the GHz regime.
