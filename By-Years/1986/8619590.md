The aim of this study, which is a continuation and extension of studies carried
out since 1972, is to monitor the brightnesses of planets and satellites in the
outer solar system along with their associated comparison stars in order to (1)
set an upper limit to, or to detect, variability of the luminosity of the Sun;
(2) study the properties, including seasonal and climate effects, of these
bodies; and (3) study the natural variability of atmospheric transparency,
including the long-lived effects of volcanism on the atmosphere, as well as
possible anthropogenic influences. One important result of this work has been
the discovery of clear evidence for a direct interaction between the global
state of a planetary atmosphere and variable solar uv output. These effects are
similar to the ones suspected and sought as inputs to possible solar-climate
effects. Thus the work is important to sun-earth relationships in terms of
changes in solar irradiance (climate change), variability in solar uv
(atmospheric photochemistry) and observations of atmospheric aerosols
(volcanoes).
