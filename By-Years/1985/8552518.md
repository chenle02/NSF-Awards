This research involves studies in speech coding, image processing, and inference
on stochastic processes. Recursive algorithms will be used for generation of
maximum-likelihood and maximum-entropy estimates in problems for which the data
are noisy and incomplete. Initially, the research applications will be
predominantly in the areas of speech coding in the auditory system and image
processing and spectral estimation for array processing.
