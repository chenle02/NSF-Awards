Seyfarth 9520566 Abstract Alarm calls are vocal signals given by animals when
they detect predators. Alarm calls are potentially costly, because they may
attract predators. The questions of how such signals function, and how they
evolve, are intriguing. Alarm calls given by nonhuman primates are of particular
interest because they provide clear evidence of semantic communication outside
of human language. This research has three objectives. The first is to examine
the current function of alarm calls, and to elucidate their evolution. The
second is to examine the semantic content of alarm calls, and the third is to
determine what callers know about the predator-prey relations that exist among
sympatric species. Studies will focus on red colobus monkeys, whose vocal and
behavioral responses to tape playback of noises from potential predators and
other prey species will be monitored in their natural environment. The results
will increase our understanding of animal communication and insight into the
evolution of semantic communication.
