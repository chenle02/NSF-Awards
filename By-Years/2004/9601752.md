Several theoretical investigations into processes of high energy atomic physics
are undertaken to elucidate the interactions of photons with correlated atomic
structures. The study yields a better understanding of relativistic, retardation
and higher multipole effects in regimes where they become comparable or dominate
electron correlation effects. A number of the proposed studies will be useful in
the interpretation of experiments being carried out at third generation light
sources.
