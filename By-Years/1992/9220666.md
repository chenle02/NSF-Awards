The objective of this proposal is to acquire a high quality, automatic FPLC
system and a new gamma counter, to purify and track proteins/peptides
(particularly radioactive proteins/peptides) and their metals or prosthetic
groups. The FPLC system is needed because the laboratories of the primary
investigators currently have only very limited access to such systems, although
in each, purification of proteins/peptides (for determination of their
structure, function and regulation) is a major activity. A new gamma counter is
needed because the existing one is twelve years old and threatening to become
unreliable. If it should fail, this would greatly limit the research of the
primary investigators, who are utterly dependent upon it for tracing copper and
iron in biological systems; tracking copper and iron binding proteins and their
receptors during their purification and/or in studies of their binding
capacities, kinetics and functions; identifying the binding sites of substrates
and cofactors of specific enzymes via affinity labeling. The isotopes used
(67Cu,64Cu,59Fe, 125I) are all gamma emitters, and double labeling is often
required.
