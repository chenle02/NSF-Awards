This project will permit participation by U.S. researchers in the 7th
International Brick Masonry Conference in Melbourne, Australia. The participants
are researchers involved with masonry design and experimentation. Most of them
will be participating in a U.S./Japan coordinated research project and it is
advantageous for them to learn what other researchers are doing in other
countries. The association with other researchers will be helpful in reducing
duplication and obtaining first-hand the results of related research. They will
also learn more about the design and construction practices in other countries.
The U.S. team will extend an invitation to the world participants to meet in the
United States to discuss design criteria and code requirements for masonry
construction for world adoption.
