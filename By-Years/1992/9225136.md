9225136 SCHNEIDER This project has two goals: to preserve and provide automated
access to oral history recordings of Alaska Natives in a computer program, and
to introduce this resource to teachers of Alaska history and Native studies.
Research projects on Alaska history, political developments, land use,
geography, subsistence and belief systems will be developed in collaboration
with local teachers. Funding is being provided to assess suitable audio
preservation technologies and the educational potentials of interactive
workstations in rural Alaska. ***
