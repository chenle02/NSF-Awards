This research focuses on developing computational techniques and high-
performance tools for societally relevant problems involving wave propagation in
earthquake dynamics and volcano seismology. Increasingly, the hazard associated
with these geophysical processes is being informed by detailed modeling of the
underlying physical processes. This is computationally challenging due to the
coupled multiphysics nature of the problem, existence of many temporal and
spatial scales, and the large simulation volumes compared to the small-scale
processes that need to be resolved. Additional constraints are placed on the
numerical methods by the heterogeneous material properties in the earth and
structural complexities such as topography and fault networks. A computational
framework for seismic wave propagation in complex geometries will be developed.
This will extend the P.I.?s newly developed, provably stable high-order finite
difference method and multi-block grids using coupled structured and
unstructured grids. These tools will be used for problems in earthquake dynamics
and volcano seismology, but can be extended to other problems involving wave
propagation (e.g., seismic imaging, fracture mechanics, and enhanced geothermal
energy production). An adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code will be developed for
the simulation of large magnitude earthquakes using unaltered laboratory
measured friction law parameters. Such studies are necessary to understand the
effect of altering friction parameters as is routinely done in scenario
earthquake simulations. AMR is required as the simulation volume is hundreds of
thousands of cubic kilometers, with resolution, at the mm scale, needed in a few
percent of the domain near the propagating rupture tip, i.e., transition from
locked to sliding on the fault. Additionally, the P.I. will assist in advising
of students, participate in course development, and lecture on topics in
computational science.
