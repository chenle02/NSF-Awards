9422144 Gross Continuing support is provided for the international
oceanographic activities of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR)
that are relevant to U.S. interests in marine sciences and the Division of Ocean
Sciences. There are currently thirty-seven countries represented in SCOR. The
Ocean Studies Board of the National Academy of Sciences serves as the U.S.
national committee. Individual ocean scientists participate in SCOR activities
through subsidiary bodies such as working groups and scientific steering
committees. Funding will support two major SCOR activities: 1) U.S. sponsorship
of focused SCOR Working Groups. Presently, there are twelve such Working Groups
covering diverse ocean-science related topics. Working Groups are comprised of
experts from different countries who meet on a regular basis to discuss and
assess the scientific status of their topic area and produce a report that
advises and provides recommendations for further research efforts. 2) Science
Steering Committee activities of the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) and
the Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics (GLOBEC) program; both are part of the U.S.
Global Change Research Program. These major programs have origins in U.S. and
have turned to SCOR to provide a forum for international planning and
coordination. SCOR's impact has and will continue to be evident in the
standardization of measurement protocols, sharing of data, coordination of ship
time, and the enlargement of field studies which would be impossible without
international coordination.
