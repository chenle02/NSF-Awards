This project extends and continues previous work on the behavior of photons and
neutrinos in a medium. Concrete calculations to be performed include: (1) The
effects of the presence of a magnetic field on neutrino damping rates due to the
effects of the matter-induced electromagnetic couplings of the neutrino. These
effect, independent of neutrino mixing, could provide a mechanism for pulsar
kicks; (2) The imaginary part of the photon self-energy (from which the photon
damping rate is determined)in a medium that contains, besides the usual
background of charged particles, a background of neutrinos that moves, as a
whole, relative to the stationary background. This type of system has been
considered in connection with energy generation mechanisms in supernova
explosions; (3) The photon self-energy in a medium with an external plane wave
field to study chirality effects. This is a novel application of thermal field
theory methods in the context of optical and condensed matter physics.

The properties of photons and neutrinos in a medium, and their interactions,
have been the subjects of continuous attention over the years because of they
provide information about underlying processes in the environments in which they
occur. This information can be important in various astrophysical and
cosmological situations and in condensed matter and physical optics laboratory
experiments. Apart from the details that are specific to the particular
calculations and physical contexts of the calculations in this project, the
treatment of these problems involve ideas, methods and techniques that can be
useful in other branches of physics.
