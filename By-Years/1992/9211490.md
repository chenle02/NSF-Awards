The research seeks to combine concepts in Kinematics and Computer Aided
Geometric Design (GAGD) to study motion interpolation and approximation problems
from a computational geometric perspective. The goal is to develop computational
geometric structure and algorithms that are suitable for computer aided
geometric synthesis of rigid body motions both with and without kinematic
constraints. The basic approach involves converting the motion synthesis problem
into a geometric problem of designing curves, surfaces, or solids. This is made
possible using an orientable kinematic mapping which transforms motions (with
one or more degrees of freedom) in the Euclidean space into curves, surfaces, or
solids in a special projective space called the image space. The mapping
facilitates integration of various methods in the fields of GAGD and computer
algorithms to solve the motion synthesis problem. The research will develop
image- space algorithms for designing a class of smooth piecewise parametric
motions that interpolates through a sequence of displacements and develop
geometric methods for approximating algebraic motions with the parametric
motions. The results, in addition to their theoretical interest in computational
geometry of motions, have applications in the design of spatial mechanisms and
manipulators, computer animation of motions, and mechanical system
simulation.*** //
