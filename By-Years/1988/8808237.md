This research will concern itself with several of the core areas of linear
algebra: matrix equations, inertia, and stability, which have relevance both to
computational linear algebra and to control theory. First the study of
conditions for nonsingularity of solutions of Sylvester, Lyapunov, and Riccati
matrix equations will be studied. Second the principal investigator plans to
study orthogonal solutions of matrix equations. Third the principal investigator
plans to study the construction of symmetrizers with specific properties of use
in applications. Fourth the principal investigator will study several areas of
inertia theory, namely singular inertia theory, inertia theory for Riccati
equations, and generalized inertia. Finally the principal investigator will
study when positive definite matrices have positive definite and semidefinite
images under certain Lyapunov maps.
