This project has the objective of understanding the transport of electrons and
holes in amorphous semiconductors, their recombination and conduction during
light excitation and their local interaction with the amorphous materials. Use
will be made of confining the charge carriers spatially in ultrathin layers of
amorphous semiconductors to explore the effects of reduced dimensionality. The
universal character of different modes of electronic conduction will be explored
in various materials including those that interact strongly with electrons and
are suspected of forming polarons.
