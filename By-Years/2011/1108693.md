Exactly how galaxies form and develop is a mystery that has long eluded
astronomers. So, it is crucial for scientists to unravel clues of galaxy
formation and development. This project focuses on one very important clue to
this mystery in spiral galaxies: how the chemical makeup (abundance) of the
interstellar medium (ISM) of nearby spiral galaxies is spatially distributed.
The investigators have carefully chosen a specific set of galaxies for this
study from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) because SINGS
galaxies have excellent multiwavelength observations already available to aid
the investigators in interpreting the data that they will obtain in this
project. Using the Multi-Object Double Spectrograph (MODS) on the Large
Binocular Telescope (LBT), the investigators will observe high quality emission
line spectra of approximately 1000 ionized gas (H II) regions of 13 SINGS
galaxies, increasing the number of previously observed H II regions by more than
a factor of 10. Securing these new measurements will allow the investigators to
address several scientific topics: (1) the dispersion of the ISM chemical
abundances as a function of radius, (2) chemical abundance radial gradients in
spiral galaxies, (3) the yields of elements from stellar nucleosynthesis with
potential constraints on the stellar initial mass function, (4) the chemical
development of galaxies at much greater distances (high redshift), and (5) the
chemical enrichment history of the Universe.

For each of the three years, this project will help fund the education of one
graduate student from an underrepresented group (a female), will provide a
summer research position for an undergraduate, and will fund a postdoctoral
scientist. Both principal investigators are also heavily involved in public
outreach activities to benefit their communities.
