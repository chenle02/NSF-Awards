9352141 McKenna Two diode array spectrophotometry systems are being used in a
project that is providing an integrative laboratory experience for students in
general, organic, advanced analytical and biological chemistry. Because we
believe that kinetics is a key concept which should be addressed in courses
throughout the curriculum, kinetics is being used as a unifying concept to
reinforce the idea that each course in the chemistry curriculum builds on skills
learned in previous courses. Students in the various courses are performing a
series of increasingly sophisticated investigations on the kinetics of the
hydrolysis reaction of the digestive protease trypsin, using spectrophotometric
and synthetic techniques and molecular modeling. ***
