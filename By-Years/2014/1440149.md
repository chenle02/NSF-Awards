This award provides support from the US Global Change Research Program for the
Secretariat operations of the global change SysTem for Analysis, Research, and
Training (START). This organization is an essential component of the US Global
Change Research Program strategic plan as it relates to international
engagement. START?s mission "to increase opportunities for research, education
and training that strengthen scientific capacities in developing countries to
understand, communicate and motivate action on critical global change
challenges" addresses all of the US Global Change Research Program strategic
goals. The funding will enable START Secretariat to continue developing and
implementing programs that advance ?research-driven capacity building? in Africa
and Asia. This approach emphasizes experiential learning by doing, particularly
for early-career scientists, in which targeted skill building and networking
opportunities are integrated into research on regional impacts and risks
stemming from global change. START?s work focuses on critical challenges at the
intersection of global/climate change and sustainable development, including
disaster risk reduction, land-use/land-cover change, biodiversity conservation,
urban development, human health, water resources management, and agriculture and
food security.
