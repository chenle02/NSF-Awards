This grant provides partial travel support for U.S. students and a limited
number of established scientists with unusual financial needs to attend the 19th
International Conference on Nucleation and Atmospheric Aerosol (ICNAA) to be
held in Fort Collins, Colorado. The intellectual merit of this activity rests in
open exchange of the latest research results concerning formation, physical and
chemical properties, transformation and cloud-climate impacts of atmospheric
aerosol particles. Broader impacts of this support center on offering a unique
opportunity for student scientists to share research results and have
discussions with an international cross-section of established experts in their
respective subdisciplines.
