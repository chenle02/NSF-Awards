This research is to determine the variability of nutrient supply to trees in
tropical forests, and its causes. Although most tropical forests are considered
nutrient poor, there is evidence that erosion can increase the supply of
nutrients by exposing new, nutrient rich rock to weathering. In Hawaii, this
effect can be pronounced and trees on slopes are often much bigger, with higher
nutrient concentrations, than trees on uneroded surfaces. As a result, there is
as much variation in fertility across a small section of tropical forest on the
old island of Kauai as there is on uneroded surfaces across the entire Hawaiian
Islands. Despite the importance of these results for understanding Hawaiian
forests, it is not clear how good a proxy Hawaii is for continental forests. To
clarify this question, we are quantifying nutrient variability across a lowland
tropical forest in Costa Rica. Comparing these systems will shed light both on
the applicability of the Hawaiian model to the continental tropics and the
extent of nutrient variability across tropical landscapes. The answer has broad
implications for both scientists and policy makers, because spatial variation in
nutrient supply affects species distributions, carbon storage, and the
sustainability of agriculture.
