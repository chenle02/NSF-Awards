The research of this group of theoretical high energy physicists at Harvard
University consists of: (a) the appli- cation of quantum field theory to a
variety of current problems in particle physics; (b) the application of
astrophysical data and cosmological constraints to particle physics, and (c) an
investigation of the properties of the "string theory" of ele- mentary
particles. Subjects to be addressed in (a) include: symmetry breaking and
"flavor" interactions; grand unification; quantum chromodynamics; and
semiclassical effects in field theory. Subjects to be addressed in (b) include:
neutrino masses and mixing; galaxy formation; and inflation. Subjects to be
addressed in (c) include: connections between string theory and developing
fields of mathematics and mathematical physics; search for new insights into
formal properties of quantum field theory; new mathematical structures of
potential use in physics; unexpected answers to questions that have been
intractable in the standard effective field theory context.
