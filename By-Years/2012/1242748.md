This project is providing support for graduate students to attend a workshop
organized in conjunction with the fall 2012 annual symposium of the Association
for Advancement in Artificial Intelligence. The workshop entitled Artificial
Intelligence for Gerontechnology was held November 2nd to November 4th, 2012, in
Arlington, Virginia. Gerontechnology is an interdisciplinary academic and
professional field combining the study of aspects of aging and technology to
address the challenges arising from the demographic changes due to aging
society. Artificial intelligence techniques are considered to be among the key
components of the solutions within the gerontechnology domain supporting care
for elders. Intellectual Merit: The symposium advances the state of the art in
artificial intelligence by considering problems and solutions that are inspired
by the challenges in developing gerontechnology. Specifically, the topics
addressed include the following: 1) novel approaches for dealing with sparsely
annotated data, 2) innovative machine learning techniques that can improve the
generalization of technological solutions across a wide range of real-world
settings and 3) design of modeling algorithms that take advantage of domain
knowledge. Broader Impacts: While the goal of the symposium was to advance the
field of AI with the focus on elder care applications, the solutions resulting
from the symposium can also be applied to other health care areas such as
assisting chronic patients in hospitals and homes. In addition, the educational
aspect of this workshop provides the opportunity to educate future workforce
with expertise at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence
and care for the elders.
