This research project will evaluate the lateral load resistance of lightgage
steel stud walls in the construction of midrise buildings in seismically active
regions of the country. The investigation will utilize both analysis and
experimentation to evaluate the shear wall resistance of two actual midrise
buildings located in highly seismic regions that were designed with
representative lightgage steel stud wall systems. Additionally, the research
program will conduct monotonic load deflection tests and pseudodynamic load
reversal tests on two types of actual lightgage steel stud wall systems.
Determinations of strength, load/deflection characteristics, and failure modes
will be made and recommendations for the design and construction of lightgage
steel stud wall systems will be provided.
