Abstract: The Fourth International Symposium on Uncertainty Modeling and
Analysis&lt;br/&gt;This award partially supports participation by US civil
engineering researchers in the 4th International Symposium on Uncertainty
Modeling and Analysis to be held at the University of Maryland at College Park
on September 21-24, 2003.&lt;br/&gt;The support will advance the state-of-
understanding and knowledge of uncertainty modeling and analysis, in the context
of civil engineering. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts derive from the way the
support will promote US interaction with the international scientific and
engineering communities; help US researchers retain their leadership in both
basic and applied research in uncertainty modeling and analysis; provide younger
researchers to interact with senior researchers in the field; encourage
interaction, knowledge transfer and exchange between researchers from academia,
industry and government; effectively disseminate the resulting information to
large sectors of the engineering and research communities.&lt;br/&gt;
