This award renews NSF support for operation of the E. Coli Genetic Stock Center
(CGSC). The CGSC supplies mutant and wild-type strains of E. coli to researchers
and educators in various fields of biology. CGSC maintains a collection of over
8,000 mutant derivatives of Eschericia coli strain K-12 and distributes about
5,000 cultures annually. Over its 30-year history, more than 127,000 cultures
have been distributed. Demand for strains currently in the collection, as well
as strains to be added, is expected to increase as the result of progress in
understanding the details of the organization and function of the E. coli
genome. E. coli remains an important model organism, perhaps the best-studied
from the standpoint of genetics and biochemistry, and serves as a critical tool
in the genetic manipulation of other organisms. Users include researchers
working in academic and governmental laboratories, non-profit research
institutes, and diverse industry laboratories, all of who rely on the CGSC for
well documented strains and for online information about the organism and the
collection. Strains and information are also provided to teachers and students
at all levels in universities, colleges, and K-12 schools. As part of it's role
in the research community, the CGSC coordinates assignment of gene symbols and
allele numbers and encourages adherence to accepted genetic nomenclature.
