Thomas Keyes of Boston University is supported by a SGER award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to provide the most widely used
biosimulation application, CHARMM, with the capability to use replica exchange
statistical temperature molecular dynamics, RESTMD. The STMD algorithm, and its
extension to replica exchange, were developed under an NSF-ITR grant, and have
substantially outperformed competing enhanced sampling algorithms in all tests,
on relatively simple systems. Keyes and his research group are exploring the
possibility that the same advantages hold for realistic simulations of the most
challenging problems in biophysical chemistry, where accurate sampling of the
thermally important states is crucial, and difficult.

The RESTMD+CHARMM program has a potentially large impact on biophysical
simulation, making possible accurate sampling of large, complex systems that are
currently intractable, including health related viruses, and protein misfolding
and aggregation. It will be freely available to all CHARMM users.
