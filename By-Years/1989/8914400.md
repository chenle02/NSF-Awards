An upgrade to the polarized ion source at the Indiana University Cyclotron
Facility (IUCF), which is a national user facility, will be carried out.
Internal target experiments, with luminosities two orders of magnitude higher
than presently attainable, will be possible. A broad experimental program in
spin physics will be carried out, exploiting the unique features of the newly
completed Cooler ring at IUCF.
