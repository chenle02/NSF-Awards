This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed at
improving the quality of life of dialysis patients through the development if a
new disinfection process of the peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter connection
that will reduce infections related to PD. The prevalence of PD among dyaliss
patients is increasing and infection rate has become a target for critical
improvement. Since PD is a self-administered treatment, patient adherence to the
set-up protocol is vital to ensure that sterility is observed. Unfortunately,
this is not always the case - infection remains a pressing concern. The
objective of this research is to circumvent the need to for complete patient
compliance, and introduce a device that will decontaminate the interfaces of PD
catheters that are at most risk of contamination. Research objectives focus on
enhancing the device design in an effort to achieve a multifold logarithmic
bacterial reduction on multiple pathogens, including bacterial and fungal. Other
objectives of this project are to optimize product design, from both performance
and usability standpoints. When implemented into the clinic, the disinfection
device will allow peritoneal dialysis patients to safely receive the full
benefit associated with this mode of treatment.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop a new
standard of care for all catheters suffering from catheter-related infections at
ports. The total addressable market for dialysis, central venous, and peripheral
venous lines is $13 Billion. Catheter-related infections still presents as a
dangerous health hazard for many markets and as of yet, no disinfectant has
emerged to successfully address this issue. The "No Pay" rule implemented in
recent years prevents hospitals from being reimbursed from infection-related
cases with catheters. The disinfection device will enable the decontamination of
catheters and the prevention of luminal infections, thereby greatly reducing the
risk of secondary infection. For peritoneal dialysis specifically, this
technology allows for home dialysis to be a more attractive option compared to
hemodialysis by adding safety, reducing patient morbidity and mortality, while
permitting more patients to take advantage of the quality of life benefits that
peritoneal dialysis provides.
