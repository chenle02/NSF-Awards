One of the basic concepts of Plate Tectonics is that continental plates are
rigid, with deformation only along their margins. However, there are extensive
areas within continental crust that have undergone large magnitude distributed
deformation at a regional scale, notably in the southwestern United States. This
project will use a combination of field and laboratory techniques to evaluate
the role of strike-slip faulting and block rotation and measure the internal
deformation of a portion of the Basin and Range province, and to attempt to
relate this deformation to plate boundary processes.
