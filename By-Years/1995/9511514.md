This is a study of how decisions are made in small groups. It tests and extends
a new model of interaction previously developed by one of the investigators and
already considered an important advance. The model takes into account the
effects of status differences among group members and how their interaction
develops to predict patterns of interaction and the emergence of structures of
inequality. The model has the added advantage of taking into account the effects
of non-participants on outcomes. Data are collected from 80 four-person groups
that vary in status characteristics. %%% The research will contribute to a
fundamental understanding of how groups reach decisions by taking into account
the status characteristics that individuals bring to the group, their
expectations about distributions of power, and the nature of the task performed.
Carefully collected data will be prepared to form a data bank for other small
group researchers.
