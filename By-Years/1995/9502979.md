9502979 Du This award provides support to develop a prototype distributed
computing, storage and scientific visualization facility for the National
Information Infrastructure (NII). Key elements of the facility include a
distributed parallel storage system with several physically distributed RAID
systems with high speed ATM connections and a high-bandwidth disk system with
direct connection to a FIBER Channel swith, a distributed computing server with
clusters of high-end workstations and multiprocessors, a high resolution display
unit, and a high-speed local, metropolitan, and wide area network
infrastructure. Projects include technology development in the areas of
multimedia servers and database servers; network research in the areas of
network design, control and performance; and research in parallel architecture
and system software. Applications areas to be supported include manufacturing,
healthcare, scientific computing, and scientific visualization.
