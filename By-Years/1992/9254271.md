A comprehensive integrated freshman educational experience suitable for both
engineering and potential engineering students is being developed, which
provides a "hands-on" introduction to engineering methodologies and problem
solving. The curricular material for this two course sequence emphasizes the
integration of mathematics, physics, and chemistry into introductory engineering
sciences through the use of carefully constructed open-ended problems.
Development of written communication skills and teamwork in problem solving and
learning are also emphasized. The project involves faculty from the University
of Pittsburgh main campus, its branch campuses at Bradford, Greensburg,
Johnstown, and Titusville and the Community College of Allegheny County (CCAC).
An important part of this project is the evaluation of curricular effectiveness
and assessment of the impact of the new courses on student attitudes toward
engineering and student performance in course knowledge content compared with
more traditional courses. The lag in introduction of new course material at the
branch campuses and CACC provides an opportunity to evaluate the new curriculum
materials against more traditional approaches. New hands-on, project-oriented
curricular material, complete with instructor's manuals, will be available for
other colleges and universities to adopt for their courses.
