0114603&lt;br/&gt;Hauri&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support
for the construction and testing of a large-radius high-transmission double
focussing multicollector mass spectrometer to be used for trace element and
isotopic measurements by SIMS. The large-radius instrument is designed to accept
sputtered secondary ions from the transfer section of a Cameca 6f, but without
any significant alteration in the Cameca's capabilities. The end result will be
a SIMS instrument with a single primary column and secondary extraction optics,
but with two mass spectrometric "beamlines" for analysis of the sputtered ions.
This instrument will provide immediate improvements in many areas of
geochemistry, cosmochemistry and geobiology at DTM. Support for this grant is
shared between the Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program
(EAR/IF) of NSF and the NASA.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
