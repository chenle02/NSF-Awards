9318099 Howard Long-term studies of natural populations, especially when
combined with experimental data, produce essential information relevant to many
theoretical and applied biological issues. For example, the significance of
year-to- year variations in population levels cannot be evaluated properly
without a database extending over considerable time intervals. Dr. Howard will
conduct several types of research. He will continue long-term demographic data
collection. He will also study the mechanisms animals use to choose their mates
and the effects of these choices on the biological success of both males and
females. The results will be important for theoretical understanding of the
mechanisms and evolution of mating behavior. In addition, the resulting basic
information on natural breeding behavior will help improve management programs,
including captive breeding and the reintroduction of captive-bred animals to
their natural habitats.
