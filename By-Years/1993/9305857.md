The proposal covers a scope of research by an active geometry group. The group
is active in several areas: geometric analysis, algebraic geometry and
mathematical physics. Such research would have applications to soliton theory
(e.g. telecommunications and signals) and other areas such as vortices and
quantum field theory. The proposal requests support for graduate students and
related instructional activities.
