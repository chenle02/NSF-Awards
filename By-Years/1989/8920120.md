This award will support the Science and Technology Center for the Synthesis,
Growth and Analysis of Electronic Materials at the University of Texas, Austin.
The research program of the Center is organized into two thrust areas--compound
semiconductors and silicon-based materials. Within each thrust area chemists
will synthesize molecular precursors and determine their surface and gas phase
reactivities, and engineers and physicists will grow and analyze thin films of
electronic materials made from these precursors, and construct and test new
devices made from these films. A major component of the research will be the
synthesis, purification and surface reactivity measurements of novel precursors,
containing group III and group V elements in a single molecule, that have low
toxicity and are suitable for film growth by advanced OMCVD and CBE techniques.
Electronic materials, and the structures and devices derived from them, lie at
the heart of numerous advanced technologies that have strategic and economic
relevance. Through an integrated and collaborative research program, which links
scientists and engineers at the University with scientists and engineers at
Sandia National Laboratory, Texas Instruments Inc., and Motorola Inc., the
Center will develop and demonstrate new concepts for electronic materials,
structures and devices, which will lead to smaller, faster and more densely
integrated electronic devices with tailored optical and electronic properties.
