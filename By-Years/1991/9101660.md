Professor Richter will study the structure of multiplication by z on a
generalized Dirichlet space. He will attempt to understand the structure of the
invariant subspaces of this operator. When the corresponding measure on the unit
disk is Lebesgue measure, then the operator theoretic problems Professor Richter
will consider lead to questions involving capacities and exceptional sets of
classes of analytic functions. This research involves the theory of Hilbert
space operators. These operators can be thought of as infinite matrices of
complex numbers. They find application in almost every branch of pure and
applied mathematics. The object of Professor Richter's research is to classify
and understand an important family of such operators.
