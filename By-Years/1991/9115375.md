For some time astronomers have explored the interconnected nature of magnetic
fields, turbulent velocity fields, and rotation in the atmospheres of cool
"flare" stars. For hot, normal-abundance "Be" stars this is a more controversial
subject because it is difficult to measure magnetic fields in these stars
because their spectral lines are smeared by the stars' rotation. Nonetheless, it
is generally thought that several physical processes, such as radiation
pressure, rotation, magnetic fields, and pulsation, may interact in a
complicated way to cause these stars to eject matter "episodically," that is,
from time to time rather than in a smooth fashion, such as a "wind." The
Principal Investigator (PI) and his colleagues propose to continue previous work
on a "wind compressed disk" model to explain how, once the ejection has started
by another means, how a circum-stellar equatorial disk develops and interacts
with the radiation-driven wind at higher latitudes. This award will support a
postdoc-toral fellow, Dr. J. Bjorkman, over three years and will permit him to
refine his model to interpret it in the context of observed changes in
polarization and spectral characteristics with time. This work is expected to
have an impact on a variety of other types of stars that periodically eject mass
during their evolutions, even if by other mechanisms.
