This grant supplies funding to the University of Texas at Austin for
oceanographic instruments to be used aboard the R/V LONGHORN in support of NSF-
funded research projects. The LONGHORN is a 105 foot vessel that is owned and
operated by the University. The instrumentation requested includes a water
sampling frame, water bottles, a fluorometer, a dissolved oxygen sensor, and a
transmissometer. The instrumentation is required for the successful completion
of NSF-funded projects aboard the vessel during 1995 and will enhance the
capability of the vessel in the future.
