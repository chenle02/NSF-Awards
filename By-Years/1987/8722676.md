This research is a first step toward developing a mathematical model that will
predict the distribution of permanently frozen soil (permafrost) in areas of
irregular terrain over large areas (hundreds and thousands of square miles).
Permafrost distribution can now be determined only by expensive and time-
consuming boring and subsurface temperature measurements in the field, processes
which are especially refractory in rugged terrain. Professors Nelson and Outcalt
are developing a means for linking topoclimatic (near-ground-level) measurements
of freezing and thawing degree-day sums to the occurrence of permafrost. If they
are successful in measuring topoclimate accurately and in establishing the
relationship, permafrost occurrence will be deducible from easily-obtained
topoclimatic measurements. Our understanding of the basic processes involved in
permafrost formation and occurrence will also be increased. This first stage of
their long- term project will test their instruments and measurements under
laboratory and field conditions.
