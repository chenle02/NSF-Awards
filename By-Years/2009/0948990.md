This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project aims to
further develop a panel of multicolor oligonucleotide fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) probes for performing preimplantation genetic diagnosis
(PGD) and detecting aneuploidies in eggs used for in vitro fertilization (IVF)
protocols. The use of oligonucleotides offers advantages such as enhanced
specificity and sensitivity, shorter hybridization times as well as a reduction
in manufacturing cost when compared to currently available genomic DNA derived
probes. The panel that the company plans to develop will cover 8 chromosomes
known to be particularly susceptible to deletions and rearrangements and would
allow simultaneous detection of any abnormalities that may be associated with
them.

The development of a panel of probes for the detection of genetic abnormalities
in preimplantation embryos will increase the success rate of IVF procedures and
thus reduce the financial and emotional cost associated with them. Moreover, use
of the proposed labeling method can be useful in a variety of areas outside of
PGD, including basic research, clinical diagnostics and cytogenetic testing.
