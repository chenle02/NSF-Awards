Rapidly oscillating patterns of electrical potentials from nerve cells have
been recently reported to be synchronized across multiple regions of the visual
cortex of the brain. The origins and function of the oscillations are unknown,
but their specificity to certain stimuli and synchrony across regions suggest
they may relate to some fundamental visual or cognitive function. This project
will test whether the synchronized oscillation in visual cortex is related to
visual perception. Specifically, it will test the novel idea that the
synchronous neural activity across a region of cortex reflects a cohesive visual
image assembled from visual stimuli that move together in a "coherent" way.
Single nerve cells in the cortex are known to handle specific properties of
visual images, such as location, orientation, color, and temporal features.
These experiments will record from single neurons at multiple sites in visual
cortex while presenting visual stimuli that are either independent, or connected
into a coherently moving object. This test will determine if the coherent
oscillation appears only with coherent movement of stimulus pieces. If so,
further experiments will explore how the coherence may be related to perception.
There is a risk that if not, the excitement about such oscillations may
considerably diminish. The impact of this limited study of this novel idea will
be very high on visual science and neuroscience in general, and if the outcome
is positive, the impact will extend to cognitive science as well.
