The behavior of aqueous and other associating solutions is to be modeled with a
technique based on exact relations among the direct correlation function
integrals of mixtures. For example, for a binary mixture only one of the three
direct correlation function integrals is independent. Closure expressions will
be derived for the cross direct correlation function integrals for these
associating solutions. With these closure expressions, analytic expressions for
activity coefficients and equations of state which are applicable for both
vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibria, at infinite dilution and finite
concentration, will be derived. The formulation does not require a knowledge of
the intermolecular potential, but it does require some experimental data with
which to determine binary parameters.
