The research of this Presidential Young Investigator Award will focus on
applying engineering principles to studies in building sciences and the quality
of the built environment, including research in the fields of building
climatology, thermal performance of passive cooling systems, modelling and
assessment of human thermal comfort, wind tunnel studies of building design for
natural ventilation, and numerical modelling of the behavior of indoor air
pollutants. The emphasis is to continue both theoretical and empirical research
in the areas of thermal response to the built environment, and the behavior and
control of indoor pollutants. Through a combination of wind tunnel testing,
field studies in office buildings, and controlled experiments in a controlled
environment chamber, various physical effects of building interior environments
on the physiology, comfort, behavior, and productivity of their occupants will
be investigated. These studies will address the economic, architectural, and
engineering implications. Research will also expand on previous development of a
model of the convective transport and removal processes of indoor radon decay
products. These studies will aid in the development of effective mitigation
strategies to improve indoor air quality.
