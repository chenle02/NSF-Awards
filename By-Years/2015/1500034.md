The conference "Simple Groups, Representations, and Related Topics," will be
held July 13-15, 2015 at the Center for Mathematical Sciences, University of
Cambridge, UK. This grant partially supports travel expenses for US-based
researchers, particularly early career mathematicians, to attend this major
international conference addressing one of the core areas of modern algebra
(group theory). The conference will bring together leading experts and
outstanding young researchers, providing an opportunity to report on and discuss
exciting recent advances in the field. It is expected that approximately 80
mathematicians will attend the conference. The meeting will play an important
role in the further development of the subject by helping to identify
interesting and challenging open problems and new applications. The location and
timing has been chosen to be compatible with an independent conference on
"Finite Simple Groups and their Applications" to be held the previous week at
the University of Warwick, UK.

The subject of the conference is related to the study of finite simple groups,
which is a classical area of algebra that has been at the heart of research in
group theory for two centuries. Simple groups are the basic building blocks of
all finite groups, and the classification of finite simple groups (CFSG) is
widely regarded as one of the greatest mathematical achievements of the 20th
century, involving many researchers over a period of many years. This
fundamental theorem has led to many interesting new problems in group theory and
beyond, and the development of powerful techniques to solve them. In the last
thirty years or so, post-CFSG, there have been great advances in our
understanding of the subgroup structure and representation theory of simple
groups. These topics are of fundamental importance in their own right, and they
are essential for many applications. The meeting will focus on the theory of
simple groups, with a particular emphasis on their subgroup structure and
representations. The interplay between finite and algebraic simple groups will
be a common theme, and we will focus on applications, both in group theory and
in other areas of mathematics such as computational algebra, Lie theory,
algebraic geometry, number theory, and model theory. For more information see
