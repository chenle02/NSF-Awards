Hugo A. Hopenhayn University of Rochester SBR-9514717 This research will examine
several aspects of unemployment insurance that have implications for the design
of social insurance in many other countries. The P.I. will undertake joint
research with Dr. Antonio Cabrales of Spain and Dr. Juan Pablo Nicolini of
Argentina to understand the international dimension of his research project. The
first aspect investigated will be the adverse impact of unemployment insurance
on the reemployment of workers. Unemployment insurance can induce workers to
reduce their search intensity or to decline some job offers. The research will
attempt to determine the optimal design of unemployment insurance to provide
insurance yet still provide suitable incentives for reemployment. The second
aspect will be the ability to learn about different workers abilities over their
work history. Unemployment insurance will transfer income from high to low
ability workers over time. This will have an impact on the optimal design of
unemployment insurance. The final aspect of the research will look at the job
creation and job destruction process to learn if this too should affect the
optimal design of unemployment insurance, and if so, in what way.
