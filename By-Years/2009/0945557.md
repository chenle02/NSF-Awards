This SBIR Phase I project will develop a robust commercial acid-tolerant culture
of the anaerobic bacterium Dehalococcoides (Dhc) for in-situ treatment of
groundwater contaminated with tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE).
The project team will conduct a search of acidic contaminated sites for natural
Dhc strains having acid tolerance. The most promising strains will be combined
to create a commercial dechlorinating culture.

The broader/commercial impact of the proposed project will be the deployment of
a bioremediation solution to address and solve many existing acid-caused
remediation failures and thereby increase the effectiveness of existing in-situ
biological treatment techniques as a cost-effective and successful remedial
option to eliminate PCE and TCE from groundwater.
