This award will provide participant support for graduate and undergraduate
students to participate in one of the world's leading annual conferences on
plasma science and engineering, the 43nd IEEE International Conference on Plasma
Science (ICOPS), to be held in Banff, Alberta, Canada on June 19-23, 2016. This
conference expects about 600 participants from around the world, including many
of the leaders in plasma science and engineering research. There will be
presentations in most of the major topics in plasma science and engineering,
including basic plasma physics, computational plasma physics, as well as
applications to accelerator science, geospace, radiation sources, inertial and
magnetic confinement fusion, and plasma aided bio-medical and environmental
research. In addition, to help enhance interactions among young professionals
and potential employers, a new event "IEEE NPSS Young Professionals Symposium"
will be organized as a part of the conference.

The award will be used to provide partial travel support for students to attend
the conference. The students will be making presentations and participating in
the symposium for young professionals. The recipients of the student travel
stipends will be selected using a merit-based selection process led by the
Student Travel Award Committee. This program will be an excellent opportunity
for young scientists to interact with and to learn from the more experienced
researchers in plasma science and engineering.
