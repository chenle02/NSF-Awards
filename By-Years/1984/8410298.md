A major research area of present importance is the sensing, transmission, and
processing of two dimensional and multi-dimensional signals. Problems of
significance arise in communications involving the transmission, reception, and
processing of image and picture information along with voice and numerical data,
ingeophysical exploration for new fields of resources such as oil, and in any
environment where there are multiple sources or channels of information. This
research is fundamental in nature and will provide the foundation for the
growing applications in multi-dimensional systems. Two- and multi-dimensional
digital filters will be investigated, with emphasis on stability, synthesis, and
design methods. Problems related to stability in the presence of nonessential
singularities, evaluation of quantization error, margin of stability, model
reduction, and optimal digitization of image processing will be examined.
