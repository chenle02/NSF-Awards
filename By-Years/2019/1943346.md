The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve
milk production efficiency of dairy cows by measuring individual cow feed
intake, a vital datapoint not typically commercially available in the industry.
This datapoint allows dairy farmers to optimize diet formulation which would
result in higher milk production per cow and reduce illnesses by being able to
provide sufficient nutrients to support the cow's level of milk production.
Using the data derived from this platform will also potentially improve the
genetic pool of the herd. The commercial impact of the project has the potential
to result in significant cost savings for dairy farmers by providing the vital
benefits of early detection of the five most common diseases and feed costs
savings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project uses custom-designed radio
frequency identification sensor platform that is installed on feeding alleys and
bedding of dairy barns. The sensors are designed to distinguish a cow from
consuming or sifting through the feeds to provide a new and efficient way of
monitoring dry matter intake on a per cow basis. The sensors also capture
individual cow's time spent lying down (rumination time) and the number of
visits to the feeding alley. All data gathered by the sensors are sent to the
cloud continuously and analyzed by unique machine-learning algorithms to
determine a range of behavioral events per individual cow, including feed intake
monitoring to identify the most/least feed efficient cows. Decrease in feed
intake over a period of time also signifies the onset of illnesses which can be
detected prior to becoming clinical cases to reduce the use of
antibiotics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
