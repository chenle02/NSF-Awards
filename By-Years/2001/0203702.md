Ivanov&lt;br/&gt;0203702&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Chile Program award will
provide support for cooperative research between Dr. A. F. Ivanov of
Pennsylvania State University and Drs. Manuel A. Pinto and Sergei I. Trofimchuk
of the Universidad de Chile in Santiago, and Dr. Samuel A. Castillo of
Universidad del Bio-Bio in Conception, Chile. They will work on aspects of the
qualitative theory of functional differential
equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to study both
qualitatively and numerically, the global dynamics of solutions of functional
differential equations and systems of such equations including questions of the
existence, stability, dependence on parameters and bifurcation of periodic
solutions, chaotic behavior, and global stability of equilibria. It will
emphasize the study of global stability and periodic solutions of equations
modeling real life of phenomena and asymptotic behavior in difference and
discretized functional differential equations. The significance of the project
lies in its potential to solve several important theoretical mathematical
problems, thus further developing the qualitative theory of the field.
