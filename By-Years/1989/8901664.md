Over the past decade, an information-based approach has been developed for
finding optimal algorithms for the approximate solution of problems which must
be solved under uncertainty. Perhaps the richest source of such problems is the
solution of differential and integral equations. This investigation is directed
towards the application of information- based techniques to differential and
integral equations, with particular emphasis on the roles of adaption,
parallelism, and randomization.
