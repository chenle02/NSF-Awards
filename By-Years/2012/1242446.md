The proposed innovation will pioneer next-generation haptic devices and
interfaces to enrich and enhance remote interactions within applications of
gaming, remote communication, military use and assistive aids. Although gaming
is targeted initially, a haptic belt immediately generalizes across diverse
domains where augmented perception of those around us and objects of interest
enhances and quickens awareness of our present situation. Moreover, the
availability of a commercial haptic belt will open new vistas for research and
development within research areas of human haptic perception, multimodal display
design and interaction, human-centered multimedia computing and socio-behavioral
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial availability of the proposed
innovation will be a catalyst for the development of assistive technologies that
will positively impact the lives of individuals with sensory impairments (visual
impairments, vestibular impairments) and perceptual impairments (prosopagnosia)-
a market the team plans to eventually transition to after gaming. It will also
significantly impact the general population, providing a novel communication
channel with many uses from navigation and spatial orientation to
augmented/virtual reality, and to the perceptual enhancement of togetherness,
important for long distance relationships and families often separated by the
travel demands of work. The availability of a haptic belt will also benefit
component disciplines including psychophysics and psychology of haptics were
access to a functional, scalable and reconfigurable haptic display will attract
and motivate researchers exploring the sense of touch as a receptive channel.
