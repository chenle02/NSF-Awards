One of the primary goals of biological research is to understand the forces that
maintain biodiversity. One powerful mechanism that leads to the maintenance of
diversity is "nontransitive interactions." Nontransitive interactions occur when
the dominance relationships among three or more players are not hierarchical,
such that A&gt;B, B&gt;C, and C&gt;A. Because no one competitor is superior to
all others, diversity can be maintained in the absence of environmental
variation. These interactions are thought to be important in preserving both
species diversity and genetic diversity within species. Nevertheless, few
studies have linked variation observed in nature with empirical tests of theory.
The proposed work examines natural isolates of the insect-parasitic bacterium,
Xenorhabdus bovienii. Assays of the bacteriocins (narrow-spectrum antibiotics)
produced by these isolates suggest that nontransitive interactions may be
important in maintaining diversity even at small spatial scales. The researchers
will further characterize these antibiotics, and will use these bacterial
isolates to rigorously test theoretical models of ecological dynamics. In
addition, they will examine whether interactions among bacteria within an insect
host have consequences for the insect and other species in the community.
Finally, they will experimentally test theory explaining why bacteria resistant
to these antibiotics do not come to predominate in the
environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will increase our knowledge of an
agriculturally, and potentially pharmaceutically, important system. Moreover,
this work will test the assumptions and predictions of theory that can be
applied generally to other systems. It will also involve active participation of
eight undergraduates in all aspects of research, as well as the mentorship of a
graduate student.
