This project will study the hydrodynamic response of subduction zones to seismic
events by using an analytical model of coseismic pore pressure generation and a
numerical model of fluid flow following an earthquake. The results will help
make better use of pore pressures as strain indicators. As observatories that
monitor pore pressure are established in subduction zones, it will be necessary
to understand how pressure changes will vary with deformation style and
magnitude, how flow systems will respond to seismic events, and how thermal or
geochemical anomalies may be generated by coseismic deformation. The results
will also help determine what drilling and monitoring strategies will yield the
greatest information concerning deformation and fluid flow in subduction
complexes.
