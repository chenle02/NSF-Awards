Chemistry (12)

Saint Joseph's College of Maine is purchasing a 60 MHz nuclear magnetic
resonance spectrometer (NMR), an infrared spectrometer (IR), and software to
investigate the effect of both horizontal and vertical inter-laboratory
integration on STEM students' ability to collaborate, cooperate, mentor and
learn. The project is using spectroscopy (UV-Vis, IR, and NMR) as a unifying
theme between courses. Each physical science course is implementing lab
experiments where students in different groups or sections are exchanging data
and working with students in another group or section (horizontal integration).
Students are also exchanging data between different courses and academic levels
(freshmen, sophomore, etc.) (vertical integration). Facilitated and ad hoc
meetings and virtual communities are forming to accomplish tasks, solve problems
and to gain skills in forming professional relationships and scientific
collaborations.

Project evaluation is being accomplished through surveys and academic
assessments by the internal and external consultants. Results are being reported
on websites, at national professional society meetings, and in peer-reviewed
journals. This project is being conducted in an institution where nearly 70% of
all students and half of all students majoring in science disciplines are women.
Approximately 60% of the students are the first in their families to attend
college, one quarter qualify for Pell grants, and of these, about half are from
families whose incomes fall below the federal poverty line.
