9623424 Rosenbaum The CAREER award addresses the fundamental issues regarding
Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) reliability of Integrated Circuits and Devices
fabricated in SOI-CMOS technology. Thermal modeling, design of protection
devices, and experimental testing form the basis of the investigation. The
device models and stress limits will be incorporated into a CAD tool for circuit
level simulation. The education of graduate students will be interdisciplinary
and involve the development of a new course. ***
