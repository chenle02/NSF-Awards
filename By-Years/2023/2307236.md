Observations of gravitational waves from a black hole and neutron star binary
systems are now routine by the NSF's LIGO alongside other international
detectors. Beyond learning about the most mysterious objects in the Universe,
such efforts have generated significant spin-off technologies, and helped turn
public and youth attention towards STEM disciplines. This research project aids
in the development of the computational tools and the theory that plays a very
critical role in not only LIGO’s mission, but also that of next generation
detectors. The main objective is to understand important aspects of binary black
hole systems using theoretical and computational techniques. The project
includes support for students and therefore directly contributes to student
mentorship, traineeship and retention in an important STEM area. The
computational skills that students develop are highly “portable”, and therefore
will allow them access to a variety of career options, including in areas of
great national need.

This award is about the development and application of the time-domain point-
particle black hole perturbation theory approach that models the gravitational
wave emission from large mass-ratio black hole binary systems. Significant
contributions will be made to the development of approximate gravitational
waveform models (such as data-driven “surrogate” models, the effective-one-body
approach, and others), that will ultimately impact the data analysis effort of
current and future detectors (such as LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA and future 3G detectors
and space-borne missions). Additionally, collaborative work will be completed
with the gravitational self-force and mathematical relativity communities, and
progress will be made on a number of challenging and important problems in the
area of gravitational physics.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
