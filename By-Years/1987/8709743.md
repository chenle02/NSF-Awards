This is a three year program for the production of global, near-real time maps
of subsurface thermal structure in the upper 500 m of the ocean. It requires
three major tasks to be completed. The first task is the development in the
Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans of the editing parameters based upon a
cursory analysis of historical data and histograms of the temperature anomalies
at 100 m depth intervals. The second task is the development of a near-real time
editing procedure for each ocean, which necessitates knowledge of the histograms
of temperature anomalies for use in an objective editing scheme; near-real time
editing of the Navy data will be conducted at Fleet Numerical Oceanography
Center (FNOC) under subcontract to Compass Systems, while editing of the
civilian data, and other subsurface thermal structure data, delivered over the
Global Telecommunications Service, will be conducted at Scripps Institution of
Oceanography (SIO). Roger Bauer of Compass Systems and Stephen Pazan will
develop the near-real time software required for duplicating the editing
procedures at both FNOC and SIO. Third is the mapping itself, using objective
analysis methodology, and the production and publication of the maps. These maps
will be published monthly in the Ocean Climate Diagnostics Bulletin.
