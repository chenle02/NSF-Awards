The PI has developed a broad database dealing with Silurian and Devonian
problems, including brachiopod and gastropod taxonomy, morphology, biogeography,
community paleoecology, correlation, geologic history, lithofacies, and
paleoclimatic indicators. This database material provides material for syntheses
useful for geologic and biologic purposes, and for some novel conclusions about
geologic and biologic-evolutionary processes. Biogeographic syntheses are useful
in checking global paleogeographies; community paleoecologic syntheses are
useful in basin analysis (industrial and scholarly) and improved stratigraphic
correlations involving biogeographic control; and studies in evolution are
useful for all. Work on the evolutionary implications of both major and minor
biostratigraphic breaks will provide a better understanding of community
evolution, biographic history, adaptive radiations and biotic crises, and
behavioral relations.
