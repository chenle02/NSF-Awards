Southern Rings is a consortium of three two-year colleges and a four-year
college to establish a regional center to increase the number of
technologically-trained information technology technicians in south Georgia. The
planning process is to define and develop roles of industrial partners and
secondary schools, an effective co-principal investigator structure, a multi-
institutional approach to academic programs and content delivery, technical
support for activities, and management and evaluation plans. The process
determines specifics of the models to ensure scalability and sustainability of
the efforts and to extend them to rural communities that have no institutions of
higher education.
