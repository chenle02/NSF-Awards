This Engineering Research Equipment award will permit the purchase of a laser
and related equipment for use in an ongoing research program in turbulent mixing
layers and their modification by the compressibility due to high Mach numbers.
The other is focused on low speed flows and seeks to further resolve their
underlying spatial and temporal organized geometrical structures. Both areas
will provide data necessary in the development of improved models to predict the
behavior of turbulent flows in a variety of mechanical, chemical, and thermal
systems.
