In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Regitze Vold will develop new techniques for the NMR study of
molecular structure and dynamics of solids and ordered phases. The emphasis in
these studies is on inorganic, bioinorganic, and biologically important systems.
Specific projects include the investigation of novel, magnetically aligned
discoidal nematic phospholipid bilayered micelles (bicelles), a multi-nuclear
spin relaxation study to test models of relaxation and internal motion of
membrane-associated peptides in ordered bicelles, the continuation of studies of
the structure and dynamics of the mitochondrial redox cofactor Q10 (ubiquinone)
in phospholipid bilayers, and magic angle spinning (MAS) experiments on
paramagnetic inorganic and bioinorganic model compounds. The common theme of the
experiments in this project is to extend and apply NMR spectroscopy to
structural and dynamic problems in chemistry which will provide information
about the binding, conformation, and dynamics of biologically relevant molecules
as well as about solid transition-metal complexes. The approaches being
developed in this work will help increase the impact of solid-state NMR on
structural biology.
