This is an Academic Research Infrastructure project to upgrade an existing lidar
system at Utah State University (USU). It is a collaborative effort that
includes investigators from USU, the University of Maryland, Clemson University,
the University of Pittsburgh, and University College London. The lidar system
provides measurements from which continuous profiles of atmospheric
temperatures, densities and winds can be derived. The results will be used to
study the transport of energy and momentum from the lower atmosphere to the
mesosphere and lower thermosphere. The continuous observations over a long
period of time will shed light on climatological questions relating to global
change. The upgrade to the lidar system will increase the sensitivity of the
instrument by about a factor of thirty. This is to be accomplished by
constructing a telescope with a collecting area of 5 square meters. The project
includes the construction of a building to house the lidar on the top of the
Science and Engineering Building at USU. After the upgrade the lidar system will
be one of the most powerful of its kind in the world. The data will be made
available to atmospheric scientists and students.
