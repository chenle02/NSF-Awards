This proposal is for support of the next three Northeast Probability Seminars.
The first of the three meetings will be held November 20-21, 2014 in New York
City at Columbia University. The Northeast Probability Seminar is a two-day
conference to be held annually during the month of November. The goal of the
conference is to have talks by both well established and promising probabilists.
The organizers will continue to invite women to speak and to seek speakers from
other underrepresented groups. The meetings will have four featured talks, two
on Thursday morning and two on Friday morning. Thursday and Friday afternoons
will be set aside for informal sessions where participants will be encouraged to
give ten-minute presentations of their recent work or to discuss open
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specialized mathematical meetings like this are
very important. They give people an opportunity to exchange ideas and try out
new theories. They also give young people an opportunity to question experienced
mathematicians. Regional meetings are especially important because it is easy to
follow up on significant conversations. They also foster the sense of belonging
to a group of active researchers--in this case the Northeast Probability
group.The conference website is:
