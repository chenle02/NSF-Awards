NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The discovery of topological materials has
taken the condensed matter community by storm, potentially providing new
material foundations for novel technologies for computing, energy transmission
and generation and ultra-fast communication. However, in order for the field to
progress in answering fundamental questions and in finding technological
applications, there is a critical need to discover new material realizations.
Weyl and Dirac semi-metals are the most recent and perhaps the most exciting
developments in quantum-relativistic condensed matter, harboring both exotic
transport properties and highly mobile surface states. The purpose of this
proposal is to find systematic methods to identify and engineer the topological
properties of these systems, aiming to answer critical questions in the field:
how are these properties affected by symmetry breaking fields? How do they
interact with symmetry breaking order? Can we engineer the materials so that
their topological properties dominate over their trivial properties? In addition
to these efforts, the PI is developing an ambitious media project that seeks to
animate complex condensed matter ideas in a series of video-tutorials that are
integrated into the PI's courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL
ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This proposal attacks three problems; (i) the need for new
experimental methods that can identify topological systems, (ii) the dearth of
materials that have symmetry breaking order in addition being topological and
(iii) experimental methods that can measure how surface and bulk transport
arising from their Weyl-like nature are influenced in these symmetry breaking
environments. At high fields all the electronic states condense into the lowest
Landau level, the so-called quantum limit, and the magnetic properties of the
material are dominated by the Berry curvature. The PI uses this fact to identify
whether a material is topologically trivial, Weyl-like or 3D Dirac-like.
Furthermore, this proposal utilizes synthesis capabilities to focus on Weyl
candidates near complex broken symmetries and develops new methods to engineer
their band structure. Finally, Focused Ion Beam nano-structuring techniques are
utilized to shape sample geometries to understand how the transport of surface
and bulk states is affected by the presence of complex spin and orbital
textures.
