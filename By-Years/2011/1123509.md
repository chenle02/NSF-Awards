SES-1123509&lt;br/&gt;Charles Kurzman&lt;br/&gt;University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How Social
Science Maps the World&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How does American social science
observe the world? This project examines social-scientific
journal&lt;br/&gt;articles, books, doctoral dissertations, and disciplinary
awards to see how often each world region has&lt;br/&gt;been studied over the
past half-century. The dataset that this project generates will allow us to
track the&lt;br/&gt;trends in scholarly attention to various parts of the world,
and to test theories in the sociology of social&lt;br/&gt;science about how
researchers select subjects for study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The patterns that
emerge from this research will help to inform social scientists and educational
policymakers about trends and possible gaps in scholarly attention to different
regions of the world. The&lt;br/&gt;internationalization of American higher
education has been a longstanding concern in academia and in&lt;br/&gt;policy
circles; this work moves the debate beyond the overall level of
internationalization to a more&lt;br/&gt;detailed break-out of
internationalization by region. The project includes a dissemination phase in
order to&lt;br/&gt;present the results of this research to annual meetings of
national professional organizations, in order to&lt;br/&gt;spur discussion of
the research findings and explore educational policy responses.
