This project will use the Drosophila melanogaster model system to address two
fundamental questions in the study of sexual selection. First, what is the
effect of sexual selection on a population's ability to adapt? Second, what male
traits are under sexual selection and how are these traits formed? The presence
or absence of female choice and male-male competition will be manipulated
experimentally in a laboratory evolution experiment. Fitness and traits will be
measured in the experimentally evolved populations and in the ancestral
laboratory population to assess which trait values confer higher fitness and how
sexual selection can change these trait optima.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results
of this research will help to clarify whether sexual selection has a positive or
negative effect on adaptation in natural populations. Undergraduates will
participate in the project and will conduct related independent research
projects and will learn techniques of experimental design and data analysis.
This project begins a collaboration between biologists and chemists.
