The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for the determination
of the molecular structure of compounds as diverse as small polypeptides and
complex metal clusters. When combined with the latest computer software, the
technique is becoming remarkably easy to put into practice. The acquisition of
X-ray crystallographic instrumentation markedly improves the ability of chemists
to carry out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry at Keene State
College will use this RUI award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation
Program to help acquire an X-ray diffractometer. The instrument will be used to
enhance research in the Department and in the Departments of neighboring
institutions and to improve the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at Keene
State. Among the areas of research to be enhanced by the aquisition are: 1)
Structural investigations of copper (I)-laser dye clusters 2) Structure studies
and molecular modeling of retinyl Schiff base-urethane elastomer systems 3)
Transition metal complexes containing perfluorinated organic ligands 4) Cages,
heterocycles and oligomers from coordinated phosphines 5) Chiral transition
metal-olefin complexes: application to organic synthesis 6) New molybdenum (II)
allyl compounds 7) Model compounds of liquid crystal polymer systems 8)
Structural and conformational studies of Ä±n!(9,10) anthra- cenophanes 9)
Transition metal complexes of tetraaza macrocyclic ligands.
