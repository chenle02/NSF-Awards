This is a proposal for funds to acquire a multi-task system for automated
analysis of mutations and polymorphisms and for drastically expanded capacity of
automated DNA sequencing. The funds are intended to upgrade an existing DNA
sequencer as well as to purchase a second one. The funds will also be used to
purchase a robotic lab station that automates cycle sequencing reactions and
software that analyzes complex electrophoretic DNA patterns. Automated analysis
and quantitation of complex DNA electrophoretic patterns at nucleotide
resolution is necessary for microsatellite, ARMS PCR and SSCP analyses of
polymorphic loci. Expanded DNA sequencing capacity is vital to current studies
of DNA sequence analysis including transcriptional regulatory regions of cell-
specific genes, cDNA clones for transcription factors and their interacting
proteins and autoantibodies, verifying site-directed mutations to study
structure-function relationships in proteins and DNA transcriptional control
elements, the nucleotide basis of genetic polymorphisms, chromosomal breakpoints
implicated in oncogene activation, analysis of extended loci of multigene
families and sequence verification of extended transgenes for introduction into
mice.
