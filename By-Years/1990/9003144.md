This project is a planning grant that will strengthen Dr. Ratteray's knowledge
base and application skills in the study of mathematics education. The work
consists of three components: (1) formal independent study at the University of
Maryland; (2) research demonstration projects with a master teacher and
mathematician on selected problem-solving strategies used in the classroom to
promote the mathematical understanding of students; and (3) travel to seminars
on innovative strategies and model programs at colleges and universities in the
United States.
