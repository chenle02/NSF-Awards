EMT/QIT -- New Designs and Decoding Algorithms for Quantum Error Correction

Abstract Jing Li (Tiffany)

Quantum computers will likely provide the ultimate cure for the explosive growth
of information data and the increasingly pressing demand to solve complex and
comprehensive problems (such as factoring and discrete problems). Of critical
importance to quantum computation and communication is quantum error correction,
the mathematical-physical mechanism that protests the fragile quantum states
from unwanted evolutions, thus enabling robust implementation of quantum
processing devices and reliable transmission over noisy quantum channels. Proof-
of-concept and the first constructive quantum error correction code did not
appear until 1995, and the research is still at its infancy.

This research entails serious theoretic and algorithmic study to advance the
state of quantum error correction. New methods will be investigated to provide a
refreshing angle to the systematic construction of better families of quantum
stabilizer codes and especially unrestricted low-density parity-check (LDPC)
stabilizer codes. New and efficient decoding algorithms will be designed to
revive several existing stabilizer codes. New concepts and tools will be
developed to analyze and evaluate quantum codes. The tools used in the research
is highly mathematical-physical, and involve quantum mechanics, quantum
information theory, linear algebra, Euclidean/projective geometry, matrix
theory, graph theory and convex optimization.
