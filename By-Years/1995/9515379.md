This award to the University of South Alabama supports an anthropological study
of local participation in social movements that oppose polluting industries and
other environmental hazards. Using ethnographic as well as survey research
methods in impacted communities and in activist groups, the researchers will
examine how a cross-section of the region's residents perceive hazardous waste
and involve themselves in environmental rights movements. Through ethnographic
methods of in depth questioning and participant observation the project will
seek to explain why environmental activism has been successful in some
situations and never attempted in others. The relation of the use of local
rhetoric about environmental racism and the civil rights movement will be
examined, as will the relation of property ownership and source of income to
perceptions of risk from hazardous environmental materials. This research is
important theories of popular social mov em ents have often lacked the in-depth
information on motives, understanding and values that is available through
ethnography. Industrial and rural development have all too often been
accompanied by environmental degradation. By advancing our understanding of how
local communities organize themselves to defend their environment, this project
will provide valuable knowledge to industrial and environmental planners.
