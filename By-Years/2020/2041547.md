We live in a complex social world in which the challenges facing society evolve
continuously, and organizations must adapt to meet them. With the rapid growth
of social networks over the last two decades and the corresponding availability
of big data, the behavioral and social sciences have become increasingly
important to the development and growth of organizationsâ€™ capacity to understand
and address global challenges. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has accentuated the
importance of the social sciences in providing guidance during societal crises,
particularly with respect to the successful operation of organizations during
emergencies. Social, behavioral, and organizational science can help
organizations address societal needs, and these contributions can be magnified
through collaborations between academia and industry. With respect to such
issues as shaping the future of work, harnessing data for societal benefit,
supporting diversity and inclusion, advancing team science, establishing
successful leadership and mentorship models within organizations, and
understanding the impact of artificial intelligence on society, the social
sciences are critical for advances and solutions. There are significant
opportunities for expanding academic-corporate partnerships in the social
sciences to help address urgent societal needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
University of Maryland, College Park, in collaboration with the University
Industry Demonstration Partnership, will host a three-day workshop in College
Park, Maryland, convening a diverse group of experts and leaders from academia,
industry, and government to consider how academic-corporate partnerships can
advance social, behavioral, and organizational science research to positively
impact science and society. This workshop will help generate more awareness
about the collaborative opportunities that exist within the social, behavioral,
economic, and organizational science disciplines, and will produce strategies to
fuel future industry-university partnerships. The workshop will showcase
research collaborations relevant to business practitioners, policy makers, and
research communities, examine how organizations develop and operate
successfully, especially amid current challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic,
and explore how university-industry collaborations in the social sciences can
stimulate discovery, knowledge exchange, and economic development, helping to
create value and achieve social impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
