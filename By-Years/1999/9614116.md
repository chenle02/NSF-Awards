This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) is supported in the Analytical
and Surface Chemistry Program. During the tenure of this twelve-month standard
grant, Professor Winograd and his research group at the Pennsylvania State
University will explore the feasibility of using time-of-flight secondary ion
mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) methods for the chemical analysis of combinatorial
libraries. The molecular specificity of TOF-SIMS methods, coupled with the two-
dimensional spatial resolution of a rastered ion beam, will be used to analyze
combinatorial libraries formed on Merrifield bead substrates. Success in this
endeavor will enhance the speed with which such libraries can be analyzed and
accelerate progress in the area of combinatorial methods of synthesis. Time-of-
flight secondary ion mass spectrometry is an extremely powerful technique for
molecular identification and quantification. The inclusion of rastered ion beam
technology adds two-dimensional spatial resolution to this analytical capability
and suggests a method for the rapid analysis of `libraries` of chemical
compounds produced by combinatorial synthetic methods. Professor Nicholas
Winograd and his students at Penn State University will determine the
feasibility of this analytical approach with support from this Small Grant for
Exploratory Research. The development of successful strategies for combinatorial
library analysis will assist markedly in the advancement of this area of
synthetic chemistry.
