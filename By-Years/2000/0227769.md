Sara Young directs the American Indian Research Opportunities program at Montana
State University. Her mentoring is beyond the ordinary, especially when the
unusually difficult logistical factors of the work are considered. In her unique
and successful mentoring of students in Montana, she has been able to overcome
many challenges, such as the demanding geographic environment. Young has worked
with both students and families to achieve successful outcomes for Native
American students. She has also worked with a coalition to achieve positive
results. The rate of students graduating from her program and going on to attend
college is high as a result of Young's mentoring and of the very positive role
model that she poses to Native American students.
