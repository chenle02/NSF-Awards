"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research seeks to develop
terahertz quantum-cascade lasers (THz QCLs) that operate at high temperatures.
Specifically, by end of the proposed three-year period, the principal
investigator envisions the development of THz QCLs that can operate at
temperatures above 240 K, so that they can be conveniently cooled by
thermoelectric coolers. Such a development will have a significant impact on
science and technologies in THz frequencies, where potential applications are
promising in detection of chemical and biological agents, imaging for medical
and security applications, astrophysics, remote atmospheric sensing and
monitoring, high-bandwidth free-space communications, and ultrahigh-speed signal
processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The project will involve a
considerable effort of quantum design. If an isolated quantum well can be viewed
as a one-dimensional "artificial atom", then a multiple quantum-well (MQW)
structure is an "artificial molecule". This project is nothing short of
designing and making such artificial molecules that perform the desired function
of THz lasers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The principal investigator
has been invited to give invited/plenary/keynote talks at many prestigious
conferences. The work has also been reported in media for broad communities such
as Technology Review, Laser Focus, and NPR Market Place. Through collaborations,
the THz lasers developed in the PI's group have helped to enhance
infrastructures at other institutions in THz-related activities by adding a
crucial enabling component. The principal investigator will incorporate elements
in the research project into a graduate course in solid-state physics and a
undergraduate core course Signals and Systems.
