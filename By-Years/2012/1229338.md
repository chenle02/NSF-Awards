The proposal requests funds to acquire a Wide range Particle Spectrometer ( WPS)
for characterizing a wide range (i.e., nano to micron sized ) aerosol particles.
The device is needed to support aerosol inhalation experiments with subject
specific airway model. The PI has used ScanIP image processing software to
extract 3D images files of up to 8 airway generations with or without the oral
cavity, which are then created by a fused deposition molding 3D rapid
prototyping machine. Models are available for normal and diseased adult patients
and for diseased pediatric patient airways. The prototypes are then placed in a
testing chamber in the PI's Inhalation Aerosol Dynamics lab. With the exception
of the WPS, all components, including a Vibrating Orifice Aerosol Generator and
a Condensation Aerosol Generator, are available for the air flow experiments.
Tidal volumes and breathing rates can be controlled to mimic sedentary and
exercise states. Regional Deposition Measurements will be obtained by washing
out pertinent sections of the lung models with ionized water and measuring the
amount of uranine that was present in the deposited oil droplets. Though not
described in the proposal, computational models created from the same 3D image
files used to create the flow through prototypes would be developed for
comparison with the experimental results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI, Sinjae
Hyun, PhD (Mechanical Engineering, NCSU, 1998) is an Associate Prfoessor od
Engineering and Director of the Engineering Research Program at Mercer
University, where he has been since 2003. In 2010 he took a sabbatical leave at
the US EPA Inhalation Dosimetry Study Lab to obtain training for inhalation
aerosol transport and deposition experiments in the respiratory system. He and
an undergraduate research assistant continued the training in the summer of
2011. A strong letter of support was included from Chong S, Kim, PhD, EPA, who
promised collaboration and advice.
