A new course, Advanced Microbiology, will be added to the curriculum. Each year
it will provide a detailed study of one topic (e.g., Pathogenic Microbiology,
Applied and Environmental Microbiology, Virology, Microbial Physiology,
Microbial Genetics) in a strong laboratory format. Problem-oriented laboratories
will be developed in all other microbiology/immunology courses. For example, the
study of lymphocyte division will be developed into an integrated problem
involving extraction of mitogenic substances, dose-response determination of the
effectiveness to stimulate lymphocytes, measurement of lymphocyte replication,
and quantitative comparison of mitogenic factors isolated from different plants.
Selected students will also undertake independent research projects using the
new equipment, which includes a centrifuge, liquid scintillation counter, ultra
low freezer, and freeze dryer. The college will provide 50% matching funds.
