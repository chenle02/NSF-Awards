This award supports a one year internship in parallel computing for a faculty
member from a minority institution. The objective is to give the participant the
opportunity to master techniques and to conduct research in parallel computing.
Working closely with computer scientists who are experts in parallel computing,
the participant will learn about various debugging tools and performance
measurement techniques available for parallel programs, study languages used to
program multiprocessors, and work on the design of algorithms to exploit
parallelism. The participant will then be encouraged to review the wide range of
applications being carried out on multiprocessors, and to propose and work on
his own new applications. Finally, the participant will have hands-on experience
with a variety of different advanced-computer architectures. The proposed
internship will provide an excellent opportunity for a faculty member to acquire
knowledge and experience in the area of parallel computing. The current
internship program has attracted highly qualified faculty members who wish to
keep abreast of new technologies. We are confident that the proposed program
will be equally successful.
