The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in the
improved database productivity that the technology can bring to many industries.
Existing software systems based on traditional pull-based database engine design
and CPU hardware often do not provide the desired high throughput and/or short
response time in the management and analysis of large-scale data. The technology
developed here offers a more efficient solution to meet such challenges and its
commercialization will potentially impact the practice of data management and
analysis in a large number of industries including healthcare, retailing, and
online advertising. Successful deployment of these the systems developed here
will enable a range of industry sectors to efficiently harness big data
analytics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project explores the commercial
potential of a data management system with a novel software architecture and
advanced data analytics functionalities built on massively parallel hardware
such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The technology features a data
processing engine under a data streaming (push-based) design and achieves very
high utilization of a multitude of computing resources on GPUs. Current
experiments show that the data processing throughput and latency are about one
order of magnitude better than best known systems built for the same purposes.
The research behind this technology complements current work in database systems
and parallel computing fields. The system-oriented approach is in sharp contrast
to existing GPU work that typically focuses on solving individual problems and
thus highly creative. Innovations are also seen in the formal methods used for
meeting system design challenges such as dynamic resource allocation in GPUs.
