The structure, phase behavior, and protein stability of membrane- associated
proteins complexed with associating polymers which replace the lipid matrix will
be investigated by x-ray diffraction and other techniques. The polymer-membrane
protein associations represent a fundamentally new approach aimed at producing a
new class of biomolecular materials. The first membrane-associated proteins to
be studied are based on (i) integral memebrane proteins (e.g.,
bacteriorhodopsin) and (ii) self-assembled two-dimensional surface protein
layers of bacteria. The two classes of associating polymers which we propose to
consider consist of (i) hydrophobically associating copolymers, and (ii)
ionomers.
