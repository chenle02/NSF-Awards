Abstract ESI-9454428 Carlsen Cornell Institute on Science and the Environment
for Teachers This five year project proposes to provide education and training
for 20 teachers each year in a three week workshop for a total of 100 teachers
directly enhanced. An additional 100 teachers will be enhanced through secondary
training at sites away from Cornell University by teams of the orignal teachers
who have received up to six weeks of additional training. The education and
training will be centered on aquatic systems. There will also be a series of
academic year workshops on specific institute related topics. A requirement that
teams of teachers develop and implement local projects will also be in place.
The goals of the project are to 1) Strengthen the knowledge of secondary science
teachers about environmentally related science; 2) Update teachers' skills in
using appropriate scientific and pedagogical methods and tools; 3) Support a
teacher leadership network; 4) Sponsor local curriculum projects that integrate
the school sciences and explore science in its social context; and 5) Promote
the use of original student experimentation il science teaching. This project
has a cost share of 49% of the requested support from the Foundation.
