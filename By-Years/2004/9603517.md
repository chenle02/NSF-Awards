The objective of the proposal is to utilize laboratory plasma experiments to
identify the physics and characterize the signatures of space-relevant
fluctuations, small-scale irregularities, and particle heating induced by
velocity-shear driven mechanisms. In particular, the project will attempt to,
1.) determine the dependence of Kelvin-Helmholz, inhomogeneous energy-density
driven, and electron-ion hybrid Kelvin-Helmholtz excitation thresholds on shear
parameters, 2.) test the ability to seed shear-driven turbulence at the edges of
nonlinearly evolved Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices in plasma potential, 3.)
distinguish the ion heating induced by different shear-driven waves from that
resulting from current-driven waves, and 4.) determine the influence of
introducing small concentrations of a second positive-ion species on items 1-3
above. The specific long range goals are to improve the interpretation of the
dynamically intense geomagnetic activity that arises at the edges of auroral
arcs and in black aurora and to provide quantitative comparisons to theoretical
models used to interpret space observations.
