9406327 Hammer RUTCOR, Rutgers Center for Operations Research at Rutgers
University, The State University of New Jersey will purchase high capacity
computing equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in
operations research. The equipment will be used for several research projects,
in particular for solving large scale satisfiability problems, for developing
efficient algorithms in logic minimization, for implementing interior point
algorithms for large scale linear and nonlinear programming problems, and for
the solution of very large scale specially structured linear programming
problems.
