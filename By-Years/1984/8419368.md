This research develops fundamental approaches for a knowledge-based expert
system to characterize a site based on geotechnical factors. The approach is new
for geotechnical research and will provide a new insight to improve the state-
of-the-art of understanding of the expert systems approach to geomechanics. The
primary goal of this research is to formalize the expertise used by the
geotechnical community for characterizing a site and to demonstrate the
automatic processing of this expertise. This research will collect extensive
geotechnical data to establish the range of techniques and viewpoints that
currently prevail in the geotechnical community and will incorporate the
expertise acquired from these experts into a knowledge-based expert system. The
demonstration of the system will be carried out by providing graphical
interfaces for a three-dimensional subsurface model.
