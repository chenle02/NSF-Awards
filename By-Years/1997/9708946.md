9708946 King The Global Positioning System (GPS) is making a profound impact on
the understanding of diverse scientific problems in the earth sciences such as
plate kinematics, the earthquake cycle, crustal dynamics, volcanic processes,
global ice dynamics and associated sea level changes, and atmospheric sensing.
To make effective use of this technology earth scientists need accurate and
efficient software to process GPS data. This award provides funding for
improving the documentation and user interfaces of the software currently used
for high-precision GPS applications. The activity is to be a collaboration
between scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at the
University Consortium for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). This award will support
the work managed by the MIT group. ***
