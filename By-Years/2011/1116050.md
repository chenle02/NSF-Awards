This proposal is developing theoretical foundations as well as algorithms and
software for secrecy-preserving reasoning. The key novel idea, rather different
from existing work, is to exploit the indistinguishability (as far as the
querying agent is concerned) between secret information, on one hand, and
incomplete information, on the other hand, under the open world semantics. The
Principal Investigator utilizes his ideas of for computing small secrecy
envelopes so that answering "Unknown" to queries inside the envelope while
answering queries outside the envelope truthfully, constitutes a secrecy-
preserving query-answering algorithm. The Principal Investigator plans to
integrate this research into education and to enhance interdisciplinary
collaborations within and beyond Iowa State University. In addition, he plans to
advance collaborations with industrial partners (Boeing in the high-tech area
and Mayo Clinic in the health care area) as well as applications in the areas of
information assurance and national security.
