This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will aid,
support, and encourage eLearning students and instructors to find the best
matches for their purposes in each other's skills, and to find the best
knowledge and program resources to suit their immediate, particular needs. The
software automatically extracts taxonomies from textual materials, which then
allows those materials to be cross-referenced automatically. Taxonomize thus
will provide extensible and low-cost eLearning support software, which is based
on knowledge management (KM) capabilities, rather than attaching KM as an added
feature. For example, an advanced auto-categorization engine will provide
content management to help students find the best resources of tutors and
workgroups to match their immediate needs.

Current customers are colleges seeking economical ways to meet increasing
demands for a popular international tutoring program. The research program,
"PerK," will enable this expansion at costs far below current market. Ultimately
the goal is to disseminate PerK capabilities into the full eLearning market,
with target functionality and at lower cost than other current eLearning
providers.
