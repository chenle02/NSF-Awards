"Formal Responses to Increasing Diversity within Social Institutions"

Tricia C. Bruce, PI

ABSTRACT

How do social institutions respond to increasing diversity? This research
examines the question of the accommodation of subcultures in religious
institutions via an in-depth, national look at non-territorial parishes in the
U.S. Catholic Church. Data are drawn from: (1) a nationwide survey of dioceses
regarding the presence and creation of non-territorial or "personal" parishes,
and (2) follow-up case studies of personal parishes in several dioceses.

In a context of increasing racial, political, and cultural diversification in
the U.S., this study brings attention to how the largest U.S. religious
denomination has fostered and managed congregations which serve sub-cultural
groups. It maps an important concept (the "personal parish") which has growing
and significant implication for how Americans build and define religion in local
contexts. The creation of personal parishes to serve subcultures of Catholics on
the basis of ethnicity, language, rite, or other reason reveals how religious
groups act within a pluralistic religious marketplace driven increasingly by
identity rather than territorial ascription. Findings carry significance not
only for religious groups in their attempts to accommodate diversity from within
but also for a broader understanding of homophily and heterogeneity in American
life as revealed in a variety of social institutions.

Broader Impacts

This project brings empirical data to bear on questions relevant to all social
institutions facing subcultural diversification. Its relevance to the ways
social institutions accommodate diversity and organize amidst changing local
contexts can be utilized by scholars and policy makers.

Its broader impacts also include (1) training for undergraduate students at an
Appalachian, non-PhD granting college (including multilingual and first-
generation college students) in the methodology of the social sciences, (2)
presentation to broad audiences interested in the theoretical and cultural
implications of responses to subcultural diversity in American religion and
other social institutions, and (3) public access to previously ungathered
information on congregations geared toward traditionally marginalized
populations. A resulting database of personal parish profiles will facilitate
future studies of diversification in the American religious landscape.
