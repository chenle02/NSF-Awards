The Nebraska University Consortium for Information Assurance (NUCIA), part of
the College of Information Science and Technology (IS&T) at the University of
Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) is implementing and administering a Federal Cyber
Service: Scholarship for Service program to provide 30 student scholarships over
a four-year period, 15 scholarships at the undergraduate level and 15
scholarships at the graduate (Masters) level. NUCIA has developed undergraduate
and graduate curriculum concentrations in information assurance, including seven
undergraduate courses and 10 graduate courses. These curriculum concentrations
were developed to provide students with a solid background in the fundamentals
of information assurance, combined with a diverse set of applied exercises and
projects that translate theory into practice.
