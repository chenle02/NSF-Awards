A new course "Field, Survey, and Analysis Techniques in Environmental Biology"
is being developed. This new course is introducing the students to new concepts
and techniques in ways designed to stimulate interest in investigative studies
and in research projects. Using the equipment procured through this award,
Biology majors are gaining experience in the description and analysis of
ecological systems, as well as in hypothesis structuring, field sampling,
literature retrieval and use, descriptive and analytical statistical techniques,
field surveys and experimental design methods. Methods and techniques involved
in field studies of aquatic and terrestrial habitats are being introduced
through studies of aquatic and terrestrial components of the Anacostia and
Potomac Rivers and the Chesapeake Bay. Students are becoming better prepared for
future graduate or lab/research positions by using the newly available
fluorescent and phase microscopes, fluorometer, ion analyzer, spectrophotometer,
sieve shaker, incubator, colony counter, furnace, and BOD and pH meters. Like
all other parts of the Gallaudet curriculum, this program is designed especially
to meet the needs of students with severely impaired hearing.
