This grant permits Dr. McGuire to continue his archaeological survey of the
Altar Valley region which is located in the northern part of Sonora, Mexico.
Preliminary work has confirmed the presence of many sites referable to the
Trincheras culture, which dates from approximately 200 to 1500 A.D. Trincheras
sites seem to be multi.functional and include defensive works, agricultural
terraces and habitation structures. Preliminary work indicates a relatively
complex prehistory with major shifts in adaptations, changes in social
organization and shifting inter.regional contactsMcGuire and his team will
survey selected portions of the Altar Valley to locate sites. They will record
site size, features and environmental context. They will collect surface
artifacts . which consist primarily of shell, ceramic and lithic remains . and
analyze these. The goal of this work is to establish the basis for a longer term
field project. What makes this region of special archaeological interest is that
it lies between the "high" culture areas in Central Mexico, to the South, and
the Southwest U.S., to the North. Shell, which appears at a trade item in the
Southwest sites is plentiful in the Altar Valley and this suggests that the
region played a role in a widespread shell trade. It is clear that a complex
society developed in the Altar region but the extent to which trade served as a
causal factor is unclear. Archaeolologists have theorized about the relationship
betwen trade and the growth of such societal complexity and the Altar Valley
provides an excellent area to examine this question. This project should also
shed a new light on the development of prehistoric Southwest cultures. This
research is important for several reasons. It will shed new light on the
question of how complex societies such as our own develop and are maintained.
Secondly there is a long history of archaeological research in the Southwestern
U.S. While the Rio Grande River has prevented, for the most part, investigation
in Northern Mexico, the river did not serve as barrier in prehistoric times.
Thus McGuires work will provide important new archeological data.
