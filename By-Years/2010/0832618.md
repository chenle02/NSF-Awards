This award facilitates scientific research using the large new computational
resource named Blue Waters being developed by IBM and scheduled to be deployed
at the University of Illinois in 2011. It provides travel funds to support
technical coordination between the principal investigators, the Blue Waters
project team and vendor technical team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
involves preparing numerical codes to be run on Blue Waters in a study of the
course of helium flash events in early generation giant stars near the end of
their lives. This relatively short duration (e.g. two years) event of
accelerated nuclear burning can dredge up material enriched with heavier
elements from the interior of the star and mix them with the outer envelope of
the star as the latter is expelled, forming a planetary nebula. The plan is to
first execute 3D, global simulations of this violent burning phase for short
periods at high resolution to capture the turbulent entrainment of unburned
hydrogen into the helium convection zone. Statistical analysis of the output
from these high-resolution calculations will provide subgrid-scale
parameterizations of turbulent, multifluid entrainment, mixing and nuclear
burning that can then be incorporated in coarser resolution models. The coarser
resolution models with parameterizations of the smaller scales of entrainment
and turbulent combustion will then be integrated over much longer periods to
determine the evolution of the helium flash. The project also involves using a
novel technique to organize the computational work on the Blue Waters processors
to use their computational power more effectively. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successful, the proposed work on Blue Waters will provide insights into the
origin and dispersal of heavy elements in the universe. It could also provide a
computational technique that would benefit a number of areas of research that
need to make efficient use of the emerging class of very large, parallel, multi-
core computing systems.
