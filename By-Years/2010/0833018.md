University of Maryland System Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation
Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Program is a collaborative effort between the
National Science Foundation and University of Maryland institutions to increase
the quality and quantity of underrepresented minorities matriculating to
completion of the doctoral degree in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics fields (STEM) fields. The program at the University of Maryland-
College Park prepares students to meet the challenges of completing doctoral
programs of study and for academic careers in higher education. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Integrating research and education, the BD fellows will be nurtured
over two years as a cohorted community that will benefit from a program of
academic and personal development activities as well as social support to
sustain their commitment and success to the terminal Ph.D. STEM degree. Program
activities include linkages to the Maryland Alliances for Graduate Education in
the Professoriate (PROMISE)as well as other NSF-funded research and education
projects, including programs that provide mentoring opportunities for
undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A total of 12 students from
underrepresented minority populations in STEM fields will participate in the
program at Auburn University during the 2009-2010 academic years. Results from
this support will broaden the participation of African-Americans, Hispanics,
Native Americans, and Pacific-Islanders in the STEM pipeline, U. S. workforce
and abroad. Results from rigorous evaluation of the project will add to the body
of literature in the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority
students in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;
