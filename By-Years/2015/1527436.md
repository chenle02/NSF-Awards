This project seeks to bring together new techniques for filtering and planning
to improve reasoning and analysis steps employed during robot
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By understanding those parts of the design process
that are typically conducted by hand and by asking which parts can be
practically automated, the research has the potential to assist practitioners by
scaling up the problems tackled, optimizing systems automatically, and
ultimately freeing designers from low-level detail and elevating their use of
time.
