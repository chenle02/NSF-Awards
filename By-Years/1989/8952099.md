This project is upgrading the undergraduate curriculum in engineering graphics
with the purchase of six Mac II workstations. The state-of- the-art equipment,
together with AutoCAD software, is allowing an increased number of students to
work on solid state modeling. The equipment affects several areas of study,
including drafting, building construction, electronics technology and computer-
aided manufacturing.
