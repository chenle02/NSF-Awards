9312028 Bruce Massachusetts Institute for Technology requests support from NSF
for connection of the New Hampshire Technical College System, the Maine Medical
Center, Rivier College, and Simon's Rock College of Bard to the New England
Academic Research Network (Nearnet) which is the NSF mid-level network that
serves the New England area. A primary goal of NEARnet is to facilitate
collaborative projects and sharing of resources between institution, including
those outside the state. NEARnet will provide operations management and
information services and it will give the universities and colleges a connection
to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The each of the universities has written a description of its
organization and a statement of the benefits of Internet access that it expects
including: greater functionality and network speed to be able to access
supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being able to
implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will
benefit from the links. This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to
explore innovative educational resources. Their diversity will expose NEARnet to
a broader range of user requirements. NEARnet will use the information obtained
by serving this diverse group for the benefit of New England's academic and
research community. ***
