A combined field and laboratory study is proposed for epithermal ore deposits of
the Champion Mine, Bohemia district, in the western Cascades, Oregon. Veins in
this deposit record multiple episodes of fluid flow and precipitation. Field
relations have been mapped by a PhD student involved in the project. They will
be studied in detail (fluid inclusion measurements, microprobe analysis of ore,
gangue, and alteration minerals, and Ar-Ar geochronology of igneous and
mineralization episodes). Observational data will be interpreted in terms of
theoretical models of ore formation involving cooling, boiling, mixing, and
redox histories of ore forming brines. Numerical simulations will be used to
model (a) mechanisms of sulfide and gold precipitation, and (b) the role of heat
transfer to and from wall rocks. These studies will be of application to
understanding many epithermal ore deposits.
