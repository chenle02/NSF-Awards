The Undergraduate Graphics Laboratory supports the new course, The Science of
Imaging: Computer Graphics for Non-Programmers, which serves as an introduction
to science for non-science-majors. The course is a vehicle for instilling in
students the excitement of mathematics and science and the importance of
studying such subjects in the liberal arts tradition. The Science of Imaging
interweaves the theory of rendering graphical images with appropriate
experimentation and projects, enabling students to see how science is done and
how its theories can be applied. The rendering of realistic images is used to
introduce the science and mathematics on which graphics are based. The course is
not intended to replace the students' need to take complete courses in
mathematics and/or science, but to provide motivation for students to take the
courses.
