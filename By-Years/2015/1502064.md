Applications of biotechnology affect diverse and critical facets of our lives
from the development of medicines we take, to the production of food we eat, to
the creation of fuels that power our vehicles and more. Furthermore, the
bioscience/biotechnology industry is a significant contributor to the United
States economy, employing in excess of 1.6 million workers at more than 70,000
companies. Whether they take place in major universities, large corporations or
small start-up companies, research and development activities that lead to
advances in the field of biotechnology rely greatly on the presence of well-
qualified entry-level technical employees to carry out essential tasks. In order
to serve the needs of the regional bioscience/biotechnology industry, the Orange
County Biotechnology Collaborative Partnership will unify and fortify the
individual efforts in biotechnician education of three southern California
community colleges, Santa Ana College, Santiago Canyon College and Fullerton
College.

Working with an advisory board composed of representatives from the local
industry and academic institutions, the members of the Orange County
Biotechnology Collaborative Partnership will design a curriculum tailored to
provide program graduates with professional skills and competencies highly
desired in the workplace. Program elements being developed across the three
colleges include simulated workplace experiences embedded within biotechnology
courses, extensive outreach to local high schools and internship opportunities
in industrial and academic settings for students in the program. A series of
three successive stackable certificates will provide students with options for
multiple program entry and exit points. Completion of the three certificates
plus two additional classes in a specialty area of emphasis will lead to an
Associate of Science degree in Biotechnology. As all three colleges in the
partnership are Hispanic-Serving Institutions, this project will provide
educational pathways into the STEM professional workforce for individuals
historically underrepresented in science and technology. Project evaluation will
involve metrics such as numbers and demographics of program graduates, employer
surveys to ensure industry needs are being addressed and whether project goals
and objectives are met. These efforts will contribute to the general knowledge
base regarding successful practices for embedding professional skills training
within formal advanced technological coursework, as well as the effectiveness of
stackable certificates in promoting flexible entrance to and exit from the
biotechnician program.
