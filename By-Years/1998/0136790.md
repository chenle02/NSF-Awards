Financial markets play positive and negative roles in economic fluctuations.
This project focuses on the latter roles and their impact on actual and optimal
macroeconomic policy. Since emerging economies are particularly affected by
financial underdevelopment and its consequences, they are both an object of
study in themselves, and a good device to isolate the financial mechanisms that
affect developed economies as well. Consequently, this project focuses on
emerging economies but extracts more general lessons as well. The starting point
of the project is a perspective where emerging economies are affected by two
main forms of financial frictions. They have weak links with international
financial markets and domestic financial markets are underdeveloped. The
combination of these ingredients lead to occasional external crises, which are
made more likely and severe by the equilibrium undervaluation of precautionary
actions by domestic agents. Within this context the investigator asks and
attempts to provide theoretical and empirical answers to questions such as: What
is the appropriate monetary policy during crises and their prelude? How is the
answer affected by the potential separation between domestic and international
liquidity? To what extent and under which circumstances can monetary policy
substitute for missing domestic insurance markets? How is this role affected by
liability dollarization? Why does the latter persist long after inflation has
subsided? What is behind the underinsurance problem of emerging economies? How
is the standard political-economy analysis of central bank behavior affected by
the presence of recurrent crises? What is the optimal exchange rate system for
economies with underdeveloped financial markets? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
