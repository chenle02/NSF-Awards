More than 2.3 million Americans participate in clinical trials annually. The
groups that oversee and approve the scientific and ethical appropriateness of
clinical research projects, institutional review boards ("IRBs"), are
empirically understudied and largely invisible to the public and research
participants. Using a mixed methods approach, this study explores how biomedical
IRBs translate flexible regulatory mandates into operational activities, as well
as how IRBs respond to environmental pressures. It will shine a light on IRBs,
which will increase public literacy and engagement around science and health
policy issues, and empower patients.

The investigation proceeds in two phases: first, administration of a national
survey to IRB members for quantitative analysis, and second, observation of and
semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of biomedical IRBs and IRB
members for qualitative analysis. This project extends theoretical
understandings of organizational responses to law and regulation, and
contributes practical knowledge about IRBs.
