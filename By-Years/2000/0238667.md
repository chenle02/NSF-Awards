This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
develop a rapid IgSwitch Assay for inducing and isolating IgG class switch
variants from IgM hybridomas using in-vitro culture conditions,
microencapsulation technology and fluorescence activated cell sorting. The
IgSwitch Assay is expected to be a significant improvement over conventional
methods used to isolate class switch variants, and will be useful in cell line
development and monoclonal antibody production. Prior Phase I research has
already demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed method using a model IgM
hybridoma. This Phase II project will develop in-vitro culture conditions that
promote switching to different IgG subclasses. The Phase II research will also
validate reagents for a family of isotype specific IgSwitch Assays.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of monoclonal
antibodies. Use of the targeted IgSwitch Assay in monoclonal antibody production
will help to generate new IgG specific antibodies from a largely untapped source
of IgM hybridomas, for potential use as research, therapeutic, diagnostic, and
imaging reagents.
