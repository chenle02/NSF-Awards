Dynamic compaction of collapsible soils under controlled soil moisture
conditioning will be performed in laboratory and in the field. The objective is
to determine the optimum moisture content based on depth and degree of
improvement, and on degree of vibration attenuation. The improvement will be
evaluated using surface elevation change, density increase based on
undistributed samples, strength increase based on cone penetrometer soundings,
and stiffness increases based on pressuremeter testing. Efforts will be made to
evaluate laboratory techniques for predicting optimum moisture content for field
compaction. Test will include proctor moisture density tests at various energy
levels as well as compaction test on undisturbed block samples trimmed into
compaction molds. Validation of the optimum moisture concept for dynamic
compaction of collapsible soils will result in increased compaction efficiency
and soil improvement, shorter construction times, and reduced costs.
