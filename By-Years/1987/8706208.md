Description: This project supports U.S. participation in an Indo-U.S. Workshop
on Photosynthesis, Molecular Biology and Bioenergetics to be held in New Delhi,
January 4-8, 1988. The meeting will address the topics of 1. Genes for
photosynthesis, including chloroplast genome and genetic approaches and
functional aspects of the photosynthesis apparatus. 2. Molecular structure-
function relationship including membrane protein complexes and membrane
organization. 3. Energy transduction including electron transport and proton
gradient and ATP formation. 4. Stress effects, including structural aspects of
photosynthesis apparatus and the photosynthetic activities. Scope: The workshop
will bring U.S. and Indian scientists, as well as some invited eminent European
scientists from various institutions together to discuss the progress of
research in this important field. This is likely to stimulate new scientific
concepts and new experimental research, possibly to be done cooperatively. Both
India and the U.S. have large active communities in this field and are both
likely to benefit from this exchange.
