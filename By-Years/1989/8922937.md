Between 10% and 40% of the Vanadium and Uranium entering the modern ocean as
dissolved river input is eventually buried in sediments overlain by anoxic
bottom water. Previous work by Dr. Emerson and his colleague Dr. Mix from Oregon
State University has found that concentrations of V and U in foram tests have
varied over the last 150 Kyrs. Provided the assumption is true that forams
incorporate these metals in equilibrium with seawater, this preliminary data
suggests that bottom water during the last glacial period was more oxygenated
that at present, and that contrasts between Atlantic and Pacific bottom water
was substantially different from that of today. In this renewal award the PIs
will to continue their research in several directions: 1) they will perform
culturing experiments with collaborator Dr. Erez in Israel to determine the
uptake pattern of V and U in live forams; 2) they will improve solid source mass
spectometry technique for measuring V and U insingle species of forams; and 3)
they will apply these techniques to refine the history of anoxia in the world's
oceans since the last interglacial.
