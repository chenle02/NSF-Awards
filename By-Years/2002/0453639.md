The problem being studied is how a changing climate will affect and be affected
in turn by water vapor feedbacks. The main questions the PI will try to answer
are: (1)&lt;br/&gt;why do global climate models (GCMs) produce water vapor
feedback in accord with thermodynamic arguments, while some other models fail to
do so; what types of models are trustworthy in addressing this issue, and for
what physical reasons; and, will relative humidity in the upper troposphere stay
constant as climate changes, or decrease with warming as suggested by some
recent studies? These questions will be addressed through atmospheric GCMs
(AGCM) climate-change experiments with microphysical and macrophysical
alterations to the model. The Community Climate System Model (CCSM) atmospheric
component (CAM) will be adapted for this use. The modeling capabilities
initiated through this project will also be used for collaborative research with
other Yale faculty on paleoclimate questions, and will be made available for
student and educational use to the Yale community. A global modeling component
to such projects has become increasingly feasible owing to the steadily
declining costs of computing. This research aims to resolve some longstanding
and controversial questions surrounding the importance of small vs. large-scale
processes in determining global humidity, and the transport of water species
near the tropical tropopause at convective outflow levels.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Results should lead either to improved
confidence in model forecasts of climate change, or else a more focused idea of
where work is most needed. Either result would ultimately improve the usefulness
of climate forecasts for societal and policy consideration. Also, this effort
should facilitate greater use of quantitative and rigorous climate calculations
in related research areas (ecological and societal impacts, paleoclimate, etc.).
