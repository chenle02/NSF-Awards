In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Artem Melman of the Department of Chemistry &amp;
Biomolecular Science at Clarkson University will explore the development of new
methods for the site specific derivatization of recombinant proteins. Current
methods for covalent derivatization of proteins are not selective, producing
complex mixtures of protein conjugates. The proposed approach will rely on
formation of metal complexes with the hexahistidine sequence that is present in
most recombinant proteins as a template for subsequent intramolecular alkylation
of one of the histidine residues of the hexahistidine sequence. The project will
involve study of ternary metal complexes of hexahistidine with other chelate
ligands, design and synthesis of histidine alkylating agents, and
chemoselectivity of their reactions with different nucleophiles. Based on these
studies, new hexahistidine alkylating reagents will be prepared and tested for
selective derivatization of model recombinant
proteins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is anticipated to lead to efficient
methods for derivatization of proteins and production of functional protein
conjugates. Development of these methods will have impact on several research
fields using chemically modified proteins including biochemistry, synthetic
biology, and medicinal chemistry. Possible applications of new protein
conjugates include new targeted drug delivery, early diagnostics of diseases,
and determination of structure and functions of proteins in biological systems.
In addition, this project will provide advance training of undergraduate and
graduate students, including those from groups historically underrepresented in
the sciences.
