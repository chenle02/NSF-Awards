For a few decades after Robert Oppenheimer's 1939 announcement of the probable
existence of "neutron stars", the field of neutron star astronomy was arguably
held back by a lack of understanding of what such objects would look like if
astronomers on Earth looked in their direction. Studies have found that
nonmagnetic neutron stars reveal their presence by emitting high energy
radiation in response to primarily matter falling onto them from an orbiting
companion star. The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes a series of theoretical
investigations that would predict the radiation emitted a matter-accretion
process. He suspects that the response is reponsible for the pulses of x-ray and
gamma ray radiation recently detected by balloon and space-borne high energy
experiments. The PI hopes to confirm or refute this idea by his modeling of what
these "signatures" of a brief radiation-driven wind would look like. He
anticipates further that these events can be used to estimate the masses and
radii of neutron stars directly, which has not been possible up to now. In
addition, he points out that a knowledge of high energy signatures from
accretion events may be essential in the interpretation of data from several x-
and gamma-ray space missions now being planned. Finally, the PI wishes to
examine the spiralling in of neutron stars in decaying orbits around one
another. This process would proceed so fast (within seconds) that it can be
fairly described as a "neutron star collision". Much of the gravitational energy
liberated in a collision would be emitted in a brief burst of gravitational
radiation. It is possible that such events could be a major source of any
gravitational radiation detected on Earth. ***//
