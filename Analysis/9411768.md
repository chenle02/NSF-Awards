9411768 Berenstein This award provides partial support for young investigators
to participate in the 1994 International Conference of the IEEE-EBMS to be held
in Baltimore, November 1994. The specific purpose of the funding is directed at
research developments presented at a concurrent workshop whose focus is Wavelets
in Biomedical Engineering and Medicine. This is a new area of application of the
wavelet theory which has the potential for important applications to
neurophysiology, speech analysis, MRI, spectroscopy and the analysis of EEG and
ECG. The workshop will have two parts, (1) tutorial presentations by prominent
experts in the field and (2) a series of contributed talks focusing on new
developments and applications in biology and medicine. The workshop focuses
exclusively on developments andapplications of wavelet theory to mathematical
problems arising in biology and medicine and does not involve any research which
could be considered to be directly related to medical or health issues. ***
