9632032 Hill The plan is to establish the School of Mathematics at Georgia Tech
as the center for applied analysis in the Southeast. This will be accomplished
by building on present departmental strengths in applied analysis (differential
equations, dynamical systems, mathematical physics, numerical analysis,
probability), using this group of core faculty as a base and expanding on its
current activities. The Applied Analysis Center will have a small
administrative/technical staff, permanent facilities for visitors and postdocs,
an electronic network of regional applied analysts, a liaison center to
facilitate and encourage interaction with industry and a student placement
service. Regular annual conferences and workshops at Georgia Tech will be
complemented by a distinguished lecturer series, a long-term visitor program and
a regional lectureship program in which our researchers will visit regional
universities, colleges and community colleges on a regular basis. The net result
will be a surge of research and educational activity in applied analysis in the
Southeast.
