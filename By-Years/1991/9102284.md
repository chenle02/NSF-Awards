Bonneau Long &amp; Medium-Term Research: Transition-Metal Dichal- cogenides:
From Quantum Confinement to Novel Inclusion Compounds This award is made under
the Program for Long- &amp; Medium- Term Research at Foreign Centers of
Excellence, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to
twelve months abroad at research centers of proven excellence. The program's
awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or
complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad. This
award, sponsored by Dr. Richard B. Kaner of the University of California, Los
Angeles, will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Philippe
Bonneau with Dr. Jean Rouxel of the Institut de Physique et Chimie des
Mat>riaux, Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique, Universit> de Nantes.
They will investigate layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and other
lamellar materials, which can be exfoliated or sonicated in polar solvents to
produce solution-suspended monolayers. The suspended monolayers are then size
separated (by gel electrophoresis) and used in quantum confinement studies or
restacked with other low-dimensional compounds to create new, metastable
inclusion compounds. Quantum confinement in TMD monolayers can be investigated
both as a function of particle size and as a function of monolayer interactions
with various chemical environments. New inclusion compounds, composed uniquely
of low-dimensional materials, provide almost limitless opportunities to study
topics such as intercalation and electronic interactions in mixed low-
dimensional materials, superconductivity, charge density waves, and the role of
stoichiometry on the structure and the electronic properties in low-dimensional
inclusion compounds. The award recommendation provides funds to cover
international travel and a flat administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S.
home institution.
