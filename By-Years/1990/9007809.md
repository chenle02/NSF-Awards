With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Bouman plans to continue his study of the way in which a
wide variety of molecules respond to externally applied magnetic and electric
fields. Properties to be studied include nuclear magnetic shielding, static and
dynamic polarizabilities, electronic oscillator and rotatory strengths, and
vibrational circular dichroism. The work is based on a localized molecular
orbital approach to linear response properties, using both correlated and
uncorrelated wavefunctions. The major focus is on calculation and analysis of
the nature of nuclear magnetic shielding tensors, as well as the study of
electronic spectra and vibrational circular dichroism. This study will culminate
in the extension of the popular RPAC computer code for the computation of these
properties.
