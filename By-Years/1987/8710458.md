This proposal is to further develop a comprehensive model of the physical and
chemical reactions occurring in the thermosphere during auroral precipitation
events, and to use them to interpret spectrographic observations from recent and
planned CEDAR campaigns. The result will be information on the energy
distribution of incident electrons and protons, and changes in atmospheric
composition as a result of the precipitation. The proposed work is likely to
lead to a significant advance in our ability to use ground based observations to
infer the physics and chemistry of auroral effects on the atmosphere, including
heating effects and composition changes. There is a current need for such an
interpretive capability, which will be increasing during the next few years, as
the CEDAR campaigns of coordinated auroral observations produce extensive data
sets. The PI is highly qualified to perform such work, as he has developed the
most comprehensive model currently available for such work.
