Kilauea volcano began a new phase of eruption on Dec. 20th, 2020 after ~1.3
years of repose. The beginning of the current eruption was fairly low risk to
the community but that could change quickly, as it did in 2018. One factor that
could help forecast if this eruption might transition into a higher risk
eruption is the amount of hot, gassy, and crystal-poor magma that is reaching
the surface. If the magma is colder, more crystalline, and degassed this
suggests that the eruption is more likely to end soon. However, if researchers
detect a change in the gas or crystal content during these early stages of the
eruption, they can assume this means the magma chamber is producing new, hot and
gassy magma instead of erupting old, degassed and crystal-rich magma. This
project will sample volcanic gas and estimate the crystal content in an attempt
to characterize the deep magma feeding this eruption as old (lower risk) or new
(higher risk).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will conduct investigations on
the 2020 eruption at the Kilauea summit with the goal of capturing and
correlating changes in the crystal content of the lava and gas geochemistry. The
researchers will use one tried-and-tested method and one experimental method to
build a dynamic picture of the early stages of this eruption through 1) gas
collection, and 2) hyperspectral imaging. With these techniques, they will
constrain the carbon isotope ratio of the gas (an indicator of young, fresh
magma), the crystal content (an indicator of stagnated, older magma), and the
eruption vigor. The potential contribution of this project is to inform the
forecast of the likely behavior of the current activity as well as develop a new
remote method which may lead to real-time crystal contents during an eruption.
These values would be useful for lava flow modeling which helps civil defense
plan evacuations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
