This project will be supported by an award from the Chemistry Office of Special
Projects under the aegis of the Chemistry of Life Processes Initiative. The
studies will focus on the macrocyclic pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) class of
natural products. The PAs have attracted much attention from the scientific
community as a consequence of their wide spread occurrence in nature, their
challenging structural features, the numerous physiological effects they elicit,
and their worldwide health and agricultural implications. Despite this
significance, a number of fundamentally important aspects of PA chemistry and
biology remain unanswered. In the current study, two issues central to the
understanding of PA biosynthesis will be addressed: 1) The determination of the
latter stages of PA biosynthesis with particular attention to be paid to
anabolism of the macrocyclic ring. 2) The determination of the products formed
by the turnover or degradation (catabolism) of the PAs.
