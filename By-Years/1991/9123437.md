This award is for support of a 3 year cooperative modeling program involving the
University of Washington (UW) and the Ohio State University (OSU). Each research
team will focus on a complementary part of the ice modeling program, UW on
derivation of paleoclimate forcing on the ice flow, and OSU on the development
of ice fabric and hardness variations which must be known before adequate models
can be constructed. Formal inverse techniques will be used to derive the
rheological parameters, and the climate forcing histories. Ice core and borehole
data will also be used to test the model.
