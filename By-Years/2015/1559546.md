Despite the increase in the number of life-saving organ transplants in the last
decades, organs recovered from deceased donors are not adequate to meet the
increasing demand in most countries. In many cases, the possibility of organ
transplantation is prevented because of the objection of the donor's family,
especially when the deceased herself did not express her willingness for organ
donation (OD) while alive. This project implements a broad and in-depth research
program to understand behavioral and psychological mechanisms behind OD
decisions. It aims to find ways to increase the percentage of organ donors and
the support for policies that may increase ODs. For example, encouraging OD
receivers to tell their story in the media (with identifying detail) may
increase the support for OD. Likewise, providing statistical information about
the average life expectancy may promote realistic thinking about death and may
increase willingness to commit to OD. We believe that increasing the number of
potential organ donors as well as the public awareness of this issue may help to
save the lives of many that are waiting for organ
transplants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned research addresses three main
objectives. (1) To learn about the role of the presentation of OD cases in
affecting people's willingness to commit to OD (including the decision to donate
the organs of a deceased relative). (2) To examine individual differences in
death anxiety (Fear of Personal Death - FPD) and in people's beliefs, to learn
about their role in predicting people's decisions regarding OD issues. (3) To
manipulate the factors situationally, using priming techniques (i.e., priming
thoughts about religious issues, about just vs. unjust world; thoughts of
tempting fate; manipulation or increasing the salience of different aspects of
the FPD) to examine the influence of such manipulations on people's decisions
regarding OD issues. Together, these research directions will help us to better
understand the mechanisms behind OD decisions and describe how these decisions
differ from other donation decisions.
