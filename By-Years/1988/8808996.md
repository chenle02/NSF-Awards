This award is partial funding for the purchase of a high speed video and image
digitizing system for observation of flow phenomena in multiphase systems.
Specific studies will include bubble formation in the grid region of fluidized
beds, particle cluster formation in circulating fluidized beds, cluster
formation of magnetic particles in the draft tube of a magnetically stabilized
fluidized bed, and segregation of solids during the pumping of slurries. The
information to be obtained should assist in the design of more efficient gas-
particle contacting devices such as are used in chemical processing and energy
production.
