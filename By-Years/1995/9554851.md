Project NATURE is a collaborative research experience involving undergraduate
students in an introductory biology course. The focus of their research will be
on problems and solutions related to the restoration of natural areas, in
particular, prairie restoration. The project is unique in that it shares the
knowledge and biological products (seeds and plants) produced by undergraduate
students with teachers and students in schools and private citizens interested
in preserving and restoring prairies. About 900 students per year, for the next
several years, will be conducting research on seed germination, seedling and
juvenile plant survivorship, and the mortality and survival of vegetative and
flowering plants, as well as, the relationship between plant weight and seed
set. This life history approach to the conservation of plant species is
currently viewed by ecologists as an important way to guide recovery efforts for
rare and declining plant populations. This 5-week collaborative research
experience in an introductory biology course will show students that they too
can contribute to the restoration of natural areas, while learning what it means
to add their own small piece to a body of scientific knowledge.
