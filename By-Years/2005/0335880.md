This research deals with the integration of a Discrete Choice Analysis (DCA)
based approach to demand analysis with a Decision-Based Design (DBD) framework
that supports a company's goal of making profitable products. The research will
address four major topics, including (1) improving predictive capability of
demand analysis, (2) incorporating behaviors of multiple market players in
demand modeling, (3) predicting uncertainties in demand analysis, and (4)
extending engineering modeling for DBD implementation. The proposed approach and
techniques will be demonstrated through a real vehicle engine design problem,
and verified and validated based on the basic economic principles and the
properties of a rigorous alternative selection method. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successful, the proposed research will have an immediate impact on improving the
predictive capability of demand analysis in product design. The proposed method
can incorporate many important factors that are currently ignored, such as the
behavior of competitors and other players in a market and the uncertainty issues
in demand estimation. The proposed DBD framework will offer a rigorous
engineering design approach that supports a company's goal of making profitable
products. The work on extending engineering modeling is beneficial for bridging
the gap between business and engineering modeling in product design. The
proposed research is expected to extend the extant knowledge in engineering
design as well as in market research. The research is also expected to have a
broader impact on increasing industrial competitiveness and improving
educational activities. Research is anticipated to contribute to education in
the areas of engineering design theory and methodology, decision analysis in
engineering design, quality engineering, and market research for engineering
design. A strong collaboration is planned among the university and industry
teams including regular seminars, visits, and co-supervisions of graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
