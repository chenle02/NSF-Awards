Eight undergraduates will be supported by this Research Experiences for
Undergraduates renewal award. It is an activity which articulates closely with
the institution's own project-based undergraduate research program. The three
faculty advisors are well-versed in the philosophy of undergraduate research
participation. Excellent results achieved during the past four REU sites amply
demonstrate their capabilities. Students will work in teams in one or more
problem areas. Typical of these include studies of highly irregular graphs, edge
domination numbers of graphs, Hamming distances, pseudo-Boolean functions and
excess problems related to birigid graphs. Much of the research involves a
degree of computer experimentation which will be integrated into the early
stages of the program. All students will be required to communicate their
completed work as well as work in progress both orally and in writing. Finally,
they will be encouraged to present their results at an appropriate academic
meeting and to revise their reports for journal submission where significant
progress has been made.
