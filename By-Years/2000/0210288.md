This work seeks to describe the thermalization of electrons at a silicon/silicon
dioxide interface representative of a power MOSFET device. The interface is
characterized in one case by &lt;br/&gt;hydrogen passivated silicon bonds, and
in the other case without the hydrogen. It has been shown experimentally that
the hydrogen improves device performance, but that the longevity of
&lt;br/&gt;the hydrogen is limited. Therefore, the reliability of a device with
hydrogen is uncertain. Through modeling and simulation, the physical processes
governing the device behavior will be &lt;br/&gt;examined. The analysis will be
performed using Monte Carlo techniques that follow single electrons. The
scattering will be determined from cross-sections of the important scatterers in
&lt;br/&gt;the problem. In the present case, the cross-sections for silicon and
hydrogen can be obtained from the literature. However, the hydrogen-silicon
bonds represent a modified phonon &lt;br/&gt;distribution. This distribution has
been measured experimentally, and can be incorporated into the simulation
through a modified cross-section at the interface. Careful description of the
physical process will lead to an evaluation of device performance. Parametric
studies can then lead to enhanced device designs.&lt;br/&gt;
