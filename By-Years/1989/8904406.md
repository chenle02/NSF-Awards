8904406 Todd This project focuses on linear programming and its extensions,
especially in interior point methods and in probabilistic analysis. Linear
programming is the most basic constrained optimization problem and has wide-
ranging applications in the physical and engineering sciences. Variants of
Karmarkar's projective algorithm have very attractive theoretical and
computational properties. Part of the effort will be devoted to understanding
and improving Ye's potential function method. Convex quadratic programming is
also a fundamental problem, both in its own right and as a subroutine in
nonlinearly-constrained optimization. Efforts will be made to develop new
potential function methods for its solution. New probabilistic models for linear
programming will also be investigated both to understand more fully the
structure of such problems and to evaluate experimentally and analytically the
expected behavior of particular algorithms.
