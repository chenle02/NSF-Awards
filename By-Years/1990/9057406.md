This award is to provide research support to Dr. Westmoreland under the National
Science Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator Awards (PYIA) Program. The
objectives of the PYIA Program are to provide support to the Nation's most
outstanding and promising young science and engineering faculty. The awards are
intended to improve the capability of U.S. academic institutions to respond to
the demand for highly qualified science and engineering personnel for academic
and industrial research and teaching. Dr. Westmoreland's field of research is
the study of chemical reactions ranging from the plasma fabrication of
microelectronic devices to combustion and pyrolysis. He plans to combine
molecular-beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) with optical spectroscopy, gas
chromatography, and GC/MS to map concentrations within laboratory reactors. This
combination permits quantitative measurements both of reactive species (free
radicals, singlet species like silicon dihydride, and ions) and of stable
species. Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) of amorphous silicon
films from silane will be studied in an MBMS apparatus. A near-term goal is
describing the existing commercial PECVD of amorphous silicon: hydrogen, silicon
dioxide, and silicon-nitrogen films with sufficient accuracy for process and
product-quality control, but understanding at a molecular scale will also be
later directed toward new films and applications. His goals in combustion and
pyrolysis are to establish and apply detailed chemical mechanisms of oxidation
and growth, particularly the formation of aromatics. He will study three carbon
hydrocarbons (propane, propene, propyne, and propadiene) to determine whether
three carbon radicals form benzene, whether the benzene is formed via four
carbon radical pathways, and whether molecular or insertion reactions might also
be involved.
