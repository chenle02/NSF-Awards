9303181 Warren This is an award for equipment to investigate the development and
scalability of algorithms and systems for parallel computers. The
instrumentation to be acquired include a number of high performance parallel
workstations, a scalable distributed memory multiprocessor, and a high speed
network. The research supported by this infrastructure includes organic chemical
synthesis, automated theorem proving, very high speed transaction processing,
parallel prolog, 3-D graphics and volume visualization, and simulations of
massively parallel computers. ***
