This CAREER award, funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry
Division, supports the proposed research and educational plans of Professor
Timothy B. Clark of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the
University of San Diego. The project aims to develop substrate-directed C-H
borylation reactions, which result in selective formation of carbon-boron bonds.
The proposed research plan focuses on the design and development of catalysts
that selectively functionalize C-H bonds into C-B bonds. Ultimately, the
catalysts will be modified to be used in the C-H borylation of non-aromatic
substrates, providing valuable intermediates in organic synthesis.

The carbon-boron bond is versatile and can be used to access a number of
functional groups that are common in biologically relevant compounds such as
pharmaceuticals. This work will simplify access to a variety of derivatives and
could be used to facilitate the discovery of new materials for diabetes testing.
The bulk of the research performed will be carried out by undergraduate
students, providing valuable experiences for students interested in pursuing
careers in the area of catalysis or related fields. The proposed educational
activity aims to introduce high school students to applications and careers in
chemistry through providing an authentic research experience for high school
teachers and subsequently engaging their students in various activities such as
visiting USD Science building and field trip to local chemical R&D facility. The
involvement of high school teachers in an authentic research experience will
also allow them to incorporate research concepts into their curriculum.
