The controlled mixing history laminar flow reactor will contribute
significantly to our presently established research programs as well as
generally increase our future research capabilities and flexibility. The
University of Maryland is strongly committed to combustion research with current
major thrust in guiding the development of strategies for improved combustion
characteristics and reduced trace chemical pollutants, soot and carbonaceous
particulate formation during combustion of fuels including future low grade and
hazardous chlorinated hydrocarbon fuels.
