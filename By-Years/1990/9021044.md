Previous work on measurements of total and differential cross sections for
positron scattering on atoms will be extended. In addition there will be three
directions for the research, namely: 1. Measurements of excitation cross
sections for alkali atoms. 2. A measurement of the positronium formation cross
section. 3. A search for resonances in positron-atom collisions which have been
predicted theoretically, but have not yet been observed.
