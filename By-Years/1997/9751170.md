The objective of this proposal is to gain support to significantly enhance an
interdisciplinary Integrated Systems Laboratory (ISL) technology teacher
education facility for both pre- and in-service teacher preparation at the
University of Missouri-Columbia. This will result in a model laboratory, unique
in Missouri, for preparing secondary-level Technology Education teachers to work
within an interdisciplinary environment. Additionally, the laboratory will be
utilized by students throughout the College of Education, with specific emphasis
given to science and mathematics education as well as students from the
Industrial and Mechanical &amp; Aerospace engineering departments. To insure
this broadscale integration and use, the specifications for this laboratory were
developed jointly by faculty from technology education, science, mathematics
education, and engineering. Wide-spread national calls for Technology Education
and the integration of math/science/technology necessitate the development of a
facility for thematic exploration and study. This facility will be the primary
show place in the region for this new kind of learning, significantly enhancing
undergraduate education in Missouri, and setting a standard for the midwest. A
comprehensive undergraduate program in Technology Education has been approved by
the University and is in place. The most significant barrier to full
implementation of the program is a lack of state-of-the-art equipment necessary
to deliver the program. The equipment listed in this proposal has been carefully
selected to provide a solid foundation for preparing teachers for the 21 st
century.
