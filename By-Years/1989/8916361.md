Extremes in environmental conditions such as low and high temperature, drought,
and high salinity, severely limit the geographical distribution of plants and
account in large part for the shortfalls between potential and actual crop
yields. Many plants, however, have evolved mechanisms that enable them to
acclimate to and survive to varying degrees, different forms of environmental
"stress." The long term research interest of the Principal Investigator is to
understand at a molecular and cellular level the adaptive responses that plants
make to survive cold and freezing temperatures. He has recently established that
Arabidopsis, like many other plants, becomes more frost tolerant when exposed to
low nonfreezing temperatures and that changes in gene expression occur during
this cold acclimation process. His goal now is to determine the functions of the
cold-regulated ("cor") genes. His specific aims include: the isolation and
sequencing of cor genes; determining whether COR polypeptides have
cryoprotective effects; the construction and analysis of Adrabidopsis cor
mutants; determining the cellular and subcellular location of the COR gene
products; and determining whether Arabidopsis cor genes are highly conserved
among plants. At a minimum, these studies should provide additional insight into
the molecular and physiological changes that occur in plants at low temperature.
They also have the potential of yielding genes that could be used to improve the
cold and freezing tolerance of agronomically important plants.
