ABSTRACT This award for $444,000 to Duke University is part of the Graduate
Research Traineeship program of the Engineering Directorate. The objective of
the University's effort is to provide eight highly qualified trainees with the
opportunity to concentrate their doctoral level studies on nonlinear dynamics, a
fundamental discipline that promises to illuminate many complex problems of high
engineering and societal importance. The trainees will be recruited in large
part from academically non- traditional backgrounds. New recruitment activity
for the trainees will be concentrated at basically liberal arts, predominantly
Black schools in the region around the university. The objective for the
individual trainees is that they acquire the expertise to become leaders in
university and/or industrial research in this challenging and important
discipline.
