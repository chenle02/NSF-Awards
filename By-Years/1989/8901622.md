This award will support Professor Jorge V. Jose of Northeastern University in a
research collaboration with Professor G. Monsivais of the Universidad Nacional
Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) and Professor E. Cota of the Physics Institute of the
UNAM at Ensenada, Baja California. The investigators intend to study the
phenomena of wave propagation in a random nonlinear medium. More specifically,
they are interested in the transmission properties of a nonlinear random medium
in terms of the different roles played by disorder and nonlinearities. Further,
they will look at the localization properties of a random system acted on by a
time-dependent periodic potential. The research will rely heavily on the use of
numerical simulations as well as analytic techniques with both sides
contributing their expertise in these areas. Through its potential to increase
our understanding of the physics of transport in ultranarrow wires, the proposed
work could lead to the development of new types of quantum effect electronic
devices.
