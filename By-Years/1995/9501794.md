The main research goals of this project are to study new analytical techniques
for elucidating the internal structure of complexity classes. These techniques
adapt the theories of Lebesgue measure and Baire category to computational
complexity. They provide quantitative methods to differentiate `typical` from
`exceptional` properties of languages in a particular class, shedding light on
the relationships between the structure and intrinsic difficulty of
computational problems. These concepts are also closely related to the study of
pseudorandom and `pseudo-generic` sequences. Improvements to some of these
analytic techniques are explored, and new types of complexity-theoretic Baire
category and their applications are investigated. The Educational Component of
this CAREER Grant includes the goals of: (a) Establishing theoretical computer
science as an integral part of the undergraduate curriculum at the University of
Southern Maine, expanding the theory offerings and more closely tying theory
with applications and with other subjects; (b) Implementing innovative ways to
attract nonmajors to the computer science department, especially those who are
interested in computer science, but may not be ready for a traditional first
programming course. The routes to these goals run through teaching, advising,
mentoring, and curriculum development. (This educational component is part of
the Research at Undergraduate Institutions Program.)
