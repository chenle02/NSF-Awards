The project will attempt to develop techniques for indexing and retrieving
motion data. The PIs have already developed a substantial library of motion
data. Motion databases are being used in the film and entertainment industry.
However efficient access to such data is still a major challenge. The indexing
algorithms to be developed will enable efficient access to the data. The
retrieval algorithms will enable the retrieval of motion data. The project will
also develop clustering techniques so that similar motions may be grouped
together for efficient retrieval.

The proposal has strong intellectual merit and will make contributions to
advancing the state-of-the-art in motion databases. While the main application
area at present is the entertainment and film industry, the results of the
project may be applied to defense, intelligence and transportation applications.
One can expect this project to have broader impact in homeland security
applications.
