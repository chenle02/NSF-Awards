In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Prof. Anne B. Myers of the University of Rochester will investigate the dynamics
of electronic states and electronic coherences of small molecules in the
condensed phase. Specifically, electronic dephasing and solvation are to be
studied using ground-state resonance Raman spectroscopy and three-pulse photon
echo measurements. The systems to be studied include carbon disulfide in a
variety of polar and non-polar liquid solvents, the triatomic iodine ion in
polar solvents, and azulene in glassy polymers. From the electronic absorption
spectra, Raman excitation profiles, and the absolute Raman quantum yields as a
function of the excitation frequency broadening processes that are fast and slow
on the Raman time scale will be deduced. The three-pulse photon echo experiment
provides similar information for comparison to the Raman results. These
investigations will provide insight to the processes that are responsible for
the broadening of electronic absorptions in condensed media and to processes
that affect chemical reaction rates in condensed phases. Efforts to develop
practical optical memories based on persistent spectral hole burning in solids
will be aided by a better understanding brought about by these researches.
