This project focuses on the balance between riverine and submarine groundwater
discharge in Southeast Asian coastal zone areas dominated by large rivers. Using
geochemical tracers (radon and radium isotopes), the researchers will study both
groundwater and river-derived fluxes in two river-dominated systems in which
they have established strong international partnerships: (a) The Yellow River-
Bohai Sea and (b) the Chao Phraya-Gulf of Thailand. Parallel biogeochemical
studies to be performed by international collaborators will permit direct
comparisons of the river- and groundwater-derived inputs of biologically
relevant chemical species to the coastal zone. The project will contribute to
human resource development in developing countries and the U.S. and will have
important implications for coastal zone water resource management in highly
populated areas.
