This award describes a program of research aimed at applying single-molecule
spectroscopy to problems in tbe dynamics and rheology of polymer melts. This
will be accomplished through a collaboration of three research groups: Waymouth
(synthesis), Moerner (single-molecule spectroscopy), and Fuller (rheology). The
outcome of this research will provide direct measurements of orientation and
translation of single monomer units attached to polymer chains at strategic
locations. Liner chains, tagged with fluorophores at the ends or at the center,
will be studied. Star and H-shaped chains will also be considered to understand
the consequences of long chain branching. These branched architectures will
either be tagged an the ends or arms, or at the branched
points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dynamics of quiescent melts, or of melts
subjected to either simple shear flow or extensional flow will be measured.
These data will offer the first direct measurements of orientation dynamics and
translation of individual polymer segments. The ability to track orientation and
translational fluctuations of entangled segments is important to understanding
the process of tube renewal and constraint release.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
high level of multidisciplinary integration and collaboration in this project
will provide a valuable and stimulating educational environment for graduate
students. In addition, this research program will provide new information about
the fundamental behavior of entangled polymer melts, which will be useful in the
broader contexts of melt flow processing and extrusion.&lt;br/&gt;
