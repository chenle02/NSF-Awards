Image Processing and laboratory research equipment will be provided for
researchers at Johns Hopkins University for research in the Department of
Electrical & Computer Engineering. This equipment is provided under the
Instrumentation Grants for Research in Computer and Information Science and
Engineering program. The research for which the equipment is to be used will be
in the areas of: (1) Modeling Problems in Nonstationary Image Processing and
Analysis (2) Stochastic Inversion of Multidimensional Acoustic Media (3) Imaging
of Local Cerebral Metabolic Rate (4) Image Processing (5) Efficient Image
Reconstruction Using Alternating Projections
