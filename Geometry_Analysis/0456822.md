Conference on Complex Analysis, Differential Geometry, and Partial Differential
Equations



This is a week-long conference on the many aspects of complex analysis,
differential geometry, and partial differential equations centered around the
theme of canonical metrics in geometry. Of particular importance are recent
developments such as multiplier ideal sheaves, Bergman kernels and asymptotic
stability in geometric invariant theory, Hamiltonian dynamics and complex Monge-
Ampere equations, geometric heat flows, and energy functionals.

Canonical metrics involve typically a non-linear system of partial differential
equations, where the unknown is a tensor. They arise from geometry and topology,
but they are also closely to basic equations from theoretical physics such as
Yang-Mills equations and Einstein's equations in general relativity. They are
usually very difficult to solve, but there has been recently an influx of new
ideas from many different directions. This conference will help cross-
fertilization of ideas between the leading experts, and introduce a new
generation of young students and postdoctoral researchers to problems and
methods in the area.
