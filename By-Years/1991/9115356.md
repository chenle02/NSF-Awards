This proposal examines three ternary aluminum alloys and one quartenary
aluminum alloy system. Thermodynamic modeling and phase diagram calculations are
coupled to solidification modeling to determine paths of solidification. Alloys
of interest to the study are aluminum-rich alloys of Al-Mg-Cu, Al-Mg-Zn, Al-Zn-
Cu, and Al- Mg-Zn-Cu. The approach combines thermodynamic modeling and
experimental measurements of phase equilibria. A modified Schiel model is
employed that accounts for back diffusion in determining the solidification
path. Results from directional solidification experiments are compared with the
calculations to improve the models. %%% A knowledge of the thermodynamics and
phase equilibria of multi- component alloys is vital to the development of new
alloys. This research expands basic understanding in this field for model
aluminum alloys systems that also have commercial significance.
