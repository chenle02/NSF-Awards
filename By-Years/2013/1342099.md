University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Modeling and Theory Driven Design of Soft
Materials&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Part: In an effort to advance cross-
disciplinary, cross-continent, and cross-scale interactions among computational,
theoretical and experimental researchers involved in soft materials, the PIs are
organizing the symposium ?Modeling and Theory Driven Design of Soft Materials?
that will be held as part of the 2013 Fall Meeting of the Materials Research
Society in Boston MA. The symposium will include eight half-day oral sessions
and one poster session and will provide a forum for fostering scientific
exchanges on the latest developments on the design of soft materials resulting
from the integration of simulation, theory and experimental approaches. The aim
of this symposium is to bring together researchers from academia, industry, and
federal laboratories who are harnessing the interplay between simulation,
theory, and experiments to explore and validate the design of synthetic and
organic soft materials. The program will enable the dissemination of state-of-
the-art developments in the field and serve to educate the next generation of
young researchers while broadening the participation of underrepresented
categories in materials research. The MRS meetings provide a broad forum for
dissemination of scientific results and exchanges between material scientists
from different disciplines working on diverse topics. A distinguished group of
invited speakers has been confirmed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Part:
The symposium is well aligned with the Materials Genome Initiative and will
stimulate the use of computational and theoretical methods in the design of new
soft materials. The organizers of this symposium are strongly committed to
involving the participation of women and underrepresented minorities. The
organizers will encourage the participation by prioritizing the travel and
registration support for such groups of researchers. Similarly, attention will
be given to participation of researchers and students from undergraduate
institutions. The symposium organizers and the invited speakers include both
women and members of ethnic minorities; there are two women among the co-
organizers and four women among the invited speakers with two speakers from
underrepresented minorities.
