In Phase II operation, the Water and Environmental Technology (WET) I/UCRC
intends to minimize any adverse effects of emerging contaminants (EC) on human
health and/or the environment. The research challenges in this area include the
need for more scientific information about levels, fate, transport, ecological
and health impacts of ECs in the environment, the need for improved detection
and monitoring capabilities, and for new cost-effective treatment technologies
and optimization of existing operations at both water and wastewater treatment
plants. Center engineers and environmental scientists utilizing microbial,
chemical, and mathematic approaches will work collaboratively in coordination
with center industry representatives to perform this research. WET's industrial,
need-focused research program aims to enhance scientific understanding and help
address potentially significant health and environmental problems.

BROADER IMPACT The challenges addressed and potential benefits derived from the
work of the Water and Environmental Technology (WET) I/UCRC impact several
industries including: the Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products Industries;
the Oil and Natural Gas Industry; Pesticide and other Chemicals Industry;
entities that treat wastewater and drinking water; and companies that create and
service technologies for the removal of contaminants from water. Students and
faculty will experience state of the art research projects of value to both
industry and the community. Many member companies have overseas installations,
and students will be exposed to regulatory, technological, social and cultural
aspects of different countries, enhancing their global experiences. In addition,
every effort will be made to engage and involve minority students, as well as
students and teachers from local K-12 schools, in part through existing programs
at the center's institutions. The Center will further enhance the ongoing
efforts at the three institutions of integrating research into classroom
teaching.
