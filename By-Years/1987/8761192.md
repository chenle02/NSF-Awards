The canonical variate analysis (CVA) method of system identification will be
evaluated for identification and adaptive control of industrial processes.
Currently available algorithms for system identification and adaptive control
are not completely reliable for automatic implementation on microcomputers in
real time. In the CVA approach, the algorithms are computationally stable and
numerically accurate and can be implemented on inexpensive micro-computers. The
CVA method automatically determines the dynamical state order and structure of
the process. The proposed Phase I research is to show the feasibility of the CVA
method on industrial processes that are difficult to identify, and to extended
CVA to the identification of nonlinear and time varying systems. The computer
simulation software and experimental process facilities of the University of
California at Santa Barbara will be used for evaluation of feasibility.
