This grant provides funding for travel support for young participants attending
the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) Symposium
on Shape Memory Alloys, being held in Austin, Texas, from April 28 through May
2, 2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Symposium will bring together scientists from
very diverse backgrounds who work on different aspects of foam mechanics in
order to present their work to researchers with whom they do not usually
interact. The intellectual growth that results from the interactions and cross-
fertilization of ideas and approaches that take place at the symposium should be
a lasting experience to all attendees. The symposium will include graduate
students, post-docs and young researchers who will benefit by their interaction
with the best researchers in the mechanics of shape memory alloys in the world.
The lectures will be video taped and be available for viewing by anyone at a
dedicated website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
