This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Paul Cox, Brigham
Young University and Dr. Lars Bohlin, University of Uppsala, Sweden. The
principal objective of the joint work is to perform a comprehensive
pharmacological screen of the medicinal plants of Samoa. The Polynesians have
significantly exploited their island plants for the development of an indigenous
system of ethnopharmacology. In this joint project, the U.S. team headed by Dr.
Cox will be responsible for interviewing Samoan healers, recording their plant
lore, collecting and identifying all medicinal plants used by them, and for the
preparation of crude extracts. The Swedish team headed by Bohlin will examine
the extracts for pharmacological activity using both in vivo and in __ ____ __
vitro general and specific screens. Crude extracts showing _____ pharmacological
activity will be fractionated, and specific fractions responsible for the
activity will be isolated. The Swedish team will also prepare extracts for
future structural determination. This international and interdisciplinary
collaboration should provide a model for future ethnopharmacological
investigations and may potentially result in the discovery of new compounds with
novel pharmacological activity.
