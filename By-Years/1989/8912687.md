The International Conference for Global and Regional Environmental Atmospheric
Chemistry will be held May 3-10, 1989 in Beijing, China. Topics include
biogeochemical cycles, homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical transformations,
photochemical oxidants, and acidic deposition. An understanding of these topics
is imperative for coping with international issues such as global warning,
stratospheric ozone depletion, and acid rain. Furthermore, China, with a quarter
of the world's population, is emerging industrially and will become an even more
important influence to the global atmosphere. Therefore, convening the
conference in China is an effective means of establishing interactions of
American scientists with the Chinese environmental scientific community. This
award, in particular, enables the participation of several young American
scientists (graduate students and recent Ph.D's) at this conference.
