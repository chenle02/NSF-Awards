The objective of the program is to provide a professional level research
experience for eight undergraduate mathematics students. The program provides a
unique research community-of-peers setting that emphasizes developing the
independence of each student. At Duluth the approach is to treat undergraduate
students with extraordinarily high potential for doing significant research as
though they are working on a PhD thesis problem where the adviser provides the
problem and mentoring but avoids direct involvement in solving the problem. The
PI is assisted by three graduate students and many visitors who are program
alumni.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants work on open problems and conjectures
from the recent literature. Topics include pattern-avoiding permutations,
combinatorial problems involving words, and problems in combinatorial number
theory. Students gain experience in reading research articles, finding
insightful examples, asking probing questions, recognizing subtle patterns,
writing frequent reports, giving weekly presentations, posing problems and
making conjectures, using computational software, working with peers, dealing
with setbacks and frustration, and becoming familiar with the publication
process. Participants will be integrated in the mathematical research community
by giving presentations of their results at meetings and
conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
