Long & Medium-Term Research: The Exclusion Principle Derived from
Nonrelativistic Quantum Mechanics This award is under the Long and Medium-Term
Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence Program, which enables U.S. scientists
and engineers to conduct three to twelve months of research abroad at research
centers of proven excellence. The program's awards provide opportunities for
joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions abroad. This award will support a twelve-month
postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Jonathan M. Robbins to work with Dr. Michael
V. Berry at the HH Wills Physics Laboratory in Bristol, England. Their research
concerns the Pauli exclusion principle. Currently regarded as an independent
postulate in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, or else as a consequence of
quantum field theory, their aim is to investigate possible connections between
the exclusion principle and the geometric (or Berry) phase, and to see whether
it can in fact be derived from the dynamics of the Schrodinger equation. The
award recommendation provides funds to cover a stipend for twelve months.
