Professor Boshier will make precision measurements of the spectrum of the
hydrogen atom using high resolution Doppler-free two-photon spectroscopy. These
measurements will be among the most accurate determinations of the ground state
Lamb shift in hydrogen which, in turn, will be an extremely rigorous test of
quantum electrodynamics (QED). A second experiment comparing two transitions in
the optical spectrum of the He+ ion will be even more sensitive tests of the
theory, which will be limited by uncertainty in the size of the proton radius.
