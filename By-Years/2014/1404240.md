A complete understanding of the history of our universe is not possible without
addressing the problems of singularities in classical gravity. Singularities,
such as the big bang, are the boundaries of classical space and time where the
classical physics stops. These singularities signal that the underlying theory,
in this case Einstein's theory of General Relativity, has reached its limit of
validity. Answers to fundamental questions such as the birth of the universe
thus cannot be obtained using general relativity which is based on the classical
notion of space and time. It is expected that a quantum theory of gravity would
reveal new physics which provides important clues on the resolution of
singularities. In this research, loop quantum gravity is used to explore the
fate of singularities in different spacetimes, including cosmological and black
hole spacetimes. Lessons from these investigations will be important to
understand the quantum nature of spacetime, the physics of the very early
universe and the final stages of the gravitational collapse.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research carried out in this project deals with
analytical, phenomenological and numerical investigations of isotropic,
anisotropic, black hole and inhomogeneous spacetimes to understand singularity
resolution using techniques of loop quantum gravity. By a systematic study of
quantization of these spacetimes and its relation with the effective
descriptions, precise physics at the Planck scale will be extracted and
phenomenological implications will be explored. This research also aims to
address fundamental issues pertaining to the quantum probabilities for events,
such as the quantum bounce, in a quantum universe. These investigations are
expected to give valuable insights on the generic resolution of singularities in
quantum gravity.
