Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to enable a new paradigm
of spectral filter array (SFA) based image sensors in the visible wavelength
range. This multispectral imaging problem is formulated as the task
of&lt;br/&gt;making finite spatial-spectral measurements on a hyperspectral
image signal with minimal risks for aliasing. The proposed SFA design exploits
the periodic response of multilayer dielectric interference&lt;br/&gt;filters
that has a natural interpretation in the Fourier sampling theories, giving
direct correspondences between the refractive index contrasts, layer thicknesses
and the fidelity of the captured
spectral&lt;br/&gt;image.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit is the understanding of how the spectral filters in image
sensors affect the spatial spectral fidelity of the multispectral images
acquired by SFA based sensors. The proposed joint&lt;br/&gt;processing-hardware
solution is capable of capturing considerably sharper image than other SFA-based
sensors considered to date, since extra spectral samples are measured with
minimal sacrifices to spatial&lt;br/&gt;resolution. The expected outcomes of the
research include multilayer thin film filters with optimal spectral response, a
high fidelity SFA sensor, and an advanced post-capture processing
algorithm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact is
the development of SFA based multispectral sensor for applications that require
portable or simple, inexpensive solutions. The fidelity of spectral images
directly affects food and&lt;br/&gt;water safety, remote sensing, geology,
surveillance, biomedical imaging, environment monitoring, forensics, and
mineralogy. The proposed educational and outreach program leverages various
outlets to&lt;br/&gt;target local industries, a large graduate population
comprised of practitioners of sensor exploitation, and tutorial sessions at high
impact conferences.
