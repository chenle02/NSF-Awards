&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This GK-12 project supports fellows at the University of
Colorado, from the departments of Astrophysics, Environmental Biology, and
Chemistry, for educational activities with 6th-8th graders and 9th-10th graders
in the Boulder Valley school districts, targeting especially Hispanic
populations. Nine graduate students and five advanced undergraduates are
supported per year. The themes are adaptation, implementation and enrichment of
Full Option Science System (FOSS) modules, a modular approach to teaching
elementary school science. The microscopic-macroscopic connection in science
(biology and chemistry) is emphasized. Partners include the Sombrero Marsh
Nature Center, the Cooperative Institute for Environmental Science, Thorn
Ecological Institute and the City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks. The
intellectual merit is evidenced by the unifying focus on environmental issues.
Broader impacts are reflected in the nature of the schools, as many include
students in groups currently underrepresented in science. This project is
partially supported by funds from the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Title: Partners in Science Education:
