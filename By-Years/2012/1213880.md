Based on the funding from Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism Program
(CSDM) program, Prof. Sivaguru Jayaraman's group at the Department of Chemistry
and Biochemistry, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND will carry out
studies pertaining to light induced enantiospecific chiral transfer in solution.
Synthesizing chiral compounds with high stereoselectivity during light induced
transformations provides an opportunity to develop sustainable strategies with
minimal impact on the environment. As part of the investigation the PI will
pursue new strategies for stereocontrol in photoreactions to gain a fundamental
understanding of interaction of light with matter coupled with an intricate
control over molecular reactivity, dynamics and non-bonding interactions to
enhance stereoselectivity in the photoproducts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
development plan seamlessly integrates scientific research, educational
training, and public outreach. Students involved in the proposed investigations
will learn both traditional techniques to characterize and evaluate asymmetric
induction during enantiospecific phototransformations and modern spectroscopic
methods and characterization techniques to assess excited state reactivity. The
PI plans to engage local high school students through the PICNICS (Parents
Involvement with Children, Nurturing Intellectual Curiosity in Science) outreach
program that he has developed at North Dakota. The aim of the outreach program
is to provide a cutting edge research environment to high school students there
by encouraging them to look up to science and math as career paths.
