This workshop consists of two ten-day sessions for about 16 participants. It
will introduce teachers of undergraduate electrical engineering laboratories to
the computerized workstation concept. Using current technology in
instrumentation, hardware and software, the workshop will explore the full range
of capabilities that are now available for academic laboratories at reasonable
cost. A strong emphasis will be put on creativity in designing laboratories, and
on encouraging the participants to be creative in turn. To achieve these
objectives, the workshop will provide a balanced mix of theory, discussion and
design in a laboratory environment. The laboratory facilities will be available
around the clock. A maximum amount of sharing among the participants will be
encouraged through open discussion periods, and a commitment to integrate new
ideas into the curriculum of the home institution is expected. In addition to
the NSF funds, participants' institutions will contribute about 15% in travel
costs toward the cost of the project.
