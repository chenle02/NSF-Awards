The Computing Community Consortium (CCC) is established through a Cooperative
Agreement between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Computing
Research Association (CRA). Since its inception, the purpose of the CCC has been
to catalyze the development of bold, far-reaching visions for computing
research, and to facilitate the communication of those research visions to
stakeholders both within and beyond the computing research ecosystem. The CCC
fosters proactive engagement with both computing and non-computing research
stakeholders -- agencies, industry, professional societies, consortia, and
philanthropic stakeholders -- to ensure that it continues to expand its network
and impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CCC provides the continuity and capacity to
bring together stakeholders that depend on computing innovation as part of
increasingly diverse and multi-disciplinary national and societal needs. The CCC
plays a vital and effective role in catalyzing the computing research community
to articulate far reaching and strategic research visions that will continue to
shape the field for decades to come. The majority of CCC visioning activities
and white papers bring together multidisciplinary expertise and needs that
combine to create important disciplinary and interdisciplinary challenges for
the computing field. The results of these activities are disseminated back to
the community to ensure continued revitalization and advancement of new areas
and topics for future computing research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
