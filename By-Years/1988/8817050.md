Although Raman spectroscopy long has been recognized in material science and
solid state physics as a powerful tool for the study of carbonaceous materials
(CM), it has barely been used to study "graphite" in samples of geological
interest. The overall goal is to evaluate the usefulness of laser Raman
microprobe (LRM) spectroscopy to characterize naturally occuring CM. For the
purpose of LRM analysis, several suites of progressively metamorphosed CM have
been obtained, most of which already have undergone other analyses, such as by
X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The
intention is to develop a routine LRM methodogy 1) to provide relatively rapid
evaluation of the degree of crystallinity of "graphite" and its compositional
deviations from pure carbon and 2) to be as quantitative as possible in
characterizing the kind of carbon. The results will be important in
understanding the history of carbon-bearing rock.
