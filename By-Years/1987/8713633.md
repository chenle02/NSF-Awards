The research will demonstrate how the regular inclusion of randomized
experiments in sample surveys can aid in the analysis and interpretation of
survey data. Some experiments will draw on formal methodological issues, such as
the difference between open and closed questions, while others will vary the
content of questions in order to explore these issues in a particular
substantive area. Still a third set of experiments will deal with the effects of
different forms of questioning in the case of topics likely to elicit
controversy. Throughout, the aim will be to test the ease and efficacy with
which experimental and survey methods can be merged, and the usefulness of the
resultant combination in substantive analysis.
