A multidisciplinary Graphics Workstation Laboratory for students in Geology,
Chemistry, Physics, Biology and Astronomy is being developed. It consists of a
central fileserver and 20 high resolution color graphics workstations. Major and
non- major science students utilize computer technology for individual study,
supervised research projects and laboratory work. The laboratory supports the
integration of faculty and student and enhances interactive learning. The
equipment will affect 27 courses and provides the direction for further
curricular development.
