Researchers are in the first phase of a study to analyze the impact of three
different curricular approaches to the learning of algebra. The three approaches
are represented by: 1) instructional materials developed with NSF support (The
Interactive Mathematics Program and Contemporary Mathematics in Context, also
known as Core Plus Mathematics); 2) "hybrid" curricula (University of Chicago
School Mathematics Project and the Discovering Mathematics Series by Key
Curriculum Press); and 3) traditional texts (those published by Glencoe,
McDougal Littell, and Pearson Prentice Hall). The primary criterion for
selecting these curricula is the level of market penetration. This first phase
of the study analyzes the three approaches in order to develop comparative maps
that highlight the algebra content and cognitive demands across the curricula
being studied. This project is developing reliable and valid instruments to
assess student learning, which, will be used to examine and compare student
understanding of algebra in the later phases of the study.
