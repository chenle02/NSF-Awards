9725910 McIntosh This award is for support for a project to establish a detailed
record of volcanism at Mt. Takahe volcano in Marie Byrd Land that will provide
absolute age and elevation data on inland paleo-ice levels on the West Antarctic
ice sheet (WAIS) during the most recent glacial cycle. Previous work at Mt.
Takahe documented volcanic deposits located on the lower flanks that were
erupted beneath, at, or above the level of the WAIS. These deposits have been
dated to between 104,000 and 7,000 years before present and suggest that the
inland WAIS was much higher during the last glacial cycle than it is today. The
inland paleo-ice level can be used to test conflicting hypotheses about the
configuration of the WAIS in late Wisconsin time and the role of WAIS retreat in
global sea level rise. Well constrained limits on inland paleo-ice-levels during
the past 100,000 years can be compared with global records of climate change in
order to assess the relationship between the WAIS and the climate system.
Finally, precisely dated paleo-ice- levels can be used as "hard" input data for
numerical models of ice sheet dynamics.
