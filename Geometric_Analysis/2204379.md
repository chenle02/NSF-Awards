The project explores algebraic aspects of chaotic dynamical systems, namely
systems with hyperbolic behavior. This is a classical type of system, which has
its historical roots in the study of the famous three-body problem of physics.
Even after decades of investigations, many basic questions about such systems
remain open. For example, it is not known which of these systems have a rigidly
algebraic description (can be constructed from groups). The project aims at
studying the connections of hyperbolic dynamical systems with group theory, the
theory of automata, and other branches of algebra. Conversely, the project plans
to use the insights gained from the study of hyperbolic systems to solve open
questions in group theory. The project also includes training and advising of
students, organization of an annual high school mathematics competition, and the
completion of a graduate textbook on groups and topological dynamics.

Hyperbolic dynamical systems are classical and well-studied examples of chaotic
dynamics. However, several basic open questions remain open. One such question
is whether every hyperbolic homeomorphism of a locally connected compact space
comes from a nilpotent Lie group. The question is probably very hard, but the
project outlines several directions toward clarifying group-theoretic aspects.
The project aims to study automatic structures associated with hyperbolic
systems and groups generated by such automatic structures. These groups may have
interesting applications to the theory of the growth of groups and amenability.
The project's plans also include the study of the relation between group theory
(contraction coefficients of virtual endomorphisms) and the conformal dimension
of hyperbolic dynamical systems, which can have interesting applications of
group theory to rigidity results in dynamics and to asymptotic group theory.
