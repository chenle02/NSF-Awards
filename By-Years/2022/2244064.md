This award will support the renewal of a 10-week research experience program for
ten undergraduate students each year at Cornell University. The student interns
will be involved in research projects which include current and future planetary
missions, exoplanets, time domain radio astronomy, gravitational waves, star
formation across cosmic time, and astronomical instrumentation, all under the
direct guidance of a cohort of dedicated mentors. The students will also
participate in personal and professional development programs that encompass
(e.g.) psychosocial support, hands-on computational tutorials, career path
options in STEM, research and communication skills, and scientific writing, as
well as half-day workshops on various cutting- edge topics in astronomy. The REU
student experience will also feature local field trips, including one to a
fossil rich stone quarry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to providing an
immersive scientific research experience, the program also emphasizes
inclusivity by actively working to increase the participation of under-
represented minorities and women, as well as non-standard students (e.g., single
parents with young children, veterans, and 1st generation college students) in
astronomy and related STEM fields. Their continued success in these efforts is a
highlight of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
