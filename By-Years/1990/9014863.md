This project will (1) complete the implementation of the existing design for an
experimental expert retrieval assistance system in the workstation environment;
(2) test the effectiveness of the system through experimentation and analysis;
and (3) depending on the results of the analysis, devise more refined and
comprehensive search models and assistance techniques. The techniques used
incorporate such functionality as (1) estimating absolute and relative search
relevance based on several spectra of matching criteria; (2) automatic ranking
of documents by relevance using existing tools from current Boolean-based
systems; and (3) optimization of search strategies based on user relevance
feedback. These new techniques will be integrated with a collection of
assistance aides in the current system including (1) automatic execution of
search strategies in different databases including translation from a common
command language; (2) search strategies derived automatically from user's
natural language phrases; and (3) recall estimation based on both formal search
features and empirical search results. These models and techniques, termed
"smart Boolean", will advance information retrieval from an intuitive art toward
a rational quantified decision-making process.
