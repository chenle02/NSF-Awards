Uranium-series isotopes have provided unique insight into geochemical rates and
processes during genesis of basaltic magma from the earth's mantle.
Specifically, recent measurements of the longer-lived isotopes of the U-decay
series have placed important constraints on melting rates (related to solid
mantle upwelling rates) and melt fractions. However, there have been relatively
few measurements of the shorter-lived isotopes of the U decay series in basaltic
samples. As a result, time-dependant parameters such as melt transport rates and
magma storage times are not well known. To better constrain these parameters,
under this SGER award, the PIs propose to measure short-lived 227Ac (t1/2 =21.8
y) in young basaltic samples from mid-ocean spreading centers and intraplate
volcanoes like Hawaii. This geochronologic system has the potential to be an
important chronometer for dating of young mid-ocean ridge basalts in the time
range of 10-100 years. Development of a new counting technique for 227Ac has
simplified its analysis making this research possible for the first time.
