This grant is to support a Presidential Young Investigator. The research will be
in the area of turbulence modeling through numerical simulations, in the
elucidation of coherent structures in turbulent flows, and in the application of
dynamical systems theory to turbulence. These phenomena occur in the flow of
fluids past boundaries, in which the mechanism of turbulent drag is now believed
to be controlled by coherent structures and their dynamic generation and
interaction.
