ABSTRACT DMS - 0204651. PI: David Auckly

This project is centered around a list of problems on the border of topology,
geometry and analysis. The least speculative problem is part of a collaboration
with V. Kapovitch to prove that there are compact topological 4-manifolds that
do not admit Alexandrov metrics. The result should follow by a suitable
modification of previous work of S. Donaldson and D. Sullivan. The most
speculative problem in the list is to study the interaction between Gromov-
Witten invariants and finite type invariants.

Many different ideas are used in geometric analysis, and developments in this
field will effect a broad range of other disciplines. For example symplectic
geometry and gauge theory were developed to describe mechanics and
electrodynamics. These ideas were developed into subtle invariants of smooth
manifolds defined via the solution to systems of partial differential equations.
Various gluing formulae developed to compute these invariants resulted in
relationships with other invariants that arise from a combinatorial point of
view. Properties of the combinatorial invariants lead to conjectures about the
smooth invariants, and vice versa. It is exactly this interplay that makes
geometric analysis such an important field.
