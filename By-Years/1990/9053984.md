This project is building on the success of Gallaudet University's involvement
in problem solving education by beginning a national initiative to improve
problem solving skills of high school and college deaf students. An Advisory
Panel to plan a National Initiative to Improve Problem Solving Skills of Deaf
Students has been formed. The Advisory Panel includes representatives, some of
whom are deaf, from various disciplines. These disciplines include deductive
reasoning, inductive reasoning, non-traditional thinking, the use of symbolism
in reasoning, hand-on scientific museums, invention, teaching problem solving
techniques to deaf students, as well as deaf education. The panel met for two
days to accomplish the following: a written statement delineating the scope of
"problem solving" as it pertains to this effort; an outline of a practical plan
to improve problem solving skills of deaf students nationally; identification of
mechanisms for implementation; identification of personnel and organizational
resources; and a comparison of the similarities and differences of the approach
to what would be possible for the non- dear population to determine whether a
parallel effort should be made for hearing students. It is expected that the
analysis of deaf students' problem solving skills will provide insight into
those aspects of general problem solving skills related to visualization -- and
this should be of value to the general student population.
