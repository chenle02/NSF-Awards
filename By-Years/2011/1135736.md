The last few years have seen a revolution in DNA sequencing instrumentation and
technology. In that short time period sequencing instrument capabilities have
increased more than 1000 fold and are likely to continue to increase about
5-fold each year for the next several years. As such it is now affordable and
efficient to sequence to high coverage large plant genomes that had previously
been prohibitively too expensive and complex to attempt. However, analysis
methods have not improved nearly as much during the same time period and a
variety of technical limitations of these new DNA sequencing instruments make it
even more difficult to carry out whole genome sequencing of novel genomes (de
novo sequencing). These limitations also make it more difficult to use the new
instruments to carry out older clone based strategies for de novo sequencing,
such as BAC-by-BAC approaches. The purpose of this meeting to be held at Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory May 18-20, 2011 are to assess the current state of next
generation sequencing in terms of de novo, whole genome plant sequencing, what
can be expected to develop in the near future, and then determine which advances
are needed to allow these exciting technologies to be used to carry out de novo
sequencing of entire complex plant genomes. The meeting will bring together
stakeholders with broad range of expertise in high-throughput sequencing and
genomics, plant biology, bioinformatics and databases drawn from the academic,
private and international sectors. Meeting outcomes will be captured in the form
of a report to be developed by participants that will be submitted for
publication to Genome Research.
