A conference on the Applications of Geometry to Topology and Physics will be
held November 7-9, 2008 at Rutgers-Newark University. Speakers including Thomas
Banchoff, Robert Connelly, Dennis DeTurck, David Gabai, Weiqing Gu, Blaine
Lawson, David Singer, Dennis Sullivan, and Gang Tian will gather to address two
topics in the application of geometry to other fields. The first topic is
calibrated geometry and its applications to physics, including calibrated cycles
and mirror symmetry, calibrated geometry and gauge theory, and moduli spaces of
calibrated cycles. The second topic is the application of geometry to knot
theory, including the study of geometric functionals and flows on knots such as
Freedman's Mobius energy and Nabutovsky's ropelength.

A conference on the Applications of Geometry to Topology and Physics will be
held November 7-9, 2008 at Rutgers-Newark University. This conference will bring
together mathematicians working in geometry to address two applications of the
subject. The first is calibrated geometry, a structure which is often utilized
in solving optimization problems in geometry, and which has numerous physical
applications. First studied in the 1930's, calibrated geometry has garnered
renewed interest in the past decade for its connection to topics in modern
physics, such as mirror symmetry. The second conference topic is the application
of geometry to the mathematical study of knots, which provides a deep
understanding of three-dimensional objects and their topology. Geometric ideas
in knot theory have enabled applications to fluid dynamics and plasma physics.
Our second topic seeks to connect these advances in knot theory with other more
traditional applications of geometry in topology in order to foster an exchange
of ideas and techniques with the broader geometry community.
