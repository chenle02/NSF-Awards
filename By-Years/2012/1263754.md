This grant supports the fieldwork and research for a project to document Nama,
an endangered language spoken in Western Province, Papua New Guinea, one of the
most linguistically diverse countries in the world where language documentation
is critically needed. Spoken by around 1,200 people, Nama belongs to the
Morehead-Upper Maro family, which is a poorly understood and undocumented
minority Papuan language group.

Nama is interesting because it exhibits a set of morphosyntactic properties
which are unattested in the Trans-New Guinea (TNG) family, the largest and
heretofore most extensively documented Papuan family. Furthermore, Nama uses an
extremely rare senary numeral system with the base 6, which is assumed to have
cultural underpinnings. The documentation of Nama will be an important step
toward providing a more fine-grained characterization of Papuan languages and
developing a more comprehensive account of linguistic variation in the New
Guinea region. It will also establish significant ties between outside
researchers and the Nama community and will validate the importance of Nama
among the local population.

This project will produce an extensive and multifaceted description of Nama: a
comprehensive reference grammar detailing syntactic, morphological, and
phonological properties of Nama; a Nama-English lexical database which will lay
the foundation for the future compilation of a bilingual dictionary; a publicly
accessible online corpus of annotated audio recordings of native speakers
(containing, for example, short stories, conversations, narratives, elicited
utterances); an archive of textual and paradigmatic materials; and, research
papers analyzing morphosyntactic properties of theoretical significance. This
project will also contribute to the scientific training of a promising scholar.
