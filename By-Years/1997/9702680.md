9702680 Hallgren This award provides travel support for graduate students, post-
docs, and invited speakers for their attendance at a workshop on time series and
their applications to the atmospheric sciences. The workshop will be held in
conjunction with the annual meeting of the American Meteorological Society in
Long Beach, CA in February 1997. The workshop is designed to bring statisticians
and atmospheric scientists together to consider problems of mutual interest. The
broader goal is to promote stronger interaction and collaboration and exchange
of information on new methodologies between scientists in the two disciplines.
Support for this award is shared by the Statistics and Probability Program in
the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Climate Dynamics and Large-scale
Dynamic Meteorology Program in the Division of Atmospheric Sciences.
