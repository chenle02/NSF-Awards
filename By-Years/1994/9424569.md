9424569 Busch-Vishniac This project will use a new six degree of freedom sensor
based on lateral effect silicon photo sensitive diode (PSD) technology, to
measure dimensions on manufactured mechanical components. For a high volume
production environment, the innovation is in meeting the technical performance
specifications. Resolutions on the order of 0.01-0.l micrometer over a linear
range of +/- 30 mm and angular resolutions on the order of 0.01 arc-seconds over
a rotation range of +/- 2 degrees are possible, and because these are primarily
analog sensors, the goal is to make 1000 measurements a second so that it is
feasible to use them for feedback process control in high volume production.
This project will address three topics of importance in achieving these
technical goals relevant to manufacturing: an error analysis of the integrated
sensor system, implementation and robustness issues when installed in a
manufacturing environment, and detection of dimensions, as well as position, of
a fabricated part. To test the robustness issues, the investigators will work
with a company to develop and install a prototype system in a pilot
manufacturing environment. Successful completion of this project will provide a
new resolution, high speed, non-contact sensor technology at modest cost. This
enables closed loop control of dimensional or mechanical features in
manufacturing and assembly systems that produce high volume and high quality
products and components.
