The PI proposes to study several questions involving arithmetic aspects
of&lt;br/&gt;maps between algebraic varieties. These questions include new far-
reaching&lt;br/&gt;generalizations of major results about abelian varieties,
including the&lt;br/&gt;Mordell--Lang conjecture (Faltings' theorem) and Merel's
uniform boundedness&lt;br/&gt;theorem for rational torsion on elliptic curves
over a number field. In the&lt;br/&gt;generalizations, the group structure in an
abelian variety is replaced by&lt;br/&gt;objects which exist in any variety. The
PI's study of maps between varieties&lt;br/&gt;will yield results about
dynamical systems, Diophantine equations,&lt;br/&gt;automorphism groups of
curves, and value distribution of meromorphic
functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polynomials whose coefficients are rational
numbers are a fundamental&lt;br/&gt;tool in many aspect of modern life, ranging
from&lt;br/&gt;information security to weather prediction. These basic objects
have been&lt;br/&gt;intensively studied for over two thousand years, but recent
years have seen&lt;br/&gt;the discovery of previously unexpected phenomena. The
proposed research will&lt;br/&gt;examine these fundamental objects from several
perspectives. This will likely&lt;br/&gt;yield immediate consequences in
computer science, in addition to long-term&lt;br/&gt;consequences across many
disciplines. Finally, much of the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;will be carried
out jointly with graduate and undergraduate students, so that&lt;br/&gt;it will
make an educational contribution in addition to its scientific
impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
