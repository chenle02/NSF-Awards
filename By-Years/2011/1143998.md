The traveling salesperson problem (TSP) is a benchmark problem for combinatorial
optimization that asks for a shortest tour that visits all the cities in a given
network. The graph version where the distances arise from an underlying
undirected graph captures a significant portion of the difficulty of designing
good algorithms for solving this problem. This proposal will develop a
consolidated understanding of the new techniques used in recent developments in
the design of improved approximation algorithms for the graph-TSP problem and
suggest new ones to move towards optimal performance guarantees. It will also
examine carefully which of these will apply to the more general metric version
of the problem, as well their relation to the well-known subtour elimination
linear programming relaxation for the problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designing
better heuristic methods for solving prototypically hard optimization problems
can improve our ability to solve larger real-scale instances arising in a
variety of practical applications. This project will develop methods for
improving the mathematically provable quality of the heuristic solutions for the
fundamental traveling salesperson problem. New methods developed by the proposal
will find applications to broader classes of problems in designing fault-
tolerant minimum-distance networks, and also lead to new insights in graph
theory and combinatorial optimization.
