What are the rules to engineer microbiomes to improve health of animals and
plants? What organisms use microbiome engineering to improve their own health?
Do these organisms use specific mechanisms to assemble beneficial microbes into
their microbiomes? Addressing these questions will elucidate general principles
of microbiome engineering, with implications for medicine and agriculture. The
proposed work will synthesize research on one group of organisms that have
practiced microbiome engineering for millions of years, the fungus-growing
insects, specifically fungus-growing ants. Fungus-growing insects are farmers.
They cultivate gardens of fungal food embedded in complex communities of
beneficial microbes that serve nutritive and health functions, but can also
include microbial pathogens. Research during the last three decades vastly
increased genomic, microbial, physiological, and biochemical understanding of
such insect-microbe interactions. There exists therefore now an interest in a
comparative synthesis of these diverse host-microbiome associations and the
underlying rules of microbiome engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
work will generate two syntheses to elucidate general principles of microbiome
assembly and microbiome interactions with the host. The first synthesis will
summarize recent microbial, genomic, and biochemical insights on fungus-growing
insects to (i) generate an integrative understanding of ecological and
evolutionary processes shaping such complex mutualisms; (ii) elucidate
unresolved controversies; (iii) evaluate alternate hypotheses underlying these
controversies; (iv) outline experimental work to test these hypotheses; and thus
(v) identify promising novel research directions. The second synthesis will
summarize the biology of fungus-growing ants occurring in the US to enable
researchers to address the promising research directions that emerge from the
first synthesis. The second synthesis will also integrate 25 years of
unpublished observations and photography by the collaborating investigators on
the fungus-growing ants of the USA. The second synthesis will therefore enable
US researchers to take advantage of their local biodiversity and develop local
study systems. The project will also generate visual media on all species of
fungus-growing ants in the US and disseminate commons-use images to the
public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
