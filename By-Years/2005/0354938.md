The research is directed toward two experimental issues in dusty plasmas. The
first involves the boundary between dust clouds and the background plasma and
the second the kinetics of dusty plasmas (the dust velocity distribution). The
boundary study is important to learning how to manipulate dust clouds, in
addition to the basic plasma physics component. The key diagnostic in the study
is particle image velocimetry (PIV), which has been pioneered by the PI for
study of dust grains motion in plasmas (through the cross-correlation of images
taken at different times.
