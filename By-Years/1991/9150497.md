Leading experts in polymer chemistry and the teaching of general and organic
chemistry will guide this effort to develop instructional packets for the
undergraduate chemistry core curriculum. The project will operate in
coordination with the ACS Division of Polymer Chemistry project in polymer
education (POLYED). Five chemistry faculty will be appointed POLYED-NSF fellows
and will prepare instructional materials involving polymers for introductory
chemistry for non-majors, general chemistry, and organic chemistry courses. The
packets will be for use of chemistry faculty who have little or no experience in
the polymer area.
