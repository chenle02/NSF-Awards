This CAREER proposal is a request for support for the Principal Investigator's
continuing involvement in experimental neutrino physics and describes her plan
to play a role in the intermediate detector of the new J-PARCnu project. Over
the next several years, our knowledge of two-flavor oscillation parameter space
will be refined by several experiments, including Super-K and K2K. Assuming that
a "standard" 3-flavor picture holds, the next steps will be to fully explore the
masses and mixings in a 3-flavor context by determining the value of theta13,
determining the mass hierarchy, and, ultimately, searching for CP violation in
the lepton sector. Knowledge of these parameters is essential for a full
understanding of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. The next
promising step is to search for theta13 via an electron-neutrino appearance in a
muon-neutrino beam. Because theta13, and hence the amplitude for electron-
neutrino appearance, is known to be small, this is a challenging task. The
J-PARCnu project, which involves a new high-intensity muon-neutrino beam
originating at the J-PARC facility and sent to a refurbished Super-K far
detector, will have a sensitivity to theta13 approximately 20 times better than
current limits. "Phase II" of this program aims to determine the mass hierarchy,
and search for leptonic CP violation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal
describes education and outreach activities related to neutrino physics.
Specifically, it proposes to develop and make available a neutrino physics
workshop module for high school teachers.&lt;br/&gt;
