This research will consider mathematical and numerical aspects of models
describing semiconductor transport in novel device structures. Two aspects of
the problems will be considered in tandem. First, increasing miniaturization
results in effects which, while they can still be described by the Basic
Semiconductor Equations (BSE), are intrinsically three- dimensional in nature.
To address this problem, this research will develop and analyze an iterative
algorithm for solution of the nonlinear BSE using a decoupling procedure based
on asymptotic analysis. Secondly, miniaturization leads to physical phenomena,
such as "hot electrons," which are not described by the BSE. This research will
thus also consider the development and use of new model equations. This research
could have a direct impact on the design of semiconductor devices and aid in the
development of advanced technology.
