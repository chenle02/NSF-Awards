The focus of this research is in the development of self-assembling
nanocapsules. This research involving the design of organic compounds that form
defined structures through noncovalent association is important for the
development of new molecules for information storage, catalysis, molecular
transport, sensing, and the assembly of supramolecular structures. The goal of
the research program is to provide a versatile toolbox of molecular capsules for
addressing a variety of problems in drug delivery, phase transfer catalysis,
sensing of biomolecules, and the assembly of supramolecular arrays. The research
uses calixarene scaffolds supporting peptide strands that will assemble through
ionic interactions in polar solvent.

With this new award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Suzanne B. Shuker of the
Department of Chemistry at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. Professor Shuker will focus
her research on the development of nanocapsules that can combine to encapsulate
other molecules. This research will develop new methods for drug transport and
delivery, catalysis, and the binding and detection of biomolecules. Chemistry
students at the graduate, undergraduate and post-doctoral level will be trained.
Professor Shuker's laboratory has a track record of training undergraduate women
who have gone on to graduate school.
