9321626 Oberbauer Global warming will substantially increase the length of the
active season for high latitude ecosystems, but many plant species in these
areas have phenological patterns adapted to short growing seasons. Some, but not
all, of the factors that affect phenological stages will change with global
warming. Those species constrained by cues that will be unchanged with global
warming, such as photoperiod, will be unable to respond to extended season
length. As a result, species composition, productivity, and carbon fluxes from
these ecosystems will change substantially. Using Alaskan tundra as a model
system, this project addresses the questions: 1) What are the constraints on
phenological patterns for the dominant species? 2) What physiological
adjustments will species make in response to an extended period of resource
availability? 3) How will growth of the dominant species, ecosystem
productivity, and ecosystem carbon fluxes change under field-simulated extended
seasons? These questions will be addressed using a combination of controlled-
environment studies and field manipulations of season length. Growth chamber
studies will examine the effects of photoperiod, soil and air temperature, and
leaf age on phenological patterns and carbon gain of selected species of the
dominant growth forms. Field studies will examine the effects of extended active
period on phenology, growth, productivity, and ecosystem carbon balance. Results
from this study will be used to develop a model of phenological patterns of
tundra plants that can be used to evaluate species' responses to extended
growing season. ***
