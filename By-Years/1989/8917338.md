This proposal is to collect tracer and hydrographic data in conjunction with
the deployment and recovery of a suite of current meter moorings in the Pacific
Ocean near New Zealand. The purpose is to measure the influx of deep waters into
the Pacific Basin. Deep water flow in this region has never been measured,
although it is responsible for the principal water masses in the Pacific. The
work is coordinated with proposals by Warren (9002709) and Pillsbury (9002709)
and the New Zealand Oceanographic Institution. It is a component of the World
Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
