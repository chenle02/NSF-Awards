Over the past twenty years at least seventy different chemical compounds have
been detected from interstellar gas. The overwhelming majority of these
molecules have been identified on the basis of their rotational spectra, which
for the most part were measured in the laboratory prior to their observation
with radio telescopes. Successful observation and identification of interstellar
molecules have therefore been accomplished through the symbiotic relationship of
radio astronomy and high resolution molecular spectroscopy in the laboratory.
Dr. Ziurys will use this award to initiate a new research program which will
combine her observational work with a supporting laboratory effort. The
laboratory work will enable her to measure the rotational spectra, and hence
rest frequencies, of potential new interstellar molecules. The species to be
studied are those likely to be associated with high temperatures in interstellar
clouds. These include molecules of silicon, magnesium, iron, aluminum, and
calcium. This award is made under the Research Opportunities for Women Career
Advancement Award program at the NSF.
