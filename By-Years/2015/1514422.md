This research addresses a fundamental problem in systems security: how can a
machine specify a computation to another one and then, without executing the
computation, check that the other machine carried it out correctly? Over the
last several years, a new approach to this problem has emerged, based on
refining cryptographic and theoretical tools, and incorporating them into built
systems. However, despite exciting advances, the resulting systems are still not
practical in the normal sense. This goal of this project is truly practical
performance for certain real-world problems at realistic input sizes. This
research could have wide-ranging impact on third-party computing models such as
cloud computing, distributed systems, untrusted hardware manufacturers, and
defense applications. More broadly, truly inexpensive verifiable computation
will enable new ways of building systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
applies ideas from the programming languages community to represent computation
more efficiently; applies notions of program approximation to produce efficient
partial verifiability; refines and implements protocols that promise reduced
memory utilization; and develops new protocols that reduce overhead and are
better-suited to important classes of computations. The methods include refining
and adapting existing theory, implementing systems based on the refinements,
modeling performance and costs, and conducting rigorous experimental
evaluations. The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed
publications, and through software and experimental configurations that will be
available freely.
