EIA 0215799 &lt;br/&gt;Stevens, Deborah&lt;br/&gt;Institute for Women and
Technology &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Scholarship and Travel Grants for the
Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing 2002&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On
October 9-12, 2002, the fourth Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing
(GHC) is being held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This international
conference features talks by some of the most successful women in computing,
technical presentations on topics of current interest, as well as panels,
workshops, and technology innovation forums for an in-depth look at new issues
in computing. This grant provides travel and registration funding for
approximately seventy-five people in computing and related fields who otherwise
would not be able to attend. The grants are awarded to advanced undergraduate
and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the goals of GHC is to
encourage women to pursue and stay in the field of computer science by providing
support for young women before they leave the pipeline. By providing
opportunities for them to attend GHC, they are exposed to women who are
creating, improving, and studying advanced computer related technologies and
sciences. GHC is an unusual conference that focuses strongly on women in
computing and is an excellent venue for worthwhile interactions to develop
between those established in the field and others early in their careers. This
grant is expected to directly affect the careers of the attendees and to help to
reverse the current trend showing declining numbers of women in
computing.&lt;br/&gt;
