Database management systems efficiently organize, access and manipulate enormous
quantities of data for traditional business applications. This efficiency is
based on indexing records by one attribute, such as social security number.
However, new applications in both science and business require indexing on
several attributes. Astronomers and geographers want data to be organized
spatially; businesses want to study trends over time. This project continues
work on spatial and temporal indexes which have already been demonstrated to be
efficient. A new node consolidation and concurrency algorithm will be applied to
the Holey Brick tree, a spatial index with guarantees for space utilization and
query speed. This will enable scientists to make sophisticated queries on
spatial data while records are being inserted and deleted. The Time Split B-tree
(a time-and-key based indexing system) will be enhanced by limiting the time-
interval size and by managing the timestamping of records. Last, ways are being
found to create indexes and do other reorganizations of data while the DBMS is
online.The results of this project will aid in the management of anticipated
non- traditional applications on massive collections of data in both science and
in business.
