The Committee on National Statistics of the National Academy of Sciences works
to improve the statistical methods used for analysis in many fields of science.
Its work is also aimed at upgrading the quality of statistical information on
which important basic research and public policy decisions are founded. The
committee, composed of distinguished statisticians and other scientists of
eminence, identifies problem areas in which statistical questions are pivotal,
and carries out studies which evaluate these questions comprehensively and seek
to provide feasible solutions. Broad support for the committee's developmental
activities and basic operating costs is provided by a consortium of federal
agencies led by the National Science Foundation. Each agency contributes an
annual sum proportionate to its interest in the committee's yearly agenda and
the size of its own research budget. The award recommended at present represents
the foundation's financial participation in the consortium for Fiscal Year 1988.
The award also carries notification of the foundation's intention to make
similar contributions to the committee's upkeep in future years, contingent upon
satisfactory scientific progress and the availability of funds.
