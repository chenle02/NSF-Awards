Professors Olin and Thomson will continue their work on subnormal operator
theory and its associated function theory problems. This includes the study of
various algebras generated by the subnormal operators and their associated
representations. The study of the function spaces associated to these algebras
will also be pursued. This work may have applications to several areas of
mathematics including measure theory, Borel analysis, ergodic theory, and
function theory. Hilbert space operators are essentially infinite matrices of
complex numbers. These operators have applications in every area of applied
science as well as in pure mathematics. This type of research is an attempt to
categorize certain important classes of such objects.
