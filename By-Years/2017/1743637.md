This grant supports student travel for select students and post-doctoral
researchers to participate in the Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS-2017)
June 16-17 in Pittsburgh, PA. SoCS is an annual event that brings together
researchers in heuristic search and combinatorial optimization drawing from
diverse areas of artificial intelligence, planning, robotics, constraint
programming, operations research, bioinformatics, and computer games. This
consortium is oriented on research and career development for students who have
identified their PhD topics and are just embarking on that independent research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sponsoring student travel to SoCS fosters a community of
researchers from otherwise diverse areas of computer science to both advance the
state of the art in heuristic search and/or combinatorial optimization, and also
use these tools in their research. Students participating in this symposium are
also more likely to take full advantage of the top-tier conference in the
International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) 2017
taking place immediately prior to this symposium, and co-located with it. The
entire event provides an opportunity for students to engage in discussion with
scientists from around the world and to explore new research directions and
topics.
