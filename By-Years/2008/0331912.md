Proposal #: AST- 0331912&lt;br/&gt;PI: Blue, Charles &lt;br/&gt;Institution:
Associated Universities Inc/National Radio Astronomy
Observatory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;National observatories, government agencies,
universities and private institutions devote considerable time and resources to
communicating the results of astronomy research to the public. These entities,
however, do not often have the opportunity to interact, share resources, and
discuss common problems. As a result, the effectiveness of public outreach in
astronomy suffers. Expertise is not often shared. New avenues of outreach and
cooperative opportunities are missed. The National Radio Astronomy Observatory,
in cooperation with the National Research Council, is organizing a conference to
attempt to solve some of these problems, and to ensure these institutions are
poised to take advantage of new opportunities, enhance their current efforts,
and develop new cooperative programs in astronomy outreach. This three-day
meeting will feature panel discussions on communicating astronomy, featured
speakers and experts addressing salient issues, and guided discussions among the
participants. In addition, individual poster sessions will be offered to
showcase various institutions' efforts and programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts of this activity will be in two areas. First, it will provide a
lasting outreach resource for the entire astronomical community. The conference
will strive to create an ongoing method for sharing astronomy outreach
materials, and to build sustained linkages by fostering cooperation among
different sectors of the astronomical community. A second broad impact will be
improved understanding of astronomy, the scientific process, and the value of
research among the general public. &lt;br/&gt;
