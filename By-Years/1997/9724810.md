provide instrumentation for research into ultraviolet radiation in marine and
terrestrial environments of Bermuda and the Sargasso Sea. Proposed use of this
land- and underwater-based UV monitoring instrumentation includes study of
impact of ultraviolet radiation at several wavelengths on marine bacteria,
phytoplankton and coral reefs. ***
