The goal of this project is to try to understand the topology underlying quantum
invariants in three dimensions. The current state of knowledge seems inadequate
for explaining what kind of topological information the invariants carry, and
therefore what kind of applications in three-dimensional topology they might
have. However it has revealed (through the frameworks of TQFT and Vassiliev
theory) a wealth of very interesting algebraic structures, which seem to be
specifically related to topology in three dimensions, and so should be thought
of as kind of ``new algebraic topology'' in three dimensions. Roberts intends to
try to bridge the gap between this new topology and classical algebraic
topology. There are three main areas of investigation. The first is K-theory,
which could help to explain the relationship between quantum knot invariants and
Vassiliev invariants (for example, why the Jones polynomial is a polynomial).
The second is Rozansky-Witten theory, a very interesting new example of a TQFT
which provides new hints about intepretation of the invariants, and could have
additional applications in complex or hyperkaehler geometry. The third is the
hyperbolic volume conjecture of Kashaev, Murakami and Murakami. This conjecture
seems to fit into a general pattern of ideas relating quantization (and
specifically, 6j-symbols) to classical geometry; ideas which might provide a
conceptual context for the conjecture.

To a mathematician, a knot is what you get by tangling up a piece of string and
then gluing its ends together. It is clear that there are qualitatively
different ways of doing this; trying to describe and understand these ways forms
a branch of topology, which might be thought of as what remains of geometry when
quantitative questions are ignored. The main tools of knot theory are
"topological invariants", numbers which can be associated to knots and which
encode some information about their structure. During the last sixteen years,
ideas borrowed from the physics of quantum field theory have led to the
discovery of many new and beautiful invariants called "quantum invariants", but
because of this unusual origin, their meaning remains very mysterious, and their
potential unfulfilled. The goal of the project is to use some new ideas to try
to explain this mystery and to bridge some of the gaps between geometry,
topology, and physics. The work should contribute to the healthy exchange of
ideas between these disciplines, and stimulate new work in each.
