This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Major Research Instrumentation(MRI) Program will help a junior
faculty in Department of Chemistry at the Johns Hopkins University to acquire a
fluorescence spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research which explores
the excited states of inorganic compounds and extended solids in heterogeneous
media. The fluorescence spectrometer counts photons of light in the UV and
visible regions and when a sample of material is illuminated by UV light,
filtered to absorb the reflected UV light, then only visible fluorescence to be
detected.
