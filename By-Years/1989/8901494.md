Chang will continue studies on the statistical properties of estimated rotation
matrices. An important application is the determination of the errors in the
reconstructions of the past positions of tectonic plates (known popularly as
"continental drift"). He analyzes the spherical regression model for the shift
from one point to another on the surface of the unit sphere: multiplication by
an orthogonal rotation matrix A is followed by the addition of a random error.
For different points the rotation matrix A remains the same but the error is
symmetrically distributed around the corresponding rotated point. Robust
extensions of this model will be studied.
