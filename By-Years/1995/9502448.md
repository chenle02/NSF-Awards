9502448 Filz Even though soil-bentonite cutoff walls are widely used, the state
of practice is that they are designed and built without a fundamental
understanding of the mechanics of the interaction between the trench backfill
and the adjacent ground. The consequences of this are that neither the hydraulic
conductivity of the backfill nor the settlement of the adjacent ground can be
accurately predicted. The principal objective of this research is to put design
of these walls on a sound theoretical basis. The methods to be employed include
laboratory testing, instrumentation of a full-scale cutoff wall, analytical
work, and numerical analyses. Methods used for the educational component
include: 1) a version of multimedia developed to improve classroom efficiency
and to create time for students to exercise new knowledge as soon as they learn
it and get immediate feedback on their performance, 2) and interdisciplinary
educational program will be developed that will involve the environmental,
hydrosystems, and geotechnical engineering groups, and 3) undergraduates will
participate in the soil-bentonite cutoff wall research. ***
