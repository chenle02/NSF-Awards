This planning project will involve eight Tennessee universities, the Center of
Excellence for Science and Mathematics Education, public schools, and state
agencies in the development of a comprehensive systematic state-wide program of
improvement in elementary science and associated mathematics for schools
throughout the state. The project developed will prepare teachers to implement
exemplary science education experiences which are congruent with the emerging
NSTA standards and which employ contemporary educational technology. The nature
of the cooperative activities among the eight universities and the participating
schools and agencies will ensure that the best talent in the state will be
available to plan, provide, and evaluate professional development activities for
teachers. A variety of innovative delivery techniques including compressed video
and satellite will integral features of this project. Planning activities,
leading to the submission of a teacher enhancement proposal, will be conducted
over a one year period. These planning activities will involve all shareholders
in elementary science education in Tennessee. This project partially fulfills
one of the major goals of the Tennessee Systemic Initiative.//
