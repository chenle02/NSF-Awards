Privacy is an important concern in the digital age, yet the adoption of privacy
preserving technologies has lagged behind that of other security technologies.
This is, to a great extent, due to the lack of practical, usable privacy
preserving technologies. The wide adoption of confidentiality and integrity
technologies was triggered by a few practical software tools, such as SSL and
SSH. By contrast, practical privacy preserving technologies still face
considerable challenges.

The goal of this project is to develop two practical privacy preserving
technologies, which serve as a case study on unique requirements and pitfalls of
privacy preserving software.

Privacy preserving computation: Generic techniques are close to practical for
some functions of interest, but a tantalizing gap still remains for many
applications. The practicality gap widens further if malicious adversarial
behavior must be tolerated. This project focus on new efficient methods to
protect against malicious faults, retro-fitting at the algorithmic level to gain
new efficiencies at the cryptographic protocol level, and new efficient methods
to facilitate the ongoing storage and processing of privacy-sensitive data.

Off-the-record communication: This project will design protocols for off-the-
record communication between group members. Each member can verify the identity
of the sender and ensure the confidentiality of the message, but no subset of
group members may conspire to implicate the sender to any third party.

Broader impacts of this project are to inform the general public that privacy is
not a lost cause in the digital age, and to create public appreciation and
support for applied cryptography research.
