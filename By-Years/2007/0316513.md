Transposable elements (TEs) are tiny organisms, with genome sizes varying from
hundreds to thousands of nucleotides, that live within a cell nucleus and
survive by spreading their progeny on host chromosomes. TEs have multiple
negative effects on host's performance: they cause mutations and induce
deletions and duplications. Hosts with too many TEs are eliminated since they
are unfit. What regulates TE activity? To answer this question, we will identify
genes controlling transpositions of a model TE - copia, and their mutant
variants that permit copia transpositions. We hypothesize that mutant host genes
are present in natural Drosophila melanogaster populations. To test this
hypothesis and determine the frequency of mutant alleles, we will study
transpositions in 150 lines of flies. In flies with broken TE control, TE
numbers explode.

How likely, fast, and dramatic could TE explosions be? Is there enough variation
in host genes controlling transposition rate to rapidly suppress exploding TEs?
Our data will help answer these, and other important questions having a broad
impact on conservation biology programs, and on breeding programs aimed at
improving cultured stocks. Further, our research will provide new training
experiences for undergraduate, graduate students and a postdoc in molecular
population genetics and evolution.
