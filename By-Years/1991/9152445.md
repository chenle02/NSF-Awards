The purpose of this project is to establish global positioning system (GPS)
capabilities for a civil engineering technology program. With GPS (satellite
positioning) becoming accepted and commonly used in science and industry, there
is a need to teach this emerging surveying technology. The project provides 3
GPS receivers with antennas, two dedicated personal computers to reduce the
satellite data, and the necessary data reduction and network adjustment
software.
