This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports the acquisition
of an optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and thermoluminescence reader and
associated gamma ray spectrometer to support research and undergraduate
education at New Mexico Highlands University, a non-Ph.D granting institution.
The OSL lab at NMHU will support research that will benefit from the ability to
date the burial ages of silicate phases in geological and archaeological
materials up to several hundreds of thousands years before present. The
instrument will support Quaternary investigations of the timing and extent of
past glaciations and subsequent retreat and the influence of past climate on
plant and animal life and human evolution and distribution. The OSL lab will be
the first of its kind in the state of New Mexico and will support experiential
laboratory training for a student population dominated by Hispanic students. The
NMHU OSL lab will serve researchers and students across the departments of
Forestry, Environmental Geology, Chemistry, Biology, and Anthropology and will
support national and international collaborations.
