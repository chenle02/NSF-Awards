Research will be carried out in experimental pion and heavy- ion physics at the
TRIUMF cyclotron and at the Berkeley SuperHilac facility. The work will focus on
(1) pion bremsstrahlung resulting from pion scattering from polarized protons,
and (2) anomalous electron and positron emission lines produced in heavy ion
collisions of high-Z nuclei. Differential cross sections and asymmetries in the
pion bremsstrahlung experiment will be measured in the delta isobar excitation
region to investigate longstanding disagreement with theory. The heavy- ion
experiments will be kinematically complete, detecting electrons and positrons in
coincidence with scattered ions, have high statistical accuracy, and use
improved detection systems over earlier measurements at GSI Darmstadt. The
heavy-ion measurement addresses issues raised concerning possible new neutral
elementary particles, abnormal states of the vacuum, and exotic QED effects.
