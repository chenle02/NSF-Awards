The aim of the triennial workshop on "Advanced Research Workshop on Future
Trends in Microelectronics (FTM): Journey Into the Unknown" to be held June
21-26, 2015 in Mallorca, Spain, is to continue the tradition started in 1995 and
now reaching the 8th iteration, to provide a forum for a free-spirited exchange
of views among the leading professionals in Industry, Academia, and Government.
Topics to be addressed include the evolution of microelectronics including not
only computing and communications, but extending to sensors, displays, systems,
bioelectronics, nanotechnology, and electronics-related material science for the
coming decade or more, The speakers are asked to present their own uninhibited
views, opinions and critiques of the present and future trends, rather than
their own achievements. Debates and critical assessments are encouraged. The
resulting free-spirited discussion, with varied and occasionally clashing
viewpoints, will be available on the FTM workshop website as well as the
conference volume (to be published by Wiley) providing a valuable educational
tool for young researchers deciding on promising directions for microelectronics
research in the next decade.
