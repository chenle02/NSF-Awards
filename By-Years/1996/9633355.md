9633355 Gieskes This award allows the participation of Dr. Joris Gieskes of
Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, on a planned
research cruise in the vicinity of Hawaii to sample sub-crustal water at an
existing seafloor borehole. In addition to sampling and analysing the
subseafloor fluids to examine changes in properties since drilling in 1991, this
researcher will carry out detailed physical logs of the borehole. The overall
objective of this research is to understand the movement of fluids within the
earth's crust. This project provides important information on the borehole
environment for the separately-supported activity, coordinated between Scripps
Institution of Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the
Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, to emplace and test
seismometers in this borehole to record earthquakes, testing methods of
expanding the Global Seismic Network into the marine environment. ***
