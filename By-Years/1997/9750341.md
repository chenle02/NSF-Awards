Abstract DBI 9750341 Claire S. Ting This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Biosciences Related to the Environment for 1997. This
fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain additional scientific
training beyond the doctoral degree and to pursue innovative and imaginative
into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between organisms
and their environment at the molecular, cellular, organismal, population,
community and/or ecosystem level in any area of biology supported by the
Directorate for Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation. Each
fellowship supports a research and training plan to be carried out in a
sponsoring laboratory. The research and training plan for this fellowship is
entitled "Key Environmental Factors Regulating Photosynthetic Gene Expression in
a Novel Prokaryote." Prochlorococcus marinus is the only photosynthetic
prokaryote which has been found to contain a chlorophyll a/b light-harvesting
antenna as well as the phycobiliprotein, phycoerythrin. This research addresses
the functional significance of phycoerythrin in this organism. The mechanisms
that regulate phycoerythrin gene expression and accumulation are being
determined under different light and nutrient levels.
