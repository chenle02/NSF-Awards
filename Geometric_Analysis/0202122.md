ABSTRACT DMS - 0202122.

The goal of this project is to study the geometry of conformally compact
Einstein manifolds and other related problems. These manifolds were first
studied by mathematicians about ten years ago. New ideas and stimuli came up a
couple of years ago when it was found that they are the mathematical framework
for the new proposal ADS/CFT correspondence in string theory. Therefore the
study of conformally compact Einstein manifolds has even become important for
physics. The author has done work on the geometry of such manifolds, but there
remain many problems to be studied. In the future the author hopes to tackle the
problem of existence. If the conformal infinity has enough symmetry one hopes to
find explicit solutions. The global uniqueness is also a challenging problem and
requires new ideas. Many recent results have shown that there is a profound
relationship between the global geometry of ambient manifolds and the conformal
geometry of the boundary. The author intends to further explore this direction.

This proposal studies a class of geometric objects called conformally compact
Einstein manifolds. They are not only mathematically interesting, but also
important for physics because they serve as the framework for a deep
correspondence in string theory. The author will study various geometric aspects
of these manifolds as well as problems arising in physics. The study of this
special class of noncompact manifolds whose geometry at infinity is well under
control will also provide insights and ideas to study more general noncompact
manifolds.
