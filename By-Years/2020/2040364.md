The Historically Black Colleges and Universities â€“ Undergraduate Program (HBCU-
UP) provides support to undertake an institutional self-analysis and to design
activities in preparation for a research center. The project at Coppin State
University seeks to establish the Integrative Center for Emerging Contaminants
(ICEC). The goal of the planning grant is to build the foundation for a center,
envisioned to be funded by the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and
Technology (CREST) program, to perform cutting-edge research in emerging
contaminants (EC), which are derived from industry, agriculture, and
biotechnological and pharmaceutical sectors. Undergraduate students are actively
involved in this project by participating in research. This project supports the
goal of the CREST program to provide support to enhance the research
capabilities of minority-serving institutions through the establishment of
centers that effectively integrate education and
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this planning grant, the project will
form at least three convergent research collaborations to strategically
strengthen research capacity and articulate shared areas of excellence. The
three interrelated subprojects are: identifying, characterizing and quantifying
ECs; studying impacts of ECs on biological systems; and remediation of ECs.
Specific planning activities include: conducting a writing workshop,
conceptualizing and planning for development of a center, piloting research
projects to assess student learning during undergraduate research experiences,
and faculty development. The project will be guided by formative and summative
evaluation. This project is jointly funded by the HBCU-UP and CREST
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
