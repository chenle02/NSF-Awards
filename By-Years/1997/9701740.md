9701740 Chamberlin This is a new proposal in which two novel experimental
techniques will be utilized to investigate the dynamics of nanoscopic domains in
various ferromagnetic and random magnetic systems. Nonresonant spectral hole
burning (NSHB), where large magnetic field oscillations are used to selectively
study the intrinsic local response, will provide insight into the constituents
that comprise the net spectrum of response from bulk samples. Electron
holography, using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with
a small oscillating magnetic field, will provide images of magnetization
dynamics in thin films and small structures with a resolution of 2-5 nm and
sensitivity of 10-15-10-16emu. Questions to be addressed include: how does
microscopic structure influence mesoscopic dynamics, how does transient local
structure evolve, and how do mesoscopic magnetic domains govern macroscopic
response? %%% This is a new proposal that aims at the central goal of
information technology in trying to improve high-density magnetic storage.
Someday, the physical size of stored bits of information will shrink into the
submicron realm where thermal fluctuations significantly limit the lifetime of
the memory. Magnetization dynamics involves a complex combination of
microscopic, mesoscopic (medium-sized), and macroscopic processes. Two novel
experimental techniques will be used to investigate these magnetization
processes. Nonresonant spectral hole burning (NSHB) will provide information
about the intrinsic local response of bulk samples and electron holography,
using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), will provide direct
magnetic imaging of thin films and small structures with unmatched resolution
and sensitivity. Questions to be addressed include: how does microscopic
structure influence mesoscopic dynamics, how does transient local structure
evolve, and how do mesoscopic magnetic domains govern macroscopic response? ***
