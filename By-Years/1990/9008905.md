This award supports an investigation of the age of pollen, megafloral and
vertebrate fossil collections from the Eureka Sounds Group of the Canadian
Arctic. Attempts to date collections from Ellesmere Island using
magnetostratigraphy ultimately produced a reliable record but the polarity
sequence was too short for a unique correlation to the geomagnetic reversal time
scale (GRTS). This project will sample a 3000m thick interval of co-eval
sediments from Axel Heiberg Island to improve temporal calibration of the unique
Eureka Sound Group biostratigraphic record.//
