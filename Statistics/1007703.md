This project concentrates on (i) developing limit theory for a class of long
range dependent spaÂ­tial processes under various spatial sampling designs,
including the case of irreguraly spaced data-sites, which is encountered
frequently in spatial applications; (ii) developing new resampling methodology
for spatial data under both short-and long-range dependence that are immune to
the e.ects of the curse of dimensionality, (iii) developing Edgeworth expansion
theory for spatial data for both regularly and irregularly spaced cases, and
(iv) investigating higher order properties of resampling methods for spatial
data and study their higher order properties.

The proposed project aims to make important theoretical and methodological
contributions to several critical areas of spatial statistics that have a wide
of potential applications but the state of the current literature on these areas
is very sparse. In addition to advancing the state of statistical methodology
for spatially referenced data, the proposed research would also bene.t many
other areas of sciences, such as Astronomy, Hydrology, Geology, Economics,
Atmospheric Sciences, etc. where spatial data exhibiting di.erent forms of
dependence are known to occur naturally, and model-free statistical methods such
as those proposed in the project play an important role in their analysis.
Further, the project would lead to the development of human resources through
advising of Ph.D. students and mentoring of junior researchers.
