This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) plan seeks to develop new
technology for molding high-aspect-ratio microstructures and conduct fundamental
research in microstructures and fundamental research in micromolding. A rapid
thermal response molding process has been developed to increase productivity in
molding low-stress products. The technology can be adapted to micromolding to
solve the premature freezing problem while maintaining short cycle times.
Molding results of high-aspect-ration microstructures will be used to validate
an approach for simulating the filling process of polymer melts in
microcavities. The key research and education activities include: (1)
Integrating the rapid thermal response technology with thermoplastic
micromolding processes, i.e., microinjection molding and hot embossing. (2)
Characterizing the microscale viscosity of polymer melts and the size effect in
microscale. (3) Simulating the filing process of polymer melts in microcavities.
(4) Developing a graduate and undergraduate course in polymer microfabrication
and enhancing several existing courses in materials processing and
manufacturing. (5) Developing an integrated research and education laboratory in
polymer microfabrication with involvement of both undergraduate and graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key impacts of this project include: (1) The
technology for rapid production of high-aspect-ratio microstructures that will
impact significantly in the fast growing telecommunication and biomedical
industries. (2) The capability in characterizing and modeling microscale
polymeric flows that will provide a fundamental understanding of polymer
microfabrication. (3) The integrated research and education program will provide
educational opportunities for students to work on leading edge research projects
in polymer microfabrication.&lt;br/&gt;
