Current wireless data networks, such as 802.11b/g/a (Wi-Fi) which are based on
single antenna transmission are inefficient in terms of the number of users
(capacity) that can be supported in a given area. It is well known that multiple
antenna elements (arrays) can be combined with beamforming and space-time coding
to greatly enhance the capacity of cellular networks. However, the use of
antenna arrays to enhance capacity in Ad hoc networks (i.e. when a base station
is not available) is not well understood. The development of new beamforming and
space-time coding techniques that exploit antenna arrays in Ad hoc networks will
greatly increase the number of users and data rates that can be supported in
future Wi-Fi and Wi-Max type applications, and reduce dependence on cellular and
optical backbone infrastructures.

This project specifically develops and analyzes a class of distributed array
processing algorithms for increasing Ad hoc wireless network capacity based on
iterative minimum mean-square error (IMMSE) beamforming. In IMMSE, the transmit
beamformer at each node is set to the conjugate of the conventional MMSE receive
beamformer computed using a training sequence. IMMSE is then studied using
noncooperative game theory in order to obtain convergence and efficiency
results. The IMMSE algorithm is extended to space-time coding to yield
approximate solutions to maximizing decoupled Shannon capacities of Ad hoc
networks. These IMMSE-Deflation (IMMSE-D) algorithms attempt to balance desired
link capacity with a tax on interference to other links, and hence may offer
better network throughput than greedy capacity-maximization algorithms. Overall
network throughput is evaluated by embedding the IMMSE and IMMSE-D algorithms in
a network simulation software package.
