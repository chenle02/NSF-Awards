The Engineering Research Center for Advanced Electronic Materials Processing at
North Carolina State University will develop processing technology for the
generation of electronic devices that will be produced in the next century.
Specifically, the ERC is planning to develop atomic layer processing technology
and low temperature processes compatible with an in-situ processing system. The
research areas that will be addressed are plasma processing; laser and optically
assisted processing; atomic layer and molecular beam epitaxy; electron and ion
beam processing and the development of special characterization techniques to
monitor and control an in-situ processing system. Modelling and simulation of
the processes are planned as is the development of expert systems for process
control. Dr. Nino Masnari, Chairman of the electrical Engineering Department
will be the Director of the Center.
