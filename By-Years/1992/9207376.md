9207376 Glenn Species diversity in a community is partially a product of the
dynamics of local immigration and extinction. Barriers to immigration may result
in shifts in dominance and affect community structure and function. Percolation
theory provides a mechanism for developing hypotheses regarding movement of
organisms through the environment. Community structure in grasslands resembles a
percolation network, however, the applicability of percolation network, however,
the applicability of percolation theory to plant community structure has not
been evaluated. A series of hypotheses will be tested using field experiments
and simulation modeling to determine the applicability of percolation theory to
predicting spatial patterns of dominance and diversity in grassland vegetation.
Previous studies have shown grasslands to be highly dynamic at small spatial
scales over short periods. Preliminary results from stimulation models of clonal
growth in percolation networks suggests that species diversity is affected by
barriers to movement. Above a critical threshold, species diversity declined in
these models as superior competitors dominated available space. A series of
experimental percolation networks in grassland vegetation will be created and
clonal growth of prennial species, local patterns of immigration and extinction,
species diversity, and spatial pattern will be monitored. Field experiments will
be supplemented by modelling percolation of clonal plants with different rates
of spread and competitive abilities. This study will help to determine the
utility of percolation theory to small-scale plant comm unity dynamics in
grassland vegetation. ! ! ! F ( Times New Roman Symbol &amp; Arial " h Y C
