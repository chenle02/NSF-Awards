Funds are provided to study the effect of seawater on newly formed oceanic
crust during hydrothermal circulation processes. This will be accomplished
through the analysis of elemental flux between seawater and crust by studying
500 m of layer 3 gabbros cored during ODP drilling on SW Indian Ridge. These
processes exert major control over the chemistry of elements in ocean and their
understanding is thus important to the study of paleoechemistry.
