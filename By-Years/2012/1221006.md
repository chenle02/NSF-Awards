Internet users may have compelling reasons to seek anonymity online, for
example, to discuss stigmatizing issues with others like themselves, or to
express dissident opinions. This project studies what people believe it means to
be anonymous online, how their privacy and security are affected by their
strategies to achieve anonymity, and how they are likely to use new anonymity
services. These questions are important because the traceability of users?
actions across sites and contexts is ever greater, increasing risks for users
who may misjudge their actual anonymity. &lt;br/&gt;The research involves
interviews, surveys, and experimental studies to identify user motivations and
practices, situational factors, and individual differences that lead people to
desire anonymity. The research investigates the risks that users? perceive in
their interactions, their motivations to avoid being identified, and the
strategies they employ to mitigate risks they perceive to themselves and their
relationships. A key component of this work is identifying cross-national and
cultural differences in anonymity motivations and actions of people in countries
such as China, where the government monitors and blocks Internet communications.
This information will be used to design instructional materials and other tools
that provide users with feedback and better strategies to protect themselves
against risk. This project will inform cyberspace technical design and policy by
addressing the SaTC goals of understanding, predicting and explaining
prevention, attack, and defense behaviors and contributing to strategies for
remediation.&lt;br/&gt;
