The investigators in this proposal study two different aspects of noise in
neuroimaging data: structure of non-Gaussian random fields and their
applications to neuroimaging; along with interpretable predictive modelling of
fMRI. The structure of non-Gaussian random fields is expected to shed light on
how useful Random Field Theory (RFT), presently used for controlling Family Wise
Error Rate (FWER) in neuroimaging studies, can be expected to be for truly non-
Gaussian fields. The predictive models proposed by the investigators place much
emphasis on interpretability and will allow comparison with the usual approaches
based on detecting correlation between experimental stimuli and neuroimaging
data while controlling FWER or False Discovery Rate (FDR).

This project is motivated by the need for flexible and valid statistical
procedures to interpret neuroimaging data and to confirm neuroscientific
hypotheses derived from previous work. Examples of such neuroimaging data can be
found in fields like social neuroscience, which seeks to understand and model
human social behaviour based on the activation and interactions of various
regions of the human brain; neuroeconomics, which seeks to interpret and model
some of the decision-making processes of humans based on models of the human
brain; and disease models such as schizophrenia in which the goal is to
understand how the brains of schizophrenic patients differ in anatomy and
function from those of non-schizophrenic patients. Virtually all neuroimaging
data is what is known as "high-throughput" which means that huge amounts of data
are recorded, typically for only a small group of individuals. Statistical tools
are needed to produce consistent and reproducible results from such data. The
investigators in this proposal will develop tools that can be used to confirm
existing hypotheses about neuroimaging data, as well as generate hypotheses via
interpretable predictive models of decision making processes.
