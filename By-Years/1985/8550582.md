The American Psychological Association, in cooperation with the Association of
Science-Technology Centers (ASTC), will develop a series of exhibits on
psychology using a discovery room/science laboratory approach. The exhibition
will, for the first time, offer museum visitors a first hand opportunity to
explore the tools, methods, and concepts of psychology in such areas as thinking
and feeling, dreaming and sleeping, perceiving and communicating. The exhibition
will travel to eight museums over 30 months through the ASTC traveling
exhibition service and will reach over a million visitors. A wide selection of
additional materials and resources such as films, seminars, lectures and
workshops will be offered to the participating museums to extend the impact of
the exhibition. Plans of the exhibits will be made available to other museums.
NSF support represents less than 50% of the total cost of the project.
