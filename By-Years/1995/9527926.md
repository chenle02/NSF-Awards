IRI-9527926 Wolfe, Michael Oregon Graduate Institute $22,000 - 12 mos. Support
for International Travel to Workshop on Loop Parallelization The International
Workshop on Loop Parallelization, being held in April 1966 in Wadern, Germany,
has as its purpose bringing together two research communities which are both
working on Loop Parallelization, but applying differing models and criteria. One
of these communities has concentrated on parallelizing compilers for sequential
loops, pragmatically developing heuristic methods that may work at high speed
for a variety of loops, but are not provably optimal, while the other community
works on regular array design, identifying optimal parallelizations for highly
regular loop nests. The purpose of the Workshop is to get the groups working
together on a variety of common problems. Researchers from the USA, Europe, and
Japan are going to be present. This grant will guarantee a strong representation
of American scientists from the two relevant communities working on this
important aspect of parallel computation.
