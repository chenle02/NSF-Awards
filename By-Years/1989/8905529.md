Supernovae are the most energetic stellar explosions known, capable of ejecting
matter at thousands of kilometers per second into their environment. The ejected
matter expands with supersonic speed, compresses interstellar gas, and enriches
it with heavy elements that was synthesized by the parent star. The Principal
Investigator (PI) proposes to continue with his observational research,
previously funded by NSF, on supernovae and supernova remnants. He will be using
the new generation of solid-state imagers and spectrometers available at the
National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) and at other observatories. In
particular, the PI will study the events in the evolution of massive stars that
lead up to supernova explosions and the effects such explosions have on the
interstellar medium in our and other nearby galaxies. Answers will be sought to
such issues as the frequency of and energy released by supernovae, the rate of
expansion of supernova ejecta, the chemical evolution of galaxies, and the
frequency of star formation. Special attention will be accorded to Supernova
1987A, whose explosion was observed in February 1987 in the Large Magellanic
Cloud. Model atmospheres and brightness observations of supernovae will be used
to measure distances to nearby galaxies.
