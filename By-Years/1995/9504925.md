9504925 Cao The proposal lies in complex geometry and differential equations,
and deals specifically with the Ricci flow - otherwise known as the parabolic
Einstein equation, which is a geometric evolution equation - on Kahler
manifolds. The main goal is to understand the asymptotic behavior of solutions
to the Ricci flow on a compact Kahler manifold of positive holomorphic
bisectional curvature. Geometric evolution equations arise in nature. And
although the proposed research deals with somewhat technical aspects of a
specific geometric evolution equation, it is possible that it will lead to
important techniques applicable to a broader class of evolution equations.
