The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate program
provides support for planning grants to study and assess comprehensive
institutional efforts to increase the numbers of students and the quality of
their preparation by strengthening science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) education and research. This project at South Carolina State
University provides a strategic approach to redesigning foundational STEM
courses to increase student success. The project is guided and informed by an
on-going evaluation, as well as external and internal advisory committees.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to establish the STEM Recruitment,
Retention, and Success Center to create an environment to guarantee STEM student
success. The center will focus on STEM recruitment, retention and student
service activities. Much of the planning activities involve creating the vision
and the activities for this center to enhance STEM student retention by
employing innovative teaching strategies in STEM gate-keeping courses, providing
students with internships and research experiences, and preparing them for
graduate school and the workforce. The project will pilot implementing active
learning strategies in introductory Physics and Computer Science courses.
Outreach activities with the Calhoun County School District and Orangeburg
Calhoun Technical College will be conducted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
