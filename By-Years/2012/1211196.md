This award will fund the continuation of a successful survey of white-dwarf
supernova explosions (called "Type I") at telescopes in Arizona and Chile. The
main goal of the work will be to compare low redshift (nearby) supernovae with
their high-redshift (distant) counterparts, especially through observations in
the infrared which can reduce the effects of dust. Under earlier funding from
NSF, this group has assembled a large and homogeneous set of Type I supernovae
light curves and spectra, developed original methods for using them using
advanced statistical techniques, and addressed problems of cosmic expansion such
as local flows, the Hubble constant, cosmic acceleration and the nature of the
dark energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to advance the study
of dark energy, which makes up most of the universe. Results from this survey
will be incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum at Harvard, and students
will be involved in the research. The award will also support ongoing efforts
outreach and public education.
