SIMPLE- the Sub-ice Investigation of Marine and PLanetary Ecosystems, is a
large, predominantly NASA-funded project that will explore the potential for the
underside of Antarctica's ice shelves to support vibrant marine ecosystems,
despite the constant darkness. A recently discovered "upside down" sea anemone
from the underside of the ice was just named one of the top ten new species of
2013 in fact. Such systems could be an analog for life on distant, ice-covered
planets and moons. The current award will support the hot-water drilling needed
to allow a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to survey the underside of the ice
during the upcoming Antarctic summer field season of 2014/2015. The award is
supported as a RAPID because of the time-limited availability of specialized
equipment.

The University of Nebraska at Lincoln has extensive experience with supporting
hot-water drilling systems in Antarctica, and continued use of the UNL drillers
helps maintain US expertise in this specialized skill. The NSF provided
equipment, teamed with the NASA supported science, represents a synergistic
federal partnership to support interesting science in a unique habitat, the
underside of Antarctic ice shelves.
