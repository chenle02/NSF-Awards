This project will consider cooperative and stochastic games. For cooperative
games, questions related to Shapley value will be analyzed when the players are
assumed to join coalitions with varying levels of effort or sincerity. In
addition, the notion of potential function for this kind of games will be
considered. For stochastic games, the existence of efficient algorithms and
equilibria will be studied. Models developed in this project apply to a many
phenomena in areas such as economics, finance, social and military science. Due
to the generality of the methods a vast area of knowledge is to benefit from the
results of this grant.
