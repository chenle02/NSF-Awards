The Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS) proposes to develop a permanent, one-acre,
outdoor exhibition overlooking the San Francisco Bay called called "The Forces
That Shape the San Francisco Bay." The exhibition will focus on the geologic and
hydrologic forces and the human impacts that have shaped the San Francisco Bay
and its environs. The exhibition's interactive components and related programs
will involve visitors in learning about erosion, river sediment and deposition,
mountain building, folding of strata and thrusting, faulting and seismicity.
