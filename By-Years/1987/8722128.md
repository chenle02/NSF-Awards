The object of this Phase II program is to fabricate and test novel cryogenic
composites designed for use as regenerators in closed-cycle cryocoolers
operating below 10 K. The material is a composite of helium self-loaded into a
metallic extended surface structure whose dispersion form is suitable for the
thermal flux and frequency requirements of regenerators. High effective heat
capacity from 3 - 6 K derives from the latent heat of vaporization and
condensation of subcritical helium, and high heat capacity below 10 K derives
from the sensible heat capacity of pressurized helium. High, anisotropic thermal
conductivity in the regenerator derives from the geometric form of the metallic
component. The combination of high heat capacity and high radial thermal
conductivity allows for rapid thermal penetration and high regenerator
effectiveness. The potential exists to achieve significant refrigeration power
at liquid helium temperatures with a closed-cycle cryocooler not involving a
Joule-Thomson gas- Throttling stage.
