Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: CAREER PI Mentoring and
Networking Workshop&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CTS-0342557&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Alison Flatau&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Maryland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help plan future outreach,
mentoring, and networking activities, a workshop will be held at NSF on January
21-23, 2004. A primary theme will be the integration of education and research
and methods for improving these activities through mentoring and networking.
Workshop activities will be planned and directed by an organizing committee co-
chaired by the PI, former chair of the CAREER Coordinating Committee (CCC) at
NSF and by Theresa Maldonado, a former CCC member. Three additional organizing
committee members will be sought to broaden representation from other
disciplines. The grant will support about 60 participants consisting of CAREER
awardees and invited speakers including university administrators. Participation
from underrepresented groups, HBCUs, HSIs, and tribal colleges will be
encouraged. Both plenary and breakout sessions will be included. Workshop
proceedings will be generated and disseminated through a website. Assessment
will be conducted through a series of surveys. The PI has previously conducted
two NSF workshops on the Advancement and Retention of Underrepresented and
Minority Engineering Educators. A successful outcome will be to identify
obstacles to success and to provide recommendations for improving awareness of
best practices, which will then be widely dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;
