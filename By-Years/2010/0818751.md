As trial courts, federal district courts are the first, and in many cases the
only, face of justice for litigants in the federal judicial system. And yet, our
knowledge of the business of these important courts is quite limited.

Viewed as the sum of its three essays, this dissertation project seeks to remedy
this deficit and unearth an unprecedented degree of evidence on the role and
place of federal district courts in the judicial hierarchy. In particular, this
research statistically models (1) the direct impact that courts of appeals have
on district court outcomes; (2) the losing litigant?s decision to appeal from
district courts to courts of appeals and the resulting appellate outcome based
on that appeal; and (3) the initial disposition of cases in federal district
courts, with a specific focus on the sex of the judge presiding over the case
and the likelihood of case settlement.

The data collected for this project promise to be some of the most comprehensive
ever amassed on the subject. By collecting and coding thousands of case dockets,
opinions, and other court documents across multiple years, thirty district
courts, and numerous issues areas that together account for about forty percent
of federal district court civil dockets, this research improves on previous
studies that generally rely on only published or reported opinions, a small
number of district courts, and a limited set of issue areas. These data are
combined with judge and litigant specific information, providing unprecedented
insights into the development of law, the strategies of parties, the managerial
role of judges, and the influence of intermediate appellate courts.
