0105464 Windom

This Americas award will support a visit to Brazil for Drs Herbert L. Windom and
Richard A. Jahnke of the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography to plan a
collaborative research proposal in the area of coastal marine biogeochemistry
with Dr. Felipe Niencheski, Loaboratorio de Hidroquimica of Fundacao
Universidade Do Rio Grande in Brazil.

Topics for discussion during the proposed visit will include chemical and
advective processes in coarse-grain sediments and their effect on coastal marine
chemistry. Since coastal lagoons comprise 13% of the world's coastline, a study
of these systems is critical to understanding how inputs from them can alter the
biogeochemistry of the adjacent coastal ocean.
