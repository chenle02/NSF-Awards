Abstract&lt;br/&gt; The recent financial crisis calls for a workhorse framework
to analyze the interaction between the financial system and aggregate economic
activities, and to give guidance for public policy. Although there is an
extensive literature examining the implications of financial frictions for the
aggregate economy, many important issues remain outstanding. The proposed
project with John Moore plans to continue our long-term research in order to
address questions such as: (1) Through what mechanism do shocks to the financial
system lead to a financial crisis? How does a crisis spread both across markets
and across countries? Does contagion occur mainly through prices (e.g. a fall in
the value of collateral assets), or mainly through chains of credit and default?
(2) What are the sources of financial instability, even during periods of stable
inflation? Has it to do with contractual incompleteness (such as lack of
indexation in debt contracts), or to do with the limited participation of small
firms and households in asset markets? What is the externality that may
rationalize government interventions? (3) How should government intervene? How
and when should monetary and fiscal policies ameliorate financial crises? Does
this role for government connect to the central bank's role as lender of last
resort?&lt;br/&gt; Throughout the PI's investigation, the key departure from a
standard framework is limited commitment: the agent cannot precommit to repay in
the future unless the debt is secured by tangible and intangible collateral.
Anticipating the possibility of future defaults, the lender limits credit
according to the collateral value - the borrower faces a borrowing constraint.
Another relatively under-studied aspect of limited commitment (at least in the
macro literature) is limited resaleability. After the lender provides a loan to
a borrower, can the lender sell her loan to new lenders in case she is short of
funds? For the loan to be resaleable, the borrower has to commit to repay
multilaterally, to both the original and new lenders. When the borrowing
constraint is sufficiently tight, the PI plans to show that instruments with
multilateral commitment (broad money) may circulate despite a low rate of
return, facilitating to achieve a better resource allocation. In such an
economy, shocks to resaleability can lead to a recession through a flight to
liquidity. The PI plans to explore the effect of government policies that change
the mix of assets held by private agents.
