Henry Taube of the Chemistry Department, Stanford University, is supported by
the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program to carry out
mechanistic studies of oxidation-reduction reactions of osmium compounds. One
highlight of the study will be comparison of the reactivity of osmium (III)
monohydrides with analogous compounds with I, II, and IV oxidation states. A
variety of other topics will be investigated: 1) oxidation-reduction and acid-
base chemistry of dihydrogen complexes of osmium; 2) examination of the
influence of a facial geometry, imposed by triazacyclononane ligands, upon the
high oxidation-state chemistry of osmium; and 3) and investigations into the
reactivity of novel seven-coordinate paramagnetic Os (IV) complexes. The
research is of a fundamental nature and, as such, provides the foundation for
understanding how to control electron transfer. The information garnered from
these studies may provide crucial insights into the development of new catalysts
or molecular electronics.
