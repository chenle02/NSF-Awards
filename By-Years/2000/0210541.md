Behavioral analysis of a group decision-making process Thomas D. Seeley One of
the most spectacular examples of an animal group functioning as a collective
decision-making agent is a swarm of honeybees choosing its future home. This
phenomenon occurs in the late spring and early summer when a colony outgrows its
hive and proceeds to divide itself by swarming. The swarm bees leave en masse,
quickly forming a cloud of bees just outside the parental hive; they then
coalesce into a beard-like cluster on a nearby tree branch where they choose
their future dwelling place. The nest-site selection process starts with several
hundred scout bees flying from the swarm cluster to search for tree cavities
that meet the bees' real-estate preferences. The scouts then return to the
cluster, report their findings by means of waggle dances, and work together to
decide which one of the dozen or more possible nest sites that they have
discovered should be the swarm's new home. The PI will determine (1) how the
scouts in a honey bee swarm work together to make the decision regarding their
future nest site, and (2) how they sense when they have finished making this
decision. Such group decision making, or social choice, occurs in many species
of group-living animals. Unraveling the mechanisms of social choice is essential
to understanding how animal groups function and may even lead to novel methods
of social choice by humans. A swarm of honey bees choosing its nest site is a
striking and accessible form of social choice by animals.
