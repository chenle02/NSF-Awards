This research is on the development of sensors for acoustic detection of low
energy deposition in ultra-cold silicon crystals. The investigation will focus
on possible methods for the detection of the phonons (sound quanta) produced
when energy is absorbed in the crystal. The distribution of these phonons at the
crystal surface yields information on the location and amount of energy deposit.
If successfully developed, the acoustic sensors and associated silicon crystals
could be used to detect neutrinos and other neutral, weakly interacting
particles. This would allow sensitive tests of the energetics of the sun, and
the possible existence of "dark matter" in the universe.
