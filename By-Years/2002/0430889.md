Traditionally the aspect of predictability in atmospheric research has been
concerned with its dependence on initial conditions for weather prediction and
on boundary conditions for prediction. The investigators will study the
intermediate range where important areas of predictability may be found at
weekly timescales. Two numerical models that are sufficiently complex but
computationally efficient will be used to explore statistical prediction. The
influence of initial and boundary conditions, ensemble size and the optimal
temporal averaging strategies will be studied. Being able to make a reasonable
a-priori estimate of an ensemble forecast's skill and the sources for that skill
would be of considerable interest in the forecasting community. The project will
involve the participation of a graduate student.
