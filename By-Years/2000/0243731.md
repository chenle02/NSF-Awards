In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Ault will investigate the oxidation/reduction reactions in
transition metal compounds. Specifically, these include metal oxo compounds,
using chromyl chloride, CrCl2O2, vanadium oxytrichloride, OVCl3, and
methyltrioxorhenium, CH3ReO3, as prototype systems. Another class of systems to
be studied is the organic peroxides of which hydrogen peroxide is the prototype.
The goals of this work are: 1)Identification of the key intermediates in the
reaction pathway; 2) Sspectroscopic and structural characterizations of the
intermediates; 3) Ccomparison of the experimental results with those obtained
from high level ab initio calculations; and 4) Mechanistic studies of these
reactions.

While of intrinsic interest to chemistry, the results of this work will have
wide applications ranging from organic synthesis to CVD thin film formation. The
PI has an excellent record of involving graduate and undergraduate students in
his research. They receive valuable training in preparation for advanced studies
and entry into the scientific/technological workforce.
