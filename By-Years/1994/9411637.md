This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of
Professor Robert A. Moss at Rutgers University. Carbenes and related reactive
intermediates will be studied by direct spectroscopic methods, particularly by
laser flash photolysis. Elements of the project are: (1) dissection of the
photoinitiated carbenic reactions to reveal contamination by excited state
precursors (carbene mimetic reactions); (2) examination of isotope effects on
intramolecular rearrangements, and evidence for tunneling; (3) the study of
electronic and steric effects in competitive 1,2-carbon migrations of
unsymmetrically ring-substituted cyclopropylhalocarbenes; (4) the measurement of
the electronic character of 1,2-acyl migrations in acyloxycarbenes and the
possible generation of acyl anions by the basic cleavage of acyloxydiazirenes;
and (5) determination of the kinetics of carbene-pyridine ylide formation.
Carbenes, divalent carbon species, are important reactive intermediates in
organic chemistry. Aspects of the reactions of carbenes will be studied such as
the mode of hydrogen and carbon atom migrations and the origin of the products
of photolysis of carbene precursors. This research could lead to new insights in
our understanding of carbene chemistry.
