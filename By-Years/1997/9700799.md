Over the last decade, a dramatic increase has been observed in the ability of
individual experimental scientists to generate and store data, which has not
been matched by an equivalent development of adequate data management tools. ZOO
is a generic Desktop Experiment Management Environment that can be customized
and placed on the desks of many scientists to manage their experimental studies.
Early experiences with a first prototype of Zoo have indicated that, as with
general database systems, one of the biggest challenges lies with the system's
user interface. The goal of this project is to investigate several hard problems
related to advanced database user interfaces that appear particularly important
for experiment management. These include problems related to schema
visualization, experiment flow modeling, visual query languages, dynamic
queries, approximate query answers, incremental queries, and others. This work
proceeds in a tight loop between developing generic database user interface
technology, incorporating the resulting techniques into ZOO, and installing
customized enhancements of the tool in real-life experimentation environments
for evaluation and feedback. The expected results of this research will advance
the state of the art in database user interfaces and will be incorporated into
the ZOO tools. Empowered with this fashion, ZOO will reach the necessary
maturity to be placed in actual experiment production environments and enable
scientists to manage their experimental studies efficiently and effectively.
