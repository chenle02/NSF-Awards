This research team combines theory and experiment to investigate the
fundamental physics of the "non-neutral plasma", i.e. a plasma consisting
entirely of one charge species. The investigations will center on electron
plasmas but the governing physics applies to positron or antiproton plasmas as
well. Of the many unique features of non-neutral plasmas perhaps the most
striking is their behavior when cooled to very low temperatures. At cryogenic
temperatures liquid and crystal phase transitions can occur within the confined
plasma body.
