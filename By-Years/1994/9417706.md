9417706 Walker The aim of this research project is to reach an understanding of
planetary differentiation by igneous processes. Methods of study to be used
include melting and/or dehydration experiments, petrographic and microprobe
studies and theoretical and numerical modeling. Projects to be undertaken
include: (a) exploration of liquid compositional dependence of the partitioning
of siderophile elements between metal and silicate liquids - relative to
planetary core formation's impact upon mantle siderophile element abundances,
(b) development of a P-T-X saturation model for natural liquids in equilibrium
with garnet-structured crystals, and (c) improvement of the doping properties,
reliability, and availability of the LaCrO3 semiconductor heaters - relevant to
the needs of this study and a wider community for methods of improved
experimental heating with low thermal gradients.
