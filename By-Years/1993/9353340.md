9353340 Mixon The Columbus Public School District plans to collect and analyze
data regarding components of the school district that contribute to and impact
upon student learning. The planning process consists of three steps: defining
and achieving consensus on a vision; collecting data to analyze strengths and
weaknesses of the school district; and developing an implementation plan. Two
groups of consituents, the Leadership Council and the USI Staff, comprise the
Planning Team. The Leadership Council will review collected data, make
recommendations based on this data, and garner additional support from other
stakeholders. The USI Staff will gather data, prepare reports for the Leadership
Council and draft the implementation plan. At the conclusion of the self study,
Columbus will have developed a documented study of existing programs, reached
consensus on the priorities for achieving comprehensive reform, obtained the
commitment of key constituencies to support systemic change in the Columbus
Public Schools, articulated a vision for mathematics and science education;
identified a detailed plan to guide their reform. ***
