9457003 ABSTRACT CTS-9457003 PI-Chen Experimental and theoretical investigations
were proposed to study the fundamental heat transfer mechanisms in quantum
structures and semiconductor device processing. The proposed experimental
studies would focus on the measurement of the thermophysical and radiative
properties of superlattices and the development of an emissivity independent
pyrometry temperature measurement technique for monitoring device processing.
Theoretical studies would be directed at understanding the heat mechanisms in
quantum structures and modeling the thermal characteristics of quantum devices.
