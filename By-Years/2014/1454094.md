A fundamental question in auditory science concerns how people can recognize
speech and other sounds in the presence of competing sound sources, as when
conversing with a dinner partner at a crowded restaurant. The process of hearing
a sound of interest when it is embedded in a mixture of other sounds is known as
"sound segregation" and human listeners vastly outperform machine systems for
segregating sounds. However, the process is frequently effortful, is highly
vulnerable to hearing impairment, including hearing impairment that typically
accompanies normal aging. Understanding the basis of sound segregation in human
listeners, and the factors that limit human segregation abilities, would enhance
efforts to develop assistive listening devices and machine systems for robust
speech recognition and sound recognition. The project will be complemented by an
educational effort to stimulate interest in audition in the general public and
in middle- and high-school students through a series of publicly available
online video presentations describing auditory research with associated sound
demonstrations.

This CAREER award is aimed at enriching the understanding of human auditory
perception by exploring the basis of sound segregation with natural sounds. The
experiments will leverage recent advances in speech analysis and synthesis
methods to 1) manipulate grouping cues in natural speech and test their effect
on sound segregation in human listeners; 2) manipulate voice and speech
structure to probe their role in segregation; and 3) test the ability of human
listeners to attend to and track target sound sources. The long-term goals are
to inspire signal-processing algorithms that facilitate segregation by human
listeners and replicate their competence in machine systems.
