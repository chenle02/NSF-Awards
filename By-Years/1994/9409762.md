Wave pipelining eliminates the intermediate register stages in a pipelined
system by using the internal capacitance of the combinational logic for
temporary storage. to obtain a high operating speed, equal path delays must be
ensured between all the input and the output nodes of a given functional block.
This requires symmetric rise and fall times, and delay independence on the input
patterns for each component within the functional unit. This project proposes a
method that uses a modified complementary Pass-transistor Logic (CPL) circuits
as the basic cells to implement a high performance CMOS wave-pipelined system.
Preliminary research and design results show that the family of basic cells,
called Wave-pipelined Transmission-Gate Logic (WTGI), using standard CMOS
technology, can be designed to have equal rise/fall times and reduced gate delay
variations as compared to other approaches. The project addresses the design of
a WTGL cell library for computational and signal processing applications.
Further, logic synthesis and the delay tuning algorithms will be developed with
an emphasis towards an application i signal processing. CAD tools that can
effectively use the WRGL technique will be developed.
