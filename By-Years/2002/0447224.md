Despite over half a century of inquiry, fundamental questions about how new
species form remain steeped in controversy. This project uses two complementary
analytical approaches to study the dynamics of species formation in montane
grasshoppers from the Rocky Mountains. Patterns of genetic variation across the
genome will be used to test hypotheses about the role of geography and
evolutionary processes in speciation, and to identify genes that may be involved
in speciation in this group of montane grasshoppers. Together, these studies
will reveal the relative contribution and strengths of factors that cause
species diversification. This information will also be essential for determining
how these grasshoppers were able to undergo a striking evolutionary radiation
during the dynamic Pleistocene when diversification in other organisms was
apparently inhibited by the climatic fluctuations accompanying the glacial
cycles.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Graduate and undergraduate students will be
trained not only in technical aspects of collecting genomic data, but also in
recent analytical advances. Incorporation of this research into workshops,
courses, and seminars will provide a pedagogical tool integral for illustrating
how longstanding debates about species diversification can be addressed when
such questions are studied in a rigorous statistical framework. Lastly, valuable
specimens will be added to the Museum of Zoology's insect collection at the
University of Michigan, making them available to other researchers.&lt;br/&gt;
