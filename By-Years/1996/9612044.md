9612044 This work is an investigation of non-Fourier conduction in
heterogeneous media. The possibility of the existence of thermal waves with
relatively long relaxation times will be explored. The wave-like behavior may
arise from the contact resistance and the differing thermal masses of the
material constituents. Theoretical models will be used to identify
characteristics of the microstructure likely to enhance or inhibit wave
behavior. These models will be validated against experiments to systematically
demonstrate the expected phenomena. Materials to be explored include porous
media, composite media, food products, powders, and biological materials.
Applications are expected in tumor and cell destruction, freezing and
cryopreservation of biological materials, freeze-drying technology and the
setting of adhesives.
