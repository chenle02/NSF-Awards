This grant will support a cooperative effort with the Mathematical Society of
Japan and other Japanese funding sources to hold the International Summer School
and Conference on Schubert Calculus from July 17-27, 2012, in Osaka, Japan.
Schubert calculus is a wide-ranging mathematical discipline that blends many
fields. It has been used to solve problems in computational geometry,
optimization, mathematical biology, and cryptography, among other important
applications. While Japanese mathematicians are not very active in Schubert
calculus, many are experts in closely related fields. The conference will bring
US researchers and open problems in Schubert calculus to Japan, and bring
specialized Japanese expertise and techniques to questions in Schubert calculus;
this synergy has the potential to transform the field. NSF funds will be used to
support travel and limited local expenses for about 20 US mathematicians at
early stages in their careers, when the potential impact on their mathematical
development is highest.

This conference will foster mathematical leadership in the next generation of
researchers, and also encourage established researchers into the the field, via
educational programs like the summer school and resulting publications (online,
video, and traditional conference proceedings). The conference webpage is
