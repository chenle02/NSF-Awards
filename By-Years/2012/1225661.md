This RAPID project proposes a model for preparing K-12 teachers to implement the
new Framework for next generation science standards. The model is based on
current evidence of effective professional development in disciplinary content
and will also develop evidence in a rapid fashion about its potential
effectiveness that will be used to refine and improve the model in time for it
to be disseminated widely to networks of teacher educators, curriculum leaders
and others as states begin to adopt the new standards.

Specifically the model will support teachers in developing understanding of
"core ideas" and how to blend core ideas with scientific practices and
crosscutting concepts to develop learning goals; modify existing materials; and
developing learning tasks and assessment measures that meet learning goals.

The recently released National Research Council Framework for K-12 science
education provides the basis for standards development. It is anticipated that
Achieve will take about a year to develop the standards. This project will
develop, test, and refine a model of professional development related to the
standards that will be one of the factors essential to successful
implementation.
