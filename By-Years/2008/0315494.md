Kenneth S. Suslick, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is supported by
the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for continuing
studies of the chemical effects of high intensity ultrasound. Suslick is
conducting detailed studies of acoustic cavitation and also applying
sonochemistry to the synthesis of advanced materials. Sonoluminescence will be
used as a spectroscopic probe of reaction conditions and kinetics during
sonication. These physical studies will be extended to new solvent systems,
including common organic solvents and ionic liquids. Sonochemistry will also be
used to prepare new transition metal colloids from organometallic precursors,
hydrodesulfurization catalysts and hydrocarbon reforming catalysts. A new method
for generating nanometer-sized particles, ultrasonic spray pyrolysis, will be
developed and applied to the production of semiconductor chalcogenides and
ceramics.

High intensity ultrasound is used in industrial and microelectronics processes,
for welding, emulsification, dispersion and cleaning. It is also increasingly
used to effect unique chemical transformations induced by the high temperatures
and pressures present in bubbles as they collapse when liquids are irradiated
with high intensity ultrasound. Students trained by this project will have
unique and valuable experience in this important new chemical process.
