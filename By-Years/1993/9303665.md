Disseminated sulfide mineralization at the Babbitt Cu-Ti-Ni- PGE deposit of the
Duluth Complex is found within iron-and titanium-rich gabbroic rocks that occur
near the contact with metasedimentary rocks of the underlying Virginia
Formation. In order to evaluate possible metal sources Re- Os and Pb isotopic
studies are planned. These two isotopic systems will provide direct evidence as
to the relative importance of crustal or mantle sources of metals Mechanisms of
metal-enrichment will be evaluated by tracing chemical variations that accompany
fractional crystallization, crustal assimilation, magma recharge, and magma
mixing. The addition of crustal sulfur at Duluth is thought to be a prime reason
for the differences in what may be a continuum between sulfide-rich and sulfide-
poor, oxide- apatite rocks. Because of the chemical similarities a comparative
study with Fe-Ti-P-rich rocks from the St. Urbain and Labrieville anorthosite
complexes in Quebec is planned. Results will aid our understanding of
similarities and differences between mineralization in layered intrusions,
subvolcanic intrusives, and massif-type anorthosites and related rocks.
