This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will synthesize a C3N4
phase and develop a method to stabilize the C3N4 films. The hardest material
which can be synthesized is based on a combination of B, C, and N. However,
materials and compounds based on these elements are metastable at standard
pressures and temperatures. Therefore, one needs a novel, non-equilibrium method
to process and synthesize them. The firm has developed such methods, including
ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD) and deposition from electron cyclotron
resonance (ECR). (C3N4 should be harder than diamond. The synthesis of C-N films
with a hardness about half that of diamond and a smoothness of about 0.5 nm has
been documented. These films were adherent on most substrates, including steel
and magnetic thin-film materials (as in computer disks), however, no direct
evidence of a carbon nitride phase was demonstrated. IBAD is an advanced, low-
temperature, thin-film deposition process combining evaporation with
simultaneous ion bombardment; it is capable of depositing adherent films on
virtually any substrate. The Phase I project will deposit carbon nitride films
using IBAD with an ionized-vapor source for carbon. Ionizing both carbon and
nitrogen would enhance the probability of forming carbon nitride films. Stress
is the major obstacle in the formation of thick films with the theoretically
expected hardness value; stress reduction will be addressed by a number of
methods, including the introduction of a third element such as boron. A process
designed to deposit super-hard films on essentially any shape substrate has
extremely high commercial promise. Carbon nitride films are inexpensive,
extremely hard and scratch resistant, and easily applied to metal surfaces or
polymers.
