Abstract Zuk 9514055 This project will examine the ways in which the sexes
differ in both behavior and physiology, concentrating on the role of variation
among females in determining the out come of sexual selection, and a definition
of male quality that can be used to assess condition or vigor under a wide range
of circumstances. By examining female behavior and morphology, and by using
indices of immunocompetence to analyze male quality, the research will extend
knowledge of universal, a measure of condition or quality which reflects immune
system competence is clearly linked to an individual s fitness. Using captive
red jungle fowl, the work builds on previous studies showing that females prefer
to mate with males with large, colorful combs, and that infection of males with
an intestinal parasite hampers the development of the same characters used by
females in choosing mates. In addition, highly ornamented individuals, have
fewer circulating lymphocytes, suggesting that such males pay a price in terms
of reduced immune competence by appearance, and immune response, and will
integrate basic and applied research in behavior and immunology. The outcome
will be a better understanding of how behavior, including aggressive behavior
and stressful experiences, is reflected in immune system parameters that are
relevant to the health of all animals.
