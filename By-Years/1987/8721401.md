Within convergent orogenic belts, significant amounts of synchronous extension
and compression in the same direction are not generally observed. However, it
has been recently recognized that East-West striking, gently north-dipping
normal faults of regional extent exist in and north of the High Himalayas and in
Ladakh. These are forming at the same time the entire region is undergoing
compression. This project is continuation of a study to document these faults by
mapping and subsequent analysis of timing, sense of motion and displacement.
Results are expected to provide data necessary to interpret and construct
dynamic models of the role of normal faults in continental collision tectonic
situations. This work is cooperative with the Chengdu Institute of Geology and
Mineral Resources and the Ministry of Geology in Beijing.
