*** 9731882 Cassel The Laboratory of Nuclear Studies at Cornell University will
initiate an NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates Site. This project will
provide undergraduate students with the excitement and challenge of frontline
research in elementary particle physics and accelerator physics. The NSF-
supported Laboratory has an international reputation for research and graduate
education and a unique constellation of research programs including experimental
and theoretical elementary particle physics, accelerator physics, microwave
superconductivity, instrumentation for scientific research, and high performance
computing. The REU Site program builds on the Laboratory's long tradition of
successfully involving undergraduate students in research and extends research
opportunities to much wider group of students. The REU program emphasizes
providing research experience for women, minority students, and students from
institutions with limited research programs. Although this research is focused
on understanding fundamental physics, the techniques and technologies utilized
are applicable in a much wider range of scientific research. ***
