The 2016 Yamabe Memorial Symposium will be held from Friday to Sunday, September
30-October 2, 2016, at the School of Mathematics, on the Minneapolis campus of
the University of Minnesota. One goal will be, as a way to honor the memory of
Hidehiko Yamabe, to advance areas of mathematics related to his interests, which
touched in a substantial and ground-breaking way on several quite different
areas of mathematics, all of which may be roughly described as having
significant geometric aspects. At the same time, it will provide a valuable
opportunity for graduate students and junior researchers to interact with, and
learn from, mathematicians working at the highest international level. Finally,
a long-lasting benefit will be the stimulation of innovative developments in
mathematics research.

This year is the eighth anniversary of the Yamabe program, on the theme of
"Symplectic Geometry and Complex Geometry." Eight experts in this area will be
invited to speak. It will be a high-level conference on aspects of symplectic
geometry, complex geometry, contact structures and the interactions between
these and related areas. The purpose of this Symposium is to bring to our
participants deeper understanding of some recent discoveries in those areas, and
to bring to the fore new issues that have arisen in light of them. The new
understanding will encourage participants to gain a wider perspective of the
recently found deep connections between symplectic and complex geometry.
Potentially, this knowledge will inspire further discoveries in these and
related fields. Details of the Yamabe Symposium are at
