9705137 Blatchley This is an award to support research to determine conditions
under which Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts, Giardia lamblia cysts, several
bacterial pathogens and coliphage MS-2 in aqueous suspension are inactivated
when subjected to gamma radiation. The inactivation experiments will be
conducted in batch reactors using a Cobalt 60 source. Conditions to be studied
include the influence of carbonate alkalinity and dissolved oxygen on the
inactivation process. The potential toxicological effects of gamma radiation on
organic substances in water will be studied by subjecting samples of untreated
water from public water supply sources and treated water prior to conventional
disinfection processes to radiation from the gamma source. Organic substances
from these water samples prior to and following radiation will be concentrated
using exchange resins and the mutagenicity of these concentrates will be
determined by use of the Ames test procedure. Results of this research are
expected to provide guidance for potential engineering design of processes using
sources of gamma radiation to disinfect water and wastewater. In addition to
providing a process for inactivation of pathogens and destruction of organic
contaminants, environmental technologies based on use of ionizing radiation for
disinfection of water and wastewater have the potential for avoidance and
prevention of pollution by providing beneficial uses for products derived from
high level radioactive wastes. ***
