In this project funded by the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Cynthia J.
Burrows of the Chemistry Department at State University of New York at Stony
Brook will study "Biomimetic Oxidation Chemistry". Biological mechanisms of
hydrocarbon oxidation and halogenation will provide the basis for the design of
new transition metal catalysts for these processes. The oxidation of organic
substrates using metal catalysts is of great importance to the petrochemical
industry, especially since oxygen-containing compounds (primarily ethers) will
have great impact on the gasoline industry. Mechanistic studies are underway in
order to characterize the roles of nickel and the ligand in the catalytic
epoxidation of alkenes with a terminal oxidant. New macrocyclic ligands will
allow the investigation of asymmetric induction in reactions with alkenes. These
experiments will seek to distinguish between the intermediacy of metal oxo
species versus electron transfer mechanisms. Mechanistic information will be
applied to the design of new oxidative transformations based on radical
cyclization or ring opening reactions. Related group transfer reactions such as
aziridination and cyclopropanation will be investigated, as well as other metal
complexes.
