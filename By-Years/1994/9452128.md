9452128 Miyamoto A digital scanning electron microscope (SEM), with energy
dispersive x-ray spectrometer (EDS) and equipped to do image acquisition,
enhancement and analysis, will be linked to an existing academic local area
network (LAN). With this system we will engage our students in the use of an up-
to-date instrument that uses digital technology to acquire and analyze images.
We will develop a pedagogical sequence that develops student abilities in
handling a complex instrument system in a step-wise fashion. Beginning with an
introduction to the concepts of electron microscopy and imaging in a first year
foundational biology module, we progress to applying this instrumentation to
compare different kinds of cultured cells in a second year biology module. Upper
level biology and chemistry classes complete the sequence by providing students
the opportunity to learn and extensively use a number of advanced applications
in different settings. In this fashion we give our students a gateway exposure
to imaging applications that have become pivotal for research and analysis in
biology, chemistry, and medicine.
