Funds are requested to partially support a workshop to be held at the Laboratory
of Mechanics of CNRS, Paris-Cachan, during the summer of 1988. The purpose of
the workshop is to assess the current status of research in strain localization
and size effect caused by cracking and damage in brittle materials. The workshop
will provide a forum for an in-depth discussion of the frontiers of research in
this field. The workshop will be attended by several leaders in the field and
will result in recommendations for future directions in this important research
area. Improvements in the understanding of strain localization and size effects
due to damage and cracking is essential for further progress in the modeling of
failure in concrete structures, geotechnical engineering, mining, design of two-
phase ceramic composites and many other problems of materials and structural
engineering. Professor Bazant is uniquely qualified to organize and chair this
workshop. An award is recommended.
