Research will be carried out in cosmology and theoretical elementary particle
physics. The main theme of this research will concern the nature and
distribution of the dark matter that makes up most of the mass of the universe.
This will be explored in a variety of contexts, ranging from implications of
particle physics theories of the origin of the universe to studies of the
formation and evolution of galaxies and large scale structure in the Universe.
An emphasis will be placed on developing predictions that can be tested by
comparison with the rapidly increasing data. The ultimate goal of all this work
is to contribute toward the creation of a fundamental theory of the origin,
evolution, and matter content of the universe. Along the way, improved methods
will be developed for working out the predictions of cosmological models and
comparing them to observations, including state- of-the-art supercomputer
simulation and visualization techniques. These techniques will be used for
education and outreach as well, and will be made widely available so that other
theorists and observers can use them.
