This proposal is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of surface chemical kinetic studies. The efforts of two
investigators, Drs. John Hemminger and Robert McIver, are combined to utilize a
new approach previously developed involving laser induced thermal desorption of
transient species during a chemical reaction, and their detection by Fourier
transform mass spectrometry. The key advantage of this method is the ability to
detect multiple species simultaneously. The method will be used to study the
kinetics of transformation of hydrocarbon molecules coadsorbed with heteroatom
containing molecules as a function of concentration and coverage at well
characterized single crystal surfaces. In particular, the studies using the
laser induced thermal desorption-Fourier transform mass spectrometry method will
focus on three projects. The first involves the study of collective phenomena
involving two coadsorbates on platinum ı111! as a function of coverage. The
second involves complex tranformations such as dehydrocyclization of simple
alkanes and alkenes over catalytically relevent single crystal surfaces. The
third project will focus on the effects of bismuth postdosing to block specific
surface chemical sites on the adsorbate, thereby examining the influence of such
blockage on transformation kinetics of ethylene to ethylidyne on Ptı111!.
