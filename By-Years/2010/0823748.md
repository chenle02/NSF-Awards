This funding is to support the travel of approximately 10 US scientists and
researchers to present papers at the fourth international workshop and
conference on thermal, fluid and interfacial phenomena in physico-chemical,
materials and bio- processes. Problems of materials processing, nanotechnologies
and drug delivery as well as space technologies will be addressed. The
conference will be held at the Tokyo University of Science campus on October
21-23, 2008. These scientists will represent a broad base of research funded by
NSF, through its chemical thermal and fluids division. Scientists from various
countries will be able to discuss their research and foster collaboration for
future work. The scientists will represent academia, industry and government
research and this collaboration will therefore benefit the cooperative science
programs between the US and other countries as well as university industry
collaboration. The proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer
Verlag, which has an electronic publishing format aside from a book format.
Thus, the research ideas will be widely disseminated via libraries and the
electronic media making a broad impact on the community of scientists and
engineers. The published research ideas and discussions will encourage future
novel research and fresh perspectives on problems of technological content.
