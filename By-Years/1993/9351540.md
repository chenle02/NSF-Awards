9351540 Nemotko The objective of this project is to establish inquiry-based
laboratories in anatomy and physiology utilizing a technologically based
instructional support system. The physiological measurement instrumentation
requested, in conjunction with computer equipment and software already available
at the college, will enable students to collect and analyze data and to
investigate the effects of chosen variables on muscle, pulmonary and
cardiovascular physiology. The curriculum to be instituted will require students
to select variables, conduct literature searches, formulate hypotheses,
determine appropriate experimental designs, collect and analyze data and report
on results obtained. ***
