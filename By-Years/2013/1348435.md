The Annual Meeting of the Association for Education Communications and
Technology (AECT) provides a forum for interchange of ideas around designing
technological support for learning and training. Its Early Career Symposia
provide an avenue for early career scholars to receive mentoring from
established researchers.

This project supports travel for advanced graduate students and new faculty from
U.S. universities to attend the Annual Meeting and Early Career Symposium.
Sessions during the Symposium are designed to help collaborators imagine
forward-looking and viable technology-oriented research agendas, identify the
types of collaborators who complement their strengths, and identify the funding
agencies and programs that might support their work. An important goal of the
Symposium is to add to the community of researchers interested in ways that
technology can transform teaching and learning.

This activity supports the mission of NSF to train more advanced professionals
in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. This conference
is one among many that researchers in the cyberlearning community regularly
attend. Mentors come from the AECT community as well as from the learning
sciences community.
