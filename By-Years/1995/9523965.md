Abstract ATM-9523965 King, Teresa University of Rhode Island Title: The Role of
Nonlinear Interactions in Major Glaciation This award supports a study that will
make use of a set of well- documented time series of climate system proxies in
order to quantify the role of nonlinear climate system interactions in
glaciation cycles. There are two related objectives: first, to quantify the
extent to which variations between surface and deep ocean proxy data are
spatially and temporally coherent during the Pleistocene, independent of orbital
forcing; second, to objectively discriminate between linearly forced,
nonlinearly coupled, and free, or internal, unforced variations. An additional
benefit of this research effort will be a data archive resulting from the
assembly of these many proxy time series.
