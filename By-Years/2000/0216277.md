With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Martin Kirk
and colleagues at the University of New Mexico will acquire a combined
X-band/Q-band CW EPR/ENDOR spectrometer. Projects that will exploit this
instrument include a) studies of molybdoenzymes and relevant model complexes; b)
research on thermally induced charge transfer materials; c) the use of cobalt as
a spectroscopic probe of zinc sites in metalloproteins; d) spectroscopic studies
of high symmetry cobalt coordination compounds; and e) biophysical studies of
photosynthetic water oxidation and iron regulation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer is an instrument used to
obtain information about the molecular and electronic structure of molecules. It
may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals
which are often essential for the initiation of tumor growth and/or a variety of
chemical reactions. These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, in
particular biological chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
