The Dragonfly project consists of a new technique to image gas surrounding
galaxies. Galaxies similar to the Milky Way will be observed so as to better
understand this "circumgalactic medium". To do this, the Dragonfly instrument
will be upgraded with a new user interface and remote control. This user
interface and remote control lend themselves very well to classroom teaching and
demonstrations. Up to 10% of the time on Dragonfly will be devoted to projects
proposed by high school students. Dragonfly data and imagery will be used to
create a short program developed with the Leitner Planetarium, connecting the
public to the night sky and emphasizing dark sky preservation efforts.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator has developed a new technique
to image the distribution of ionized gas in the universe with unprecedented
sensitivity, building on the concept of a distributed-aperture telescope. His
team uses a tiltable ultra-narrow interference filter in front of the entrance
pupil of a telescope, creating a tunable filter with very high sensitivity and
no degradation of the bandpass. The immediate goal of the project is to develop
the prototype, through a program of calibrations, hardware refinements, and
software development. More broadly, the aim is to lay the groundwork for future
studies of the circumgalactic medium with upgraded arrays. This facility will be
able to directly reveal the ionized gas distributions in which galaxies are
embedded, providing the ionizing flux as well as key physical information on
metallicities, shocks, and bulk velocities. This program will provide end-to-end
training and learning environment for graduate students, who will gain
invaluable experience in instrument design, optics, detectors, computer control,
data analysis, “big data” aspects, as well as training in the
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
