Dr. Martin Kirk has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Kirk's doctoral degree was from The University of North Carolina
under the supervision of Professor William Hatfield. Dr. Kirk intends to
continue research at Stanford University under the sponsorship of Professor
Edward Solomon. Dr. Kirk's area of research will be physical-inorganic studies
which relate the activity of transition metal ions in protein active-sites to
their geometry and structure. Long range, he will study biomimetic manganese
complexes related to the oxygen-evolving centers in Photosystem-II. His
postdoctoral studies on the behavior of iron-sulfur clusters related to
ferridoxins will facilitate his future research. The Postdoctoral Fellowships in
Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to
broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
