This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site will inspire students
with the possibilities inherent in multi-disciplinary research in robotics. They
will complete the program excited about continuing to do research in robotics,
having the necessary tools to successfully transition to graduate-level
research, and achieve further academic progress and research at their home
institutions. Robotics is a multi-disciplinary field ranging from mechanical
design, to understanding physical systems, to exploring human-robot interaction.
This array of skills makes it both a challenging and exciting field of study for
many undergraduates, but exploiting that appeal can be challenging for a small
institution because of the inherent infrastructure cost. This site is
particularly targeted at academic institutions that do not have extensive
robotics infrastructure, and to enable students at those institutions to both
successfully compete for graduate positions and bring back robotics culture to
their home institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design of this REU site
contains a number of programmatic elements designed to teach undergraduates how
to approach research, what life as a graduate student is like, and how to write
solid graduate applications. Broadly speaking, the research in robotics focuses
on physical robots operating in the real world, and the challenges inherent in
designing, building, controlling, and interacting with them in complex
environments. One intangible but important benefit to a summer REU program is
networking - meeting students with similar interests who, potentially, will go
on to graduate school in related areas, and even, long-term, into faculty
positions. This site has several mechanisms to support the creation of these
networks, from peer-to-peer mentoring and shared activities through longer-term
social networking tools. These long-term relationships will help to form multi-
disciplinary bridges in the next generation of researchers in robotics.
