9633596 Ludwig While much progress has been made in understanding equilibrium
phase diagrams, transformation kinetics has been more difficult to calculate or
simulate with quantitative accuracy. This is particularly true when there are
complicating factors such as long-period superlattice phases and coupling
between strain and ordering. By combining synchrotron-based-time-resolved x-ray
scattering capabilities with recently-developed binding energy calculations and
supercomputer technology significant advances can be made. State-of-the-art
energy calculations in Monte-Carlo simulations are used to understand, and
predict, complex ordering kinetics as observed by time- resolved x-ray
diffraction. The calculations allow for local relaxation of atoms off their
ideal lattice sites as well as global lattice relaxation and symmetry change.
The focus is on the classic CuAu alloy, which possesses ordered and modulated
phases as well as a lattice symmetry change upon ordering. Other important
issues to be investigated include the presence of separate ordering spinodals
for modulated and ordered phases, formation kinetics of the ordered phase from
the modulated phase, and the coupling between strain and order. In addition to
CuAu alloys, other systems which exhibit long-period superlattice phases will be
investigated, in particular Ti-Al alloys which exhibit a devil's staircase of
modulated phases. %%% Ordering kinetics in many alloys is complicated by the
presence of long-range superlattice phases and/or changes in lattice constant
and symmetry. Understanding the changes in such systems is a major challenge to
materials scientists. ***
