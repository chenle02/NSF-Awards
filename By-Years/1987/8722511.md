The overall purpose of this project is to develop and test a new approach that
links psychological, sociological, and technical aspects of risk assessment. The
study will examine processes through which hazards interact with social and
cultural factors to amplify or attenuate public responses to risk. The specific
objectives of the project are (1) to integrate different social responses to
risk events into a coherent theory of risk amplification, and (2) to examine
patterns of risk amplification across a diverse set of hazards and event
scenarios, based on a detailed review of case studies. Despite the importance of
integrative approaches to risk assessment, little research has been directed
toward developing a systematic approach that takes into account the broader
social and cultural implications of a risk event. This innovative project will
both develop a theoretical basis for this integration and validate the approach
using case studies. It is expected that the results of the study will contribute
to the development of better understanding of why some risk events are amplified
and others not, and provide risk analysts and decision makers with a more
comprehensive basis for addressing difficult risk problems.
