This research program combines the areas of topology, noncommutative geometry,
and mathematical physics. One focus of this proposal will be on applications of
topology and noncommutative geometry to duality in string theory, in order to
understand topological constraints on dualities between string theories on
different spacetime backgrounds, and also to understand situations where duality
leads to a field theory on a noncommutative space. Another major area of
investigation will be the use of invariants from noncommutative geometry and
index theory for studying the geometry and topology of manifolds and of
manifold-like spaces, such as manifolds with singularities. Rosenberg will also
use methods of geometric analysis and differential topology to study the
topology of the space of Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature on a
manifold, in both low and high dimensions. Finally, the PI will continue
preparation of course materials for the use of mathematical software in
sophomore-level science/engineering courses in multivariable calculus and
differential equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The interaction between mathematics
(especially geometry) and physics has been a long and fruitful one for both
disciplines. This project will advance that interaction, by relying on physics
to suggest interesting topics of study in geometry, and using our understanding
of geometry to put restrictions on fundamental physical theories. Broader
impacts of this project will include (a) mentoring of graduate and undergraduate
students, (b) development of materials and courses for the training of
undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs, and (c) dissemination of
research in geometry and mathematical physics to a wide audience.
