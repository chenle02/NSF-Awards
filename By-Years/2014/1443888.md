Of the estimated 1.8 million named species of organisms on Earth, many are
becoming or are already extinct. This vast biodiversity is documented in
millions of research specimens housed in the collections of natural history
museums, universities, and botanical gardens. These collections are an untapped
source of knowledge that is critical for research, education, and decision-
making about the environment, public health, food security, and commerce;
however, most collections data is underutilized because it is not accessible
electronically. This project will administer an NSF innovation inducement prize
that will engage a broad community to develop pioneering technologies for
automated digitization of biological specimens.

The challenge is to digitize pinned insect collections, one of the most daunting
tasks confronting the digitization of biological collections. Developing fully
automated approaches will likely require the design and deployment of robotic 3D
digital imaging instruments, image-capture software, advanced optical character
recognition methods, metadata integration, and workflow optimization. Beyond
collections digitization, the technologies developed for this prize should have
national value in their wider application to research, education, and
manufacturing. The American Institute of Biological Sciences will administer the
prize and will convene an interdisciplinary committee of expert volunteers to
develop the prize criteria and judge the entries. A prestigious prize
competition mechanism has the potential to create new partnerships and
transformative technologies. Additionally, the prize will inform the public
about science and engineering research areas that are important to the NSF and
the Nation.
