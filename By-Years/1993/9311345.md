The project will investigate the possibility of identifying or formulating a
ceramic sol-gel system which will gel when irradiated by laser radiation. The
aim is to test the feasibility of developing a system that can employ a
modification of conventional stereo lithography equipment to produce rapid
prototypes of ceramic materials utilizing the sol-gel process. Existing
techniques for the rapid prototyping of ceramics, such as Selective Laser
Sintering and Three-Dimensional Printing yield porous and low strength ceramic
bodies, whereas the sol-gel process has the potential to produce ceramic bodies
with good strength. The prototyping and testing process represents a major cost
of developing applications for ceramic components. If high strength ceramic
components can be rapidly produced and tested using the researched technique,
the utilization of ceramics in industrial components may be greatly facilitated.
