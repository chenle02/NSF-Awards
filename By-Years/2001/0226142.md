Funds from this award will support exploratory research for the
rapid&lt;br/&gt;development of novel cryogenic scintillators. This project has
special&lt;br/&gt;urgency because of the potential broad application of
these&lt;br/&gt;scintillators to a variety of established research topics, such
as the&lt;br/&gt;observation of low energy solar neutrinos and the detection of
cosmic&lt;br/&gt;dark matter. If these scintillators work as well as expected,
the&lt;br/&gt;impact of this work on the field of non-accelerator particle
physics&lt;br/&gt;would be profound and immediate. The proposed cryogenic
scintillator&lt;br/&gt;would consist of liquid or solid neon, possibly doped
with a small&lt;br/&gt;amount (1%) of xenon. Condensed neon holds special
promise for&lt;br/&gt;low-background measurements, but its scintillation yield
and optical&lt;br/&gt;properties have received scant attention in the
past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
