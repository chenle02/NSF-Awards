Information Science and Systems (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As a
National Security Agency designated Center of Academic Excellence in Information
Assurance Education, the Center for Cyberspace Research (CCR) produces highly
qualified cyber-professionals through its graduate educational program and
research. The center has the unique ability to develop cyber-professionals with
a thorough understanding of the special requirements of both Government and
Department of Defense (DoD) cyber-operations. Performance from the original SFS
grant has been outstanding: 100% internship placement rate, 100% on-time or
early completion rate, and a 100% post-graduation placement rate.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposal has several facets:
(1) the program is distinctive for its focus on offensive and defensive cyber-
operations; (2) there is an emphasis on both theory and application; (3) there
is an emphasis on technical solutions to cyberspace issues in our curriculum and
research; (4) the center possesses a unique capability to conduct classified
research; and (5) the curriculum and research is focused on both government
computer and network operations as well as civilian critical infrastructures.
Students learn state-of-the-art cyber-technology as well as how to investigate
and solve difficult problems in the area. The curriculum is regularly updated to
stay abreast of the latest technical advancements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access
to secure research facilities enables students to work on exciting and
challenging research topics in cyberspace. These topics and facilities coupled
with close ties to the Air Force and government research agencies provide a
strong research and educational experience. Students work closely with faculty
to defend national information systems and networks against exploitation while
exploiting the weaknesses of adversaries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduates are
placed in positions that foster growth within the government through mentoring.
Their unique educational experience gives them immediately useful knowledge into
both best practices as well as vulnerabilities of information infrastructure.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program graduates have a broad impact on the Federal,
State, and local cyber-workforce. There is broad dissemination of research
results. In 2008, CCR published 74 journal and conference papers based on
student research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is engaged in a
collaborative effort with faculty at a neighboring community college and at an
HBCU. Undergraduate students at these institutions are mentored as part of a
summer intern program as they work on cyber-related projects.
