This symposium will be modeled on the Frontiers of Science symposium series
organized by the National Academy of Sciences. The meeting will be designed to
bring together a select group of the nation's best young engineers from
industry, academia, and government to discuss pioneering technical work and
leading edge research in various engineering fields and industry sectors. The
goal of the symposium is to introduce the nation's outstanding young engineers
to each other, and through this interaction facilitate collaboration in
engineering and the transfer of new techniques and approaches across fields.
