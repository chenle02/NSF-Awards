Conventional financial and macroeconomic models have been demonstrated to be of
limited utility in either forecasting, limiting, or remedying the current
financial downturn. This workshop will focus on complexity-theoretic
alternatives to traditional DSGE macroeconomic models. Specifically, agent-based
approaches for building large-scale, distributed models of economic phenomena at
the country-level will be highlighted. Attendees will discuss priorities for
basic research to make progress toward useful models most expeditiously and
explore plans for coordinating to develop next-generation modeling of economies.
Participants will come from economics and finance, computer science and multi-
agent systems, and physics, as well as public and private sector model users.

Even a slight improvement in our ability to model the economy would have
valuable implications for better policy making and mroe robust economies. Also:
methodological advances in complexity modeling that apply to economies will also
be useful for modeling other important complex entities, like political systems,
organizational systems, and systems.
