9321213 Calkin This award is for a three year study to investigate the subarctic
climatic history as recorded largely in the tree-ring record and to precisely
date glacial fluctuations of ice tongues terminating in, and occuring at, the
margins of the deep, 50-km long fjords of Yakutat and Icy Bays of southeastern
coastal Alaska. Chronologies drawn from 500 to 900 year old living trees cross-
dated with logs of buried forests at multiple sites in each of the fjords, will
provide the main basis for climatic reconstruction over the last two millenia.
Climatic and glacial series together are expected to yield the first sound basis
for testing response of fjord glaciers to climate change. ***
