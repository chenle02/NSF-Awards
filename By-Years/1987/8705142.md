Equipment funds are provided to purchase two Explorer Workstations, two
processors, mass storage, one Business Pro Personal Computer, and one Laser
Printer. Research in the applications of artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies--especially knowledge-based (expert) systems--to engineering will
be conducted. These AI technologies will be seen as providing ways to better
engineering analysis and design. Three particular research projects will
benefit. The first is the development of an expert system to assist architects
and engineers as they check building designs to ensure that they meet code
requirements, in this case the Life Safety Code of the NFPA. The second project
entails a feasibility study of the use of knowledge-based systems as assistants
when complicated finite element programs are exercised for both analysis and
design. The last project described explores the role of distributed expertise in
engineering design through the interaction of concurrently executing expert
systems.
