With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the College of St. Scholastica will acquire a
gradient high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) and Fourier-transform
infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. This equipment will enable investigations of
stereoselective nitroaldol (Henry) reactions.

High performance liquid chromatography is an extremely powerful technique used
for the separation and analysis of complex mixtures. A Fourier transform
infrared spectrometer is a veritable workhorse in the modern chemical laboratory
and can provide important information about molecular and electronic structure.
This research should add to the field of synthetic chemistry and it will teach
and train undergraduates in the area of synthetic chemistry and in the operation
of HPLC and FTIR instruments.
