Abstract: The purpose of the conferences that are held under the title "Young
Analysts Meeting of the Southeast (YAMS) and the Southeastern Analysis Meeting"
is to provide a forum for young mathematicians to gather and exchange
information about recent discoveries in mathematics, with a focus on analysis in
general and functional analysis in particular. It is the goal of YAMS to
introduce the next generation of analysts in the southeastern region of the U.S.
-- graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty -- to the existing community of
operator theorists and functional analysts in that part of the country, thereby
establishing contacts that will be of help to members of the younger generation
in their mathematical development. The duration of a typical YAMS conference is
five or six days. The program is normally built around a principal speaker, who
delivers a series of five or six hour-long lectures. Talks by ten senior and ten
junior invited speakers of lengths 40 and 30 minutes, respectively, fill out the
program. The YAMS organizers make special efforts to attract recent Ph.D.s and
graduate students as participants in the conferences. Their hope is that YAMS
will provide a unique opportunity for graduate students and more experienced
researchers alike to gain valuable exposure to some of the exciting advances in
the operator theory/operator algebras field.

The Southeastern Analysis Meeting (SEAM) has been held annually at numerous
venues in the region for the past fifteen years, in most cases with the help of
partial support from the NSF. The purpose of the meeting is to encourage the
interchange of the latest developments and ideas in various areas of analysis,
with special attention directed to the mathematical development of junior
faculty and graduate students.
