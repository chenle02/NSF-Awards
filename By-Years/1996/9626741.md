9626741 Lu The University-Industry Cooperative Research Programs in the
Mathematical Sciences are programs designed to establish a mechanism for
exchange of mathematical scientists between academia and industry at different
stages of their careers. These programs will strengthen the links between
industry and academia and identify and encourage new avenues of research in the
mathematical sciences. The University-Industry Postdoctoral Research Fellowships
provide two years of support for recent recipients of doctoral degrees in the
mathematical sciences. These awards are a means of contributing to the future
vitality of the scientific effort of the nation. The postdoctoral fellow will
work closely with scientific advisors from both academia and industry. The
postdoctoral fellow will work under the direction of Paul A. Brinkley at
Northern Telecom and Jye-Chyi Lu at North Carolina State University. The
research involves the development of a supervisory process control system to
improve production quality of digital wireless communications equipment. The
research involves statistical modeling using a spatial random coefficients
model.
