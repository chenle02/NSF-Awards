DMS-0204763&lt;br/&gt;Kenneth Bromberg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator
plans to study spaces of hyperbolic metrics on a fixed&lt;br/&gt;3-manifold.
Unlike on a closed manifold, on an open 3-manifold there
will&lt;br/&gt;typically be a large space of hyperbolic metrics. The
investigators&lt;br/&gt;goal is to understand this space. Some questions are
simple to state:&lt;br/&gt;Is the deformation space the closure of its interior?
A more detailed&lt;br/&gt;description of the space is the ending lamination
conjecture,&lt;br/&gt;which gives invariants that classify every hyperbolic
metric on&lt;br/&gt;the manifold. This classification is not a parameterization;
the map to&lt;br/&gt;the space of invariants is not continuous. The investigator
is&lt;br/&gt;interested in understanding these discontinuities and describing
the&lt;br/&gt;topology of the deformation space of metrics. Hyperbolic cone-
metrics&lt;br/&gt;are a key tool used throughout this work. The philosophy is
that very&lt;br/&gt;complicated geometry in a smooth hyperbolic structure can be
exchanged&lt;br/&gt;for a less complicated, but singular, hyperbolic cone
metric.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three manifolds are mathematical spaces that
locally look like the&lt;br/&gt;universe we live in. Mathematicians, beginning
with Poincare, have been&lt;br/&gt;interested in classification question about
three manifolds. Hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;geometry is also a very old field dating
back to the middle of the&lt;br/&gt;eighteenth century. In the last twenty-five
years, largely due to the work&lt;br/&gt;Thurston, it has been realized that
there are deep and beautiful&lt;br/&gt;connections between the two
topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
