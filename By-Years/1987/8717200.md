Sputter deposited superconducting thin films of high critical temperature (Tc
&gt; 77 K) will be investigated. The particular structure to be studied will be
an MIS-like structure consisting of a semiconducting substrate (Si) and a tunnel
oxide (30 - 80 A thick), followed by a deposited layer of the superconductor.
Tunneling currents through the oxide and into the superconductor will act as a
probe of the electronic density of states in the superconducting material. The
anisotropic current flows in these thin film materials will be addressed and
particular attention will be paid to processing conditions which favor the
alignment of conducting layers parallel to the thin film. Measurements of the
magnetic properties of these materials will also be employed to study the
anisotropic properties of the films.
