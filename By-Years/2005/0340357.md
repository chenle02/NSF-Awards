This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is for a novel
methodology to produce nanodimensional formulation additives for use in the
passive components industry. Presently available materials are rapidly reaching
the point of diminishing return in terms of fired grain sizes, microstructural
control and electrical performance. Given the ever-increasing demands of the
electronics industry, novel solutions enabling next generation passive
components must be developed. Of particular interest to this work are dielectric
formulations for the multi-billion dollar multi-layered capacitor industry. The
utilization of a novel virion encapsulated nanopowder production technology to
produce formulation additives for this marketplace is proposed. Virion
encapsulation uses self-assembling protein cages as scaffolding for nanoparticle
production. Anticipated benefits of the research include the development of a
method to produce nanodimensional multi-metal oxides, development of a novel
nanodimensional dielectric system and definition of the processing window for
nanodimensional passive component production.

The technology being developed in this proposal is a direct application of
nanotechnology. Nanotechnology impacts the fundamental nature of the products it
enables. Objects become smaller, faster, stronger, lighter, possessing entirely
new properties and even combinations of properties not otherwise available. The
application of nanotechnology permits both the production of novel products and
entirely new manufacturing paradigms.
