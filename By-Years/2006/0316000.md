The foci of this research involve two areas. First, generally applicable
asymmetric acyl halide-aldehyde cyclocondensation variants involving substituted
ketene nucleophiles will be developed. Second, diastereoselective and
enantioselective variants of Ir(I)-catalyzed Claisen rearrangements will be
probed.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Scott G. Nelson in the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. Professor Nelson will
focus his research efforts on developing methodology for the catalytic
asymmetric synthesis of useful synthetic intermediates. The research has broader
impact for the pharmaceutical industry where the preparation of enantiomerically
pure compounds is crucial. Further, the project will provide an excellent arena
for the training of graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;
