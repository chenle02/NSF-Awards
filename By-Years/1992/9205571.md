The development of world fisheries recently has been characterized by rapid
expansion of total output and volume of trade. This has encouraged coastal
nations to expand the production capacity of their fisheries to service the
international market for marine products. This has led to an emphasis on growth
oriented comparative advantage approaches involving large-scale projects, modern
capital intensive technology, and heavy injections of foreign and national
capital. One result of this activity has been to transfer priority away from
production for local markets to production for international export. This
project examines how these global level economic processes have affected local
fishing communities in coastal India. Specifically, research will center on how
the introduction of large-scale mechanization and shifts in local production and
marketing priorities have affected petty traders in terms of their ability to
participate in the fish economy of two local communities in Kerala state. Data
will be collected through interviews, observations of market transactions and
activities, and from archival records. These data will form the basis of a
comparative study of market arrangements in the two districts before and after
the introduction of mechanized technology. The disruption of long established
local economies through their integration into the global economy has often had
profound effects on the livelihoods of local producers and traders. This
research will highlight these impacts in a region which is being rapidly
influenced by forces of change in the global fishing industry. It will merge
social and economic processes with spatial factors into a single analytical
framework for analysis of local variation in economic development as a direct
result of changes in the world economy.
