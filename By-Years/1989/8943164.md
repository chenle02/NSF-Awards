The goal of the Engineering Design Research Center at Carnegie Mellon
University is to provide the research and educational base for the development
and integration of design methodologies that will make U.S. industry preeminent
in design practice, improving: (1) marketability (or user acceptability), (2)
manufacturability (design ensures manufacturing quality and low cost), (3)
timeliness (short lead time from design to production and market). Researchers
in the Center are developing a morphology of design problems and approaches to
prescribe appropriate design methods, create new design methodologies for
quality, manufacturability and synthesis, and to integrate design tools into
effective design environments. Research projects are being pursued in the
different domains of manufacturing, electronics, chemical processes, and
architecture and civil engineering. These projects are integrated within three
laboratories: 1. Design for Manufacturing Laboratory, 2. Synthesis Laboratory,
3. Design Systems Laboratory. The issues in design research being addressed are
of national importance. Design capability has been and will be a critical factor
in economic competitiveness. Industrial participation from firms in many
different sectors, such as Chemicals Aerospace, Automotive, Computers,
Electronics, Construction, have helped the Center create important, empirically-
based research on design issues that occur in many different engineering
domains.
