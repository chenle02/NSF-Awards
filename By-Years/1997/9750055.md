Abstract DBI 9750055 Belinda Chang This action funds an NSF/Alfred P. Sloan
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1997. These
fellowships support studies involving the theoretical, comparative,
computational, and/or experimental analyses of biological patterns and processes
at the molecular level within the framework of organismic evolutionary change
and adaptation. These studies also include the use of molecular data to address
broader evolutionary questions. Each fellowship supports a research and training
plan to be carried out in a sponsoring laboratory. The research and training
plan for this fellowship is entitled "Reconstructing ancestral pigment proteins
in vitro to investigate the molecular evolution of wavelength sensitivity."
Visual pigments called opsins are components in vision and display a wide range
of wavelength sensitivities. The evolution of vertebrate cone visual pigments is
being studied by constructing a phylogeny, expressing artificially synthesized
genes in vitro, and measuring absorption spectra of the resulting opsins.
Knowledge gained on the evolutionary history of opsin wavelength sensitivity
will be used to assess hypotheses concerning the biochemical mechanisms of
shifts in wavelength sensitivity.
