With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division,
Professor King, of the Chemistry Department at the University of Nevada Reno,
will investigate the synthesis and properties of a new class of helical and
linear graphite strips. These new materials will include a family of chiral
helical polymers, graphite strips consisting of benzene rings, and helical
strips containing nitrogen that will respond to changes in pH. These studies
will lead to conjugated benzenoid materials that can provide electronic
communication, dimensions, and tensile strength similar to carbon nanotubes, but
are well-defined tunable materials. These materials, with their novel electronic
and structural properties, will have applications in actuation, sensing, and
nanoelectronics.

With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division,
Professor King will pursue an educational strategy directed toward the
development of an integrated extracurricular learning environment accessible to
all students. In addition, the PI will generate enthusiasm in students towards
science by preparing a set of lectures that connect chemistry, other academic
disciplines such as history and technology, and everyday experiences. A major
goal of these efforts will be the recruitment of undergraduates into research
programs with an emphasis on promotion of diversity.
