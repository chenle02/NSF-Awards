Victor Batista of Yale University is supported by an award from the Theoretical
and Computational chemistry program to continue the development of computational
methods and applications to investigate photo-induced quantum reaction dynamics
in systems of biological and technological interest. The PI and his research
group focus on photoinduced isomerization dynamics in photochromic compounds and
molecular switches that have been studied by high-resolution gas-phase and
solution spectroscopy. The projects include collaborations with Nibbering (Max-
Born Institut) and Yan (Yale University) in a joint experimental and theoretical
effort to characterize the nature of ultrafast phototransduction mechanisms at
the detailed molecular level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program is
integrated with the continued development of Wikidchem, established by the PI
and co-workers to facilitate the dissemination of new pedagogical approaches,
research findings, and software developments on the World Wide Web, as well as
with the Science, Technology and Research Scholars (STARS) program to foster the
participation of underrepresented minority students in the
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OISE has contributed funds for international
travel.
