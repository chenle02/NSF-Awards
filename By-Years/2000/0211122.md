0211122&lt;br/&gt;Singer&lt;br/&gt;A workshop on Feynman Integrals and related
Topics will be held at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in
Berkeley, California from December 9-12, 2002. The workshop will coincide with
the end of a program on quantum computing at MSRI in order to explore the
possibility that the Feynman integral approach to quantum mechanics might be
useful for quantum computing applications. This award will partially support the
travel and local expenses of young scientists, principally graduate students,
postdoctoral researchers, who can then participate in the
workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
