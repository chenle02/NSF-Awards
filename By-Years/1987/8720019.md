This is one component of collaborative research between U.C.-Davis and Lamont-
Doherty Geological Observatory to determine the domain structures that are most
characteristic in Ti-rich titanomagnetites. Despite many years of study, an
adequate understanding of the complex domain structures observed on
titanomagnetite has proved elusive. Recently, however, it has been suggested
that most of these structures are controlled by strong non-uniform residual
stresses which cause their domain style to vary dramatically with position
within single particles. This hypothesis has profound implications. However, it
is possible that the stresses responsible for these unusual domain structures
are largely artifacts produced by the surface pre- paration methods used for
domain pattern studies. Therefore, it is imperative to determine which domain
structures are truly representative of Ti-rich titanomagnetites. A combination
of theory and experiment will provide a better understanding of the domain
structures in titanomagnetites and will lead naturally to a better understanding
of their magnetic properties. Full funding is recommended.
