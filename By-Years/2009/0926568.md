The Clarkson UBM project combines rigorous classroom instruction and
integrative summer research to create a long-term culture of interdisciplinary
collaboration between mathematics and biology and will support development of an
interdisciplinary Minor in Mathematical Biosciences. Undergraduate student
pairs, one each from biology and mathematics, will work together with faculty
pairs from multiple disciplines that have complementary expertise at the math-
biology interface. At least three to five integrated research teams will work
together during a 10-week summer program. Students also will receive specialized
instruction in mathematical biosciences using seminars, discussions, independent
projects, and active-learning lectures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In addition to
its benefits for the 15-20 UBM research students, this project will increase
curricular offerings and foster a collaborative interdepartmental culture that
will provide opportunities and stimulation for both students and faculty to
become more involved in the interdisciplinary research and study in areas of
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Summer research activities
will be integrated with other summer programs at Clarkson, such as McNair,
Honors, and NSF-Research Experience for Undergraduates, to broaden the influence
of students and mentors in this program. Research projects will push the
boundaries of science, be broadly disseminated, and generate new ways of
thinking about diverse problems through interdisciplinary
interactions.&lt;br/&gt;
