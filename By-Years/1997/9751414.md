With the rapid development of wireless networking technology and the wide use of
portable computers, a new paradigm of computing called mobile computing has been
predicted to be the dominant form of computing in the near future. In the mobile
computing environment, a large number of mobile computers, independent of their
physical locations, have access to shared services and resources, which are
situated in the land-based network and the mobile computing units. This new
environment extends the range of applications to a new dimension. This avenue is
also rich in research and development. But the requirements to mobile computing,
ranging from cellular and infrared communication links to energy-efficient data
access for terminals running on self-contained power supplies, make it
impractical to use old facilities for teaching and project development in the
area. With this project, a new mobile laboratory builds on old facilities. The
purpose of this laboratory is fivefold: (1) to be an essential part of a newly
structured course in mobile computing and information systems; (2) to be an
equipment infrastructure for the students to develop software necessary for
teaching the fundamentals of mobile computing and information systems; (3) to be
a center for training students in the use and development of state-of-the-art
technologies; (4) to provide an environment for undergraduate students to
undertake independent projects in mobile topics; and (5) to provide an
environment for faculty and undergraduate students to experience fundamental and
applied research in mobile computing and interdisciplinary areas. The laboratory
represents a crucial step in the initiation of a nationally recognized teaching
and undergraduate research program in mobile computing and nomadic applications,
by providing the much needed facilities for the development of a course and
projects designed for juniors and seniors. *
