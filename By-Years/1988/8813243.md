This project focuses on the biosynthesis of volatile halometabolites in the
marine environment. Current plans include continuing studies on the mechanism of
action of bromoperoxidases isolated from marine algae. In particular, a powerful
bromoperoxidase which has been isolated and purified to homogeneity from
Penicillus capitatus will be studied with respect to its mechanism of action and
the chemical nature of its halogenating intermediate. the P. capitatus enzyme
catalyzes the peroxidation of bromide ion with concomitant formation of
bromoform and other volatile halohydrocarbons from -keto acids. Preliminary
experiments have detected a new enzymatic route for the biosynthesis of methyl
chloride via a methyl transfer reaction. Cell free extracts of wood rot fungus,
Phellinus pomaceus, catalyze the formation of menthyl chloride and methyl
bromide from S-andeosyl-methionine and the appropriate halide anion. Plans for
the immediate future include the isolation, purification, and characterization
of this methyl chloride synthetase enzyme(s). A major goal of this research is
to discover the sources and mechanisms of production of methyl chloride in the
marine environment. The annual global emission rate of this compound is
estimated to be 2 X 10 7 tons per year and the principal source of this compound
in the upper atmosphere is biological activity on the oceans (> 90%). Methyl
chloride and other volatile hydrocarbons are produced as marine forms,
accumulate in the ocean waters and then distill into the atmosphere. In view of
the concern over the hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere, it appears important
to learn something about the biosynthesis of a compound which is undoubtedly the
most prevalent of all hydrocarbon species. Also, if methyl chloride synthetase
genes could be inserted into plants and soil microorganisms this could
theoretically lead to halotolerant crop production and perhaps allow reclamation
of salty soils. Dr. Hager is eminently qualified for this work.
