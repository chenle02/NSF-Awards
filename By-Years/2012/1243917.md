This Research Collaborative Network (RCN) advances the new interdisciplinary
field of PoliInformatics. PoliInformatics brings informatics to political
research by promoting the analysis of very large and unstructured government
datasets. The central objective of the RCN is to encourage scholars representing
diverse disciplines such as computer science, information science, electrical
engineering, statistics and computational linguistics to collaborate and apply
their skills to the analysis of U.S. government activity. Over a three year
period, the RCN will establish a new interdisciplinary scholarly network;
conduct research competitions and workshops; train the next generation of
PoliInformatics researchers; and produce a compendium of papers demonstrating
the importance of this new field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Large government data
sets inspire previously unimagined research questions, analytic methods, and
technology tools. The RCN will lead to valuable innovations in how government
activities such as lawmaking, budgeting and policy implementation are studied
and understood. It will encourage highly capable scholars possessing diverse
research perspectives to focus their attention on important technical and
substantive challenges presented by rapidly expanding repositories of government
data. The infrastructure that these researchers develop to address these
challenges will then be available for use by others--students, journalists,
interest groups, and citizens. Thus a critically important broader impact of the
RCN will be to foster improved public understanding of the roles and activities
of the U.S. government.
