9402130 Mehra This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
develops and tests a prototype hardware/software system for closed loop control
of part surface temperatures and mold interior temperatures in injection molding
operations. In the Phase I feasibility stage infrared sensors were demonstrated
successfully to provide the sensory input to a closed loop control system. the
Phase II prototype will use both remote infrared thermometers and weight
sensors. An industrial partner will support the Phase II effort with in-kind
contributions This process control technology is expected to find extensive
application in both retrofit and new equipment markets for the plastic injection
molding industry.
