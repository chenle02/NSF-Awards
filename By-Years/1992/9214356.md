Two modern X-ray diffraction units will replace the present obsolete (40 years
old) X-ray diffractometers in the Materials Science and Engineering Department
at Stevens Institute of Technology. These diffractometers will be housed in the
newly renovated Stevens Materials Characterization Facility, along with state-
of-the-art field emission TEMs and SEMs, and made available to the New Jersey
Technological Community. One of the diffractometers will be a limited resolution
unit with automatic sample exchange that will be used for undergraduate
instruction in Steven's computer-oriented courses and for graduate student
training. The second diffractometer will have a grazing angle thin film
attachment for crystallographic texture and stress analysis of thin film
materials and will be dedicated for research on the crystallization of thin
film, electrochemically deposited coatings, tribochemical reactions in ceramics,
and the chemical vapor deposition of ceramic coatings and superconducting
materials. The availablity of the new X-ray diffraction equipment will improve
data acquisition and enable improved quantitative analysis. Finally, the
proposed new equipment will have the most modern safety equipment, thereby
insuring the safety of students using the Material Characterization equipment.
