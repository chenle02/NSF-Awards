This SBIR Phase I project will model, develop, design, and build an
electromagnetic actuator using LaunchPoint?s patented nonlinear magnetic spring
design. The actuator will be used to operate valves in internal combustion
engines. Modern internal combustion engines use valve timing to optimize
fuel/air/exhaust and mixing for complete combustion. The availability of a full
variable valve timing system has the potential to improve engine performance. It
will provide valve timing flexibility which will help in reducing engine-out
exhaust emissions and improve torque characteristics of the engine.
Electromagnetic valves for engine applications have been developed, tested, and
used in a limited number of internal combustion engines. In that respect, the
proposed technology is not new. But the approach is different and the technology
is different in that it can provide controlled opening and closing of the
valve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the proposed
project will be that variable valve timing will potentially result in improved
fuel economy and reduced emissions for conventional spark ignition and
compression ignition engines. The actuator could eliminate many engine
components related to camshaft drive and result in reduced costs. This
technology could become an enabling technology for new generations of engines
and in so doing could contribute to a cleaner environment.&lt;br/&gt;
