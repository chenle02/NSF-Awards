Laser light scattering will be used to study several phenomena and processes
that are of basic interest in condensed matter physics. These are: critical
behavior near a non-symmetric tricritical point in water/alcohol/oil mixtures;
phase separation of liquid mixtures suddenly rendered thermodynamically
unstable; the properties of fractal networks of silica grown in solution, which
are the precursors of certain glasses, and the effect such networks have on
phase separation and critical phenomena in liquid mixtures. The measurements
will be carried out using a unique and very accurate laser light-scattering
instrument developed with prior NSF support, which measures the absolute
scattering cross-section and its wave-vector dependence down to very small
scattering angles. It is also used to measure the decay-rate of the spontaneous
fluctuations responsible for the scattering of light. This joint capability is
very useful since it provides accurate results for thermodynamic
susceptibilities, static length scales and dynamic behavior. This provides
stringent tests of theories relating dynamic properties to static ones.
