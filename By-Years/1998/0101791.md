Two 8 to 10 week modules, one focusing on cells and the other on reproduction
and heredity, serve as the basis for the development of a comprehensive,
assessment-driven, middle school science curriculum called "Science for Today
and Tomorrow." A curriculum frramework is developed for Life and Physical
Sciences to be taught in Grades 6 and 7 and Earth Science in Grade 8. The
research-based materials assist students to develop a working knowledge of a
core set of ideas that are fundamental to the discipline and ultimately to see
how the concepts span the disciplines. The student materials and the teachers'
guides are enhanced with classroom-tested assessments and web-based content
resources, simulations and tools for gathering and interpreting data. On-line
professional development materials allow teachers to gain content knowledge and
pedagogical skills. The website also contains an area that provides information
for administrators including strategies for supporting teachers and another area
for community members to involve them in the students' science learning. The
project builds upon the lessons learned in previous materials development
projects at TERC.
