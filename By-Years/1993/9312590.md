9312590 Solbrig This project will study the effects of fire on vegetation
biodiversity and heterogeneity in the cerrado, a savanna region in south-central
Brazil. The aim of ecology is not just to describe pattern in nature, but to
explain the mechanisms that contribute to that pattern. To assess the effects of
fire on biodiversity and heterogeneity, this study will incorporate analyses of
population and community ecology. Community level data will be collected in
transects sampled across replicated experimental plots which are either burned
frequently or left unburned. Population level data will focus on the effects of
fire on the reproduction, growth and survivorship of nine common species, three
species of grass and six tree species. %%% The cerrado region of Brazil has an
unusually high diversity of plant species compared to other savanna regions.
Fire has been an important force in the development of cerrado vegetation, but
the precise effects of fire on species diversity in the cerrado is unknown.
Although fire is commonly used as a management tool by ranchers, the long-term
effects of this practice are relevant to species conservation. In addition, the
importance of fire as a management tool in ecological reserves and national
parks is still poorly understood. This study will provide experimental data on
the effects of fire on community diversity and species survival in this species-
rich region of Brazil. ***
