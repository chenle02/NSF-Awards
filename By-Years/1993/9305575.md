9305575 Klein This is an experimental and theoretical study of phase separation,
ordering, and crystallization kinetics in metal alloys. Research on kinetics of
martensitic transformations emphasizes simultaneous ordering and shape change
reactions occurring in copper/gold alloys. The research also includes time-
resolved studies of quasimartensitic kinetics in which the martensitic reaction
is slowed by heat diffusion. The crystallization kinetics near spinodals is a
focus in the theoretical and simulation effort. Both homogeneous and
heterogenous nucleation are considered. The concept of liquid forming a "clump"
phase at a spinodal point is examined. Ordering is examined in FeAl and FeCo
alloys. %%% This research expands our knowledge base on the kinetics associated
with several phase transformations. Phase transformations play an essential role
in the processing and properties of technologically important materials. ***
