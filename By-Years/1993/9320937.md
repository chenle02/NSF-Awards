9320937 Loehman This project is supported under the Career Advancement Award for
Women Program. The grant will enable the investigator to work with a leading
scholar at the University of Arizona to learn the techniques of experimental
economics. In addition she will begin to apply these techniques in public goods
situations. The goal of this research is too design and compare alternative cost
sharing mechanisms for public goods. The tool of experimental economics will be
used to compare alternative mechanisms in terms of social costs and equity for
environments with varying group size, cost conditions, and initial endowments.
This project will provide a case in which experimentation is used not only for
behavior hypothesis testing but also as method of endogenous institutional
choice. The object is to design rules and institutions for cooperative solutions
to local public problems. ***
