0113563&lt;br/&gt;McKeegan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for
the operation, maintenance, and further technical development of the high-
transmission, high-resolution ion microprobe system housed in the W. M. Keck
Geochemistry Laboratory at the University of California in Los Angeles. The UCLA
laboratory will be managed as a multi-user facility providing access by U.S.
researchers to the special capabilities (combined mass resolution, spatial
resolution, and sensitivity) of the ion microprobe for isotopic and elemental
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
