This award will permit the continued study of the use of random iterated
function systems (IFS) to generate and encode digital images. In IFS generation
an ergodic Markov chain is simulated in R2 or R3 through products of random
affine transformations, and its trajectory is plotted to create an image. The
IFS encoding problem involves the construction of such a Markov chain so as to
generate a given target image. By exploiting the linearity of the
transformations involved with these chains, one can encode any digital image,
and for a broad class of images this affords substantial data compression. It is
planned to analyze and test various encoding schemes, and to develop algorithms
to implement them on vector and parallel machines. It is potentially of great
value to deal with large-scale image and encoding problems, particularly
involving real time applications of image transmission and communication, image
construction and processing and image restoration. Potential applications
include 3-D mechanical imaging, visual (e.g., flight) simulators, voice and
pattern recognition, optical character and object scanners, image understanding,
fingerprint and passport encoding, animation encoding, high resolution graphics
and high definition TV.
