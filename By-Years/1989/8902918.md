Composition of new software tools from previously created tool fragments has
long been recognized as a useful approach to the development of software
systems. The Aries interpreter project applied this approach to the design and
implementation of program interpreters by separating interpreter design into
modules providing a core interpretation algorithm, value kind definitions, and
computation models. Although the implementation of these modules for non-trivial
programming languages remains a substantial task, the resulting interpretation
system will permit the rapid development of subsequent tools that incorporate
program interpretation as a component. Furthermore, this interpretation system
would provide support not only for tools requiring conventional models of
program execution, but also for tools requiring symbolic execution, dynamic data
flow tracking, and other, less conventional, forms of interpretation.
