This project involves dissertation research by a student of cultural
anthropology from CUNY Hunter College. The project will study the production of
TV programs in Shanghai in order to understand the media's role in portraying
symbols of modern Chinese culture. Using ethnographic methods of participant
observation and structured interviewing, as well as textual analysis, surveys
and documentary research, the project will evaluate how some factors from the
West penetrate the cultural consciousness of Chinese media producers while
others are resisted or transformed. The study will help us understand how
television programs influence local cultural identities with respect to the
national center as well as the international cultural centers. This sort of
research is important as transnational influences become more important.
Understanding how local intellectuals function as cultural brokers while trying
to resolve their cultural identity ambiguities between East and West will help
members of the two culture areas deal successfully with each other.
