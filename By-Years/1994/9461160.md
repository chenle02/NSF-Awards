Abstract 9461160 Osterman This SBIR Phase I project is to develop, fabricate
and test a new type of micromachined bolometric detector using silicon nitride
as a high strength substrate. These bolometers will be suitable for mass
production so they will be able to be assembled into large arrays for imaging at
millimeter wavelengths; whereas, currently bolometers are "hand-made" and so
variable from detector to detector that large arrays are nearly impossible to
build. If this development program is successful it will open up the field of
high angular resolution millimeter wavelength astronomy, especially at the South
Pole observatory. It is expected that the development of imaging bolometers will
lead to a number of applications, possibly in the medical arena or for space
surveillance. ***
