Computer and Computational Algebra is a fast growing field with many
applications in education, science, engineering, medical fields, etc. To develop
and explore such applications close cooperation is needed between
mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers, and scientists. To facilitate
such cooperation the Department of Mathematics at Oakland University is
organizing an international conference during the month of July 2007 at Oakland
University. The main goals of this conference will be to promote the
applications of Computer Algebra and Symbolic Computation and to bring together
researchers from mathematics, computer science, engineering, and other sciences
in order to further cooperation.

The applications discussed in the conference are important in areas such as
education, mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, industrial
applications etc. For example, one of the sessions is organized by Charles
Wampler who is the head of the GM Research and Development group on robotics.
The group's main activities are based on techniques which make heavy use of
computer algebra. These techniques will be discussed in detail in the conference
and will introduce other researchers and students to the needs of the auto
industry, which is quite important for the economy of the Detroit area. Other
applications include coding theory and cryptography which are very important
decoding terrorist threats and securing safe communication channels. Several of
the session organizers are members of the NATO Advanced Study Institute which
will be organized in Albania in 2008. This summer institute is funded by NATO
and aims at training mathematicians, computer scientists, and engineers from
Eastern Europe and Mediterranean countries to monitor the terrorist elements in
those countries. Finally, the organizers of the Applications of Computer Al-
gebra (ACA) conference at Oakland University hope that the new ideas generated
in this conference will have direct impact on industrial applications and
combating terrorism.
