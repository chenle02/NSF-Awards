This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This micro-tensile tester will be used
in testing various materials inside an atomic force microscope (AFM) to
understand nano-scale material deformation and mechanical properties of the
materials as a function of applied tensile load. The instrumentation will serve
research efforts covering four academic departments at University of
Massachusetts Dartmouth (UMassD): mechanical engineering, materials science,
biomedical engineering &amp; biotechnology, and civil &amp; environmental
engineering. The research efforts include investigations to study the effect of
small tensile loads on displacement and deformation of conductive polymer
grafted carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on electrical conductivity of polymer-CNT
reinforced nanocomposite thin films, cell mobility in electro-spun nanofibers
scaffolds; damage initiation and growth of electro-spun fiber scaffolds,
fracture of epoxy hydrogel thin films reinforced with polyurethane fiber grid
structure, and nano-surface embrittlement of ultraviolet and thermally degraded
textile micron-sized fibers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experimental research
that will specifically address the issues associated with structural health
monitoring, tissue engineering and textile industries. Another major impact of
proposed micro-tensile tester lies in using it to provide research training and
education opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students. Undergraduate
students will be given research opportunities by supporting them through NSF-
LSAMP research projects using the proposed equipment. UMassD will incorporate
the research programs resulting from the acquisition of proposed equipment into
the Freshman Summer Institute (FSI), an existing preparatory and outreach
program where promising local college bound high school graduates study with
faculty members on working projects.
