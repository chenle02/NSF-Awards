Abstract: Conference on Fluids and Waves - Recent Trends in Applied Analysis,
University of Memphis, Memphis, Tn. May 11-13th, 2006.

The proposal is for partial support of a 3 day conference on the mathematical
analysis of wave motion and fluid dynamical problems.

The primary objective of the meeting is to bring together researchers from two
related, but distinct, fields of applied analysis. The primary goal of the
conference is to bridge some current gaps between investigators in these areas
by pursuing unifying links between the two fields. The funding will be used for
the travel expenses of the four principal speakers and to support the
participation of junior researchers as well as women and minority faculty.
