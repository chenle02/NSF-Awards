EIA-0210634 Paul Herrnson University of Maryland SGER: Human Factors Research on
Voting Machines and Ballot Design: An Exploratory
Assessment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support an exploratory
assessment of the current state of knowledge regarding the human element in the
voting process. The grantee will lay a groundwork for the systematic comparison
of different methods of voting, including comparisons of the accuracy of
different methods of voting, including ease of use and other factors related to
voter confidence in the voting system. This work is especially relevant given
the controversy surrounding the November 2000 national elections, and the
movement of many political jurisdictions toward the purchase of new voting
systems.&lt;br/&gt;
