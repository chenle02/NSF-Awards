A procedure will be developed for the analysis of dynamic response and noise
transmission of large structural systems of finite length which are composed of
discretely periodic units. The method is a combination of finite elements,
transfer matrices and waved propagation. The response is treated as
superposition of wave motions using wave reflection (due to changes in the
construction pattern) and transmission matrices. This enables the computations
to proceed in the direction of wave propagation only, so that the results are
always numerically stable. The new method can treat long piece-wise periodic
stiffened structures of finite length, which is not possible with traditional
transfer matrices, because of numerical difficulties. The method can use the
finite element formulation for the periodic units to treat systems of
complicated geometries and is expected to be much faster than the finite
elements because the degrees of freedom are reduced. The method will be used for
the prediction of the structure-borne noise transmission of large flexible
structures. Finally, the method will be used with the stochastic finite element
formulation to reduce computational time, which is an evident problems in
stochastic response as the number of elements increases. //
