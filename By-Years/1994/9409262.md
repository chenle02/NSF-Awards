With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professor Waymouth of Stanford
University will develop novel catalytic and enantioselective methods for the
construction of polycyclic rings using transition metal compounds. The
enantioselective synthesis of a variety of substituted carbocycles and
heterocycles will be pursued. Methodology developed in the catalytic
enantioselctive synthesis of polymers will be applied to the synthesis of small
rings. Methods developed for the synthesis of novel polymers using transition
metals will be applied to the efficient synthesis of carbon containing ring
compounds. The techniques employed are applicable to the efficient manufacture
of novel plastics, pharmaceuticals, and materials that will be necessary for
future needs of society.
