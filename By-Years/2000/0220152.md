Hardware-based approaches to accelerate CPU intensive operations
that&lt;br/&gt;arise in the context of non-standard database applications
are&lt;br/&gt;proposed. Two hardware technologies, namely, off-the-shelf
graphics&lt;br/&gt;cards and content addressable memories (CAM) that are used
in&lt;br/&gt;contemporary Network Routers for very fast lookups are
identified.&lt;br/&gt;The graphics functionality designed primarily for display
applications&lt;br/&gt;can be exploited for polygon intersection in spatial
databases and for&lt;br/&gt;distance-based query processing. Content addressable
memories (CAM)&lt;br/&gt;can be gainfully deployed for accelerating join
operations in&lt;br/&gt;databases. In the context of new database applications,
the join&lt;br/&gt;constraint which is generally based on equality is being
expanded to&lt;br/&gt;encompass other conditions such as set-containment. The
major goal of&lt;br/&gt;this research is to develop a general framework for
enabling&lt;br/&gt;fine-grained hardware acceleration within a commercial
DBM&lt;br/&gt;
