9451501 Pavia This proposal introduces molecular modeling and computational
chemistry into the undergraduate curriculum beginning with first year chemistry
and progressing with increasing degrees of sophistication in higher level
courses. In the first year students will be concerned principally with model
building and the testing of common bonding theory (VSEPR and VB). For organic
chemistry, conformational analysis, reaction modeling, and reaction dynamics
would be introduced judiciously via force-field and molecular orbital and MOPAC
calculations. In the third year for the integrated inorganic/physical
laboratory, students would model zeolites and learn applications of MO theory to
inorganic and organometallic compounds. Biochemistry students would also be
introduced to the use of the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank files. They would also
be taught to model docking operations at an active site and to evaluate
potential substate antagonists by least squares fitting routines. It is our
belief that molecular modeling will have far reaching pedagogic consequences
because of its predictive abilities and superb graphics and belongs in the
undergraduate curriculum. This proposal, if funded, will provide for six
molecular modeling workstations to be used in the environment of an open
computer lab.
