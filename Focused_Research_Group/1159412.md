This project is a multi-institutional (Harvard, Brandeis and Texas A&M),
interdisciplinary (mathematics and physics) effort to study the mathematical
theory of generalized geometries and its applications to string theory.
Generalized geometries form a class of almost complex manifolds with reduced
structure groups, which have become of central importance to the study of
realistic string theory models. These are natural generalizations of Calabi-Yau
manifolds and are of mathematical interest in their own right. In one class
important for string theory, the canonical structure one seeks on a generalized
Calabi-Yau manifold is governed by a fully nonlinear complex Monge Ampere type
system that couples a balanced Hermitian metric to an anti self-dual connection
of a vector bundle. When the manifold is Kahler Calabi-Yau and the vector bundle
is the tangent bundle, this system reduces to the Calabi conjecture for Ricci-
flat metrics. Generalized geometries arise as the internal component of
spacetime of string theory models that are much closer to our real world than
previous constructions. The mathematics that governs such a geometry is a
natural extension of deep problems in geometric analysis, algebraic geometry,
and deformation theory. The physics that is behind the new geometry provides
inspiration and novel approaches to posing and solving the mathematical
problems. Their solutions will in turn lead to greater understanding of
fundamental problems in physics, making this a truly interdisciplinary
collaboration.

The mathematical understanding of generalized geometries is still in its nascent
stage. The purpose of this proposal is to develop this field further, into a
full-fledged extension of Kahler Calabi-Yau geometries. We will focus on the
following tightly interconnected problems: constructing new solutions to string
theory in this class; characterizing deformations and specifically the moduli of
these spaces; computing the dimension of the space's light fields; and an
understanding of "generalized calibrations" - the analog of calibrated
submanifolds of special holonomy manifolds.
