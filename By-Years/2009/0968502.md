Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Nancey Leigh of Georgia Institute of
Technology and Professor Yuan Qifeng, Sun Yat-Sen University will host a
workshop on ?Designing e-waste material flow systems for sustainable regional
economic development: exploring U.S. and Chinese Approaches? at Sun Yat-Sen
University, Guangzhou, China, on July 31-August 2, 2010. Dr. Leigh and her
colleague will carry out a pre-meeting fact-finding visit to the key e-waste
site in Guangdong Province, Guiyu Township, on February 3-5, 2010. The proposed
workshop can foster interaction across disciplines and continue the research on
electronic waste material flows as well as optimum waste diversion and
management strategies. It can also impact society by aiming to increase the
economic development potential of legitimate recycling activities, while
reducing harmful environmental impacts of managing U.S. waste in the global
economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will be supported jointly by
Guangdong Province, China, and the U.S. National Science
Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
