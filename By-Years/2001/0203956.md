Jack W. Davidson Illinois Institute of Technology Collaborative Research:
Continuous Compilation: A New Approach to Aggressive and Adaptive Code
Transformation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Today's challenge for optimization research
is to develop new techniques and approaches that yield performance improvements
that were typical of early optimization research-20 to 40 percent and more. In
this research, we address this challenge by investigation and developing an
innovative system or applying optimizations. Our system, the Continuous
Compilation System (CoCo), applies optimizations both statically at compile-time
and dynamically at run-time using optimization plans developed at compile time
and adapted at run time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To demonstrate the practicality
and utility of our approach, initially we will apply CoCo to several large,
long-running applications. Examples of such applications include ecological
simulations, weather simulation, architecture simulators, and VLSI routing and
placement applications. As we gain insight and experience with the application
of continuous compilation, we will investigate its effectiveness on other types
of codes such as multimedia applications, signal processing applications, and
web servers.&lt;br/&gt;
