This project lies in a subfield of mathematics known as arithmetic geometry.
Many of the questions in the project are motivated by the philosophy that
information about algebraic equations over the integers can be obtained by
geometric methods. Solution to the problems under study in this project will
have substantial impact on research in cryptography, theoretical physics, and
quantum computing.

The investigator will study moduli varieties, L- functions, Arakelov theory and
their interactions. This work will have applications to solution to the Birch
and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, its generalization by Beilinson and Bloch, as
well as related problems. . In particular, research will be done on 1) the
arithmetic Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture; 2) heights of Drinfeld-Heegner cycles
with arbitrary length; 3) generalization of the Gross-Zagier formula to higher
dimensions.
