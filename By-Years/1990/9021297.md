The Malacology Collection in the Florida Museum of Natural History includes
more than 250,000 lots, principally New World freshwater and land mollusks. This
collection has grown rapidly during the past decade through integration of
several large and important "orphaned" collections, abandoned by other
universities, museums, and private collectors. Dr. Fred Thompson, Curator of the
collection, proposes to add 159 specimen cabinets to the collection, all of
which would be mounted on a compactor system that was recently shifted from the
Museum's Archeology Department to Malacology. This shift has added 47% to the
area allocated to Malacology, and the requested cabinets will provide expansion
space for approximately 10 years and will allow orphaned collections to be
captured without delay. The proposed project will enhance the growth and
improvement of an important natural history collection. Researchers in
systematic biology, ecology, population biology, and many other fields will
benefit from the heightened accessibility of these research collections.
