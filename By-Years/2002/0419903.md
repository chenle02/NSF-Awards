This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project proposes
to synthesize covalently-bonded drugs within 40 - 140 nm diameter, hydrophilic
spheres made by the process of emulsion polymerization. These nanoparticles
would be able to enter cells and release a high concentration of an antibiotic
near the target site.

The commercial application of this project will be for the treatment of
antibiotic resistant bacterial infections.
