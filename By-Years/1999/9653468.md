Project Kaleidoscope (PKAL) is sponsoring a series of workshops that continues
the current focus on programs that work, and incorporates a more intentional
focus on institutions that work. Our intent is to build networks of individuals
and institutions, regionally and nationally, that are committed to working
together to transform science, mathematics, engineering, and technology programs
in institutions of all kinds, in all parts of the country. Building on the
similar prior activities, the project will host workshops during 1997 - 1998.
Each workshop will involve 10 - 14 presenters who are recognized within their
disciplinary and educational community as reflective practitioners in the field
of educational reform. Teams of approximately three people, from 20 - 24
different institutions, will participate in each workshop; host sites for each
of the workshops will be institutions that are demonstrably seeking to transform
their undergraduate SME&T programs. Topics to be covered by the series of
workshops include the wide range of issues that must be addressed by faculty and
administrators in the process of achieving institutional and programmatic reform
that succeeds over the long-term. These workshops fit into the larger goals of
PKAL: to facilitate comprehensive reform at over 500 colleges and universities
across the country, by equipping institutional teams for their leadership role;
to provide leadership opportunities for the PKAL Faculty for the 21st Century
network; and to encourage national action supportive of local efforts to enhance
and improve undergraduate SME&T. Extensive activities have been planned to
disseminate materials from the workshop (particularly through the World Wide
Web) and to evaluate the impact of PKAL activities on participating campuses.
