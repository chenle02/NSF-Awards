The MASTEP (Mathematics And Science Teacher Education Program) Collaborative in
the San Francisco Bay Area is attracting high quality STEM majors and practicing
professionals into K-12 science and math teaching using the incentives of Noyce
scholarships and stipends. Academically outstanding teacher candidates are
awarded up to two years of financial support to help defray educational expenses
at either San Jose State University or San Francisco State Universities, two
large and prominent urban campuses within the California State University
System. Potential scholarship or stipend awardees are recruited from multiple
sources, including the pool of undergraduate STEM students at the two
universities and from approximately 20 feeder community colleges, as well as
from the large local pool of STEM professionals who work in the technologically
intensive region. In addition to enrolling in teacher preparation courses at the
two universities, the Noyce Scholarship and stipend recipients participate in
MASTEP Future Teacher Clubs and a New Teacher Support Network consisting of
workshops and an electronic network to support the new teachers as they assume
teaching positions in high need urban school districts.
