This award will provide participant support for early career scientists and
graduate students to participate in the PACIFIC 2013 Symposium. This symposium
will focus on the latest developments at the interface of particle physics,
astrophysics, and cosmology and on their ramifications for understanding
fundamental interactions.

It will be held September 2-7, 2013 at the University of California Richard B.
Gump South Pacific Research Station, located on the island of Moorea in French
Polynesia.

For Broader Impacts, it has a particular focus on early career scientists and
graduate students. To make the symposium more accessible to the general public,
they have integrated a public lecture by one of the symposium speakers into the
schedule.
