This project provides funds to create computer-microscopy stations to better
implement a BioQUEST PPP philosophy in the introductory biology, genetics, and
microbiology courses. As a result, more hands-on experience are being introduced
into the undergraduate curriculum, most of the courses are undergoing a series
of changes, and most courses now have laboratories. Some courses have "research-
like" experiences, and a few include a comprehensive PPP-like research
experience. A student defines a question (poses a problem), conceives and
executes an experiment (solves a problem), and thinks carefully about the data
and its relevance to the question to convince colleagues (persuades peers). This
technology also improves the instructor's ability to create open-ended, student-
originated research problems.
