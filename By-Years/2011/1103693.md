This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY
2011, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training
plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden
participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this
fellowship to Talline Martins is "Genetic basis and evolution of petal
pigmentation patterns in Clarkia." The host institution is Duke University, and
the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Mark Rausher

One of the most striking morphological characters organisms have evolved is
ornamentation based on a multitude of pigmentation patterns. For example,
pollinators are attracted to specific leaf and flower patterns of plants. These
traits and their repeated evolution implicate pigmentation patterns as powerful
drivers of evolution by natural selection. Yet, the genetic bases underlying
patterning have been described in less than a handful of cases. This research
investigates how members of the genus Clarkia produce one such pattern, petal
spots. It surveys and compares all genes that are active in developing petals,
known as the floral transcriptome, in several closely-related species. The
result is a comprehensive map of the genetic, molecular, and biochemical
interactions that led to the formation and diversification of this ecologically
important trait. Training objectives include a range of genetic, genomic, and
informatics techniques to explore the biological network that gives rise to
pigmentation patterns in flowers. Broader impacts include increasing the
participation of underrepresented minorities at the postdoctoral level, as well
as at the undergraduate and high-school levels, through mentoring activities and
outreach efforts.
