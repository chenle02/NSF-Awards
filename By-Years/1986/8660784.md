This is a recommendation for an award to support research on the feasibility of
development of a field portable gas-chromatograph/tandem mass-spectrometer
(GS/MS/MS) for application to critical environmental monitoring needs. The
proposed instrument system will greatly improve the capability to monitor and
ultimately predict the diffusion, dispersion, interactions and impacts of air,
water and land pollution. Phase I of this research will explore the technical
feasibility of a miniaturized and portable GC/MS/MS sysbm by (a) developing a
conceptual design, (b) performing high risk research on subsystems, and (c)
assessment of advanced field sampling methods. This research has objectives
consistent with those of the Environmental Engineering program. The
qualifications of the investigators are appropriate for the work to be done. The
proposal leading to this recommendation for support was submitted under
conditions of the SBIR- Small Business Innovation Research Program Announcement
NSF 86-19. Award is recommended in the amount of $40,000 for six months starting
February 1, 1987. This is for Phase I.
