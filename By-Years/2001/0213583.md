This research project addresses the effect of atomic scale structure and
composition on the reactivity of bimetallic alloy surfaces for catalytic
processes. With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
Professor Koel and his co-workers in the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Southern California, use scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray
photoelectron diffraction, and ion scattering spectroscopy to examine the
structure, composition and morphology of Pt-Sn, Pt-Ge, and Pt-Ti alloy surfaces.
This information is correlated with small molecule catalytic activity on these
surfaces, using temperature programmed desorption and infrared spectroscopy to
monitor the surface reaction kinetics. Information obtained from these studies
improves our fundamental understanding of catalysis on complex heterogeneous
surfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atomic scale structural and compositional
information is correlated with surface reaction kinetics in these studies,
carried out in the laboratory of Professor Bruce Koel at USC. The identification
of the reactive site for catalytic processes on alloy surfaces is the goal of
this work. Fundamental insight into the operation of catalytic surfaces is
obtained from these studies. &lt;br/&gt;
