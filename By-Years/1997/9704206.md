Feasibility analysis of a real-time system is the process of determining whether
the system can be scheduled to meet its temporal requirements. In order to be
able to build better automated tools for constructing complex real-time
application systems, we must first clearly understand what factors are
responsible for rendering certain systems feasible and others infeasible. This
research proposes to enhance our understanding of the phenomenon of feasibility
in real-time systems, and to obtain new tools, techniques, and methodologies for
feasibility analysis in such systems. This will be done by providing a firm
theoretical foundation to the analysis of feasibility in real-time systems. More
specifically, questions relating to the following topics will be addressed: (i)
Obtaining a generic framework for feasibility-analysis of a system, through the
identification of its ``worst-case behavior". (ii) Designing new abstract models
of real-time tasks to accurately capture salient features of real-life
application systems, and identifying rules for mapping application systems onto
the most appropriate models. (iii) Analyzing various task models in order to
enhance our understanding of what intrinsic properties render a model
intractable from a feasibility analysis point of view, and to identify very
general classes of tractable models. (iv) Determining alternate methods of
analysis for task models for which feasibility-analysis is provably intractable.
(v)Constructing ``proof-of-concept'' software that validates the usefulness of
the theoretical results obtained during the course of this research.
