This research is concerned with two problems in commutative algebra. The
principal investigator will analyze the direct-sum decompositions of Cohen-
Macaulay modules. She will also study the structure of the partially ordered set
of prime ideals in a noetherian ring and the influence of this poset on the
direct-sum behavior of modules over the ring. Commutative rings are algebraic
structures possessing a commutative addition and a commutative multiplication.
These structures occur throughout mathematics and algebra. Common examples
include polynomial rings and rings of algebraic integers in extension fields of
the rationals. This project is concerned with several questions concerning
commutative rings.
