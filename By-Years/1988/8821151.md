Scholars agree that two central questions in political economy are: How do
economic markets become politically regulated? And, once regulated, what
determines the allocation of resources within them? To date, little research has
been directed at these questions. This project will address these questions by
examining the case of the international coffee market. The market is regulated
by international agreement. One objective of this research is to examine what
led to the elaboration of political rules to govern trade in this commodity.
Another objective is to characterize the way in which these rules influence the
quantities traded and the price levels maintained in international markets. The
study of the political regulation of markets lies at the forefront of
theoretical concerns in contemporary social science. The research is also
important for policy reasons. Coffee represents one of the most valuable exports
from the unstable countries of Central and Southern America. Understanding the
way in which trade in this commoditiy is governed is thus of great interest, for
it may help policy makers to restructure the rules of the agreement so as to
bring greater prosperity to these strategically important nations.
