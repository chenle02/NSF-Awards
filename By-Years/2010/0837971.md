The team of researchers at the Southwest Research Institute is developing two
new mass spectrometer systems: 1) a portable, real-time laser ablation resonance
ionization mass spectrometer (LARIMS) in order to enable in-situ isotopic
measurements, and 2) a rotating field mass spectrometer (RFMS) for residual gas
measurements in high shock environments. For LARIMS, not only are they expanding
the basic physical understanding of the underlying atomic processes, but are in
addition exploring methods that could enable real-time in-situ isotopic
measurements of trace isotopic and elemental systems. By using LARIMS instead of
TIMS or SIMS, initial results show that the laser and mass spectrometer systems
could be made portable for real-time field use, while maintaining sufficient
precision and accuracy for enabling geochronology, geolocation, forensics,
archeology, food tracking, and studying nuclear processes. The outcome of this
work will enable the construction of field instruments that would move students
from 2- week laboratory stints (for one measurement), to real-time field
measurements of the target of scientific interest, and is therefore an important
development in the field. The RFMS study serves as a proof-of-principle for a
new approach for doing mass spectrometry, which if successful, will reduce the
size and cost of shock tolerant chemical measurements, also enabling field use
by institutions and students that might not otherwise be able to afford such
technology.
