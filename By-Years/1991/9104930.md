This award will provide half of the funds necessary for the acquisition of an
electron microprobe which will serve a large number of faculty and students in
the Department of Geology and Geophysics at Rice University, as well as many
other scientists and engineers at the university and in the Houston, Texas
regional scientific community. Rice University is committed to supply the other
half of the funding. This electron microprobe will replace an eighteen year old
electron microprobe, and will enable many of the past users to have access to a
state of the art instrument. The electron microprobe will be central to research
in geologic areas such as mineralogy,petrology,geochemistry,tectonics, and
related fields.Examples of specific research areas include the use of the
mineral apatite as a tracer of fluid evolution in volcanics in Colorado and
California, crystallization conditions of volcanic rocks in Hawaii,condition and
timing of deformation of metamorphic rocks in several geographic
areas,alteration of carbonate platform sediments in the Caribbean Sea and Indian
Ocean. Researches in all aspects of material sciences will be greatly aided by
the availability of this instrument.
