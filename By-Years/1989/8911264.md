In the past decade, there has been a great deal of work in using intertemporal
general equilibrium models to analyze problems in monetary theory. Professor
Woodford aims at building up a general theory of money in an intertemporal
equilibrium framework involving financial market imperfections and heterogeneous
consumers. Preliminary results indicate close connections between market
structure and demographic assumptions. The set of models that being analyzed
under this project also involve incomplete markets, an infinite time-horizon,
cash-in-advance and a time-varying distribution of money holdings. Long term
payoffs of this research could provide some extremely important policy-related
results. Specifically, Professor Woodford is attempting to find a generalized
framework for the redistributive fiscal effects of monetary interventions (such
as open-market operations). These alternative fiscal effects will lead to
differing influences on the price level and other real economic variables.
