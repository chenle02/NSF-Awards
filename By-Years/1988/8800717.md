This research is directed toward developing practicable methods for calculating
three-body reactions, in particular by extending the continuum-discretized
coupled-channel (CDCC) theory developed by the principal investigator and his
collaborators. Applications are to processes involving deuterons on nuclei, for
which this approach appears to be the only one practicable of nuclei of
intermediate mass, and to more exotic reactions in which final state
interactions are particularly important.
