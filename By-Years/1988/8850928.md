Fifty physics teachers in the Southern California area will participate in a
two-year Institute (1989-91) aimed at improving their content background in
modern physics and their teaching skills in general. School districts with high
minority representation will be the primary target population in recruiting
participants. The main thrust of the Institute will be in modern physics which
is generally the area in which teacher backgrounds are weakest. The first summer
will focus on electricity and magnetism (E&amp;M) and optics with applications
to modern physics. The second summer will focus on relativity, quantum theory,
atomic and nuclear physics and special topics. Ten of the participants will be
experienced mentor teachers who will act as coaches by providing support and
guidance for teams of four less experienced "crossover" teachers. Activities
during each of the four-week summer institutes held at Cal State Fullerton will
include content updating, laboratory experience, lesson preparation, discussion
of pedagogical techniques and problem-solving practice. Content enhancement will
be facilitated by use of "The Mechanical Universe". Lectures by project
directors, coaches and visiting speakers will present participants with
alternative teaching styles and different techniques for teaching physics.
Laboratory experiences will aim at maximizing hands-on opportunity by having
participants perform the experiments. A group of on-site high school physics
students will provide practice sessions for the participants during the duration
of the summer institute. During the academic year, follow-up activities will
include use of interactive television for monthly video-conference meetings,
three Topical Conferences (scheduled on weekend) on current issues in modern
physics and site visits by coaches and project directors. Finally, as part of
the follow-up agenda, each participant will receive visitations from coaches and
project directors for observation in their own classrooms. Several dissemination
strategies are planned. These include: opening the topical conferences to twice
as many participants, requiring them to make presentations to their colleagues
about the program, establishing a communications network of Southern California
physics teachers under the auspices of the Orange and Los Angeles County Boards
of Education, and having a system-wide conference of the 19 campuses of the
California State University to discuss the project. Project evaluation will be
performed by Far West Laboratory for Educational Research and Development on a
continuous basis during the project. Cost-sharing is approximately 34% of the
National Science Foundation request.
