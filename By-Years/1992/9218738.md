PI will conduct sedimentologic, stable isotopic and biostratigraphic studies of
the Naples Beach exposure of the Miocene Monterey Formation, California.
Monterey Formation deposition occurred over a significant interval of global
change, and the preservational quality of the Naples Beach section represents an
important opportunity for obtaining detailed paleoenvironmental records. The
sequestering of great quantities of organic carbon in the Monterey Formation and
correlative deposits around the Pacific Rim has been linked to an early to
middle Miocene increase in deep-sea 13C, and to global cooling through drawdown
of pCO2, termed the "Monterey Hypothesis". The proposed work will test a
corollary of the Monterey Hypothesis by evaluating the synchroneity between
intervals of enhanced organic-rich deposition in the Monterey Formation and
deep-sea 13C maxima, which requires better age control than the existing
biostratigraphy and chemostratigraphy provide. Stable isotopic stratigraphy has
the potential for direct comparison of intervals of organic- rich deposition
with 13C maxima in the Naples Beach record, or for correlation to deep-sea 13C
maxima. Central questions which the proposed work will address are: Can stable
isotopic stratigraphy enhance international correlation of the Monterey
Formation and aid in testing the Monterey Hypothesis? What is the relationship
between sedimentary sequences in marginal basins of the Pacific Rim to global
paleoceanographic changes? PI will develop a stable isotopic stratigraphy and a
detailed paleoenvironmental history based on quantitative analysis of benthic
foraminiferal faunas. integration of the resulting faunal and stable isotopic
time series with sedimentologic information will greatly enhance correlation to
Miocene sequences of the Pacific Rim and illuminate the relationship between
organic-rich deposition and global oceanographic events in the early to middle
Miocene.
