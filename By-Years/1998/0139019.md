The investigators will continue their study of the representation
theory&lt;br/&gt;of finite groups, especially the symmetric group and its double
covers, by &lt;br/&gt;exploiting various connections to Lie theory. These
connections arise at&lt;br/&gt;many different levels, combinatorial, algebraic
and geometric, and involve the &lt;br/&gt;representation theory of algebraic
groups, supergroups, quantum groups and &lt;br/&gt;infinite dimensional Lie
algebras. The investigators intend to study in &lt;br/&gt;particular the
Shapovalov form on highest weight modules over affine&lt;br/&gt;Kac-Moody
algebras via vertex operators, Broue's conjecture for the&lt;br/&gt;symmetric
group, and to further exploit the relationship between branching&lt;br/&gt;rules
and crystal graphs in representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
is in the area of mathematics known as representation theory. &lt;br/&gt;The
tools of mathematics provide a precise way to describe the
symmetries&lt;br/&gt;of something. Representation theory is the study of the
ways such&lt;br/&gt;symmetries can arise in the real world, and as such it has
applications to many &lt;br/&gt;areas of mathematics, physics and chemistry. In
the last few years, there has&lt;br/&gt;been some major progress in our
understanding of representation theory, thanks&lt;br/&gt;in part to a new influx
of ideas from mathematical physics. This project is&lt;br/&gt;concerned in part
with the representation theory of the most important of all the&lt;br/&gt;finite
groups, the symmetric group, which is closely related to the theory of
&lt;br/&gt;symmetric functions. The work is expected to have applications to
other areas of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, as well as a wider impact in mathematical
physics, statistical &lt;br/&gt;mechanics and coding
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
