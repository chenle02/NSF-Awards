9634569 Stephanopoulos This proposal is on research to elucidate the control of
flux in the central carbon metabolic pathway of Corynebacterium glutamicum. The
three branch points of glucose-6-phosphate, phosphoenol-pyruvate and pyruvate
will be specifically investigated as they are deemed critical in determining
flux distribution between anabolic and catabolic functions. The approach that
will be followed is to: (1) establish the fundamental genetic and biochemical
characteristics of key enzymes at the above branch points, such as pyruvate
carboxylase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphofructokinase,
respectively, and (2) to reconstruct measured in-vivo metabolic fluxes from the
kinetic and regulatory properties of the individual enzymes. Genetic
modifications will be employed as needed in order to provide appropriate genetic
background in the research, or to implement specific designs for flux
amplifications. The research will employ a state of the art genetic toolbox for
C. glutamicum, metabolic flux analysis for in-vivo flux determination using
material balancing and radioactive carbon thirteen compound labeling, and
biochemical assays in properly designed chemostat experiments. The investigation
of fundamental determinants of flux distribution in metabolic networks will be
concluded with coordinated multienzyme modifications aiming at productivity and
yield enhancement of amino acid production, and overproduction of the preserved
food flavor enhancer trehalose in C. glutamicum fermentations. ***
