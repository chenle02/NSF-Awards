This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
endocrinology between J. Michael Conlon of Creighton University and Hubert
Vaudry of the Laboratory of Molecular Endocrinology, University of Rouen. The
objectives of their research are to continue investigations on the isolation and
characterization of novel regulatory peptides in frog brain and to identify the
structure and function of other amphibian pancreatic polypeptides and
tachykinin-related peptides. The investigations involve tissue collection,
purification and characterization, and synthesis of the peptides. Subsequently,
the researchers will conduct receptor binding studies with the ultimate goal of
characterizing as many novel biologically active peptides as possible. The
project takes advantage of complementary expertise in the U.S. and France. The
U.S. investigator provides the experience and facilities for isolating the pure
frog peptides and for determining their complete primary structures. This is
complemented by the French investigator's ability to characterize peptides
functionally. He has developed specialized bioassays utilizing frog tissues. The
results of their joint efforts will be of interest to endocrinologist and will
improve our understanding of the evolution of peptide hormones and their
receptors.
