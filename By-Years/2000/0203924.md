University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: CISE Postdoctoral Associates
in Experimental Computer Science: Topologically Inspired Multi-Agent Robotic
Systems with Coverage Tasks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will
contribute to the development of the underlying science in using topological
information encoded in a free space to spatially allocate members of a multi-
agent team to achieve a particular task. Converge path planning (a new motion
planning approach that determines a path ensuring a robot's end effector will
pass over all points in a target region) will be used as the focusing task for
multi-robot team allocation theory development and experimental verification.
The postdoctoral associate and the principal investigator will consider how to
decrease the time of operation (i.e., work in parallel) and create qualitative
synergies among robots working together in a team. The expected outcome is a new
geometric result based on Kalman filtering theory, which will support planning
optimal motions for agents engaged in mutual positioning. The associate will
also participate in educational activities, specifically including robotic LEGO
modules for undergraduate and middle school education.&lt;br/&gt;
