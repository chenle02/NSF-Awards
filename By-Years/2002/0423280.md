Engineering systems are usually designed using costly computer simulations of
their response to environmental input. Designer typically perform dozens to
hundreds simulations and construct an approximation--called surrogate--to the
response as function of design parameters. The surrogate is used to search for a
candidate optimum design completing a cycle of design. For improved accuracy,
the cycle of simulation, surrogate construction, and optimization is repeated in
a smaller range of design parameters near the candidate optimum. Each cycle can
require many days, and so typically only few design cycles are performed.
Unfortunately, there is no formal methodology to help designers decide when to
stop; the objective of the proposal is to develop such methodology.

The main task of the proposal is to use statistical analysis to estimate the
probability of substantial improvement in system performance if another cycle is
undertaken. Also, we propose using multiple alternate surrogates for developing
confidence in these statistical estimates. Given a probability, a designer can
decide whether expected improvement in performance is worth the extra time and
money of another design cycle. This approach will be applicable to improve the
design process in a wide range of industries, since almost every industry makes
use of surrogate based design optimization.
