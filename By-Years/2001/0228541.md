This Special Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award provides funds to
support the construction, testing, and development for scientific use of an
ultra-slow, ultra-cold "superleak" superfluid helium beam. The superleak helium
beam offers seemingly unprecedented directionality and intensity in addition to
the novel coherence properties intrinsic to the superfluid itself. Although the
superleak source is still very much in a developmental stage, it seems
increasingly likely to offer extraordinary and completely novel ways of
investigating superfluid helium and of characterizing and synthesizing
materials, particularly on nanoscale dimensions.
