The Networking Technology and Systems Virtual Organization (NeTS-VO) will foster
communication and collaboration, expand the reach of high-quality resources
including datasets, testbeds and workshops, and highlight advances within the
Networking Technology and Systems (NeTS) community. NeTS-VO will provide easier
access to potential NeTS researchers and Principle Investigators who have not
had the opportunity to grow their network of professional contacts. By making
access to these resources transparent and easily available, and fostering
interactive communication, NeTS-VO will improve access to the NeTS community and
resources, especially to students and researchers from historically minority
institutions and institutions that primarily focus on undergraduate education.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NetS-VO is a pilot project and in its initial phase will
consist of a website, discussion platform and virtual workshops. The website
will feature the latest information from NSF NeTS, from the NSF NeTS community
and sites of interest to the NeTS community. The discussion platform will
facilitate interaction among current and potential NeTS researchers. The virtual
workshops will focus on a broad range of broadening participation topics. The
platform will be developed to be portable and easily maintainable. With this
"one-stop-shop" for the NSF NeTS community, the platform will provide a hub for
identifying potential resources and collaborators. It will also facilitate
access to NSF NeTS-related data sets and testbeds. By providing this platform,
it will improve the scope and quality of submitted NSF NeTS proposals thus
advancing our networking and telecommunications systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NeTS-VO project will encourage mentorship between more
experienced NeTS researchers and researchers who need guidance in how to prepare
and follow through on a successful proposal. Through virtual workshops, under-
represented researchers will get valuable feedback on the proposal writing
process. As the platform is open to the public, it can also inform under-
represented K-12 students of the exciting opportunities in networking and
telecommunications research. This platform will be the public face of the NeTS
community and a vehicle for improving access to research-related
resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
