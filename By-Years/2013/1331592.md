The National Science Foundation (NSF) Climate Change Education Partnership
Alliance (CCEPA) is a consortium made up of the six Phase II Climate Change
Education Partnership (CCEP-II) program awardees funded in FY 2012.
Collectively, the CCEPA is establishing a coordinated network devoted to
increasing the adoption of effective, high quality educational programs and
resources related to the science of climate change and its potential impacts.
The establishment of a CCEPA Coordination Office addresses the need for a
coordinating body that leverages and builds upon the CCEPA projects' individual
initiatives. The CCEPA Coordination Office facilitates interactions to leverage
a successful network of CCEP-II projects and individuals engaged in increasing
climate science literacy. The efforts of the Coordination Office advance
knowledge and understanding of how to effectively network related, but
different, projects into a cohesive enterprise. The goal is to coordinate a
functional network, where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CCEPA Coordination Office at the University of Rhode
Island is helping to move the CCEPA network forward on a number of key
initiatives that strengthen it, reduce duplication, and enhance its overall
impact. An important role of the Coordination Office is the facilitation of the
transfer of best practices between projects. An effective network forges
collaborations and establishes communities of practice through network working
groups, building intellectual capital network-wide. The CCEPA Coordination
Office has a key role in assisting the CCEPA project PIs and staff to
disseminate the results of their work. Partnerships with other relevant
societies and organizations assist the Coordination Office in identifying
opportunities and synergies for sharing, disseminating, and leveraging network
products as well as best practices that emerge as Earth system science education
models and tools are evaluated. This endeavor broadens the collective impact of
the individual projects across the country.
