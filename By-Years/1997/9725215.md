This award supports Dr. Sergei Ostapenko and a graduate student from the
University of Southern Florida in a collaboration with JÂ¼rgen Werner of the
Department of Physical Electronics at the University of Stuttgart. The
collaboration brings together the complementary capabilities of the German and
U.S. groups to study the effects of ultrasound treatment on hot-wire
hydrogenated polysilicon thin films on glass and polysilicon solar cells.
Defects in the polysilicon determine the electronic quality of the material
formed, and one way to improve the quality is to passivate the defects by
hydrogenation. In addition to exploring the effects of ultrasound, the research
will apply a combination of traditional and novel characterization techniques to
monitor those effects. The research will use experimental facilities of both
institutions, and the exchange of personnel and graduate students will strongly
benefit the transfer of advanced knowledge and capabilities. The results of the
research could have an impact on a new generation of low-cost solar cells and
high-performance thin-film transistors used for active-matrix liquid-crystal-
display technology.
