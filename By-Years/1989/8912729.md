Improved forecasts of the timing and location of localized rainfall events are
dependent on improved understanding of the processes responsible for the
initiation and organization of convective storms. Convergence along mesoscale
atmospheric boundaries and topographic effects are primary mechanisms for
convective cloud initiation and development and in determining the mesoscale
distribution of precipitation. Using numerical simulations and data from
previous field experiments, the Principal Investigator will examine the
contributions, interactions and sensitivities of the physical processes leading
to convective storm development. Emphasis will be placed on the role of
mesoscale atmospheric boundaries and topographical effects. //
