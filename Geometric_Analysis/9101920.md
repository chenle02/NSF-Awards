This award will support research in three related areas: topological invariants
of non-simply-connected manifolds derived from heat kernels on covering spaces,
higher signature extensions of spectral invariants, and Riemannian geometry on
noncommutative spaces. The last area is connected with mathematical aspects of
particle theory and mathematical physics. The relationship between local
information and global topological information is fairly well understood on
compact surfaces or manifolds. The situation in the noncompact or unbounded case
is much more difficult. This research involves trying to understand this
relationship in cases in which the noncompact space is related to a compact
space in a precise manner.
