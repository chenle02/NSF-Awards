9453669 Cohen The Dade County Public Schools (DCPS) Urban Systemic Initiative
(USI) plans to achieve significant improvement in mathematics and science
learning and achievement by focusing on four systemic strands: content and
instruction; school improvement; administrative/school management policies; and
community involvement. Each strand focuses respectively on implementing policy
reform and sustained support in the classroom, the school and the district, and
on collaboration with community partners. The four strands collectively will
impact all professionals and students involved in the mathematics and science
learning process in Dade County. Specific leadership roles for teachers, and
clear plans for incorporating Chapter I resources and accomplishment buttress
the plan. The Initiative calls for active hands-on, inquiry based instruction
and high achievement expectations in mathematics and science for all students.
It proposes to sustain success through on-going quality assessments using well-
qualified leadership, and a vigilant focus on incremental and continuous change
over time. Continuous collaboration with the Community Leadership Council and
the District USI Policy Team will lead to development of strategies to overcome
barriers to sustained long-term improvement.
