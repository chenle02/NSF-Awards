This award provides funds to establish a core facility for macromolecular
synthesis and analysis at the College of Medicine of the Pennsylvania State
University. The facility will foster and facilitate interaction and
collaboration among cell and molecular Biology that stresses rigorous research
training for graduate students, and train postdoctoral fellows in a research
environment that stresses the use of cell and molecular biology techniques. The
instrumentation will be used for research that involves all phases of cell and
molecular biology-- membrane structure, receptors and modulators, cytoskeleton,
organelle cell culture. The investigators are engaged in high- quality research
and are productive.
