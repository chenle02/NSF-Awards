In a cooperative study with Colorado School of Mines the effects of implantation
of very large concentrations of ions on friction and wear propertied will be
evaluated. The microstructure, microhardness, residual surface stresses and
tribological behavior of ferrus surfaces, which have been implanted with up to
20 atomic percent of nitrogen, oxygen, boron, and/or carbon, will be determined
and correlated with processing variables.
