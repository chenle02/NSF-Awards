This project seeks funding for a state-of-the-art computer lab which will
incorporate instructional technology to empower students in undergraduate
economics courses. This lab will help students increase their capacity for
inquiry, logical thinking, critical analysis, and synthesis; work
collaboratively; build progressively on their software knowledge; and integrate
instructional technology and economic learning in their capstone experience. The
results of research on the impact this lab has on learning economics and on
students attitude toward economics will be presented at national and regional
economics conferences, submitted to relevant economics journals, and made
available on the Internet.
