The project is to host a conference to provide a forum on user centered
evaluation for people involved in the creation or management of digital
libraries of all kinds. The impetus for the conference arose from the desire of
sponsors and awardees associated with the six NSF/ARPA/NASA Digital Library
Initiative (DLI) projects to improve the effectiveness of the evaluation
programs associated with the projects. At the first joint meeting of project
participants, the Evaluation Working Group recommended organizing a conference
such as that described here. Upon further discussion, that recommendation gained
the support of DLI participants and sponsors, and led to this proposal. There is
the need for a methodological plenary of those involved in digital library
projects. It is beneficial to find out how others are collecting and analyzing
data, framing problems, what is working and what has proved to be a dead end. It
is important to gather together people for such a conference just as major
digital library initiatives are getting underway; because of the
interdisciplinary nature of the work no regula rly scheduled scholarly
conference specifically focusses on usage in this way.
