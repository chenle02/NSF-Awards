In order to study cellular physiology and biochemistry of biological and
physiological cells, it is important that the cells of interest be separated
effectively from heterogeneous mixtures. Presently available separation
techniques do not usually discriminate cells according to their physiological
states or intracellular constituents. This proposal seeks to develop a novel
separation technique (to separate cells on the basis of their physiological
characteristics) based on the ability of the cells to react to applied
electromagnetic fields. It is expected that the proposed technique will be fast
and will exert little stress on the cells (in contrast to some of the pr3esently
available techniques). The proposed technique would have a significant impact in
the areas of genetic engineering and immunology. The principal investigator and
his company (Biotechnologies and Experimental Research, Inc.) have very good
expertise in the area of the proposed work and qualify for support under the
Small Business Innovation Research Program. Support for Phase I (proof-of-
concept) research, in the amount of $40,000 for six months for FY87 funds is
recommended.
