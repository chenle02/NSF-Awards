This Phase I CCI will place chemistry at the center of research efforts to
describe the molecular composition of the universe. The Center for Chemistry of
the Universe will assemble a multi-institutional, multidisciplinary group of
researchers to investigate and understand chemical processes in the interstellar
medium. The chemistry occurring under the unique conditions of the interstellar
medium produces the initial molecular starting materials for solar system
formation. This chemistry, which produces a surprisingly rich set of common
organic molecules along with more exotic reactive species, also supplies the
molecules in meteorites and comets that may deliver the building blocks of life
to young planets. Understanding this chemistry will require the development of
high-speed broadband mm-wave spectrophotometers for chemical identification as
well as new methods to probe chemical reactivity in cold gases and on surfaces.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center will establish connections between fields such
as combustion chemistry, atmospheric chemistry, and materials processing that
share the theme of "chemistry under extreme conditions." The Center will provide
a team-oriented, collaborative and multidisciplinary research environment for
graduate student and postdoctoral researchers. Synergistic center activities
capitalize on the broad appeal of the space sciences and include a summer
undergraduate research program, a university-level general science course, new
web materials for the general public and display materials for out-of-school
time programs in science centers and museums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Centers
for Chemical Innovation (CCI) Program supports research centers that can address
major, long-term fundamental chemical research challenges that have a high
probability of both producing transformative research and leading to innovation.
These Centers will attract broad scientific and public interest.
