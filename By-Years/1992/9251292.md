This project will foster illustration, interpretation, and integration of
theoretical concepts in communication, signal processing, and control systems
through the use of a modern computer laboratory. Undergraduate students will be
exposed early to a state-of-the-art networked computing system, the X- Window
environment, and several high-level computational tools. The hands-on laboratory
experiments in an introductory lab course will develop in the sophomore students
the ability to simulate waveforms, noise, simple filters, and basic linear
systems. To enhance the pivotal course in signal and system theory, the junior
level students will experiment with the numerical simulation of a broad variety
of signals and systems. In the laboratory courses associated with the senior
level courses, students will experiment with the simulation and design of
realistic communication, control, and signal processing systems. In addition,
the laboratory will be an important resource for senior design projects. This
laboratory will provide students with better insight into the fundamental
concepts of communication and control. At the same time, it will better prepare
students for both modern industry and graduate school. Equipment to be purchased
includes: 26 X- Window terminals, additional processors, memory and disk drive
for the existing Sparc-class server, and networking hardware. The ease of use of
this equipment by undergraduate students will be achieved by developing an
optimized X-Window graphical user interface, course materials, class projects,
an electronic library of problems and solutions, and by providing the students
with an introduction to modern computing and simulation software within the
first laboratory course.
