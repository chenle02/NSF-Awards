This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) Program award
will advance the national health by reducing congestion and improving patient
flow within hospital units and between hospitals. By developing models that
predict flow dynamics and address sources of congestion, this project will
improve patient safety and satisfaction, and at the same time reduce staffing
and equipment costs to the hospital. Reduced congestion will also improve
occupancy prediction, thus reducing ambulance diversions within the hospital
network. This research employs novel modeling techniques that are informed by a
close collaboration between the PIs and the GOALI partner, Northwestern Memorial
Hospital (NMH). Models will be developed that are easy to calibrate and
sufficiently general, so that their analyses and insights are applicable in a
broad range of clinical settings within the hospital. The award provides support
for graduate students to engage in research that will be of direct benefit to
healthcare operations. The PIs will incorporate the results of their research in
courses on queueing and service engineering. The outcomes of the research will
be disseminated to both the operations research and the healthcare practitioner
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research on multi-server
queueing models, tailored specifically to hospital operations, that address key
features of patient-flow dynamics. These features include bursty departures due
to periodic discharge windows and non-stationary arrival processes. Because of
the complexity of the dynamics, the research develops appropriate approximations
for queueing phenomena based on fluid approximations during peak loads and
infinite server approximations during lightly loaded periods. These methods, in
conjunction with high-fidelity simulations, will be used to characterize long-
run behavior of the patient-flow process, such as the maximum throughput of
hospital units, and their (periodic) time-dependent equilibria behavior under
different operational policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
