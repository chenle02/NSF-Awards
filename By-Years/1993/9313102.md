9313102 Turro The photochemical behavior of supramolecular systems will be
studied, in particular guest-host complexes and supermolecules. The guest
systems include precursor ketones which produce triplet geminate radical pairs
and metal complexes that serve as electron donor acceptor transfer pairs. The
host systems include colloidal micellar aggregates, double helical DNA and
porous molecular crystalline zeolites. The supermolecules include biradicals
produced by photolysis of large ring cyclic ketones and donor-acceptor complexes
separated in space at fixed distances by a DNA spacer. The objectives of the
proposed research include the discovery of new knowledge which will allow the
control of the chemistry of supramolecular systems that involve highly reactive
species such as biradicals and micellized radical pairs, and the photoinduced
electron transfer processes between metal complexes. %%% This grant from the
Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of Professor Nicholas J.
Turro at Columbia University. Supramolecular chemistry has been defined as the
chemistry beyond the molecule. Two important classes of supramolecules will be
studied: guest-host complexes and supermolecules. Guest-host complexes consist
of two or more molecules that are held together by attractive forces, rather
than chemical bonds. The supermolecules to be studied can be viewed as a
consisting of two or more subunits, connected by spacer units. The structure and
dynamics of these supramolecules as well as reactive intermediates that will
generated by photolysis will be studied. The results of this study will find
applications to technological activities involving chemistry at interfaces, the
characterization of materials possessing unusual properties, and to an
understanding of the binding of small guest molecules to biomolecules. ***
