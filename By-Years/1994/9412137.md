This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the Pennsylvania State University in
the purchase of a parallel computational facility using IBM SP2. This equipment
will enhance research in a number of areas including the following: (a) Quantum
Chemistry, (b) Chemical Reactions Induced by keV Particle Bombardment , (c)
Solvation and Solvent Effects on Chemical Reaction, (d) Interaction of Fusion
Peptides and Fusion Inhibiting Peptides with Model Lipid Bilayers, and (e)
Simulations of Molecular Liquids and Absorbed Phases. A workstation network of
fast, modern computer workstations is a new way to satisfy the computing needs
of chemistry departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a development
environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art
graphics and visualization facilities and supports research in state-of-the-art
applications of parallel processing.
