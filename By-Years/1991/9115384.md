This project deals with so-called low temperature copper oxide superconductors.
The focus of research will be on the electron- doped neodyium-cerium-copper-
oxygen system. The research will employ a substantial range of physical
measurements on the same single crystal material grown in the principal
investigators laboratory. The objective is to gain a better understanding of the
mechanism of superconductivity and the nature of the anomalous state in all
copper oxide superconductors. The research will complement similar
investigations in the high temperature copper oxide superconductors.
Measurements on high quality single crystals with a systematic variation of
dopants should enable this goal to be achieved and also allow the insulator to
metal transition at low dopant to be better understood.
