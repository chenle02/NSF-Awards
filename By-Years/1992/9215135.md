Technical Narrative: This U.S.-Egypt collaborative research project involving
chemists from the University of California at Berkeley and Alexandria University
in Alexandria, Egypt will investigate the excited state dynamics in liquids
using ultrashort pulse techniques. Project funding will enable Dr. Ashraf El-
Bayoumi of Alexandria University to spend a total of seven months in the
laboratory of Dr. Charles Harris at the University of California at Berkeley.
Additionally, Dr. Harris will travel to Alexandria and spend two weeks in Dr.
El- Bayoumi's laboratory. This cooperative research project will reveal valuable
information regarding fast relaxation processes that occur in the excited state
of several molecular systems. This project will provide useful information
regarding some features of the potential energy surface along which the
relaxation process occurs, the rates of such processes, and the influence of the
solvent in altering excited-state dynamics. This project in physical chemistry
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
leading experts in the United States and Egypt to combine complementary talents
and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
