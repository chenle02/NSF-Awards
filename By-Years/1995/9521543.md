9521543 Temperature regulation is very important for many organisms, because
rates of biochemical reactions vary with temperature. Careful thermoregulation
is particularly important to flight performance. Flying bees have been thought
to regulate temperature of their thorax, which houses their flight muscles, by
varying rates of convective and evaporative heat loss. Recent studies, however,
show that flying bees reduce rates of metabolic heat production as air
temperature increases. Because metabolic heat is produced mainly by the activity
of the flight muscles, power output for flight may also change with temperature.
This research will measure flight performance, water balance, evaporative water
loss and metabolic rate in freely hovering honey bees over a range of air
temperatures. The data will be used to construct quantitative heat and water
budgets for thermoregulation in flying bees. It will result in the first
comprehensive models of thermal effects on heat balance, water balance and
flight performance in insects. The research will increase understanding of
environmental constraints on the distribution, abundance, and activity patterns
of biologically and economically important flying insects.
