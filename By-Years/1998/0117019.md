This research will examine a suite of cores from Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana, for
evidence of a high-resolution (i.e., interannual to millennial-scale) record of
West African Monsoon dynamics over the last 20,000
years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lake Bosumtwi is the remnant of a basin formed by a
meteor impact approximately 1.1 million years ago. As such, the lake is a well-
defined catchment basin that is sensitive to small changes in precipitation-
evaporation balance, a fundamental aspect of climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research strategy is to use a multi-proxy approach to analyze cores recovered
from the lake under previous NSF funding. Specifically, the researchers will
develop annual resolution records of West African climate through the last 1,000
years, examine the record of West African monsoon variability through the last
20,000 years when climatic forcing functions were different than today, and
establish detailed chronologies for sediments from the lake to examine abrupt
climate change events in the region.
