Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past several years, the
proliferation of accessible mathematics technology has led to alterations in
mathematics pedagogy. The college has responded to these changes by
incorporating the use of technology throughout the mathematics curriculum from
the use of graphing calculators in calculus to computer labs in more advanced
classes. The goal of such reform has been to provide opportunities for students
to work on realistic and computationally complex problems, develop strong
visualization skills, and engage in collaborative and investigative learning.
The purpose of this project is to extend and fully integrate the use of
technology in mathematics classes by creating a student-centered computer
classroom and implementing appropriate curricular changes in the effected
courses. Initially, three courses are being taught daily in the computer
classroom: multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations.
These courses already make use of scheduled visits to a computer laboratory, but
the new classroom is providing daily use of essential technologies and
eliminating the artificial separation between the high-tech and non-tech
activities of the class. In order to ensure a successful transition to the new
space, curricular changes are being implemented that reflect the recommendations
of The Linear Algebra Curriculum Study Group and the Boston University
Differential Equations Project.
