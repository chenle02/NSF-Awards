9303359 Martin The long term objective of this research is to elucidate the
function of plant disease resistance (DR) genes. The interaction of tomato and
the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) provides an ideal
system for understanding gene-for- gene complementarity. Resistance to Pst in
tomato is conferred by a single, mapped locus, Pto and an avr gene corresponding
to Pto has been isolated (avrPto). A multi-step positional cloning strategy has
recently been used to identify a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone that
contains the Pto locus. We now propose to molecularly isolate the Pto locus from
this YAC clone and characterize its role in resistance. We will isolate the Pto
bacterial resistance locus; determine the DNA sequence of Pto and examine its
structural features; investigate potential alternate alleles of Pto that exist
in susceptible plants; characterize the spatial and temporal expression patterns
of the Pto gene; examine the expression patterns of pathogenesis-related (PR)
genes and other defense-related using Pto isogenic lines, and determine the
spatial and temporal accumulation patterns of the Pto protein. %%% Knowledge of
the DNA sequence of the Pto gene and the localization of its gene product in the
plant cell will address fundamental questions in cell-cell interactions. In
addition, since the Pto gene will likely be one of the first plant resistance
genes isolated, its characterization may facilitate the isolation of disease
resistance genes from other plant species. ***
