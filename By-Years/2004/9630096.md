The main objective of this proposal is to develop an integrated approach for
increasing the dependability of parallel computers. For detection and diagnosis
of hardware faults at the local (node) level, this approach will combine off-
line built-in self testing, on-line concurrent checking, and software techniques
implementing path and algorithmic-based checks. The aim of this proposal is to
develop a systematic method for generating and placing checks into the
implementation of an application. For automating the verification process and
placement of checks in programs, an interactive tool, VERIFY, will be developed.
For estimating the coverage factor provided by these techniques, a software
fault-injection tool will be created. Efficient and fast reconfiguration
algorithms will be developed for avoiding single and multiple faulty nodes and
links. A user transparent software layer will be created for implementing the
proposed algorithms. This will be written on top of the existing system software
that residents in every node of parallel computing systems. The Software Object-
Oriented Fault-Injection Tool (SOFIT) will be ported on the nCUBE and Tandem
SeverNet. The recovery time overhead will be estimated in the presence of single
and multiple faults injected by SOFIT into the nodes and links of the nCUBE and
SeverNet when programs are being executed. A dependability evaluation study will
be performed. The objective of this research is to show that this integrated
approach can be used successfully for improving the reliability of the nCUBE and
SeverNet by an order of magnitude.
