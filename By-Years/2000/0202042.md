In this proposed RUI research, we will apply our current research results
supported by NSF&lt;br/&gt;to design efficient parallel algorithms and to
develop software to reliable numerical solutions&lt;br/&gt;for both
unconstrained and constrained multivariate global nonlinear optimization
problems.&lt;br/&gt;To achieve high reliability, even in the presence of
uncertainty in the data, roundo error, and&lt;br/&gt;nonlinearities by finite
digit computations, we apply interval arithmetic in this project. The
basic&lt;br/&gt;algorithms to be used are interval branch-and-bound method and
interval Newton/generalized&lt;br/&gt;bisection method.&lt;br/&gt;In designing
parallel algorithm and developing portable software, we will take full
advantages&lt;br/&gt;of parallel computing to significantly reduce not only
elapsed computation time but also total&lt;br/&gt;amount of computation due to
the spatial nature of the problem we address. To achieve high
efficiency,&lt;br/&gt;we will balance workload dynamically among available
processors through inter-processor&lt;br/&gt;communication. The software will be
architecture independent. General sparsity and scalability&lt;br/&gt;will be
considered as well. The research results, parallel software package,
installation and user&lt;br/&gt;guides, and testing examples will be freely
disseminated through the Internet.
