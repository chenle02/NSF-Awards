This project develops new laser instrumentation, and is supported jointly by
Atmospheric Sciences and Materials Science Research as part of the Major
Research Instrumentation Program. Researchers are designing and building a
multi-functional suite of nanosecond pulse-length optical parametric oscillators
(OPOs) in collaboration with industrial partners. All participants have
extensive experience in the application and construction of state-of-the-art
light sources. The instruments will be shared among the group of university
researchers for in situ studies of atmospheric radicals and greenhouse active
gases, laboratory studies of critical atmospheric reactions, optical and
infrared diagnostics of chemical vapor deposition, and characterization of solid
earth minerals under extreme conditions. By developing the new laser systems,
these investigators will enhance existing NSF-sponsored research, and explore
and develop new interdisciplinary activities. The new laser instrumentation will
transfer several of the proposers' recent inventions to the private sector
through the participation of the industrial partners (i.e., Coherent, Spectra
Physics, and Casix, Inc.). Licensing of both existing designs and newly
developed instruments emerging from this partnership assists the rapid transfer
of new laser technology to broader-based science and engineering. Finally, the
project will enable graduate and undergraduate participation in several OPO
instrument development subtasks, and further involve the students in novel
applications to atmospheric science, cluster chemistry, thin film deposition,
and solid earth materials. ATM-9724500
