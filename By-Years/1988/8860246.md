The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of separating
clay and short pulp fibers contained in sludges produced during the papermaking-
process and to determine whether the separated clay can be reused in the
process. This project offers the potential of reducing the amount of sludges
that need to be further processed and/or placed in disposal sites where they
could unfavorably impact quality of surface and groundwater. The proposal
leading to this award was submitted in response to the NSF 88-8, Program
Solicitation for Small Business Innovation Research. This research, being
conducted with the cooperation of the Institute of Paper Chemistry, if
successful would complement previous work that resulted in a process for removal
of the long-fiber fractions of the sludge for reuse as a pulp substitute. The
overall impact of these concepts if fully successful would be to convert an
estimated 4 million tons per year of waste materials into useful resources and
reduce the unfavorable effect alternative waste management concepts have on
environmental resources.
