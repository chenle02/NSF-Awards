BDEI: Planning Workshop on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Informatics for the Indian
River Lagoon, Florida

Summary

This proposal solicits funding to organize and conduct a planning workshop that
will establish and facilitate research on the informatics needed to address
complex issues of biodiversity and ecosystem processes within the Indian River
Lagoon. This workshop will provide the opportunity and resources for
collaboration and discussion among scientists from diverse fields of
biodiversity, ecological sciences, remote sensing, geographic information
systems, computer science and intelligent systems. The topics to be discussed
will include investigation of novel computational intelligence techniques for
modeling, prediction, analysis and database management of the disparate and
complex data for the Indian River Lagoon. The explicit products of the proposed
workshop will be a white paper and technical report, a formal research agenda
that incorporates informatics into existing and planned research, and
preparation of a competitive proposal based on the recommendations and
preliminary work defined by the workshop.
