9404093 Taqqu This research concerns the investigation of the time series with
long memory and/or infinite variance. Long memory, in the finite variance case,
occurs when the covariances tend to zero like a power and the spectral density
diverges at the origin. This behavior has been observed in many real-life
phenomena. Sometimes long memory occurs jointly with infinite variance, for
example when the underlying process is stable but not Gaussian. In this case it
is the tail of the distribution that decays like a power function. The research
will focus on the probabilistic and statistical properties of time series with
long memory and/or infinite variance. Most of the available statistical
techniques assume that the data to be analyzed are not very dependent. However,
in a number of areas such as economics and geophysics, the data can display long
range dependence and can also sometimes fluctuate significantly from their mean
value. The goal of this research is to develop new techniques for modeling and
analyzing this type of data.
