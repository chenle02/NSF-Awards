This project will explore issues in designing and implementing a coordination
language for multidisciplinary applications. Multidisciplinary applications are
becoming increasingly popular among computational scientists, due to their
ability to accurately model complex systems involving a variety of multiple
disciplines. For example, realistic aircraft modeling is achieved only by
coordinating models from different disciplines, such as aerodynamics,
propulsion, and structures. While data parallel languages, such as High
Performance Fortran, can be successfully applied to many numerical applications,
they are ill-equipped to specify and manage the complex coordination required by
multidisciplinary applications. Since they lack "Programming-in-the-large"
features, most current multidisciplinary applications are executed in a disjoint
fashion with file I/O providing the necessary "plumbing" between the various
segments of the application. This project will develop an alternative, language-
based approach that concentrates on the coordination of the various discipline
codes, resulting in a clean and efficient execution model that supports multiple
levels of parallelism.
