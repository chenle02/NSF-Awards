Proposal DMS-0401261 PI: Lihe Wang (University of Iowa) Title: Regularity for
Partial Differential Equations

ABSTRACT

This proposal is directed to the study of regularity theory of elliptic,
parabolic partial differential equations and the study of the regularity
properties of their level surfaces. Degenerate equations arising from geometry,
fluid dynamics and several complex variables are also proposed. Equations with
stochastic media are connected with properties of the obstacle problems. New
methods and new understandings to these problems are introduced.

The PI is working on problems from pure mathematics and on issues from liquid
crystals and from geological underwater problems. The proposed research will be
important for a wide interdisciplinary subjects. The PI is actively involved in
the training and recruiting of post-doctors and graduate students. At the
Mathematics Department of the University of Iowa, there is a student body about
100 graduate students from around the country and around the globe.
