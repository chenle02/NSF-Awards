This planning grant, submitted in conjunction with the Minority Research
Initiation Program, will provide support to develop a research proposal to test
the hypothesis that nitrate could enhance in situ BTEX biodegradation not only
by increasing the availability of electron acceptors, but also by fostering
favorable changes in the microbial ecology of the aquifer and fortuitously
selecting for a microbial population capable of degrading BTEX under either
aerobic or denitrifying conditions.
