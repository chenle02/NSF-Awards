The Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Maine offers ten
undergraduate students a grant of $3,000 each plus an appropriate subsistence
allowance to participate in their REU Site. The available research projects
include: 1) Microwave Acoustic Solid State Sensors, 2) Robotics, computer Vision
and Neural Processing, 3) Wideband Signal Processing Components for
Communications Applications, 4) Motion Control, 5) Microprocessor Applications,
6) Environmental Noise Measurements, 7) VLSI Based Neuronal Models, 8) Power
Systems Applications. Students selected for the REU program have a high degree
of initiative and independence of thought in both laboratories and course work.
Student research projects are chosen to match the student's interest and
educational level. At the program culmination a written report and an oral
seminar are required from the student.
