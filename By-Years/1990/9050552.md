This project employs microcomputer based data acquisition and control
workstations for instruction in undergraduate engineering technology heat
transfer and fluid mechanics laboratories. Each workstation consists of a
microcomputer, printer/plotter, oscilloscope, and interface cards to be
integrated with existing experimental apparatus. This equipment enables
innovative approaches to laboratory instructions and offers students "hands-on"
experience with modern instrumentation. The award is being matched by an equal
amount from the principal investigator's institution.
