An exploration of a new laser induced liquid phase deposition process will be
performed. For microelectronics repairing and pattern direct writing
applications of electronic circuits. The work will focus on a new
electromechanical device to accurately localize the disposing chemical and on
new metal-organic precursors. Several new chemical strategies and a series of
new Gold (1) compounds will be investigated to improve the electrical and
mechanical properties of deposited metal films. The development of a
piezoelectric ceramic ejector will substantially benefit the deposition
performance with controllable application quantity and location of precursor
solution. The goal of the program is to investigate the characteristics of the
laser induced deposition process using liquid droplets generated by a
piezoelectronic ejector. Laser- induced deposition process will be investigated
using several, soluble precursor molecules and the deposited layers will be
characterized.
