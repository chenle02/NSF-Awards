9600077 Zhong-Jin Ruan The investigator's research area is in operator spaces
and their applications to operator algebras, non-commutative harmonic analysis
and locally compact quantum groups. Recently, using operator space theory, the
investigator has studied various amenability conditions for Kac algebras and
locally compact quantum groups. During next three years, he plans to continue
his research in this direction and plans to investigate the following problems:
(1) Operator amenability, strong Voiculescu amenability and Voiculescu
amenability for Kac algebras; (2) Weak amenability, approximation property and
weak approximation property for Kac algebras, and their connection with
C*-algebra and von Neumann algebra properties; (3) Locally compact quantum
groups. The most profound distinction between classical and quantum mechanics is
Heisenberg's principle: one must represent the basic variables of physics by
operators rather than functions. Motivated by Heisenberg's principle,
mathematicians have investigated the quantization of certain areas of
mathematics such as topology, differential geometry, analysis, probability and
etc. An operator space is defined to be a subspace of operators on a Hilbert
space together with a distinct matrix norm. Operator spaces are natural
quantization of function spaces, or more precisely, natural quantization of
Banach spaces. The theory of operator spaces was first introduced by William
Arveson in 1969. It has been quickly developed into a subarea in modern analysis
due to the recent work of David Blecher, Edward G. Effros, Vern Paulsen, Gilles
Pisier and the investigator. The theory has been proved to be extremely useful
in the study of non-self adjoint operator algebras, C*-algebras, von Neumann
algebras, non-commutative harmonic analysis, locally compact quantum group, and
etc. In this project, the investigator plans to pursue the further properties
and applications of operator spaces. The succes s of this project will be very
helpful for us to have a better understanding of the quantized mathematics.
