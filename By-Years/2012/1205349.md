From the very first steps of symplectic topology in 1980s flexible and rigid
methods played important complementary roles, though&lt;br/&gt;with introduction
by M. Gromov of the method of holomorphic curves, rigid methods played the
dominating role in the development of the subject. However, it became recently
feasible, with a number of important recent advances, to push the results on the
flexible side almost to the borderline with the rigid side. The research under
the current grant pursues the development of rigid and flexible methods in
symplectic topology. Most important tasks on the rigid side include: completion
of the algebraic foundations of symplectic field theory (SFT), including the
relative theory concerning invariants of Legendrian submanifolds, connections
with the theory of integrable systems, and further development and extension of
Legendrian surgery technique to all SFT invariants with applications to
Hamiltonian dynamics, especially to the theory of quasi-states and quasi-
morphisms. On the flexible side, the research will be directed towards further
development of the theory of flexible Weinstein manifolds, a new class of
symplectic manifolds previously discovered by K. Cieliebak, E. Murphy and the
PI, as well as the theory of Lagrangian immersions with minimal number of
intersection points. Another new subject which should benefit from both,
flexible and rigid methods is symplectic pseudo-isotopy theory, a necessary
ingredient towards understanding topology of groups of symplectic and contact
transformations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic topology is at the
crossroads of several mathematical disciplines such as low-dimensional,
algebraic and geometric topology, Hamiltonian dynamics, algebraic geometry,
mathematical theory of mirror symmetry and theory of integrable systems. Its
development, and in particular the development of symplectic field theory,
significantly changed the face of these areas. The research under the current
grant should bring both, the further development of symplectic topological
machinery, and in particular of the algebraic formalism of symplectic field
theory, as well as new horizons for its applications to dynamics, low-
dimensional topology and theory of quantum integrable systems.
