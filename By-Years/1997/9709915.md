9709915 Ruby Gene expression in nearly all eukaryotes requires the excision of
introns from nuclear pre-mRNAs to produce functional mRNAs. The introns are
spliced out by the spliceosome, which is composed of five snRNPs and many
proteins. These components assemble on the pre-mRNA before splicing begins. This
project focuses on the role of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Usa3p in the
splicing pathway. Usa3p has previously been shown to interact with Snp1, a U1
snRNP-specific protein. Usa3p is essential for cell viability and splicing in
vivo. Its deduced amino acid sequence has several interesting motifs, suggestive
of its function in splicing. These include several SR, RE and RD dipeptides,
which are hallmarks of known metazoan SR proteins that regulate constitutive and
alternative splicing. In vitro assays will be utilized to determine the function
of Usa3p in splicing. The roles, if any, of the SR dipeptides and of Usa3p
phosphorylation in the regulation of splicing will be assessed by a combination
of genetic and biochemical assays. Pre-mRNA splicing is a process for gene
expression in all eukaryotic cells. The long-term goal of this research is to
understand the regulation of splicing at the level of splice site recognition
and selection as well as at a more global level in coordinating splicing with
other cellular processes. Yeast is used as the experimental organism because
biochemistry and genetics can be used together to characterize complex transient
molecular interactions.
