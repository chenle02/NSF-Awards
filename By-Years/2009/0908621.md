This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

The award is for a pilot program to explore two areas related to OH masers: an
OH maser survey of the Andromeda galaxy (M 31) to study the dark matter
distribution and kinematics in the Local Group, and an OH megamaser survey at
redshift ~1 close to the peak of cosmic star formation and black hole growth to
study galaxy merging and associated phenomena. The M31 work will try to detect
the galaxy's proper motion in order to constrain dark matter halos and the
dynamical evolution of the Local Group. The megamaser survey will use the Green
Bank Telescope to observe IR-selected galaxies at redshifts z ~ 1. The award is
for one year with the aim of obtaining evidence that masers can be detected in
the target objects.

Broader impacts of the program include research training for undergraduate and
graduate students, and utilization of new educational programs and methods in
use at the University of Colorado, including K-12 science teacher training and
the learning assistant program.
