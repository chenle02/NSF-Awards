The PI will work on a wide range of research projects related to the geometry
and intersection theory of moduli spaces in algebraic geometry.Three main
directions are proposed. First, the PI will study Le Potier's strange duality
conjecture for spaces of generalized theta functions. Along the way, the author
will investigate questions related to the tautological rings of the moduli space
of K3 surfaces, abelian surfaces, and Calabi-Yau manifolds, the positivity of
the theta linear series, and the Brill-Noether theory of sheaves over higher
dimensional bases. A second direction concerns intersection theoretic
calculations on the moduli space of stable quotients for local toric and
hypersurface geometries, and their comparison with Gromov-Witten theory.
Thirdly, the author plans to compute stable pair invariants of local curve and
surface geometries by comparison with intersection theory of Quot scheme, a
topic which has been at the center of the PI's research in recent
years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI works in algebraic geometry, which is the
study of solutions of polynomial equations. More specifically, the PI's research
focuses on moduli theory and enumerative geometry. Moduli spaces put together
objects with similar structure, with the goal of obtaining a global unified view
of the structure under study, both qualitatively and quantitatively. This will
be beneficial for algebraic geometry, but also for a number of related fields.
In recent years, the PI mentored undergraduate and graduate students in areas
close to his research, and will continue to do so. He plans to develop new
algebraic geometry courses, and to write an undergraduate algebraic geometry
text. He will co-organize a seminar at his institution, as well as the Southern
California Algebraic Geometry Seminar. Furthermore, the PI will organize
workshops focusing on topics related to moduli spaces of sheaves. Finally, the
PI will be involved in high school and college competitions, and in the
preparation of gifted high school students.
