HBCU-UPâ€™s Research Initiation Awards provide support for STEM faculty to pursue
research activities to further their research capabilities and effectiveness and
enhance STEM research and undergraduate education at HBCUs. This award to
Jackson State University has the potential to improve bio-imagery, train
undergraduate students in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and
produce education modules in advanced technology for STEM courses. The project
aims to use a novel application of machine learning to discern what atoms in a
light emitter dominate its chemiexcitation efficiency to improve bio-imaging
devices. The significance of this projects is in advancing knowledge of machine
learning of thermolysis and assisting in the synthesis of a new generation of
light emitters that advances image quality for bioluminescent imaging and
improved treatment outcomes for tumor therapy. Student participants will receive
training in critical workforce skills.

This project seeks to use the Bayesian Support Vector Machine (BSVM) learning
model to uncover the origins of high chemiexcitation efficiency in synthesized
light emitters. The project is novel in that it (1) expounds the excitation of
the trajectories via the conical intersection (CI) topology obtained by
optimizing the CI seams around the reference trajectories; 2) projects the
energy state of a trajectory at any instant via the BSVM separatrix; 3) searches
the most influential features that describe the decision boundary and classifies
surface hopping trajectories statistically; 4) characterizes the features that
are farthest from the separatrix and predicts the energy states with high
probability; 5) establishes the relation between initial phase space coordinates
and transition thresholds to facilitate the designing process for new light
emitters with high lighting efficiency; and 6) develops multiple small
computational modules, each of which will be used as research topics for HBCU
undergraduate student research.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
