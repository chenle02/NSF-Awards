9713645 Mazumder This GOALI award will conduct research on precision machining
with novel industrial lasers, jointly by the (University of Michigan and the
General Electric Corporate Research and Development Center. GE Engineers will
make visits to the University of Michigan, for the duration of one to two weeks
each time, in order to conduct the joint research. The research objective is to
understand the interactions between laser beam and machined material as a
function of wavelength, intensity, and interaction time using a new generation
of industrial lasers. Focus will be given to processing of advanced materials
using parameters such as high average power, high peak power, high beam quality,
and various wavelengths which were not available in the previous laser systems.
The collaborative research will generate fundamental understanding of precision
manufacturing with novel industrial lasers. The research result could propel
widespread industrial applications of this technology. Also, the industry
presence on campus could foster close university-industry interactions which are
valuable to updating engineering education programs and preparation of future
talents with advanced knowledge on emerging technologies. 2
