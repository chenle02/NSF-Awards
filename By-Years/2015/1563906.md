A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and
research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the
Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these
institutions expands the opportunities for their students to pursue challenging,
rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that
may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational
appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly
with that goal, and moreover will enhance the Nation's knowledge of the impact
of providing relevant STEM instruction, on recruiting and retaining
underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next
generation of STEM professionals. For those students entering the workforce
directly from the college, it is important that they have a well-defined skill
set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the STEM workforce.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Navajo Technical University will develop a two-year
engineering technology degree to complement their four-year engineering and
digital manufacturing programs. The two-year degree will create a milestone that
will encourage students to start a STEM degree while opening a pathway to a
bachelor's degree. The project will increase faculty skills in relevant
technologies and create a model for incorporating advanced manufacturing
technology in engineering education, particularly at tribal colleges and
universities.
