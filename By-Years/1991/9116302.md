This three-year award supports cooperative research involving Paul A. Heiney,
of the University of Pennsylvania and Roger Moret and Patrick Bernier of the
University of Paris (South), Orsay. They will determine the long and short-range
structural ordering in fullerites and their alkali metal intercalation
compounds. Intramolecular bonding and molecular orientational order will be
probed by x-ray diffraction techniques. These studies will be complemented by
NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) experiments to determine the short-range
interatomic, intermolecular and atomic molecular interactions in doped phases.
Fullerites are a new class of materials with superconducting capabilities. The
principal objective of this study is to identify the origin of their metallic
and superconducting behavior and to determine their properties. A mixture of
X-ray diffraction and NMR techniques will provide complementary information and
data. Dr. Heiney brings to this collaboration experience in fullerite synthesis.
This is complemented by French expertise for combining high pressure and low
temperature x-ray diffraction, which will be crucial for determining the
structure of fullerites. The project will also benefit from access to the
synchrotron radiation facility at Orsay.
