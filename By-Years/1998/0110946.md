This project studies borrowing constraints and their implications for
firm&lt;br/&gt;growth and survival. Recent empirical work suggests that
financial&lt;br/&gt;constraints are an important determinant of the evolution of
small and young&lt;br/&gt;firms. As repayment of loans cannot be always
guaranteed, long-term&lt;br/&gt;contracts can often provide better incentives to
borrowers. Applying recent&lt;br/&gt;advances in contract theory, this project
considers the optimal design of&lt;br/&gt;such long-term lending contracts.
Implications for firm dynamics --growth and&lt;br/&gt;survival-- of small and
young firms are considered.&lt;br/&gt;
