PHYSICS (13)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Calls to reform the introductory science
curriculum have come from the National Research Council's Bio2010 report,
Association of American Medical Colleges, Howard Hughes Medical Institute and
Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians. A well defined set of competencies
that students should possess when they enter medical school have been
articulated. These competencies are expected to replace the current premed
requirements for a defined set of introductory courses and to drive the upcoming
M5 revision of the MCAT exam. Introductory physics courses have long provided
students with their first exposure to a model-driven view of the natural world,
and are frequently the first science course a student takes at the college
level. Few physics departments are prepared to address this changing curricular
landscape. The Introductory Physics for the Life Science (IPLS) project is
bringing together faculty from a variety of college and university types,
faculty who have begun to implement reforms, and faculty from the life and
medical sciences, to generate an initial understanding of what is known and what
needs to be done. The workshop will set in place a framework to begin a much-
needed reform of introductory physics courses, to alert physics departments
nationwide for the need for dialog, and to provide a platform for that dialog.
