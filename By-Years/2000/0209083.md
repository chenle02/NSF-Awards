Assurance for distributed systems is based on constantly strengthening the
protective boundaries that prevent and detect unauthorized access to computer
systems. Accountability, ensuring that principals are liable for their actions,
is an equally important issue. This project investigates a programming language
approach to tracking accountability in distributed systems, specifically by
extending the Java language to maintain a fine-grained audit trail for
accountability purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed approach is based on
associating secrecy (access control) and integrity information with data as it
is retrieved and copied over the network. Distributed access control is not just
enforced at one point in the network where the data is accessed, but may be
enforced wherever a copy of the data is accessed. Distributed information flow
types enforce access rights and enforce a form of causality that supports
tracking of tracking of accountability for principals. In recognition of the
fact that communication may be over an insecure network, sensitive data is
assumed to be "virtually" signed or encrypted, for integrity and secrecy
guarantees, respectively. The computational burden of the ubiquitous application
of cryptographic operations is avoided through the use of cryptographic types
for static checking where possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
