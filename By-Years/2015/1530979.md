Data intensive research for many scientific disciplines has changed the basic
research methods for those disciplines. For example large plant genomic data
bases have changed how research is done in plant biology where analyzing the
genes in the data base becomes a critical component of plant genetics research.
This workshop addresses the emerging discipline of data intensive research in
education through case studies of how data intensive research emerged in other
disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is a two-day workshop that will
feature case studies in disciplines such as astronomy, plant genomics,
engineering, ocean sciences, and health information technology on the first day.
The case studies will be presented by two participants within each domain - the
provider of the data intensive research and the user of the research. The second
day will be devoted to cross-cutting issues such as data interoperability,
privacy, security, open data access, and other policy and data curation issues.
