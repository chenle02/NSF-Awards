This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design and
synthesis of a new family of polymer composites tailored for the fabrication of
proton exchange membranes (PEMs) to be used in fuel cell applications. The novel
PEMs, based on a new family of polymeric composites, are expected to surpass
state-of-the-art Nafion.-type PEMs in general fuel cell applications, and to
have all the properties needed to allow the development of the next generation
of H2 and methanol fuel cells. The energy and transportation industry is quickly
recognizing fuel cells as the leading technology in an upcoming revolution in
energy production systems. The market accessible to fuel cell applications is
simply gigantic, ranging from personal electronics and car design to portable
and stationary power generators. Superior fuel cell systems are needed to
penetrate deeply in those markets and superior fuel cell systems is exactly what
the project will enable if successful.
