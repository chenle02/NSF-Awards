ABSTRACT PROPOSAL # : DEB-9708596 INVESTIGATOR(S) : MILCHUNAS INSTITUTION:
COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY Although the effects of increasing atmospheric CO2
concentrations on primary production and other aboveground ecosystem processes
are widely studied in field experiments, experimental studies of the effects of
CO2 belowground have generally not been done. The aims of this research are to
investigate the effects of elevated CO2 concentrations on soil C dynamics and N
cycling in Colorado grasslands. The main driver of belowground responses is
assumed to be CO2-induced changes in plant C an N allocation among soluble
exudates versus tissue components, in addition to changes in total C and N
fluxes. The focus of the measurements is on root exudates, plant litter
chemistry and litter decomposition, and changes in soil fauna, particularly
nematodes. Results will be synthesized using the Century simulation model. This
research is part of the NSF Environmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry
Program, with support from the Divisions of Environmental Biology, Earth
Sciences, and Atmospheric Sciences.
