The most pressing obstacle to achieving high computer performance
is&lt;br/&gt;that CPUs compute faster than the computer can move data to the
CPU. &lt;br/&gt;Because programs usually have regular and repetitive accesses,
current&lt;br/&gt;computers cache recently accessed data in a hierarchy of fast,
flat&lt;br/&gt;inclusive memories to improve performance. Technology trends
are&lt;br/&gt;making the data delivery problem much worse and will force changes
to&lt;br/&gt;to memory design such as partitioned cache levels. We propose a
rich&lt;br/&gt;software/hardware interface to manage next generation caches.
We&lt;br/&gt;propose new compiler algorithms to translate programs to
perform&lt;br/&gt;better on this new hardware, and new hardware designs that
enable the&lt;br/&gt;compiler to inform the hardware of current and future data
access&lt;br/&gt;patterns. These new techniques will go well beyond the
current&lt;br/&gt;minimalist load and store architecture/compiler interface to
achieve&lt;br/&gt;high performance. The result will enable end users of computer
systems&lt;br/&gt;to solve their problems more quickly and easily. The research
will&lt;br/&gt;have broad impact on the design and implementation of software
and&lt;br/&gt;hardware cache architectures. It will add new and enhanced tools
to&lt;br/&gt;the compiler, tool, and simulation national research
infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;This work will also train graduate students in
advanced research.&lt;br/&gt;
