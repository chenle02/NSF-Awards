&lt;br/&gt;Penn State University continues operation of a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU Site is affiliated with the Department of
Physics at Penn State. Eighteen undergraduate students are recruited every year
for a ten-week summer research experience. Students participate in a variety of
research projects in condensed matter and materials physics, both within the
Physics Department and the Center for Nanoscale Science at Penn State. Students
also attend weekly seminars, workshops on computer simulations, machine shop
courses and facility tours, including a trip to the Franklin Institute in
Philadelphia, and present the results of their research at a
symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site also supports five teachers every
year for a five-to-eight week summer research experience. In addition to
research activities with a specific faculty advisor, teachers are encouraged to
interact with other faculty members on pedagogy and to enroll in a two-week long
interactive course on the mechanics of materials that facilitates incorporation
of materials topics into their classroom
curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
