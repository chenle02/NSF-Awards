Abstract Krantz

The purpose of this award is to support American participants in a conference
to be held in June, 2007 at the Banach Center in Warsaw, Poland. The conference
will run for five days. The subject will be Several Complex Variables and
Complex Geometry. The funds will be used primarily in supporting women, young
mathematicians, and members of underrepresented groups. In addition, a good deal
of the conference activities will focus on vertical integration. The subject of
several complex variables and complex geometry is now at a new plateau of
maturity and continued development. It is important to take this opportunity to
assess recent developments and to chart the course for future work. This
conference is designed to be in the workshop style. Its objective is to chart
new directions in the field and to foster new collaborations. The intellectual
impact will thereby be considerable, and will last far beyond the one-week
duration of the conference. As a result of these considerations, the impact of
this event will also be broad and lasting. One of goals is to integrate young
mathematicians and mathematicians from underrepresented groups into the working
infrastructure of the profession. By putting them into contact with mature and
experienced scholars, and exposing them to current research problems, one can
help to jumpstart their careers and give them something of lasting value to take
with them.
