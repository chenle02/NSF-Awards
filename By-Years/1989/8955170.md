This two-year project is a teacher-centered model designed to improve the
performance of low-achieving middle school mathematics students in the area of
algebra. Collaboration among industry, schools, and EDC is central to the
project, which includes a training program for industry personnel who will serve
as substitutes for the teacher participants. Forty- eight teachers will
participate in an academic-year seminar, summer seminar, and summer lab school
phase. Teachers will be released from their classrooms on a regular half-day
basis to participate in the ongoing seminar. Cost sharing is provided as 70% of
the NSF award.
