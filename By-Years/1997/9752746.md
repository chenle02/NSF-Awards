Interactive satellite teleconferences are being delivered to faculty who teach
science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) students in colleges,
universities, and high schools. Each telecast features an innovative "best
practice" that can be adopted by participants. In addition, a special
experimental workshop on the creation of multimedia instruction on the world
wide web is being delivered. The workshop combines satellite instruction with
live, web-based tutoring sessions as well as e-mail so that instructors and
student assistants have support as they work through on-line exercises during
the week between telecasts.
