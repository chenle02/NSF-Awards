The Minnesota Zoological Garden seeks to initiate an eleven- week commuter Young
Scholars project in behavioral research and conservation biology for ten
students entering grades eleven and twelve. The project provides opportunities
for students to engage in seminars, field trips, research methodology, and
classroom activities focusing on animal behavior, conservation biology, and zoo
biology. Each student develops and executes an independent research study with
guidance from program professional staff and individual zoo staff mentors. The
seminars and field trips are designed to increase the students' awareness of
educational and career opportunities in related scientific fields.
