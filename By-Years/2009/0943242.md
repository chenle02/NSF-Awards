This engineering education research award to the University of Washington will
employ researchers to develop a number of assessment techniques for use by both
instructors and students to assess students' consideration of context in
engineering design. Success in addressing grand challenge problems of the future
will require that engineers be able to place engineering problems and design
alternatives in the larger complex context of societal and organizational
constraints. The assessments will be tested in four different engineering
classes. This research is transformative in rigorously investigating the
effectiveness of methods used to develop students' consideration of context in
design. In addition the assessments developed will be easily used in a classroom
setting rather than being limited to a research laboratory with labor intensive
evaluation methods. Understanding of how to incorporate context into engineering
education will be advanced by widespread use of this assessment tool and will
lead to engineering programs which better prepare engineering students to fill
future engineering jobs.
