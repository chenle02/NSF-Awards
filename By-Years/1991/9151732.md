This project establishes an undergraduate computer integrated design laboratory.
Closely coupled to the laboratory is the development of a unified education
program which will be introduced as early as possible in the curriculum for
maximum benefit in the majority of courses where computer graphic simulation
gives insight into complex phenomena. The equipment includes six Interpro
workstations and associated software.
