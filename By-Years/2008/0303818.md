The National Science Resources Center (NSRC) proposes a one-year renewal of the
K-8 "Leadership and Assistance for Science Education Reform (LASER)." LASER
operates through eight regional centers around the country and supports:

Development of a theory of action for increasing student achievement in science

Development of services and products informed by research and based on best
practices

Establishment of partnerships to work to accomplish shared goals

Dissemination of services and products for initiating and implementing research-
based science programs for all students.

LASER is having a significant impact on participating districts. To date, 446
districts serving more than 2.5 million students have begun implementing
research-based science curricula. The renewal will permit LASER to continue to
support districts as they move to reform, develop partnerships with additional
districts, permit the model to be refined and to deepen the partnerships to
ensure sustainability.
