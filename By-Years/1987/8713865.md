This is a grant for research into ways that allow reliable and efficient control
of large parallel systems containing thousands or millions of component
computers. Candidate algorithms will be analysed with a combination of the two
techniques: direct simulation of as many as two thousand computer nodes to
explore major factors in algorithm performance and mathematical analysis to give
precise formulae for scaling results onto even larger systems. Expected benefits
from this research include: (1) creation of distributed tree algorithms to
control global resources in large systems; (2) creation and evaluation of
partially distributed algorithms tailored for efficient execution on large
parallel processing systems by locally using shared cluster memory and very
globally using slower communications to exchange data; (3) comparison of major
algorithms for performing key tasks in large parallel systems, for example, to
determine at what systems size asynchronous gossip techniques for keeping
distributed copies of system databses weakly consistent become more efficient
than synchronous mehtods of assuring mutual consistency of all copies before any
changes are made; and (4) generally establishing and confirming design
techniques for operating systems for large parallel computers, especially as
they differ from the control techniques needed for small systems.
