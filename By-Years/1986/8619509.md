This project is in the general field of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of colloid chemistry. The principal investigator will study
fundamental principles of colloid stability and interfacial phenomena,
particularly as they result from specific chemical reactions at the interface.
This research will help him develop chemical procedures for preparation of well
defined colloidal dispersions of oxides, sulfides, selenides, titanates, and
molybdates, consisting of particles uniform in composition, size and shape.
These materials may be useful as pigments, catalysts, ceramics constituents,
coatings adsorbents, and drug carriers.
