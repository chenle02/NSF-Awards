Transient luminous events (TLEs) are large-scale optical events occurring in
Earth's stratosphere, mesosphere and lower thermosphere that are directly
related to electrical activity in underlying thunderstorms. TLEs impulsively
couple the troposphere to the ionosphere and may result in heating,
acceleration, and photoionization in the lower thermosphere. TLEs are richly
structured phenomena, whose fundamental elements are filamentary plasmas called
streamers. TLE studies are critical for understanding the microphysics of
streamer discharges, and also represent an important area in the research of the
chemistry in the Earth's atmosphere. Field observations of streamers currently
outpace theoretical developments, and consequently many aspects of streamer
initiation are not well understood. The proposed work consists of theoretical
investigations that will close several knowledge gaps. This proposal will also
contribute to the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students.

The proposers will build upon an existing model by embedding small-scale
phenomena (sprite streamer initiation) within a larger domain, and adding
additional chemistry. Specifically the PI will investigate: 1. the role of
plasma inhomogeneities in sprite streamer initiation; 2. propagation of
streamers over long distances (~10 km) within stratified air density; and 3. the
effects of sprites on lower ionospheric chemistry. These studies will inform
industrial applications of streamers (including ozone production and pollution
control) and TLE-related ionospheric modification.
