SBR-9618343 Chakravorty, Sanjoy Temple University This award supports research
on the spatial dimensions of structural reform in India. A set of hypotheses are
posed which suggests the geographic impacts of sweeping policy reforms. These
acknowledge the disengagement of the nation-state from investment location
decisions and regulations, and at the same time the greater independence of and
competition between sub-national states. A novel hypothesis will examine the
internal restructuring of the metropolis to accommodate new growth impulses. The
hypotheses will be tested using spatially and sectorally disaggregated data on
investment from the pre-reform and post-reform periods. Three spatial scales
will be used: interstate with nationwide coverage, intra-state for the seven
leading urban-industrial states and intra-metropolis for the leading
agglomerations. The data will be analyzed using a variety of spatial techniques.
These include exploratory spatial data analysis, clustering techniques and the
use of mixed regressive-spatial autoregressive models. The research has
important theoretical and policy implications in regards to the impact of
liberalization efforts throughout the Third World.
