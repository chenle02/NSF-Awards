University of Miami proposes to support technical services on one research
vessel R/V Walton Smith, operated by the University?s Rosenstiel School of
Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (RSMAS). R/V Walton Smith is operated as part of
the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet
and as part of their basic operations they will provide one technician on each
seagoing research project, and will maintain, calibrate and provide for
qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.
The budget included with this proposal is for the first year of a 5-year
continuing grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal
impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure
support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in
support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually
undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The support of
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
