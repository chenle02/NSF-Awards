Duke University proposes to support technical services on R/V Cape Hatteras, a
135? general purpose UNOLS research vessel operated by the Duke/UNC Consortium
as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research
fleet. They request support for basic services only. They will provide one
technician on each seagoing research project of R/V Cape Hatteras to support
seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified
users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation. The budget
in this proposal is for the first year of a 3-year continuing grant.
