ATM9912341abs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will conduct research
using data from neutron monitors and other instruments on the Ulysses and IMP-8
spacecraft, and continue precision observations by the Climax and Huancayo
Mountain cosmic radiation neutron stations. The research will focus on charged
particle modes of propagation in the three-dimensional heliosphere, and charged
particle acceleration phenomena in solar flares and coronal mass ejections.
Using the Ulysses data, the investigators will study the recurrent 26-day
modulation in cosmic ray intensity observed at high solar latitudes. They will
also show how direct solar neutron detection during solar particle events
provide information about particle acceleration mechanisms. The support will
allow continuation of the 47 year record of cosmic ray observations from ground-
based stations.&lt;br/&gt;
