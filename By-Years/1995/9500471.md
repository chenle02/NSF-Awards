9500471 Srinivasan This research is focused on the development of decomposition
methods and queuing analysis of polling (i.e., cyclic-queuing) models. In a
polling queuing system, a single serve attends to a system of multiple queues.
The server travels from queue to queue in some prescribed manner to attend to
the customers in the queues. In decomposition, the system model, which is
usually large and complex, is broken down into simpler models. The simpler
models are analyzed and subsequently linked together to obtain a solution to the
larger model. The objectives of this research are to produce practical
algorithms for the performance analysis of polling models, and to generate
theoretical knowledge and insight about polling models, vacation models, and the
phenomenon of decomposition. The methods to be used are the mathematical methods
of queuing theory, and the tools and insights from vacation models and polling
models with and without switchover times. The research will investigate whether
decompositions, of various types, hold for various kinds of polling models.
There are many real world systems in which a single server attends to arriving
entities in a given queue in a noncontinuous basis. An example of such a system
can be found in manufacturing where an operator attends to multiple machines.
Material handling systems that employ mobile transporters are another example.
The results obtained from this research will be of significant value to
researchers and engineers concerned with the modeling and analysis of
manufacturing systems, telecommunication systems, and other systems that provide
services to a random demand.
