The object of this project is to assist the Program Director in determining what
practicing professionals and university faculty believe are the benefits and
pitfalls of cooperative research. The rationale for this endeavor is to help
maximize the benefits of funding projects when they may result in international
cooperative efforts. The project will be accomplished primarily through
interviews that will be conducted by phone and in person. The project team may
review reports resulting from international conferences and research funded in
civil engineering to determine if commonalties exist that support or corroborate
information taken from interviews. the project should provide information that
can help the NSF refine its decision-making in this area of grant giving, making
international cooperative research more effective and resulting in information
that will benefit the field of civil engineering. ***
