Student Travel Support for WASA Conference 2009 &lt;br/&gt;Jie
Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0908636&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this
travel grant is to seek funds to help increase representation and participation
of US-based graduate students in the WASA 2009 conference. Since its first
endeavor in the year 2006, this international conference on Wireless Algorithms,
Systems, and Applications has established itself as one of the premier
conferences serving the rapidly growing research community. This grant offers
travel support to graduate students who might otherwise be unable to attend WASA
2009. It provides a chance for the students to be exposed to the state-of-the-
art in their research, and to interact with leading researchers and fellow
students from other institutions. The participation of deserving students in
technical conferences such as WASA has the potential to shape the future of the
research in wireless networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
