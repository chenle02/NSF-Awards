9453701 McCauley-Bell The research proposes to investigate the use of fuzzy set
theory to identify and model the primary elements that are necessary to describe
human performance. The research also aims at investigating the use of fuzzy set
theory to evaluate the feasibility of linguistic hedges and natural language
interfaces in human computer interaction.
