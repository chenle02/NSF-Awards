9614705 Fischer This research involves a study of the direction of mantle flow
around deep continental roots in the northeastern U.S. by means of the mapping
of the direction of anisotropy, and a study of the vertical distribution of that
anisotropy. Anisotropy measurements will be done through shear-wave splitting
from existing SKS and Ps phases converted from upper mantle discontinuities and
from a deployment of PASSCAL seismic stations to fill in gaps in coverage. The
vertical distribution of anisotropy will be determined from the comparison of
splitting of Ps from discontinuities at different depths. A series of 2- and 3-D
numerical calculations will model the strain fields and anisotropy produced by
strong continents translating through weaker surrounding mantle. The study
should allow the assessment of flow patterns around continental roots, the
degree of strain produced in continents by present-day plate motion versus
fossil deformation, and the degree of coupling between continental roots and the
deeper mantle. The flow and coupling are important for the determination of
crustal forces that are responsible for earthquakes in the eastern U.S. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
