This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is made to Dr. Lai-Sang
Young. Dr. Young will continue her work in the area of Chaotic Dynamics. In
particular she will investigate the following three topics: asymptotic
distributions and stochastic stability for attractors, dynamics of the Henon
map, and statistical properties of chaotic systems. The NSF Faculty Award for
Women recognizes the high quality of the awardee's record in teaching and
scholarship as well as potential for continued significant contributions to
scientific research, the academic profession, and the education of future
scientists. Dr. Young will continue her work in the area of Chaotic Dynamics.
Particularly noteworthy is her interactions with students.
