9514427 ASHBY This research will investigate the perceptual and cognitive
processes used in the identification and categorization of complex perceptual
stimuli. The research program will develop and test a new theory that assumes
category learning is a competition between two separate categorization systems.
One system uses rules that can be described verbally and has access to
consciousness (i.e., the verbal system), whereas the other can learn rules that
are impossible to describe verbally (i.e., the implicit system). The theory will
be described at three different levels. A neuropsychological version will
provide a detailed description of the major brain areas and neural pathways used
by the separate systems and that mediate the competition between the systems. In
addition, two separate mathematical descriptions of the theory will be
developed. One will provide a global level description of the dynamical behavior
that the theory predicts should occur when people learn new categories. The
other will provide a more detailed description that can be used to predict
trial-by-trial category learning behavior. Many experiments will be conducted to
test novel predictions of the theory. In addition to making predictions about
category learning in normal human adults, the theory also makes specific
predictions for children, the elderly, patients suffering from major depression
and from diseases of the basal ganglia (e.g., Parkinson's and Huntington's
disease), and for nonhuman animals. This research will improve our understanding
of one of the most basic and important of cognitive processes, namely
categorization. It also has the potential to increase our understanding of the
cognitive effects of several major diseases and disorders, and of how cognition
is affected by normal aging processes. This project will combine extensive
experimentation with theoretical investigations that rely heavily on
mathematical modeling techniques and recent discoveries in th e neurosciences.
