Machine learning has many important applications in science and industry. Modern
machine learning uses a mix of insights from different disciplines, most notably
artificial intelligence, statistics and optimization - areas that traditionally
have not had much overlap. The participants will take part in tutorials given by
experts from several different areas of machine learning - an opportunity that
many students do not have at their home institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project supports student participation in a Machine Learning Summer School to be
held at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh during June 16-27, 2014. The
summer school emphasizes big data and scalable machine learning algorithms. It
features speakers from academia and industry with established experience in
large scale data analysis. Approximately 50 graduate students from around the
U.S. are expected to participate in person. The content will be streamed live as
well as archived online making it possible for a much larger number of students
from academia and industry to benefit from the summer school. In addition to in-
depth tutorial lectures given by leading researchers, the summer school will
include exercise sessions that provide the participants hands-on experience with
large scale data (using the Kaggle platform and Amazon cloud services).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The Summer School provides state-of-the
art knowledge of machine learning and big data analytics to graduate students -
an opportunity that many students do not have at their home institutions. Thus,
it would not only help train an new generation of machine learning and big data
analytics researchers, but also reduce the barrier to entry of researchers who
want to apply state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to applications in
areas such as social network analytics, bioinformatics etc.
