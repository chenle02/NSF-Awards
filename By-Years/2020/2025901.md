The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is translation of a novel, non-invasive monitor
for fetal health during labor and delivery that will improve care and reduce
cost. Currently, clinicians rely on monitor technologies that are subjective,
unreliable and have high false positive rates for detecting the fetus at risk of
hypoxia (fetal distress), resulting in high rates of medically unnecessary
cesarean deliveries. When medically unnecessary, intervention by cesarean
delivery incurs avoidable healthcare cost, unwarranted maternal risk and adverse
consequences for newborns. Further, misdiagnosis of fetal health with current
technologies results in costly medical negligence litigation. Fetal pulse
oximetry would be applicable to over 3 million births per year in the United
States alone. This project will advance a new technology to measure oxygen in
the fetus's pulse, creating a new method to ensure health of mother and child
during delivery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Phase II project advances a new safe, non-invasive, reflectance-based
optical method for transabdominal fetal pulse oximetry. This method detects the
fetal signal at the surface of the maternal abdomen and extracts it from the
combined maternal-fetal signal. This project will conduct verification and
validation tests to integrate signal processing, biophotonics, and pulse
oximetry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
