This project is awarding scholarships and providing comprehensive support
services to academically talented but financially needy students. Scholarships
are supporting a total of 29 scholars for up to five years while the scholars
earn bachelor's degrees in Mathematics, Computer Information Systems, Computer
Science, or Information Assurance and Security. Support structures for
participants include the institution's personalized achievement compact, which
provides each student with a personal mentor who will advises students on
academics, college life, and career paths. Additional support includes mentoring
by faculty, field trips to local industries, a seminar series, and internship
opportunities. The institution boasts an ethnically diverse student body, and
many of its students are among the first generation in their families to attend
college. The goal of the program is to increase the number of students from
underrepresented groups who complete a baccalaureate degree program in computer
information science or mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
