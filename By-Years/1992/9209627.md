The objectives of this project are to produce new knowledge on the molecular
genetics and enzymology of anaerobic butryic clostridia that will allow
beneficial genetic alterations of the cell metabolism for a variety of
applications. Butryic acid clostridia have an excellent potential for industrial
applications to produce commodity and specialty chemicals. The cur- rent
knowledge base on the genetic- s, regulation and metabolism of these cells has
been limited, but considerable progress has been made by work on previous
grants. This project will continue the study of gene regulation, develop further
the expression systems in clostrid- ia, and evaluate other factors in- volved in
the regulation of metabo- lic pathways in clostridia.
