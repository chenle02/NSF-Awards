The North Armorican Massif is part of the Armorican Plate that separated from
N. America, Baltica and Gondwana in the early Paleozoic. Large segments of
Armorica were affected by the late Precambrian Cadomian orogeny, and the massif
is one of very few areas where there is no apparent overprinting of Cadomian
aged rocks during the late Paleozoic Variscan orogeny. This area is thus
critical for resolution of tectonic linkages with correlative Avalonian and/or
Pan-African sequences. Existing models for the Cadomian orogeny have a limited
geochemical data base, although recent field work has shown that complex
polyphase Precambrian metamorphic/structural events occurred. This study will
make systematic determination of 40Ar/39Ar mineral ages and selected U-Pb zircon
ages from representative lithological units within the massif, and will be
conducted in collaboration with British field geologists working in the area.
Co-operation with local French geologists has been arranged. The results of this
research will permit detailed evaluation of Precambrian tectonothermal events
and will help constrain tectonic models for the region.
