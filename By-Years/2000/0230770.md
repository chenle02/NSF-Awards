ABSTRACT, AVRAMOV&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent work Avramov has successfully
used multiplicative structures to study problems on free resolutions over
commutative local rings. With the help of graded Lie algebras he exhibited many
modules with minimal free and injective resolutions of maximal possible
asymptotic size. Using homotopy theory he proved a long standing conjecture of
Quillen on the rigidity of the cotangent complex and applied it to problems on
locally complete intersection homomorphisms. He produced algebraic varieties
that describe the action on cohomology of operations defined by Gulliksen and
Eisenbud, and with Buchweitz used them to find unexpected growth and vanishing
properties of Ext and Tor. Avramov proposes to develop systematic products and
other higher order (co)homological structures for use in ring theory and module
theory, and to apply it to specific problems, that usually involve only
homological invariants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commutative algebra and algebraic
geometry may be thought of as studying solutions of many equations in many
unknowns when, typically, the solution is not unique. The set of solutions can
then be viewed geometrically, but one can use instead encode all the pertinent
information about the equations in abstract algebraic objects called commutative
rings. The two points of view interact in beautiful and productive
ways.&lt;br/&gt;
