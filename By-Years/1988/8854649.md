This workshop considers the collection of descriptive and numerical data on
undergraduate programs in science, engineering and mathematics in U.S.
universities and colleges. Discussions at the workshop focused on: a) the needs
for data about undergraduate programs, b) what types of data are needed, c) how
the data may be collected, d) methods for disseminating the data. The
participants included individuals from academe, professional societies, public
agencies and industry; both prospective data users and those from whom data may
be expected to be collected were among the participants. The grantee provides no
matching funds for this project.
