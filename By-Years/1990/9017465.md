This ongoing project is designed to determine the nature, origin and derivation
of the Laramie Anorthosite Complex (LAC) by detailed mapping, petrography and
mineral chemistry of selected samples, major and trace elements of some whole
rocks, and Sr and Nd isotopic analyses. The PIs are particularly interested in
Fe- Ti oxide deposits associated with most anorthosites which are reserves of
titanium. The study should help determine the origin of the Laramie suite, and
should increase understanding of similar rocks that occur at several locations
world-wide.
