9306252 McGhee This is a three-year cooperative experimental research program
involving the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in the United States and Institut
National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automotique (INRIA) in France. On
the U.S. side, the principal investigators have many years' experience with
robotic vehicles, and currently operate an advanced autonomous underwater
vehicle (AUV) in a test pool environment on a routine basis. On the French side,
INRIA supports a major laboratory in Sophia Antipolis concentrating on both
mobile and fixed-base sensor-controlled robots. Their work has led to a three
level software architecture for robot control surprisingly similar to an
architecture which has been developed at NPS for AUV control. It is desired by
both INRIA and NPS to conduct a cooperative experimental study involving a
comparison of these two architectures, and to combine the best features of each
to produce a new architecture to enable more timely, less costly, and more
reliable development and archiving of software modules applicable across a
variety of underwater vehicles.
