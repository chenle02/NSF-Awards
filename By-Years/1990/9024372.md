The P.I.:s propose to conduct an organic geochemical investigation of the flux
of particulate matter in the Central Equatorial Pacific (EQPAC). This study
should allow them to reconcile water column production and sinking fluxes of the
major biochemicals (lipids, amino acids, pigments, and carbohydrates) with the
corresponding sediment deliver, accumulation and preservation rates, using well
over 100 individual organic compounds. Major questions are: 1) What are the
dynamics of particles in the surface Equatorial Pacific as reflected by their
organic constituents? 2) What fractions of the different biochemicals produced
in the surface waters reach the deep ocean and are accumulated at the sediment-
water interface? 3) What are the relative reactivities of different organic
substances in the underlying sediments? 4) Do biochemical distributions differ
appreciably with the inorganic composition of the various sediment types along
the study transect? To address these questions the P.I.:s will sample suspended
particles by insitu pumping, sinking particles using our new swimmer-exclusion
traps, and bottom sediments from box cores at transect and time-series stations
in coordination sampling with other EQPAC investigators.
