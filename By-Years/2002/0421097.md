Patricia Bedinger Proposal No. 0421097 "The Role of Pollen LRX Proteins in Plant
Reproduction"

Project Summary Sexual reproduction in plants requires many recognition events
between pollen, which bears the sperm, and pistils, which contain the eggs.
Currently, the molecular mechanisms mediating sexual recognition in plants are
poorly understood. The work in this proposal seeks to illuminate the role of
pollen Leucine-Rich Repeat-Extensin chimeric (LRX) proteins in plant
reproduction. Three approaches will be used: genetics, analyzing mutants to test
for reproductive success in the absence of the proteins; molecular, to test for
function of engineered forms of the proteins; and biochemical, to find
recognition factors that function at the molecular level. It is expected that
these studies will reveal information about male-female recognition in plants
through specific protein-protein interactions. In addition, some understanding
of how proteins can become anchored into cell walls in plants, an issue that has
puzzled plant scientists for decades, may be gained. The work in this proposal
addresses two issues of broad societal importance. First, much of the success of
agriculture in the United States is due to the production of hybrid seed, which
depends on controlling pollination in crop plants. The studies outlined in this
proposal will further our understanding of the basic molecular recognition steps
involved in pollination. Second, there is a legitimate concern about whether
transgenes in genetically modified crops can spread to non-crop species via
pollination. The proposed activities will shed light on the control of
pollination, and may suggest molecular safeguards to prevent the inadvertent
spread of transgenes.
