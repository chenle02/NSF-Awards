9506736 Nanni The objective of this project is to provide the engineering
science necessary for the implementation of externally bonded FRP reinforcement
for the repair of concrete structures, except for the case of members subjected
to compression where enhancement of strength and ductility is the result of
lateral confinement of concrete. The material forms of interest are highly
flexible sheets made of dry fibers or prepregs that can be adhered to a concrete
surface after minimum surface preparation by means of a polymeric resin. The
fibers are high-strength and high-modulus such as carbon and aramid. The
methodology of the project consists of an experimental and analytical study
based primarily on tensile reinforced concrete specimens. Tests are conducted
under quasi-static conditions after mechanical conditioning (repeated and
sustained loading) and environmental conditioning (thermal cycling and exposure
to aggressive environments). The experimental program is necessary to quantify
the effects of externally bonded FRP reinforcement on concrete resistance to
cracking and to assess long-term strengthening performance. A part of the
durability study is to determine whether the presence of FRP reinforcement
promotes/inhibits degradation of steel reinforcement in concrete (i.e., galvanic
corrosion when FRP is made of conductive fibers). Various material forms,
conditions at time of repair and preparation conditions are investigated.
Primary measurements include load, strain, interfacial delamination, crack
opening, and electrical conductivity. The project is conducted with the
collaboration of the manufacturing and construction industry in the intent of
securing suitable materials and of using field applications as a test bed for
laboratory findings and verification of modeling. ***
