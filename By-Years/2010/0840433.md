CERN'S Large Hadron Collider (LHC) ranks among the top scientific endeavors of
the decade. Although predictions vary as to precisely what will be observed at
this new energy frontier, theorists are in broad agreement that something new
will be discovered. The excitement surrounding this scientific opportunity has
led to a sharp increase in the number of graduates seeking to pursue research at
the LHC for their Ph.D dissertations.&lt;br/&gt;Because of the unprecedented
scale and complexity of the LHC detectors, working on the commissioning of such
detectors provides the students with a highly valuable experience which
contributes to their education in ways that simply cannot be duplicated.
Moreover, meaningful participation requires a physical presence at CERN. With
the imminent turn-on of the LHC, the next few years provide a special window of
opportunity. However, the combined effect of sharply increased student interest
in the LHC, higher living costs in Geneva and the weakening of the U.S. dollar,
has made student support more problematic. To ensure that students will have
time at CERN, this proposal comprises a program consisting of about 10 special
single-year (non-renewable) travel supplements per year, for three years,
awarded competitively, for US CMS graduate students to be resident at CERN
during the one-year period of their support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With regard
to broader impact, the recipients will be ?natural ambassadors? in two senses.
First, their day-to-day interactions with counterparts from other countries will
lead to friendships that will promote mutual understanding in the near term and
may lead to future international scientific collaborations. Second, upon their
return to the U.S. they will be integrated into US CMS? existing Education and
Outreach program, where their relative youth makes them plausible role models
for potential scientists of high-school and middle-school age.
