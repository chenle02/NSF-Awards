X-ray computerized tomography (CT) and related imaging modalities (e.g., PET)
are notorious for their excessive computational demands. While early CT
algorithms such as filtered backprojection are now trivial in two-dimensions and
scalable in three-dimensions, the more noise-resistant probabilistic methods
such as regularized tomography are still prohibitive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
basic idea of regularization is to compute a smooth image whose simulated
projections (line integrals) approximate the observed (but noisy) X-ray
projections. The computational expense in previous methods stems from explicitly
applying a large sparse projection matrix (to compute line integrals of the
image) and its transpose to enforce these smoothness and data approximation
constraints during each of many iterations of the algorithm.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to study a new formulation of regularized
tomography in which the smoothness constraint is analytically transformed from
the image to the projection domain, before any computations begin. As a result,
iterations take place entirely in the projection domain, avoiding the repeated
sparse matrix-vector products. A more surprising benefit is the decoupling of a
large system of regularization equations into many small systems of simpler
equations. The computation thus becomes ``embarassingly parallel'', so that
latency tolerant and ideally scalable parallel computations are possible, as our
preliminary results show in 2-d. We propose to apply this technique to
modalities other than CT, to implement it in three-dimensions, and to embellish
the probability models. Further, the network-friendly nature of this method will
allow us to study the feasibility of harnessing the increasingly wasted desktop
compute power in a typical hospital. We see decoupled regularization as an
exciting development in tomography, benefiting society by providing images to
doctors, patients, and scientists with fewer artifacts, at higher resolutions,
and with greater interactivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
