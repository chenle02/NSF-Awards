ABSTRACT 0432059 (Note changed title: U.S.-India Chemical Engineering
Conference)

This grant assists 35 U.S. delegates to attend the first joint U.S.-India
Chemical Engineering Conference in Mumbai, India, December 28-30, 2004. This
conference, organized jointly by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers
and the Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers, is the first of its kind. The
conference theme, Chemical Engineering in a Global Environment, is addressed
specifically in sessions discussing: Science and Technology Policy: Intellectual
Property Issues, Corporate Research and Development in a Global Setting, A
Workshop for the Promotion of Collaborative Research Programs sponsored by the
National Science Foundation and the Indian Department of Science and Technology,
and a session on Education for Curricular changes in the face of current trends
in the chemical engineering profession. A special report on the proceedings of
these sessions is envisaged. Other topical sessions in frontier areas in
chemical engineering are included with provision for plenary and keynote
lectures in each session in addition to contributed papers from academia and
industry.

The intellectual merit of this proposed activity lies in the scope of sessions
devoted to frontier areas in chemical engineering education and research by
experts from industry and academia in both the United States and India. The
global theme of the conference greatly widens the scope for broader impacts of
the conference in view of its focus on several technological issues of mutual
interest, such as energy and environment as well as education, for two nations
with very different economic backgrounds but substantial intellectual resources.
