High Pressure Liquid Chromatography allows the quantitative analysis of many
biologically important materials like derivatized amino acids, oligopeptides,
phenolics, polar terpenoids, and coumarin allelochemicals that are too heavy for
gas chromatographic separation. The proposed HPLC system will support the
research of at least five faculty lab groups in the new University of Minnesota
Ecology Building, including investigations of plant/herbivore interactions and
plant secondary products.
