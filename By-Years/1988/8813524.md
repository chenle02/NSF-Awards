A program in experimental and theoretical crystal chemistry is described. It is
proposed to measure the electron density in simple crystals using a new, but
proven, electron diffraction method that is considerably more accurate than the
traditional x-ray method. This will provide (in many instances for the first
time) invaluable data for interpreting bonding in crystals and which can serve
as benchmarks for evaluating theoretical calculations. Synthetic work is aimed
at the preparation and structural characterization of new oxides and nitrides of
importance to developing the theoretical crystal chemistry of these materials.
Particular attention will be paid to new synthetic routes to transition metal
nitrides; to structures of importance in elucidating the role of hydrogen in
oxide chemistry; and to compounds that will shed light on the crystal chemistry
of superconducting oxides with high critical temperatures.
