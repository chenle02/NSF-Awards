This project provides for summer workshops for computer science faculty on the
use of history in improving undergraduate computer science instruction. The
workshops target computer science faculty who agree to incorporate units or
modules dealing with history into their courses in the year after the workshop.
First year workshop participants serve as mentors to the second year
participants. Speakers at the workshops are individuals known nationally for
efforts on behalf of computing history and instructional curricula and materials
that include computing history. This project encourages the participants to
develop and adapt exemplary materials for use in their classes and includes
dissemination to the computer science community for possible use and adaptation
by others.&lt;br/&gt;
