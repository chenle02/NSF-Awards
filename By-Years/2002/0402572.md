Computer Science (31) This project establishes a New Mexico Computer Science
(CS) Community Consortium with selected two-year community colleges around the
State to promote computer science education through regular visits and distance
education offerings from the NMSU Department of Computer Science. The project
includes activities in the areas of program improvement, professional
development for educators, educational materials development, and laboratory
development. The primary participants in these activities are two-year college
students and two-year college faculty members, mostly drawn from institutions
with a prevalent Native American and Hispanic population. The consortium builds
on existing solid collaborations between NMSU CS and various tribal two-year
colleges in the region, and it integrates with existing activities aimed at
outreach and improvement of recruitment and retention of students with a diverse
background.
