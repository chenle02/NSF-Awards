This award is for the purchase of a Stereolithography rapid prototyping machine
and necessary accessories. Rapid prototyping technology provides a means of
quickly producing prototypes directly from a Computer Aided Design (CAD)
representation. The proposed equipment will be used to support research projects
with emphasis on rapid prototyping using concurrent computational geometric
modeling and information transfer, and CAD-based interactive graphic
modification and automatic verification of 3-D objects using complete 3-D laser
scanning data. Rapid prototyping can shorten product lifecycle and improve the
design process by providing rapid and effective feedback to the designer. North
Carolina State University will be purchasing a Stereolithography rapid
prototyping machine and necessary accessories to support research in the areas
of concurrent computational geometric modeling and information transfer.//
