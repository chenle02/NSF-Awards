Experimental studies of the high temperature deformation of single and polyphase
aggregates of feldspar and quartz are essential for providing mechanical data
for mid to lower crustal rocks, and for allowing interpretations of mechanisms
and conditions of deformation from preserved microstructures. Feldspars
constitute the most abundant phase in the crust, but their refractory nature and
chemical and structural complexity. The PIs will build on their experence in
this area, and conduct experimental studies of high temperature deformation of
feldspars, complemented by detailed optical and transmission electron miroscopic
characterization.
