Fishes appear well oriented in their movements in the oceanic environment, but
the mechanisms they use for orientation or navigation are very poorly
understood. Dr. Klimley is investigating these mechanisms with the scalloped
hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini). Using ultrasonic telemetry, he has identified
two oriented behavioral responses, straight-line swimming and homing (i.e.,
repeated movements away from and back to residence), at seamount El Bajo
Espiritu Santo in the Gulf of California. He now is seeking to determine what
environmental cues sharks use to carry out these behaviors by correlating an
increase in the directionality of their swimming movements with the presence or
absence (or strong gradient) of an environmental feature. Instantaneous swimming
directions, depths, surrounding water temperatures, and light levels will be
recorded continuously by a computerized data-logging system. Dr. Klimley will
obtain the following environmental measurements: (1) vertical profiles of
current directions and speeds, water temperatures, and light levels periodically
along the shark's swimming path, (2) sea-surface temperatures from satellite
images, and (3) a flower-petal-shaped survey pattern of bottom topography, total
magnetic fields, and local field differences from the earth's average field. He
will determine whether or not the straightness or directionality of shark tracks
or instantaneous swimming movements are correlated with any of the above
features. The research will focus, in particular, on magnetic-field features
because preliminary results indicate possible utilization by hammerhead sharks.
An important outcome of identifying those environmental features to which fish
orient is that mapping of the environment would then enable prediction of those
locations where fish densities are highest. Such a capability would increase the
capture success of fisheries.
