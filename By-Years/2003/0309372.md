The research will investigate the effects of mutations in the yeast,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The investigators will measure these effects when
mutations occur as single copies (heterozygous) or in pairs (homozygous). A
second phase of the research will compare how mutations affect survival and
reproduction in the life phase where individuals have two copies of every
chromosome (diploid) vs. when they have one (haploid). A third component of the
project will estimate the rate at which new mutations that affect survival and
reproduction enter the genome. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New mutations are one of
the primary factors that determine why organisms age, why breeding closely
related individuals often yields offspring with reduced reproduction, and why
many organisms reproduce sexually. Despite the importance of these topics for
human health and genetics, estimates of mutation rates and the distribution of
their effects have been very difficult to generate. The yeast, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, is an unparalleled system in which to estimate these parameters. In
addition to improving our general understanding of the properties of mutations,
these estimates will also be applicable to agriculture and conservation
biology.&lt;br/&gt;
