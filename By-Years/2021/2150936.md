The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the contribution to the field of conjugate
vaccines, which have made revolutionary and tremendous contributions to public
health. When successfully developed, the proposed platform will be available for
use by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to develop next-generation
conjugate vaccines against a wide range of antigens, including cancer and
emerging infectious diseases, for improved clinical outcomes. In addition to
vaccines, the platform offers an excellent starting point for the generation of
monoclonal antibodies for both basic scientific research and therapeutic
application. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase
II project aims to establish the applicability, robust manufacturing and
characterization protocols of a proposed mutant bacteriophage based carrier
platform. This work will establish superior and long-lasting antibody response
against weakly immunogenic subunit antigens, while reducing the anti-carrier
antibody responses. This project will advance the demonstration of the proposed
platform's performance in boosting the immune responses against the target
antigens, relative to that of the wild-type bacteriophage and commercially
available carrier proteins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
