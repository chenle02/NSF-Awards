9630131 Morse This is a project requesting funding for a two weeks trip to
Mongolia by Dr. John Morse, Clemson University. The purpose of this planning
visit are (1) to collect aquatic insect and fish samples in the Lake Hovsgol
region and (2) to explore the ways of helping scientists in Mongolia to develop
expertise in aquatic insect identification and water quality measurements. There
is little information on aquatic insects and fishes in the Lake Hovsgol region.
Dr. John Morse and two graduate students will collect insect and fishes samples
to fill the information gap in the Lake Hovsgol region. This information should
improve the overall understanding of this ecosystem. This project can also
provide valuable international opportunities to two U.S. graduate students to
work at a unique ecological site in Mongolia.
