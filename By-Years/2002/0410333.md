Chemistry (12) A 300MHz, high field, broadband NMR integrates modern NMR
techniques into the curriculum and allows faculty to greatly expand the depth
and breadth of laboratory courses, independent student projects, and
undergraduate research capabilities. The NMR allows a number of experiments to
be added across the chemistry curriculum. These experiments are chosen to
communicate to chemistry students the versatility and dynamic range of
experiments accomplished with a modern NMR. In addition, laboratory experiments
are selected to build a strong foundation in NMR spectroscopy for students to
launch, under the guidance of faculty mentors, more sophisticated independent
research projects.
