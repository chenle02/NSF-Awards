&lt;br/&gt;We propose various directions for studying embedded minimal
surfaces&lt;br/&gt;in three-manifolds. This includes the study of the
convergence of such&lt;br/&gt;surfaces, how they degenerate and whether or not
their Morse index is&lt;br/&gt;bounded. There are many possible applications of
results along these lines&lt;br/&gt;including to the spherical space-form
problem, the topology of&lt;br/&gt;three-manifolds with positive scalar
curvature etc. In addition, these results should&lt;br/&gt;yield new insight
into minimal surfaces in Euclidean space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project focuses on minimal surfaces in three-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;manifolds.
Minimal surfaces are critical points for area (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;soap films are
least area surfaces) and arise naturally in many&lt;br/&gt;problems in
mathematics and in the other sciences. Many of the&lt;br/&gt;classical results
in this area are on least area surfaces. In contrast,&lt;br/&gt;our main
interest is in high index (i.e., highly unstable) embedded
minimal&lt;br/&gt;surfaces with bounded topology - a well-known example is given
by&lt;br/&gt;the standard helicoid. Roughly speaking, the point of some of our
theorems&lt;br/&gt;is that the behavior of the helicoid is typical.&lt;br/&gt;
