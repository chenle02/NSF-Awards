9317236 Numbers This award will support the participation of ten senior and
junior U.S. investigators in a seminar entitled, "Responding to Darwin: New
Perspectives on the Darwinian Revolution" to be held at the University of Otago
in Dunedin, New Zealand, in May 1994. The American coordinator is Prof. Ronald
Numbers of the University of Wisconsin. The New Zealand organizer is Dr. John
Stenhouse of the Department of History at the University of Otago. Support of
this workshop in New Zealand is being co-funded by the Royal Society of New
Zealand and the Alexander Turnbull Library in Wellington. Participants will
employ comparative methods to explore responses to Darwinism in the U.S. and New
Zealand, as well as in Great Britain, Canada and Australia, geographical areas
bound together by common language. There exist no comprehensive studies of
Darwinism for these regions. The organizers have set forth an array of
comparative studies of the reception of evolutionary theory among religions,
races and genders.
