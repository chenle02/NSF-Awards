The hydrogeology of karst, a limestone region marked by sinks and abrupt
ridges, irregular protuberant rocks, and underground streams, is important both
to the understanding of hydrological processes and to the resolution of
groundwater pollution problems. This doctoral dissertation project will assess
the extent of groundwater pollution in a representative karst landscape in
southwestern Wisconsin, and it will define and quantify the routes by which
contaminants reach the aquifer. Groundwater testing, identification of
subsurface flow routes, and measurement of solid and sediment infiltration rates
will be used to develop a predictive model of contaminant transport and behavior
based on the hydrogeology of the dolostone karst terrain. This project will
provide valuable information about groundwater. It will lead to enhancement of
conceptual models of hydrogeological processes, and it will identify more
clearly how rapidly groundwater in karst terrains becomes polluted and
comtaminated, the mechanisms of pollution, and the potential for self-correction
of the problem. This project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a
promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.
