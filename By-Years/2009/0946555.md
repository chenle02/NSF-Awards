Dr. Andrew Kouba of the Memphis Zoo, Memphis submitted a planning visit proposal
to request a visit to Dr. Wei Fuwen, Key Laboratory of Animal Ecology and
Conservation Biology, the Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, Beijing. The purpose of the visit is to plan the next phase of a
landscape-level biodiversity conservation initiative in the Qinling Mountains of
central China. This proposed planning visit is an important step to establish a
long-term training and research program for ecosystem services and biodiversity
management at the landscape scale.
