9623094 Firestone Microbial taxonomic and functional diversity may have the
potential to determine the rate and dominance of different carbon stabilization
pathways. In this research the PI's propose to achieve three objectives, each
addressing the central question: do microbial communities vary in their ability
to determine the fate of carbon in soil? To accomplish these goals, the PI's
will assess microbial functional and taxonomic diversity, investigate community
control over carbon partitioning, and will quantify the contribution of
microbial cell walls to stable carbon. The PI's hope to involve aspects of humus
chemistry, soil microbiology and ecosystem ecology in advancing our
understanding of the role that microorganisms and microbial diversity play in
ecosystem functioning. Ultimately, this work may have implications for regional
carbon cycle models, and for predicting response of soil carbon pools to
environmental and land-use change. ??
