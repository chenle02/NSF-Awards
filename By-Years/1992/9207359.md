The Solanaceae, or tomato family, is one of the world's most economically
important plant families, and includes the large and diverse genus Solanum,
thought to encompass some 1500 to 2000 species. Despite its importance,
phylogenetic relationships in the Solanaceae as a whole and particularly those
in Solanum are poorly understood. This project will examine phylogenetic
relationships in the subfamily Solanoideae of the Solanaceae, concentrating on
sectional classification in Solanum. Previous research has shown the Solanoideae
to be a monophyletic group derived from the solanaceous subfamily Cestroideae.
Data sets to be used in phylogenetic reconstruction include restriction fragment
variation and DNA sequence information. Species will be chosen from as many
sections of Solanum as possible, with broader representation from genera in the
subfamily Solanoideae. Trees will be rooted using the Cestroideae as the
outgroup. The goal of this study is to provide a phylogenetic framework for the
subfamily, which will focus further systematic work on the group at finer levels
and provide working hypotheses of relationships for assessment of character
polarity and examination of biogeographic patterns,
