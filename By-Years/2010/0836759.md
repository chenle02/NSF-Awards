NSF and other Federal agencies will require further understanding of concepts,
methods, and means for Exascale computing systems before formulation of future
programs in enabling technologies, architectures, and methodologies. Such
understanding will drive the unknowns to be determined, the challenges to be
addressed, strategies to guide, and tasks to be performed on the way to Exascale
system realization. The objective of realizing systems capable of sustained
Exaflops computing by 2018 suggests that sponsored R&amp;D programs dedicated to
this goal be started no later than 2011 to provide sufficient time to complete
the ensemble of necessary research, design, and implementation tasks.
&lt;br/&gt;The NSF Point Design Study for Exascale Computing is a collection of
three tasks that will look at three different regimes of computing by experts in
those areas. While each is stand alone, they will benefit strongly through
cooperation and sharing of results, each being guided by the insights derived
from the others. These are 1) applications and programming models, 2) system
architecture and operating systems, and 3) hardware technology and component
design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SGER will study hardware technology and
component design aspect of the Point Design Study for Exascale
Computing.&lt;br/&gt;
