The project, PI James J. Snodgrass, proposes to address a long standing interest
among polar scientists in the adaptability and physiology of humans in the
Arctic. The project will focus on the nature of basal metabolic rates (BMR) in
Arctic peoples. Existing data from numerous research studies shows that
metabolic elevation is an apparent physiological adaptation to cold stress,
however, the causal relationship and the mechanisms of this elevation are poorly
understood. The proposed research will 1) investigate metabolic elevation and
seasonal energy dynamics; 2) clarify hormonal factors associated with metabolic
elevation; and 3) consider whether metabolic elevation shapes chronic disease
patterns among Arctic populations.
