A common problem in digital government is the significant gap between research
results and government IT practitioners, both policy and technical. On the
academic side, it is difficult and risky, especially for a young researcher, to
publish cross-disciplinary work, which is what most digital government work is.
On the government side, it is difficult to find a journal or magazine which can
effectively convey research findings. This grant will examine the existing field
of journals and magazines which may be relative to digital government, conduct a
survey of researchers and government staff as to their needs for a journal, and
characterize such a journal in terms of format, audience, peer review, and
sustainability (business model).
