In recent years there has been considerable interest in estimating the effect of
risk upon economic decisions. Applied studies have been made of the effects of
risk upon foreign exchange markets, trade flows, output and unemployment, and
stock prices. Generally the method used to model such effects has been to make
the risk term a linear or quadratic function of some observed variables. There
is increasing evidence from a number of sources that the resulting models are
generally inadequate and that the effects are, therefore, measured incorrectly.
The purpose of this project is to develop statistical procedures that enable
much better specification of the risk term. A number of methods will be
investigated ranging from the use of the residuals to identify suitable
functions to capture the risk term to non-parametric estimation techniques. This
research is important because it will develop new estimation techniques that
will strengthen empirical research in economics.
