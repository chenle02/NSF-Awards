The principal investigators, in collaboration with Dr. Frank Spera of the
University of California/Santa Barbara, will study the atomistic and
thermodynamic properties of H2O systems using computational techniques. The main
aim is to theoretically predict the behavior of H2O under temperature and
pressure conditions that are impractical for direct experimentation. Data such
as these will be especially valuable to earth scientists studying the behavior
of H2O-bearing systems that exist deep within the Earth.
