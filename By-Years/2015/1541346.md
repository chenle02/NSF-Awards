The Cyberinfrastructure (CI) Engineer at the University of Maine System improves
the utilization of existing computational infrastructure provided by the
Advanced Computing Group (ACG). This position promotes the use of advanced
computing across all campuses of the University of Maine System through live

virtual office hours. The CI Engineer assists with data management throughout
the data lifecycle, from proposal preparation through long term archiving. This
includes best practices for data security and integrity as well as the
utilization of different storage platforms for different performance needs. In
addition, the CI engineer assists individual researchers in optimizing codes
supporting individual research and inter-institutional collaborations.

The position supports the single university initiative by helping faculty, staff
and students use existing cyberinfrastructure to collaborate across campuses.
These activities provide the CI engineer with a better understanding of research
needs, so he/she also provides a voice for users in the design of future ACG
infrastructure. He/she also improves the efficiency of the University of Maine's
K-12 outreach by providing special technical support for the ACG Outreach
