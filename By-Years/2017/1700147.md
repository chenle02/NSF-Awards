The mathematical analysis of dynamical systems -- systems which evolve through
time -- has found diverse applications in fields from economics and weather
forecast to engineering and astronomy. Many systems arising from such
applications tend to exhibit chaotic behavior and can be very difficult to
analyze directly. Nevertheless, it is always possible to obtain useful
information about such systems by studying their long term behavior. The
overarching goal of this project is to develop new methods to study the long
term behavior of dynamical systems in a theoretical setting and to explore
applications to the mathematical subject of
combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspired by Furstenberg's proof of
Szemeredi's theorem using ergodic theory in 1977, several results in Ramsey
theory and combinatorial number theory were since obtained using ideas and
methods from dynamical systems. The interplay with combinatorics has likewise
enriched the fields of ergodic theory and topological dynamics with a wealth of
interesting new problems. The two main research directions of this project
are:&lt;br/&gt;1. To develop new techniques within the framework of dynamical
systems to solve Ramsey theoretic problems, with emphasis on those concerning
partition regularity of (systems of) non-linear equations.&lt;br/&gt;2. To
improve the understanding of the long term behaviour of measure preserving
systems by exploring the phenomena of multiple recurrence and convergence of
multiple ergodic averages along polynomials and other natural classes of
sequences.
