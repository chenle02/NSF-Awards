9403201 This new proposal is to study strongly correlated systems using newly
developed renormalization group techniques. The proposed work is expected to
provide some understanding of the validity of Fermi liquid theory in two
dimensions. The techniques will also be used to study effects of electron-
electron repulsion on the persistent current in mesoscopic rings. %%% One of the
open questions in the study of strongly correlated systems is whether the
conventional Fermi liquid theory is is valid in two-dimension. The proposed
research will use very efficient numerical methods to resolve this question. The
work will focus on high temperature superconductors and mesoscopic rings.
