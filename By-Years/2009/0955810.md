In the last several years large observational programs have produced results
that have led to a basic understanding of how star formation in galaxies has
evolved over cosmic time. However, an understanding of why star formation varies
as it does has remained elusive. This is primarily due to a lack of information
about the dense reservoirs of gas that serve as the fuel of star formation in
these galaxies. In this proposal Dr. Baker outlines a program to characterize
the masses, distributions, and physical conditions of the dense gas in a range
of star-forming galaxies. The core strategy of the program is to target distant
(high-redshift) galaxies that have been gravitationally lensed by foreground
galaxy clusters. This proposal will use the NSF-funded ALMA array to make
critical observations for the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will
support one graduate and one undergraduate for the duration of the grant. The
undergraduates will be participate in the Research in Science and Engineering
(RISE) program at Rutgers University, a program specially aimed at
underrepresented groups and/or first-generation college students. Additional
educational activities, such as the inclusion of modern astronomy topics in
physics classes, will take place as part of an existing collaboration between
Dr. Baker and Xavier University in New Orleans and a majority-minority high
school in Newark, New Jersey. The materials developed through this grant will
also be incorporated into the Rutgers Future Scholars program.
