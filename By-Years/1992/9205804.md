In order to understand the recycling behavior of subduction-related fluids
through forearc regions at convergent margins, and to better understand the
origins of volcanic rock types unique to forearc regions, a study of B, Li, and
10/9Be systematics will be undertaken on suites of forearc lavas from Mexico,
the Woodlark Basin and from Panama, and on serpentinites emplaced diapirically
in the Marianas and Izu forearcs. Analyses for B, Be, and Li will be conducted
by IC plasma spectrometry at Florida International University, while 10Be
measurements will be made at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism.
Measurements of B and 10Be, unquivocal indicators of a subducted origin, will
aid in identifying the sources of serpentinizing fluids in the Izu and Marianas
and the magnitude of these fluid fluxes through the forearc. As in island arc
volcanic rocks, measurements of light elements in forearc volcanics will allow
us to identify and quantify the effects of subducted components, as well as to
define the method by which trace elements are transported from the slab into
lavas. Light element data from forearcs will be compared and combined with the
existent database on arc volcanic rock in order to create a detailed model for
the chemical cycle of fluids in subduction zones.
