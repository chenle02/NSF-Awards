With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at SUNY-Stony Brook will acquire a 500 MHz solid state
NMR Spectrometer for materials chemistry and geosciences. This equipment will
enable researchers to carry out research on a) studies of anionic conductivity,
lithium-ion batteries and catalysts; b) characterization of new cation and
anion-exchange materials; c) new carbon rich compounds and nanotubes; d)
membranes for solid oxide fuel cells; e) metal doping in silicate glasses; and
f) materials that mimic phases in the earth's mantle.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of
the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in earth
science and materials science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
