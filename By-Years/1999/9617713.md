9617713 Loubere This project will reconstruct the geographic and temporal
patterns of surface ocean production in the eastern equatorial Pacific over the
past 150,000 years. Reconstructions will be based on a relationship between
taxonomic assemblage of benthic foraminifera and surface production determined
by factor and regression analysis using modern material. The project will expand
on existing work which indicates regionally complex gradients in productivity
over time, with significant differences from trends inferred using geochemical
indicators of production.
