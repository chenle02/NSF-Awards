&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
of&lt;br/&gt;2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buggy software costs
the U.S. up to $60 billion annually, so preventing&lt;br/&gt;bugs is important
to society. It is possible to prevent certain bugs by&lt;br/&gt;running a type-
checker that analyzes a program to find all errors of a&lt;br/&gt;given type.
Current type-checkers for mainstream programming languages
are&lt;br/&gt;limited: there are too many bugs they cannot express and
prevent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project enables a programmer to extend and
customize a type-checker.&lt;br/&gt;As a result, the type-checker can detect and
prevent more errors, and in&lt;br/&gt;particular the errors that the programmer
considers most important. The&lt;br/&gt;outcomes include design of new type
systems for solving real-world&lt;br/&gt;programming problems; a framework for
building custom type-checkers, in the&lt;br/&gt;context of an industrial
language (Java); and significant experience with&lt;br/&gt;real codebases to
evaluate the ideas and to generate new research&lt;br/&gt;questions. The
framework will enable a community of researchers to more&lt;br/&gt;quickly and
realistically evaluate their theories. This may encourage
more&lt;br/&gt;relevant research and lead to more impact on practice.&lt;br/&gt;
