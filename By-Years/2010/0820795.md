The End User Opt-In Working Group, which is one of five Working Groups dedicated
to particular areas of technical design for a suite of experimental network
infrastructure currently in its planning stages, holds three workshops each year
that, on a continuing basis: 1) identify and resolve design issues, 2) identify
areas of technical risk, 3) review documents prepared by the GENI Project
Office, and 4) engage in outreach. This award gives the co-chairs funds for
their participation in a one-year set of workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By
having an open, transparent, well-managed design process, the community will
have ample opportunities to comment and contribute to the design of a suite of
experimental network infrastructure. Engaging the community early in the design
process will ensure that the infrastructure will have the functionality and
capabilities required by many in the research community. Workshop topics
include: detailed open design issues and tradeoffs, risk assessment and
mitigation, common vocabulary and models, design and integration activities, use
cases, and the evaluation of software and services, for example.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chairs will be responsible for workshop preparation,
chairing workshops, results dissemination, and progress reporting. These funds
will enable the chairs to recruit a diverse set of attendees, conduct and attend
meetings, and broadly disseminate the results.
