Frostig 9507936 It has become clear just recently that the adult brain can
reorganize its connections. One of the situations during which connections seem
to change is when new behaviors are learned. With this award, Dr. Frostig will
study how the brain's representation of different sound frequencies is altered
as an animal is trained to discriminate certain frequencies. This will be done
using new techniques to repeatedly image the activity levels of brain tissue in
a non-invasive way. This work will provide new information on the time course of
plastic changes in the brain, and will allow Dr. Frostig's group to study the
relationship of specific behavioral capacities to specific changes in brain
organization. ***
