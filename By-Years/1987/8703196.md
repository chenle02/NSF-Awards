The goals of the proposed research are to understand the nature of parallel
computation, to develop theoretical foundations for the design and analysis of
algorithms for parallel computer systems, and to apply these principles to
discover appropriate parallel computer architectures and algorithms. Some of the
specific areas in which research has been and is being conducted are: (1)
parallel algorithms for a variety of natural problems, (2) models of parallel
computers and their interrelationships, (3) lower bounds or other evidence that
specific problems cannot be efficiently solved by parallel machines, and (4)
implementation and measurement of parallel algorithms on currently available
processors. This is an excellent proposal by a very fine researcher. The
proposed study of parallel computing is fundamental for progress in computer
science at this time.
