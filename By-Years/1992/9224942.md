This is an SBIR Phase II award directed to the use of unobtrusive
autostereoscopic techniques for the display of three-dimensional views. The
advantages of three-dimensional viewing are widely recognized but the
restrictive use of glasses and the lace of understanding of image acquisition
and configuration for its 3-D use have thwarted widespread acceptance in
practical applications. The teleoperation applications to be considered include
teleroboticic mining, underwater search and salvage, and medical endoscopic
microsurgery. The research concentrates on solving the problems of balanced
picture acquisition and processing, and unobtrusive viewing systems for
autostereoscopy and consider mechanical, electronic, and optical constraints
such as camera mounting, required signal bandwidth, and field of view and wide-
angle viewing. These results translate in better choices for viewer movement
range, camera configuration, and resolution.
