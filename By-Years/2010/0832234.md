SGER Abstract

0832234 Jalalabad Fab Lab Neil Gershenfeld MIT

June 9, 2008

Fab Labs are portable rapid prototyping facilities that can be deployed
worldwide to allow local manufacture of physical objects. Over the several years
that they have been in existence, they have been used for making RF components
in Norway, copier gears in India, and for education in the inner city of Boston.
A FabLab network has permitted the individual facilities to share ideas and
solutions.

A Fab Lab has been established in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, both as a base for
research and an experiment in itself in the impact of providing modern means for
invention rather than remotely-developed solutions to local problems. The
initial focus on applications in healthcare is targeting some of the most
immediate needs, which are currently constrained by the need for long supply
chains or large local inventories. As solutions are developed and tested in the
Jalalabad fab lab, they will be shared throughout the global fab lab network.
The connection with this network, along with access to rapid-prototyping
capabilities, is also expected to contribute to the regional development of
educational and economic activity.
