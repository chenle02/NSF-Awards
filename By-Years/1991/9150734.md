This project develops innovative materials and methods for teaching
communication skills in a variety of engineering courses from the first through
senior years. The project integrates the teaching of communication skills with
the teaching of the problem solving skills typical in engineering. Instructional
materials that can be used by engineering faculty themselves, including non-
native speakers of English, are produced. To supplement present methods of
teaching communication skills and to address unmet needs, "communication skills
modules" that engineering professors can use in their courses without
significant extra effort on their part and indeed that will complement
instruction in engineering problem solving skills, are developed. The modules
address written, oral, visual, and interpersonal communication skills. The
project provides a prototype for modification of the engineering curriculum to
teach communication skills in engineering courses.
