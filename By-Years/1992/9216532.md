Orientation to and location of distant unseen targets, such as mates, nest
sites or food, can be achieved by tracking odors emitted by the targets. The
path that is traveled through air or water typically exhibits a regular side-to-
side zigzagging pattern. In this award to Drs. Edmund Arbas and Mark Willis,
control systems will be identified and the manner in which these systems
interact and adapt to the unpredictable environmental conditions experienced
during pursuit of the goal will be studied. The model system is the male tobacco
hornworm moth, which locates its mate by flying up a wind-borne plume of
pheromone-attractant released by the female. Flight patterns in a wind tunnel
will be recorded by videotaping while electrical activity of the flight muscles
is monitored. The results of this research will used as the basis of computer
simulations of the behavior. This work will contribute basic knowledge about
movement control and how it is modulated by adaptations to the environment.
