The Department of Mathematics at Southern Methodist University will purchase a
highshared memory machine. . The equipment and software purchased with this
grant will be used for five research projects involving seven faculty and five
graduate students. These projects are: dynamics and instabilities in
semiconductor lasers; modeling multiphase contaminant flows in porous media;
parallel software for two-point boundary value problems; continuation methods
for analyzing chemical pattern formation and multiscale methods for integral
formulation of elliptic and parabolic equations.
