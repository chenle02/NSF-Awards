Most species have evolved reproductive strategies to insure that offspring are
born during a time of year that provides maximum survival potential. Length of
day supplemented by other environmental cues are used to predict these times.
Although much progress has been made in understanding how photoperiodic
information is perceived by animals, the tranduction of this information to
hormonal signals that control reproductive function is still not well
understood. The overall objectives of these studies is to identify brain
mechanisms by which daylength influences the release of pituitary hormone that
in turn regulate reproductive function. The golden hamster becomes
reproductively active in the long days of summer and reproductively quiesent
during winter. Natural changes in length of the light and dark portions of the
day (less the 12.5h of light secretion rates of pituitary) hormones. Then, he
will use drugs that affect specific chemical (neurotransmitter) systems in the
brain to see if he can mimic or block the affects of daylength on hormone
secretion and reproductive activity. The pineal gland, a small structure within
the brain, is important in mediating the effects of daylength on reproductive
function. The action of melatonin, the principal hormone of the pineal gland, on
neurotransmitters and hormone secretion is not understood. He plans to study the
effects of melatonin administration or removal of the pineal gland on the
metabolism of brain neurotransmitters and hormone secretion. The results of
these experiments should have important implications for understanding the
control of reproductive function by both internal and external factors. Although
he is specifically studying affects of daylength on reproductive function, the
conclusions based on these studies are applicable to our understanding of how a
variety of external stimuli such as food affect reproductive function.
