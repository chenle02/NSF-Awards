While the concept of competition for mutualists has attracted considerable
attention during the past century, few studies have provided direct experimental
evidence documenting its occurrence. This absence is particularly evident for
homopteran-ant associations. The proposed research is designed to experimentally
evaluate the hypothesis that neighboring homopteran aggregations
intraspecifically compete for the services of an ant mutualist. Manipulative
experiments have previously demonstrated that the membracid Publilia modesta
(Homoptera) benefits from being tended by the ant Formica occulta in most years.
A series of experiments will evaluate the following hypotheses: (1) ants are a
limited resource for membracids, (2) the number of ants tending membracids, and
not just the presence of ants, has a significant impact on membracid fitness,
(3) intra- and interspecific variation in host-plant quality influences the
chemical composition of membracid honeydew and therefore the ability of
membracids to compete for ants, and (4) tending ants benefit membracids by
reducing the impact of predatory spiders (Pellenes sp.). Such experimental
studies will provide needed insight into the dynamics of mutualistic interaction
in spatially-variable environments.
