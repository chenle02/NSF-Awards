EAR-9005218 Junta, Jodi L. The principal objective of this research is to test
the hypothesis that clay minerals can nucleate and grown in/on leached layers
produced by the OweatheringO (hydrolysis) of other silicates. Because aluminum
is ubiquitous in nature, a second logical objective is to document how aqueous
aluminum reacts with leached layers. To achieve these objectives, the Fellow
will use a dual approach, combining wet-chemical solution methods with
microscopic and spectroscopic analyses to quantify how weathered silicates can
react with aluminum to form clay minerals. The study will demonstrate how clay
minerals nucleate and grow in soils. This research has implications for
understanding the cycling of excess aluminum released by acid rain. The
techniques mastered by the Fellow during this work will open up new research
avenues to study the cycling of environmentally or economically important heavy
metals in other settings.
