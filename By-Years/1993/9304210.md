An interdisciplinary project on sustainable forestry in tropical dry forests in
Quintana Roo (QR), Mexico will be conducted. The project will help to implement
and evaluate the Plan Piloto Forestal. Data on tree growth and regeneration will
improve a computer-based model that has been developed to plan tree cutting
rotations. The impacts of sustainable forestry on the local avifauna, an
important component of biodiversitiy, will also be evaluated. The project has
four primary objectives: (1) quantify species- specific growth rates of
commercially important tree species, with an emphasis on the influence of soil
type and between-year differences in rainfall, (2) quantify natural regeneration
of commercially important species with an emphasis on seed production and
seedling establishment, survival, and growth, (3) evaluate the use of a
silvicultural treatment "refinement" to enhance the growth of commercially
important species by removal of their neighbors, and (4) evaluate the effects of
selective logging on the abundance and species composition of the local
avifauna.
