Following the example of the previous three successful Georgia Algebraic
Geometry Symposia at the University of Georgia, this award will support
participation in a cycle of three conferences rotating among major research
universities in Georgia: Emory, University of Georgia, and Georgia Tech. The
first conference will take place at Emory University on October 16-18, 2015. The
second conference will take place at the University of Georgia in October 2016,
and the third at Georgia Tech in October 2017. The aim is to sustain and grow
collaborations between mathematicians in the Southeast, and to nurture a new and
diverse generation of students and postdocs, by providing a regular series of
exciting mathematical activities and a forum to meet peers and attend talks by
leading experts in the field.

Algebraic geometry and arithmetic geometry are some of the most established and
active areas of mathematics and have deep connections with many other subjects.
In addition to their central role in mathematics, they have important
applications in encryption, physics, engineering, biology, and a host of other
sciences. The conferences will aim at presenting the latest advances in these
fields to a wide audience of local researchers, students, and postdocs.
