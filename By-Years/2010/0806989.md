This project is providing scholarships and support systems to recruit and retain
academically talented, economically disadvantaged students from underrepresented
classes with a special focus on students of color and first-generation students.
The Bradley University STEM Scholars program enrolls high school and community
college students from a large, high-needs, urban school district and provides
them financial and academic support, enrichment opportunities, and career
placement support. This STEM Scholars program is providing $5,000 scholarships
per year to 13 incoming freshman and 30 transfer students over a 4-year period.
Student retention is supported by a comprehensive program designed to provide
students with enhanced science, technology, engineering, and math backgrounds
prior to beginning their STEM studies at the university, and offer a variety of
academic, social, and career oriented programs, including peer mentoring and
tutoring, faculty mentoring, undergraduate research, work-study jobs, and
participation in student organizations and cultural
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program is contributing directly to the
advancement of knowledge in STEM disciplines while enabling members of
underrepresented and financially needy groups to achieve their educational
goals. Partnering institutions include members and partners of PeoriaNEXT, a
community-wide consortium of which Bradley University is a member. Other members
include Caterpillar, National Center for the Agricultural Utilization Research
(one of 4 United States Department of Agriculture agencies), and the University
of Illinois College of Medicine in Peoria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
