9410454 Hackney The program examines the morphological stability of precipitates
which form in the initial stages of precipitation at the interface between
dissimilar materials in ternary systems. This program is unique in its focus on
the lateral growth instabilities which occur during initial precipitate growth
perpendicular to the direction of interdiffusion. A quantitative hypothesis has
been developed which predicts how the addition of a third element affects
morphological development during the lateral growth of interfacial reaction
products. The prediction of the ternary effect is a function of the slope of the
solvus with composition in an isothermal section of the ternary phase diagram
and the degree of resistance to interdiffusion at the interface between the
dissimilar materials. A critical experimental test of this hypothesis is to be
carried out by studying precipitate morphology as the composition and interface
characteristics are varied in a systematic manner. %%% The results of this grant
could impact important processes in technology, such as diffusion bonding of
different materials and/or reactions of substrates with thin metal films. ***
