Extreme air pollution events pose a considerable threat: it is estimated that
currently air pollution is causing 7 million deaths annually and without action
air pollution will also be the largest environmental cause of premature deaths
by 2050. While meteorology sets the stage for the occurrence of dangerous
pollutant levels pollution events do not occur in isolation but involve the
interplay between the atmosphere's dynamical and chemical systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will bridge the gap between two separate
lines of inquiry into extreme pollution events: one through studies of the
dynamics of the atmosphere, the other through studies of atmospheric chemistry
and aerosols. The relation between meteorological events and extreme pollution
events is still not sufficiently understood. This research will further quantify
this relationship, going beyond the proximal meteorological cause of extreme
pollution events so as to understand these events within the context of the
general circulation of the atmosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent advances in
the theory of atmospheric transport and mixing have shown the value of an
objective diagnostic of the waviness of the jet stream and the associated
synoptic cyclones and anticyclones as quantified through wave activity. Changes
in wave activity and their relationship to air pollution events will be
elucidated. These simplifying diagnostics have the potential to transform
understanding of the relation between atmospheric circulation and air pollution
events using dynamical insights into the underlying climate system. In
particular they will allow a more robust understanding of how future climate
will impact air pollution through changes in circulation.
