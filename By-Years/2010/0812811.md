Astrophysical plasmas are rarely observed to be static. Instead
they&lt;br/&gt;vary strongly in both time and space, a phenomena known as
turbulence.&lt;br/&gt;Such plasmas are also typically endowed with magnetic
fields, just&lt;br/&gt;like the Earth and the Sun. An understanding of
turbulence in&lt;br/&gt;magnetized plasmas (known as MHD turbulence) is thus
required to&lt;br/&gt;understand a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena, from
the solar&lt;br/&gt;wind in our solar system (and how the solar wind impacts
Earth) to&lt;br/&gt;rotating disks of gas falling into black holes (which
produce some of&lt;br/&gt;the brightest sources of light in the Universe). Our
proposed&lt;br/&gt;research is aimed at understanding the behavior of MHD
turbulence on&lt;br/&gt;small scales where the energy is converted into
heat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to carry out large-scale numerical
calculations of the&lt;br/&gt;properties of MHD turbulence on small scales.
These calculations will&lt;br/&gt;predict observable properties of the
turbulence that can be directly&lt;br/&gt;compared to measurements in the solar
wind, and ultimately to&lt;br/&gt;measurements in the laboratory on Earth. The
same calculations will&lt;br/&gt;predict how plasmas are heated when the energy
contained in the&lt;br/&gt;turbulence is dissipated -- one of the major unsolved
problems in our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of turbulence. These results will be
compared to&lt;br/&gt;measurements in the solar wind; they will also be used to
predict the&lt;br/&gt;light we see from plasma falling into black holes -- our
primary&lt;br/&gt;observational window onto black holes in nature. More broadly,
the&lt;br/&gt;calculations proposed here will advance the state-of-the-art
in&lt;br/&gt;numerical modeling of turbulence in magnetized plasmas and will
have&lt;br/&gt;implications for a wide variety of laboratory, space,
and&lt;br/&gt;astrophysical plasmas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
