The objective of this research is to overcome fundamental performance
limitations in today's lightwave communications devices by using a hybrid
nanophotonic waveguide cross-section, consisting of a bonded stack of silicon
and of a ferroelectric oxide, e.g., lithium niobate. The approach is that
modulators and nonlinear optoelectronic devices will be fabricated using the
hybrid material, formed by oxide thin films being transferred onto a planarized
silicon photonic chip using a low-temperature plasma-assisted bonding process
which preserves diodes and transistors in the silicon
chip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal is to
realize, via use of this hybrid material system, optoelectronic devices that
perform beyond the possibility frontier of devices fabricated using either
material system alone. In the context of silicon photonics, the project will
demonstrate a robust and high nonlinearity without sacrificing high index
contrast. The project will also demonstrate more complex waveguide structures
than possible in conventional lithium niobate structures.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this proposal is firstly, to benefit
the information-driven infrastructure needs of modern society by enabling faster
data networks without increasing energy consumption. Secondly, this GOALI
collaboration between a university and a small business, both having committed
interest in this area of research, involves two-way researcher visits, and
technology and knowledge transfer. Results from this collaboration will be
published in peer-reviewed literature, will form components of graduate student
thesis research, and will provide a roadmap to future commercialization by
interested parties. The project also target opportunities for interdisciplinary
education and training of underrepresented groups.
