The long term goal of this fundamental bioengineering proposal is to produce a
new computational technique for voice recognition. Voice control of the
environment of a quadriplegic is extremely important. Such a method could
provide the physically disabled with a greater degree of control of the space
surrounding them than is now currently available. This project will carry out
research needed to recognize all English phonemes and to verify the feasibility
of using the concept in an associative processor.
