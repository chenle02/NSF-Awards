Many organisms exerperience periodic drops in population numbers (bottlenecks).
The consequences of these bottlenecks upon he evolutonary potential of the
species (i.e., how they might repsond to novel selection pressures in a new
environment) is largely unknown for all buth the simplest of circumstances. The
proposed research will experimentally investigate the effects of bottlenicks
upon the evolutionary potential by assessing response to artificial selection on
composite traits in bottlenicked populations. The research will investigate
specific hypotheses about how various components of genetic variance affect
these composite traits and how these components respond to bottlenecks and
contribute to the artificial selection response. The main thrust of the proposed
research is to provide an empirical test of speciation theory via bottlenecks,
but results will also affect management for endangered specites. The potential
loss of adaptability as a results of population bottlenecks is a major concern
in the management of captive and endangered species and we need to know the
extent that species are in jeopardy of extinction as a result of small
population size. the results of the research will contribute to ur
understainding of how bottlencks affact genetic bariances within populations and
thus can be used to guide management strategies for survival of endangered
species.
