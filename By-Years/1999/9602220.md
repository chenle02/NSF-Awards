Case Western Reserve University has made a major commitment to revitalize its
Department of Chemistry. Funding from the National Science Foundation will
enable the institution in this endeavor by renovating research and research
training areas. Currently the Chemistry Department is separated between the
Morely Chemical Laboratory and the Millis Building. Laboratories housed within
Morely, originally built in 1908, are dilapidated, and would be inordinately
expensive to rectify conditions due to structural and spatial constraints.
Constructed in 1962, research space in Millis has serious inadequacies as a site
to conduct modern, sophisticated research in the traditional areas of organic,
inorganic, and physical chemistry. The project entails repairing Millis in order
to consolidate the department in one building, thus ameliorating the dispersion
and fragmentation of research groups and shared equipment. Renovations include
upgrading laboratory layouts to current standards of efficiency and safety. New
air management and environmental control systems will improve air quality and
energy efficiency. Deteriorated fume hood, lab benches, cabinets, and sinks will
be replaced or refurbished. Laboratory and access elements that are not fully
ADA compatible are to be replaced, and a sprinkler system will be installed for
fire safety. Improved facilities will not only enhance the Department's
contributions to high priority research, but it will strengthen training
opportunities needed to sustain its recruitment of a highly qualified and
diverse group of students.
