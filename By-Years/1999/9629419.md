This research is on a data structure, Pseudo-Symmetric Binary Decision Diagrams
(PSBDDs), for completely specified Boolean functions. It is based on Ordered
Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) and symmetric networks. The structure of an
OBDD for a totally symmetric function is used as a model for PSBDDs. The Shannon
expansion is used to generate the vertices of PSBDDs. There is a join operation
which combines two adjacent vertices such that the function is represented as a
pseudo-symmetric network instead of a binary tree. The research consists of: a)
developing a PSBDD package with four types of symmetry; b) investigating the
best heuristic for variable ordering, and ordering sets of symmetric variables;
c) comparing mapping results for large functions between PSBDDs and BDDs; d)
developing strategies for efficient generation of PSBDDs for incompletely
specified functions; e) developing diagrams using Davio I and Davio II
expansions; and f) suggesting new architectures for Cellular-Architecture type
FPGAs which are design-automation friendly.
