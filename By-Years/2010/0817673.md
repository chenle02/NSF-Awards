Drawing from theories and empirical work on gender in the workplace, aging, and
sociolegal studies, this study of workplace harassment will assess how the power
that older workers hold across a variety of domains including work, family, and
community life shapes their harassment experiences and responses to those
experiences. The study involves collecting and analyzing survey data on the
workplace harassment experiences of 800 Maine workers aged 62 and above. These
results will then be used to create a generalized theoretical model which
outlines how age and other dimensions of power operate together to shape
victimization and mobilization experiences. Four fundamental questions frame the
proposed study: 1) What is the content of older workers? harassment
experiences?; 2) Within the current social context, which older workers are most
likely to become targets of workplace harassment?; 3) How do older workers come
to label their experiences with potentially harassing behaviors as harassment
and how do they go on to respond?; and 4) What general model of age, power,
victimization, and mobilization can be drawn from this study? In addition to
bringing together several areas of sociological inquiry to present a unified
model of age, power, victimization, and mobilization, this study will provide
new information relevant to public policies on harassment and discrimination in
the workplace. Given evidence of an aging workforce now is an especially
important time to become familiar with the workplace experiences of older
adults.

Broader Impacts. Study results will be used to develop a larger-scale
comparative investigation of workplace harassment over the life cycle. The
research will also promote teaching, training, and learning by involving
research assistants at both the undergraduate and graduate level, offering them
experience with data collection, analysis, writing, and collaboration with local
agencies.
