Mathematics inspired by physics has successfully provided the background and the
language for most sophisticated areas of modern physics. In this project the
principal investigators aim to create new algebraic and geometric tools helping
to formulate ideas and methods of quantum physics in a precise mathematical way.
Specifically, the team will combine its members' past experience and
achievements to construct new Topological Quantum Field Theories for manifolds
with additional structures. Inspired by Witten's Chern-Simons theory and
invariants of 3-manifolds that are known now as Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev
invariants, the principal investigators will explore their new Field Theories
with the objective to find physical definitions for the resulting topological
invariants of manifolds. This work is stimulated by several fundamental examples
and will open the door to new research avenues in algebra, topology, geometry,
mathematical physics, and related areas of mathematics. The broader impacts of
the project belong to two main categories: mentoring and outreach. The members
of the research team are currently mentoring a total of twelve PhD students.
They will advise graduate students on projects related to the main objectives of
the grant. The outreach component is to organize several workshops and
conferences aimed at developing communication and collaborative research between
participants of the project, establishing scientific connections with other
mathematicians, as well as fostering broader applications of this work.

In 1999, Turaev introduced Homotopy Quantum Field Theories (HQFTs), which are
generalizations of Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs) studied by
Schwartz, Witten, and Atiyah. HQFTs produce topological invariants of manifolds
furnished with extra data that add supplementary topology/geometry to the
context of TQFTs. Most of the theory of quantum invariants and HQFTs involves
monoidal categories which have certain additional properties like being semi-
simple. In various collaborations started in 2005, the team members developed a
theory of re-normalized Quantum Invariants that derives non-trivial topological
invariants from non-semi-simple categories. In this project the principal
investigators will further use renormalization to develop non-trivial HQFTs,
based on the examples coming from the theory of unrestricted quantum group.
These new HQFTs should share the strength and the new features of the re-
normalized Quantum Invariants. The principal investigators will further search
for a physical interpretation of these new invariants.
