This award to the University of Lowell is made in response to a proposal
submitted to the NSF's Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program, a
program whose goal is to extend support for undergraduate instructional
instrumentation. The award will provide one-half of the funds needed to acquire
surface and balloon observational equipment for real-time acquisition and
processing of meteorological data. The University of Lowell is committed to
matching the NSF contribution for this equipment. The instrumentation will be
used to enhance the undergraduate meteorology curriculum and to provide students
with the opportunity to acquire and process meteorological data.
