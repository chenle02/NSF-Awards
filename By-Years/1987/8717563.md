Drs. Rose Ann Cattolico and Jeanine Olsen of the University of Washington are
employing state-of-the-art tools of molecular biology to sequence ribosomal
genes of select green algae in order to construct a framework of evolutionary
divergence for the main lineages of Chlorophyta. DNA sequence analysis provides
a powerful analytical tool in understanding the phylogenetic relationships among
organisms; direct comparisons can be made between samples of genetic material
and measurements obtained of the amount of base-pair (mutational) change leading
to present species. Little work of this kind has been done with algal groups,
although algae are worldwide in distribution, important in ecological function,
and significant in understanding the origins of land plants. Dr. Cattolico has
been a leader in molecular-biological studies of various groups of algae. Dr.
Olsen, a recent Ph.D., has training in both traditional and modern molecular
approaches to the study of algae. Together they make an ideal team for the study
of algal phylogeny using new biochemical methods.
