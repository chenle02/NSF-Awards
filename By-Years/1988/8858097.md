Professor Goldberg's primary research interests can be divided into two
interrelated areas: algorithms and parallel distributed computation. The purpose
of Professor Goldberg's research in the first area is to develop more efficient
algorithms for problems that arise in practice. such improved algorithms reduce
computational requirements for the corresponding applications and may allow
computerized solutions of problems that are infeasible to solve on a computer
using previous algorithms. Professor Goldberg studies sequential as well as
parallel and distributed algorithms. He is also interested in implementation and
experimental evaluation of algorithms. Parallel processing is being recognized
as one of the most promising ways to wider the class of problems that are
feasible to solve by computers. Massively parallel machines are now available
commercially. Taking advantage of parallelism, however, often requires special
methods. Professor Goldberg is interested in designing efficient parallel and
distributee algorithms for computation-intensive problems. In addition to design
of parallel and distributed algorithms for specific problems, he is interested
in general techniques for developing parallel and distributed algorithms. He
also studies the features of parallel architectures and distributed systems
which facilitate efficient implementations of algorithms.
