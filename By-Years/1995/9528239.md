9528239 Munchow In this project, the PIs will conduct an observational study of
coastal upwelling circulation on a wide continental shelf -- the mid-Atlantic
Bight off New Jersey. The objectives are: 1. To resolve the mass balance, as to
whether it is two or three- dimensional; 2. To determine the primary subsurface
across-shelf transport pathway and the dynamical importance of along-shelf
pressure gradient; 3. To determine criteria for formation of an upwelling front,
and find its role in the mass and heat fluxes; 4. To determine where the zone of
maximum upwelling occurs; and, 5. To find the principal terms in the heat
budget. A variety of moored and ship-board instruments, and satellite-tracked
drifters, as well as satellite imagery of temperature and color will be used.
