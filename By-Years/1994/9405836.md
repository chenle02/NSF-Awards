9405836 Haimson The PI will conduct laboratory experiments on borehole breakouts
and core disking under far-field boundary conditions and stress paths most
closely simulating real field situations. Tests will be carried out on a granite
and a sandstone. Samples will be carefully characterized microstructurally for
failure mechanisms. The net result will be a more realistic simulation of the
two related phenomena, a better understanding of the strength criteria leading
to core and borehole failure, and practical conclusions regarding the
relationships of breakouts and core disks to in situ stress magnitudes in terms
of working models and calibrated numerical models for each of the two rock
types. ****
