Professor Cowen will study the structure of bounded linear operator on the
Hardy space, the Bergman space, and related spaces of analytic functions on the
unit disk. He will continue his investigations of composition operators,
Toeplitz operators, and related operators. His investigations will be carried
out with particular emphasis on providing research projects for both graduate
and undergraduate students. Professor Cowen's research involves the theory of
Hilbert space operators. These objects can be thought of as infinite matrices of
complex numbers. They occur in almost all branches of pure and applied
mathematics. The research being done here is an attempt to understand and
classify certain families of these operators.
