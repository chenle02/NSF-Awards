0322455&lt;br/&gt;Khairoutdinov&lt;br/&gt;This project consists of fundamental
dynamical studies of artificial closed bilayer membranes containing photochromic
ion transporters and ion channels. Its primary purpose is to develop new classes
of supramolecular systems that can be reversibly switched by light from
electrically conducting to nonconducting states. The design concept is based on
the PI recent finding that light illumination could result in the translocation
of some photochromic molecules from the membrane interior to the membrane-water
interface. Specifically, several types of optically switchable supramolecular
ion channels will be constructed and studied that are capable of transmembrane
ion transport. They include photosensitive gramicidin A and amphiphilic
poly(L-glutamate) containing covalently attached dye molecules and double
crowned spiropyran assemblies. Their functioning is based either on photoinduced
formation or alteration of the channel conformation or on the light-induced
formation of ion-conducting polar sites within the membrane.
