This is a Post Doctoral Fellowship project that supports the research and
trainging of Post Doctoral Fellow Dr. Alessandro Jaker who will study under the
direction of Dr. Siri Tuttle, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Alaska Native
Languages Center. The project will extend the Fellow's research on how Dogrib
and Chipewayan experienced a major prosodic shift (language tones) in their
language. The Fellow proposes to do this through a detailed phonological study
of northern Athabaskan languages including the collection of verb paradigms,
elders' stories, and experiments aimed to assess consonant length and
germination, and correlates of stress. An important part of the project is the
documentation of these languages and the creation of language teaching and
learning materials for use by heritage speaker communities.
