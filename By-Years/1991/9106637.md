The objective of the proposed program is to strengthen research in materials
science and engineering at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus. To
accomplish this, a variety of activities will be implemented. Research
infrastructure will be strengthened by faculty and Hispanic student involvement
in the following projects: o Synthesis and Spectroscopic Characterization of
High- Transition Temperature Superconductors o Development of a Rapid
Solidification Facility o Development of Bacterial Polymers as Biodegradable
Plastics o Research Centered around a Laser Interferometric Displacement Gage
and a Mechanical Testing System o Adsorption Microcalorimetric Studies in
Heterogeneous Catalysis: The Relationship between Site Strength and Catalytic
activity. Additional activities to enhance the competitiveness of the faculty
will include annual symposia and two yearly short courses on materials science
and engineering, summer minisabbaticals in mainland research laboratories, and
frequent attendance to national scientific meetings.
