Abstract/Street ATM-9526246 A well defined set of numerical experiments is
proposed for an investigation of turbulent flow over complex terrain. The
objective is the simulation and analysis of flow features crucial in the physics
of dispersion and mixing over topography and for the improvement of mesoscale
atmospheric simulation, (e.g., lee waves, wave breaking, flow separation, and
orographic drag). An important first step towards improved understanding of
these features in the atmosphere is their accurate simulation at model
(laboratory) scales. The proposed extension of a set of simulation tools
developed under a previous NSF grant contains the elements necessary for
accurate simulation of model-scale atmospheric flows. The research strategy is
to: develop the numerical tools, validate and test the toolds, and investigate
turbulent flow over several arrangements of terrain. Simulation of laboratory-
sized geophysical flows over complex terrain would contribute to field-scale
atmospheric simulations in two ways: through the improvement of approximate
boundary conditions and parameterizations for mesoscale simulations, and through
direct insight into the flow physics.
