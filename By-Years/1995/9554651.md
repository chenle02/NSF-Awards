The teaching of undergraduate mathematics courses for future school teachers is
being enriched by week-long summer workshops for college and university faculty
in which they will: Goal 1. experience new teaching strategies and techniques.
Goal 2. experience examples of non-test based assessment schemes. Goal 3. learn
about and observe these and other examples of pedagogical techniques that have
been successful in encouraging women and underrepresented minorities to excel in
mathematics. Goal 4. learn new subject matter and experience new instructional
materials being produced by the Cornell Undergraduate Geometry Project which
relate both modern and rarely studied geometry topics with the mathematics
subject matter of the middle and high schools. Goal 5. have the opportunity to
interact and share with colleagues and experts who have common interests in the
teaching of mathematics to future school teachers, and to develop plans to
incorporate both teaching techniques and new curricular materials into their own
courses. Goal 6. learn about and share ideas concerning the recent
recommendations, guidelines and standards put forth by the Mathematical Sciences
Education Board (MSEB), the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM),
and in publications of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) concerning
changes in the teaching of undergraduate mathematics. Goal 7. be committed to
participate after the workshop in several of the planned follow-up activities.
