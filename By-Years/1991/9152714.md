The goal of this project is to develop an optics laboratory to provide
undergraduate students the opportunity for broader exposure to both traditional
and modern optics. A number of new optics experiments are being added to an
existing optics laboratory. A set of new experiments in traditional and
contemporary optics are being developed: Michelson Interferometry, polarization,
birefringence, measurements on optical fibers, optical properties of solids. The
equipment is also improving an existing laser spectroscopy laboratory suitable
for physics seniors. The new capabilities allow students to investigate a broad
range of optics and thus help build a broader physics curriculum.
