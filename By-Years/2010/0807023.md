The USF STARS program is providing 25 scholarships per year to academically
talented and financially needy students to increase the retention of STEM
transfer students through graduation, with emphasis on students from
underrepresented groups, including women, minorities, and students with
disabilities. This program offers a viable transfer pathway for students at
community colleges (CC) and non-Engineering degree granting (e.g. dual degree)
programs into Engineering. Also, this project leverages existing student
enhancement programs developed and implemented at USF to improve the recruitment
and retention of STEM transfer students through graduation.
