This project is building a high-performance distributed storage system using
communication switches and workstations. Data to be stored will be distributed
across the workstations and will be retrieved using the communication network
between the workstations. Research issues to be addressed include identification
of hardware and software bottlenecks, limits to system scaling, scheduling of
multimedia I/O in a distributed system, and the implications of I/O on switch
architecture. Education is a part of this project; plans include a graduate
course on I/O systems, an undergraduate laboratory in computer architecture, and
use of the machine developed during the research as a testbed for the graduate
course.
