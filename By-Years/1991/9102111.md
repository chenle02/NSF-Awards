This project will investigate Floquet exponents, Floquet expansions, and
related properties of solutions to elliptic and parabolic equations with
periodic coefficients. Emphasis will be placed on the understanding of the
geometry of the set of Floquet exponents, expansion of solutions in terms of
Floquet solutions, and the connections between the geometry of the Floquet
exponents and the properties of the given equation. These studies have been
motivated by problems arising in areas of mathematical physics such as stability
theory, quantum theory of solids, hydrodynamics, and inverse scattering theory.
