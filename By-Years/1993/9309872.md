This is a Career Advancement Award which will support the Sabbatical research of
the PI. This grant will allow the PI to extend her research into the digital
hardware/software area. She will work at IIT on the design of low-power,
battery-operated, limited-memory devices for implantable debribillators. Her
present area of expertise is in the area of signal processing algorithms to
detect cardiac arrhythmia and therefore this project will allow her to implement
some of the algorithms in hardware and gain practical experience in this field.
