9423616 The Neurotransmitter dopamine has been strongly implicated in the
physiological regulation of "simple" behaviors, such as motor control, as well
as in higher order cognitive function. This work addresses the functional
consequences of perturbing the normally exquisitely regulated levels of dopamine
in the nervous system by manipulation of the regulatory mechanisms directing
dopamine synthesis. The choice of Drosophila melanogaster as the model system
facilitates the use of molecular genetic techniques to circumvent limitations
encountered in other systems. These studies take advantage of recombinant DNA
methodology to (1) modulate the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-
limiting biosynthetic enzyme in the synthesis of dopamine, and (2) determine the
functional consequences of perturbing these mechanisms in the intact animal.
