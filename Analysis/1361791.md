Despite the ubiquity of wave phenomena, the mathematical analysis of the
dynamics of such free boundary problems still presents great challenges of
significant current interest to the research community, understanding the
mechanisms of singularities, wave breaking and rogue waves is of great
importance to science and engineering. The PI proposes to continue her study on
the evolution of water waves. The focus in this funding period is on
understanding singularities as well as long time behaviors of the water wave
motion. The PI will use rigorous analytical tools to tackle the problems.
Through involving graduate students and post doctors, the project will provide a
training ground for a younger generation of researchers.

The mathematical problem of water waves concerns the motion of the interface
separating an inviscid, incompressible, irrotational fluid, under the influence
of gravity, from a region of zero density in two and three space dimensions,
neglecting surface tension. In prior funding periods, the PI showed that the
Taylor sign condition always holds, and obtained the local well-posedness of the
two and three dimensional water wave problems for arbitrary (smooth) data. And
the PI showed that the nature of the nonlinearity of the water wave problems are
of cubic or higher orders, and obtained the almost global well-posedness for the
two dimensional and global well-posedness for the three dimensional water wave
problems for small and smooth initial data. Furthermore, to understand singular
behaviors in the water wave motion, the PI constructed a class of self-similar
solutions for the two dimensional water wave equation in the regime where
convection is in dominance. The PI proposes to continue her study of
singularities as well as the long time behaviors of the water wave motion.
Particular problems include the stability of the self-similar solution she
constructed and the long time evolution for a broader class of initial data. The
objective is to achieve good understanding of a basic type of waves--waves with
angled crests, and its role in the long time water wave motion, and to obtain
better understanding of dispersion and the structure of the water wave
equations.
