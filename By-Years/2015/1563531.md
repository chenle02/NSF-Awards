This research project aims to create improved mathematical models for predicting
the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. These models can be used to help guide
public health workers in improving the effectiveness of intervention strategies
for mitigating the impact of these diseases. The project focuses on analyzing
approaches that have the potential for optimizing mitigation strategies for
controlling chikungunya, dengue fever, and Zika virus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
partial differential equation mosquito-borne disease transmission models under
development in this project will account for spatial heterogeneity in the
population density of the mosquito and host populations. The research aims to
create a new two-sex model that can account for both vertical and horizontal
transmission of bacterial control measures, such as using Wolbachia to mitigate
the disease spread. The mathematical analysis of these models will include
quantifying the uncertainty in the model forecasts for multiple species of
mosquitoes.
