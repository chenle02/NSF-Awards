This research is on test methods for mixed signal and analog VLSI systems.
Aspects being considered are: 1) design of high-speed dynamic current sensors
for application in iDD pulse response test method, for mixed-mode, MOS and
bipolar circuits; 2) development of high-speed static current sensors for
utilization with the IDDQ test method; 3) verification of a dual to the IDDQ
test scheme for analog circuits (denoted VDDQ testing). Approaches are: a) on-
chip generation and comparison of VDDQ voltage references, and b) external
measurement of VDDQ voltages using analog boundary scan test techniques to bring
them out of chip in analog form using sample and hold circuits or in digital
form after performing on-chip A /D conversion. Research activities designing,
manufacturing and evaluating various integrated circuit prototypes of built-in
dynamic and static current sensors and of VDDQ test circuitry.
