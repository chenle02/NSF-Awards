Spreadsheets are the most commonly used programming environment in the world;
there are more than 750 million users of Microsoft Excel alone. Spreadsheets are
widely used in government, scientific, and financial settings; over 95% of US
firms use them for financial reporting and 85% use them for budgeting and
forecasting. Unfortunately, errors are endemic to spreadsheets; a recent study
found an error rate of over 95%. Spreadsheet errors have had catastrophic
consequences, leading to losses of billions of dollars. This project uses
automatic analysis techniques designed specifically for spreadsheets to (a)
automatically detect and help prevent errors in spreadsheets, dramatically
increasing the reliability of their calculations, (b) reduce the risks of
serious mistakes, and (c) potentially save the economy millions if not billions
of dollars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops statistical and
structural analyses for spreadsheets (S3). Spreadsheets have unique features
that make them different from standard programming languages, and thus demand
new program analyses that exploit their characteristics. S3 employs statistical
analyses over the spatial and deep structure of spreadsheet formulas to identify
spreadsheet cells that are highly anomalous and thus likely to be wrong. S3
reduces the problem of finding data and formula errors to that of finding
anomalous structures via a novel vector representation that combines spatial and
structural information (including patterns of dependencies). Applying
statistical analyses across these vectors can then identify formulas that are
highly unusual in any dimension, and thus likely to be wrong. S3 operates both
at an individual spreadsheet level and also incorporates learned models of
spreadsheet usage from large bodies of existing spreadsheets to condition the
analysis and further reduce false positive rates.
