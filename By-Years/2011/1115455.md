The PIs propose several investigations in computational arithmetic geometry.
These include the further development of generic group algorithms and numerical
computation of p-adic cohomology, the further investigation of the distribution
of Frobenius eigenvalues of curves of low genus, and the efficient computation
and tabulation of modular polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational
arithmetic geometry in general, and the proposed research in particular, bears
relevance to several aspects of applied computer science, including the reliable
transmission and storage of digital data and the security of electronic
communication. In addition to research, the proposed activities also include
undergraduate participation in algorithm and software development, integrating
research and training activities while producing tools of high value to the
research community.
