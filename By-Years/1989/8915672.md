This research will assess the computational utility of approximate inertial
manifolds by means of a simpler Benard convection system in two-and three-
dimensional geometries. Solutions of the Benard system are known to become more
and more complicated as the energy input to the system is increased, and so the
analytical and numerical methods developed by the investigators will be of great
use in studying more complicated fluid dynamical phenomena governed by the
Navier-Stokes equations. Many physical systems that are nonlinear in nature have
solutions that diaplay increasingly complicated behavior as some external
parameter is varied. This proposal concerns the study of heat conduction inside
two-and three-dimensional containers filled with liquid both analytically and
numerically. The insight gained from the study of this canonical system will aid
in our understanding of much more complicated phenomena related to turbulence
and chaos.
