This research focuses on the synthesis and characterization of molecules, called
photoacids, that exhibit changes in acid-base properties on optical excitation.
Synthetic methodologies will be developed to achieve molecules whose
photoacidity can be tailored thereby providing new methods for studies of proton
transfer reactions and novel polymerization catalysts. The research introduces
graduate and postdoctoral students to new concepts in acid-base chemistry and
kinetics, and to the methodologies to examine these transient effects. With this
award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of
Professor Laren Tolbert of the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Georgia
Institute of Technology. Professor Tolbert will focus his research efforts on
the synthesis and excited state chemistry of molecules, called photoacids, whose
acid-base properties change on optical excitation. These molecules, which can
exhibit immense, but transient, changes in acid-base properties, provide new
methods to study acid-base chemistry, and novel approaches to photoactivated,
polymerization catalysts. Through Professor Tolbert's research, graduate and
postdoctoral students will be exposed to new concepts in acid-base chemistry,
and the methodology to examine these transient effects.
