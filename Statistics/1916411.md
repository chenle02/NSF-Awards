Mathematical models have been increasingly integrated in infectious disease
studies in order to provide a quantitative understanding of virus infection and
disease processes. Among the mathematical models, the ordinary differential
equation (ODE) is a simple but powerful framework for modeling the dynamics of
complex systems. Parameters in ODE models often have scientific meanings. Most
of the previous research in this area focused on estimating ODE parameters from
a single subject. This is not an efficient approach, because the data are often
collected on multiple subjects. The objective of this project is to develop
efficient methods for analyzing ODE systems by combining data from multiple
subjects. The proposed research is expected to have broad impacts and
application in biomedical studies, ecology, and other scientific areas.

Models that can characterize the common features in the population will be
considered while taking into account the variations among subjects. Efficient
approaches for model selection will also be investigated. Both statistical
theory and computational algorithm will be developed to tackle challenges in
this area. Results from this research will provide new insight into the existing
methods and inspire new lines of investigations in analyzing complex dynamic
systems using ODE model. Extensive numerical studies will be conducted, which
will help interested researchers better understand the proposed methods. The
research will be integrated with various educational activities that will impact
teaching and learning related to dynamic modeling.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
