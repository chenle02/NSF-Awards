One of the primary goals of nuclear physics research is to determine how
&lt;br/&gt;the constituents of a nucleus interact with each other and what
phenomena &lt;br/&gt;occur due to these interactions. New opportunities to
explore these&lt;br/&gt;interactions have emerged with the development of
improved experimental &lt;br/&gt;techniques and facilities. For example, nuclei
whose proton or neutron &lt;br/&gt;numbers are very different from those of
naturally occuring isotopes are now &lt;br/&gt;studied with high intensity
radioactive beams. A comparison of the expermental &lt;br/&gt;results from these
facilities with the predictions of the proposed calculations &lt;br/&gt;will
provide an understanding of the phenomena and their dependence on the
&lt;br/&gt;underlying interaction. Such calculations also provide a guide for
&lt;br/&gt;experimentalists by telling them which experiments will yield
information on &lt;br/&gt;specific components of the interaction or which
experiments will produce a &lt;br/&gt;desired phenomena. Many of these
calculations will lead to a better &lt;br/&gt;understanding of the types of
radiation emitted from stars and how elements &lt;br/&gt;are made inside stars.
In addition, a theory of how the protons and &lt;br/&gt;neutrons that comprise a
nucleus interact with each other can be extended to &lt;br/&gt;the interactions
among protons, neutrons, and the many unstable particles &lt;br/&gt;that exist
for only fractions of a second. Therefore, an additional task is to
&lt;br/&gt;develop and test these more general interactions. It is likely that
the &lt;br/&gt;particles that are unstable here on Earth can be stable under
extreme &lt;br/&gt;conditions such as inside neutron stars and, therefore, alter
the properties &lt;br/&gt;of neutron stars.&lt;br/&gt;
