The large amount of unlicensed and semi-unlicensed bandwidth available for
millimeter (mm) wave communication enable multi-Gigabit wireless networking that
can potentially transform the telecommunications landscape.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research investigates the use of
the unlicensed 60 GHz ``oxygen absorption'' band for providing a quickly
deployable broadband infrastructure based on multi-Gigabit outdoor mesh
networking. Millimeter wave links are inherently directional: the directionality
is required to overcome the increased path loss at higher frequencies, and is
feasible for nodes with compact form factors using antenna arrays realized as
patterns of metal on circuit board. This project addresses the cross-layer
design of mesh networks with such highly directional links, in which implicit
coordination using carrier sense mechanisms cannot be relied on, and there is no
omni-directional mode for explicit coordination. In addition, the research will
investigate new design principles for directional medium access control, with
the challenge being to coordinate nodes despite the deafness induced by
directionality, while taking advantage of the drastically reduced spatial
interference. The project will also study methods for network discovery and
topology updates, the interactions between scheduling and routing; and the
impact of oxygen absorption on network capacity and protocol
design/performance.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The principal
investigators will develop publicly available mm wave network simulation tool,
intended to engage a larger research community in this emerging field. The
investigators will also explore other mechanisms for broader impact including
technology transfer, undergraduate research, and curriculum updates featuring mm
wave communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
