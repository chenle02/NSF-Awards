The investigators will use a global circulation model of the Earth's
magnetosphere to study key aspects of substorms and their global consequences.
The methodology is to use solar wind data as input to the simulation model and
critically compare the results with observations in the magnetosphere and
ionosphere. By combining simulation results with observational data, the
investigators will overcome the limited spatial and temporal resolution of
observations and be able to produce accurate, high resolution synoptic maps of
the magnetosphere and ionosphere. With these maps the investigators will study
key issues of substorm research, such as the detailed topology of substorm
current systems and the timing of substorm signatures. The research will lead to
a better understanding of geomagnetic activity and substorms and aid in the
development of improved space weather predictions.
