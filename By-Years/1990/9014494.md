This project supports the research of a graduate student in cultural
anthropology who will study the work of family artisans who make food specialty
items in southwest France. The project will study how such family firms
reproduce their economic activity in the context of a post-industrial society.
These producers are based in local household or family settings for production,
yet have organized themselves into guilds to represent their interests in the
wider society. Using participant observation and in-depth life history
interviews the student will analyze how small family-based producers have been
able to reaffirm their autonomy and mobilize their constituency in a context
that assumed their disappearance or marginality. This research is important
because family owned business has historically been the key to community
development for defined groups. Understanding how one such well-defined group
has asserted and defended its interests can help us understand how groups in
general can prosper, and so design policies that aid groups that have
historically not been able to succeed in family owned business.
