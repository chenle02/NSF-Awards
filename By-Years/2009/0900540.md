"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently plasmon resonances are mostly
studied numerically or experimentally by using a ?trial-
anderror?&lt;br/&gt;approach, i.e., by probing nanoparticles with radiation of
various frequencies and polarizations.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
advance novel techniques for the direct analysis of plasmon
resonance&lt;br/&gt;frequencies and plasmon modes in nanoparticles by treating
plasmon resonances as an eigen value&lt;br/&gt;problem. The main emphasis of the
research work on this project will be the development of
novel&lt;br/&gt;boundary integral equation techniques for the time-domain
analysis of plasmon resonances, finding the&lt;br/&gt;conditions for efficient
coupling of incident radiation to specific plasmon modes, and the study
of&lt;br/&gt;general physical properties of plasmon resonances. It is expected
that new powerful software tools will&lt;br/&gt;be developed for the design of
promising engineering nanostructures. It is also intended to explore
the&lt;br/&gt;device applications of plasmon resonances in semiconductor
nanoparticles where these resonances can&lt;br/&gt;be controlled through optical
manipulation of the conduction electron density. This controllability
is&lt;br/&gt;especially promising for the development of all-optical
nanotransistors. Furthermore, the research&lt;br/&gt;activities on this project
will include the study of applications of plasmon resonances in both
thermally&lt;br/&gt;assisted and all-optical magnetic recording as well as the
elucidation of the electromagnetic mechanism&lt;br/&gt;of surface enhanced Raman
scattering (SERS).
