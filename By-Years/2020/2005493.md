Groups are algebraic objects that formally describe the concepts of symmetry.
They play a central role in all branches of mathematics. This NSF award supports
research and education that contain several directions to study Dynamical
Systems in the presence of large groups. These include dynamical properties in
situations with many explicit or implicit symmetries. Such systems tend to
attain additional special properties. Conversely, some dynamical properties can
often serve as indications of rich underlying symmetries. Educational impact of
the project is through Ph.D. supervision, dissemination efforts, and high school
outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will encompass a number of
topics at the intersection of dynamical systems, group theory, geometry and
operator algebras. The common theme of the research directions lies in the
synthesis and interactions between these areas. Many of the aspects of these
interactions involve rigidity, a phenomenon of robustness of a structure under
perturbations. Specific projects are related to special phenomena in dynamical
systems that occur in the presence of large groups, such as explicit or implicit
symmetries, rigidity of certain exotic geometries, and applications of dynamical
methods to geometry and analysis. The three main topics under consideration are:
measure equivalence rigidity, the Lyapunov spectrum for random walks and
generalizations, and the length spectrum for Gromov hyperbolic groups. One focus
of this research is the application of dynamical methods in the study of group
theory and geometry, and especially rigidity phenomena. The other focus will be
the application of group theory to shed light on problems in dynamical systems
and geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
