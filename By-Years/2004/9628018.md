9628018 Salant Travel support is provided to allow a group of US tribologists
with expertise in tribological performance prediction to attend a US - Nordic
workshop on the performance predictive design of tribological machine elements.
The Nordic participants have special expertise in machine element design. The
workshop will examine the status of the field and the need for synergy between
the two areas of expertise. It will also develop suggestions for future research
activities and research collaborations in the topic area.
