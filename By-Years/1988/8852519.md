This project supports curriculum improvements in computer science at this
institution. Using graphics-based, windowed workstations that are networked,
existing courses have been modified and a new course in computer graphics
introduced. The equipment supporting this project includes: Apollo DN3000 and
DN4000 workstations; DEC, Apple and Tektronix printers; and software including
UNIX, Modula2, Lisp, and C. In addition to programming skills, students are
exposed to software development, network management and graphic tools. This
award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
