The next step toward understanding the brain is to reveal how the different
regions of the brain interact. This proposal creates an interdisciplinary set of
protein and microscopy tools that optically captures and then interprets movies
of the entire zebrafish brain. These large-scale recordings will help understand
the relationship between different brain regions, especially during fast neural
activity patterns associated with specific neural disorders. The technological
and scientific products of this proposal will result in training materials that
educate and inspire the next generation of neural
engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neuroscience requires a mesoscopic study of the
brain to define the functional relationships between different brain regions.
This proposal creates a series of fluorescent genetically encoded voltage
sensors, optical microscopes, and signal processing tools to optically extract
the millisecond waveforms of targeted neural populations simultaneously over the
entire zebrafish brain. These recordings will help characterize the cascade of
fast, millisecond timescale bursts of neural activity expanding through multiple
brain regions that underlie neural disorders. The broader impact goals of this
proposal will fold these technological tools into educational and research
training materials targeted to a diverse array of students in the STEM
pipeline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
