This project utilizes scientists from the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land
Management, the National Park Service, and Portland and Oregon State
Universities to provide middle and high school science teachers with authentic
work in environmental monitoring and forest research at one of the National
Forests. The project provides a five-week summer research experience for
teachers who will be partnered with field scientists. Five additional days of
professional development training are provided during the school year to ensure
transfer to the classroom. Teachers begin the program by working on an
established project with forest scientists, and then create a short inquiry
project of their own to be used with their students during the school year.
Novice teachers work with mentor teachers in implementing the research projects.
Mentor training is provided during the summer and the school year. This project
will educate 105 mentor and 210 novice science teachers over four years. In the
third year the project will be extended to a site that will be run by the
University of Northern Colorado. Teachers at this new site will be will be
recruited from Colorado, Wyoming and Montana.
