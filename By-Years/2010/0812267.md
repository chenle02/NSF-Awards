The project is developing a framework for efficient reasoning about effects of
actions in temporal action theories (TAT) with incomplete information and state
constraints in the form of static causal laws. To cope with the high complexity
of temporal reasoning and planning problems, the project develops and exploits
an approximation theory for query answering and planning in TAT. This theory is
being used as the basis for sound and efficient algorithms for hypothetical
reasoning and planning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This framework guides the
development of state-of-the-art temporal conformant planners, robust in the face
of a variety of contingencies, which can deal with various classes of
preferences. Techniques developed will application, for example, in the
composition of web services for comparative data analysis in evolutionary
biology.
