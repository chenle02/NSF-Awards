The long range goal of this project is to investigate a framework that can
improve understanding of the topology/connectivity of complex biological
pathways. This research combines experimental molecular genetics with
computational systems biology to develop new approaches for mapping complex
signal transduction pathways in eukaryotic cells. The initial system for study
is the Ras and Tor pathways in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The
research will employ data sets from whole genome expression analysis to develop
and validate the pathway map. The research will focus on three avenues of
analysis with the objectives: (1) to study a genetic epistasis analysis approach
using extensive DNA microarray data to define a qualitative connectivity map of
the pathways, (2) investigate a new computational systems approach based on a
superstructure representation and a mixed integer linear optimization framework
for the prediction of the topology of the complex pathways, and (3) study a
quantitative analysis framework for the effect of model uncertainty on the
network topology of the metabolic pathways.
