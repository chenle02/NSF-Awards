The investigator plans to develop a local stable manifold theory for non-linear
stochastic hereditary systems with a bounded memory. A study of the Lyapunov
spectrum near stationary hyperbolic orbits will be carried out. It is expected
that the construction of the Lyapunov spectrum will lead to the existence of
local stable manifolds around the stationary orbits. In specific case studies,
the investigator hopes to obtain sharp estimates on the top Lyapunov exponent,
and study its dependence on the noise variance and the delay. The proposer
intends to analyze the behavior of dynamical systems that depend on chance and
on the past history of their states. The proposed work sill examine the
stability of such dynamical systems in the long term. The study will be
supported by computer analysis of specific models from engineering and the
physical sciences.
