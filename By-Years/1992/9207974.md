The proposed biophysical studies comprises of two parts: electron-nuclear double
resonance (endor) investigations of metalloenzymes; studies of long-range
electron transfer within protein complexes. Dr. Hoffman is engaged in a program
of multi- frequency cw and pulsed endor investigations of (i) the metal centers
of hydrogenases, (ii) metalloenzymes from extreme thermophiles. Mixed-metal
hemoglobin hybrids provide the optimal system for studying electron transfer
within a rigid and crystallographically defined environment. Using this system
Dr. Hoffman will examine the temperature response of electron transfer down to
helium temperatures. He will also probe the interfacial conformational dynamics
that control a cooperative binding transition displayed by non-covalent electron
transfer complexes. %%% Endor spectroscopy is the technique of choice for
answering many of the fundamental questions about the structure and function of
metalloenzyme active sites. Long-range electron transfer is one of the most
fundamental chemical and biological reactions, yet one of the most difficult to
study.
