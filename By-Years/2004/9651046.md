This project uses MacLab physiological recording equipment as part of a
comprehensive three-phase plan designed to strengthen the undergraduate program
in Biological Sciences. Phase I (Building Improvement) and Phase II (Upgrade of
Instructional Aids) have been addressed. Phase III (Curriculum Enhancement) is
addressed by this project. The MacLab recording equipment is being integrated
into all levels of the curriculum. Of particular interest is the integration of
the MacLab into Level III. Having been introduced to the MacLab on a
demonstration basis (Level I) and had practical experience in the use of the
MacLab (Level II), students are required to design, conduct, and present a
reasonably sophisticated research project using the equipment as part of their
advanced training (Level III). The addition of a required research component to
the undergraduate curriculum is necessary to prepare students adequately for
postgraduate life as teachers, researchers, and health care practitioners.
