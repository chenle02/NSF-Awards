This research is concerned with the development of a stochastic optimization
modeling approach that supports the evaluation and the analysis of global
manufacturing strategies under uncertainty. The research project will introduce
a normative model that considers risk and return tradeoffs throughout the world
supply chain network. The sources of uncertainty to be considered include
currency fluctuations, market demand variation and price risk. Tradeoffs occur
through corporate taxes and transfer prices; duties and tariffs; production and
transportation costs; the cost of manufacturing flexibility; global financing
costs; and international pricing differences. Decisions concerning facility size
and location, material flows, product mix, overhead cost allocation, financing
and pricing will be accounted for in the model framework.
