The digital revolution has created new opportunities in the management and use
of all types of research (and other) data and information. Most areas of
scientific research are now data-driven and this has produced a broad range of
quantitative and qualitative improvements in the research enterprise. The
communication of research results in myriad forms, both formal and informal, has
also increased and improved. The day-to-day practices of the established fields
of science and engineering are changing in response to the emergence of new
computer- and network-based modes of communication and collaboration. These
issues need to be understood by the various stakeholders in our nation's
research enterprise, including the research communities in government, academia,
and industry, research policymakers and managers in the Administration and
Congress, and ultimately the public that both supports these activities and
benefits from improved effectiveness. Acting through the NRC, the U.S. CODATA
provides an interdisciplinary mechanism and focal point for bringing greater
understanding and visibility to these issues, for adding value to the sponsors'
objectives and priorities in these areas, and for helping to improve returns on
the public investments of federal agencies. U.S. CODATA will hold one two-day
meeting. The principal focus of this meeting will be to review the progress of
activities already underway and those being planned under its auspices, and to
discuss with the U.S. CODATA's sponsors and external experts the key issues that
may need some action or follow-up. The U.S. CODATA staff will disseminate online
and other information related to the U.S. CODATA activities and outputs. Toward
this end, the U.S. CODATA has developed an Outreach and Communication strategy.
