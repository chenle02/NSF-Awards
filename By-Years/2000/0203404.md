0203404&lt;br/&gt;Pierotti&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves
collaboration between three universities in Kansas&lt;br/&gt;and will train a
number of Native American undergraduates in research&lt;br/&gt;techniques
related to ecology and environmental science. Unlike many&lt;br/&gt;programs
that offer only a brief research experience, this program will
work&lt;br/&gt;with students over a 2-4 year period and mentor them through to
graduation&lt;br/&gt;with a bachelor's degree. The PIs on this program have
graduated more than&lt;br/&gt;25 Native Americans over the last 7 years, and
most of these graduates have&lt;br/&gt;gone on to attend graduate
school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award includes a supplement from the Central
and Eastern Europe Program&lt;br/&gt; of NSF's Office of International Science
and Engineering to fund student and mentor &lt;br/&gt;travel to Siberia for
research on indigenous knowledge as part of a collaboration&lt;br/&gt; with
scientists and students at Gorno-Altaisk State
University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The significance of this program lies in recent
discoveries that Indigenous&lt;br/&gt;communities represent stores of knowledge
that both add to and compliment&lt;br/&gt;scientific knowledge obtained through
the methods of the Western scientific&lt;br/&gt;tradition, e.g. indigenous
knowledge 1) reveals connections between&lt;br/&gt;ecological communities that
are studied separately and remain unlinked&lt;br/&gt;under Western scientific
paradigms, and 2) give insight into the role of&lt;br/&gt;high quality
individuals within population dynamics that are obscured by&lt;br/&gt;Western
traditions of population level thinking. Students completing
this&lt;br/&gt;program will be better prepared to conduct scientific research
within the&lt;br/&gt;context of indigenous knowledge than any other group. Such
approaches can&lt;br/&gt;simultaneously increase scientific awareness without
losing sight of&lt;br/&gt;spiritual dimensions of human experience. &lt;br/&gt;
