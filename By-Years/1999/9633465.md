OCE 96-33465 Bogden The project will apply a generalized inverse method to the
problem of estimating tides and residual currents in under-sampled fields such
as those generated by Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) operated from
moving ships. Shipboard ADCP sampling suffers from inherent limitations which
necessitate separation of tides and low- frequency flows during post-processing.
The generalized inverse method will improve on existing least-squares fitting
techniques by explicitly including dynamical constraints. In addition to
development and assessment of the generalized inverse method, emphasis will be
placed on evaluating and designing optimal sampling strategies for use in field
studies.
