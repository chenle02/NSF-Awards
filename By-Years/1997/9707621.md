With National Science Foundation support, the Phoebe Hearst Museum of
Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley will purchase a compactor
shelving system with 147 cabinets, each supplied with internal shelving and
hinged doors. These will be used to store the museum's collection of Native
American baskets. The largest portion consists of 9,014 specimens from
California. An additional 2,235 derive from other areas in North America. The
first entry in the collection's catalogue dates to 1901 and the museum has
worked consistently to the present time to collect materials which document the
variability and change over time of this artifact class. The materials are
accompanied by excellent documentation which in some cases this includes not
only finished product, but also the raw materials from which it was made along
with information on details of the manufacturing process. The collection has
been widely used for research purposes and each year many scholars request
access to this material. Because of limited space these baskets have been
improperly stored. Items are stacked one inside the other, a practice which can
lead to deformation in shape. This also means that to retrieve a single
specimen, many must be moved and the result is an unacceptable degree of wear
and tear. The University has made additional space available which, if properly
used, will alleviate the overcrowding problem. Compactors provide an excellent
and widely employed means to store large amounts of material in a relatively
small space and this grant will permit the baskets to be stored without
stacking. This will result in enhanced preservation of the materials and improve
access to anthropologists who wish to study them.
