The mission of the Applied Information Technology Education (AITE) project is
(1) to equip and develop students who can function effectively in an information
technology (IT) workplace, who can adapt to changes in emerging technologies,
and who will become innovators in their respective disciplines, and (2) to
prepare educators with the understanding of an IT economy and with the knowledge
and skills to teach and develop the current and future workforce. This mission
evolves from Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College's vision to develop a Gulf
South workforce that can perform successfully in a knowledge- and idea-based
economy, embedded with technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is
accomplishing its mission by increasing the supply of IT workers--female IT
workers, in particular--in the Gulf South region and developing programs in
database administration and Web design and administration. Activities and
methodologies to support the goals and objectives involve faculty training and
certification; curriculum adaptation; developing a career awareness and
exploration model, called "The IT Pathway," focusing on females and other
underrepresented groups; communicating "The IT Pathway" to high school and
college faculty and students; and disseminating the project's findings and
products. The curricula developed in the project are geared to nationally
recognized certifications and industry standards.&lt;br/&gt;
