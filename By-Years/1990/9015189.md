The object of this research is the physics of maritime clouds and
precipitation, including the nature of mixing between clouds and their
environment, the capacity of this process to moisten the region surrounding such
clouds, the relative importance of ice and water drops in producing
precipitation in such clouds, and the physics of "ship tracts", the trails of
condensation often produced by ships.
