An award is made to the University of California, Riverside to develop
"microfluidic building blocks," a library of parts that can be connected to
build custom microfluidic instruments quickly and easily. Microfluidics (the
manipulation of fluids on the microliter scale) has enabled important
applications in the biological and health sciences, but currently each of these
applications uses a custom-made microfluidic "chip" designed and fabricated by a
specialist trained in the art of microfabrication using costly and specialized
equipment. This highly custom nature of microfluidics has slowed the spread of
microfluidic technologies into new applications in the biological sciences. The
"microfluidic building blocks" developed in this project enable non-experts to
rapidly build custom instruments for their own research needs. Each block
performs an elementary microfluidic function like valving, mixing, storing
fluids, measuring cell size, or measuring optical density. Using standardized
interfaces, the blocks can be literally "clicked together" to build a custom
microfluidic instrument without specialized training or equipment. Through
collaborations with colleagues in several different fields at UC Riverside and
journal and conference presentations in their respective fields, microfluidic
building blocks will be disseminated across the bioscience
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By allowing any scientist or engineer to
assemble custom microfluidic instruments without specialized training or
equipment, microfluidic building blocks have the potential to accelerate
research progress throughout science and engineering. In resource-limited areas,
doctors and nurses could use a supply of microfluidic building blocks to
construct diagnostic or therapeutic instruments tailored for their own unique
needs. Additionally, as educational tools, microfluidic building blocks could
enhance science and engineering curricula from grade school through university.
By assembling blocks into working instruments that accomplish certain tasks,
students can learn principles of physics, chemistry, and biology. In summary,
microfluidic building blocks have the potential to both enhance existing
research in science and technology and prepare the next generation of the STEM
workforce.
