9726456 Schwartz Knowledge about the factors controlling plant rarity are
critical to successful conservation. This grant from the Division of
Environmental Biology will utilize the Nature Conservancy Natural Heritage Data
Base on plants of the United States and Canada to make broad generalizations
about the characteristics of rare plants. Using statistical techniques, it will
be determined if rarity is correlated with: ( a) life history attributes, (b)
taxonomic affiliation, and c) phylogenetic lineage. This research focuses on
discerning broad patterns of rarity first, and then refines the focus down to
finer scales (ecological, geographical, taxonomic) in order to determine which
patterns observed at the broad scale remain consistent across scales.
