This Small Grant for Exploratory Research supports a project to implement the
Number Field Sieve, the newest method for factoring large integers. The
principal investigators are Professor Robert Robson of the Mathematics
Department and Professor Walter Rudd of the Computer Science Department at
Oregon State University, and Professor Joe Buhler of Reed College. The Number
Field Sieve has a predicted running time that is so much better than that of the
previously known methods of factoring that the Principal Investigators believe
that they will be able to factor numbers in the 145-digit range, far larger than
has been possible up to now. Except for counting, number theory, which is the
study of the properties of the whole numbers, is the oldest branch of
mathematics. In modern days, problems in number theory have furnished the
driving force to creation of new mathematics in the fields of pure algebra,
analysis, and geometry; some of the most recent and most astonishing
applications of number theory have appeared in theoretical computer science and
coding theory. In particular, the difficulty or ease of factoring large numbers
has turned out to have a direct application to the security of public-key codes.
