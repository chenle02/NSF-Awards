9626310 Li The proposed research deals with harmonic functions, and more
generally, harmonic maps. Three related topics are to be pursued: harmonic maps
between Hadamard manifolds, harmonic maps from possibly singular algebraic
varieties, and harmonic functions on complete manifolds. In particular, the
investigator aims to work on the following conjecture due to Yau: the set of
harmonic functions of k-th order polynomial growth, for any non-negative integer
k, must be of finite dimension on a manifold with non-negative Ricci curvature.
Harmonic functions appear as components of complex-valued analytic functions; as
such they have a rich structure theory. In applications, they arise as solutions
to various classical partial differential equations, and can be used to describe
the heat flow on a lamina, tension and area-minimizing surface configurations,
and so forth.
