The effect of metal ions on the hydrolysis of a series of carboxyl substituted
esters and amides will be studied to allow a chemical assessment of the
mechanistic possibilities for the metalloenzyme carboxypeptidase A. In this work
all of the currently recognized possibilities will be investigated in systems of
known mechanism so that a quantitative evaluation may be made of the effects on
the rate constants of: (1) the identity of the metal ion, (2) the strength of
binding of the metal ion to either the carbonyl oxygen or the leaving group, (3)
the pKa of the leaving group, and (4) the steric fit of the carboxyl group to
the carbonyl. In conjunction with the chemical work a kinetic investigation of
carboxypeptidase A will be carried out employing new types of substrates with
which the leaving group can be varied. This should permit a clear distinction
between nucleophilic and general base mechanisms involving the carboxyl group of
Glu- 270. Employing these and also more conventional ester and peptide
substrates, conformational effect will be investigated in temperature-jump,
stopped-flow studies and in inhibition studies. The latter experiments will give
information on the nature and identity of the sites in which esters, peptides,
and inhibitors bind. Thus, this work should lead to an understanding of the
kinetics and mechanism of this important metalloenzyme.
