This resource development project would produce multimedia PD tools to help
teachers identify students' naive science explanations and encourage their
replacement by accepted scientific explanations. The proposed products would be
interactive, multimedia professional development tools to guide middle school
physics and biology teachers in assessing students' scientific explanations. The
project's goals are to identify students' faulty explanations and then develop
curriculum that will guide the process by which they recast their explanations
to align them with accepted scientific ideas. This work builds upon a prior NSF-
funded project entitled "Understandings of Consequence."
