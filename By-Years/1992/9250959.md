A recently revised curriculum in Genetics includes a study of recombinant DNA
technology. The laboratory provides students with a comprehensive introduction
to recombinant DNA technology including relevant computer analysis. Students
gain experience with DNA sequencing, prediction of protein structure,
restriction site analyses, and DNA cloning via computer simulations before they
preform the experiments. The simulations are designed to help the student
conceptualize cloning theory and execution.
