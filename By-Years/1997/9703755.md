This project deals with the compression of information for efficient
transmission and storage. The information can be of the most general kind, but
the approach here takes into account the redundancy in the data which expresses
itself as a spectral distribution . This is done with the help of a compression
scheme called subband coding. In this scheme, the spectral characteristics as
well as the characteristics of the signal, which pertain to the human perceptive
systems such as the hearing or visual system, can be exploited. We are
addressing several fundamental issues in the design and implementation of
subband codes. The optimization of orthonormal as well as biorthogonal subband
coders is being considered in this project. We are also addressing the cases of
nonuniform subband coders, which are most appropriate for the case of audio and
image coding; and the theory of sampling and reconstruction of non bandlimited
signals, showing how such a theory can be exploited in quantization and
compression of data. This aspect of the research generalizes the family of
oversampled analog- to-digital converters to the case of non bandlimited
signals. Another topic under investigation is a special class of subband coders
called cyclic coders, which are potentially capable of greater coding
efficiency. This class is especially useful for the compression of short blocks
of independent data.
