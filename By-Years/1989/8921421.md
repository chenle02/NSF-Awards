Abstract Decompostitions of space play a major role in almost all areas of
computing that have to do with geometric spaces. For example, finite element
approximation methods are based on "meshes" that are cell complexes decomposing
domains into smaller and simpler parts. Depending on the application different
quality criteria govern the way the decompostition is created. This research
will study decompositions with emphasis of triangulations (simplicial cell
complexes) and the possibilities and impossibilities to meet quality criteria
such as constrained numbers of simplices and lower and upper bounds on angles
and other shape descriptors.
