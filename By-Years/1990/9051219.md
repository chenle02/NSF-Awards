This project integrates microcomputers and spectrophotometers into four
introductory biology courses. The Spectronic 20D Spectrophotometer is utilized
to construct a standard curve, determine concentrations of bacterial cultures,
produce absorption spectra of plant pigments, study the relationship between
light intensity and the rate of photosynthesis, and demonstrate enzyme kinetics.
The use of the computer enables the students to collect, tabulate, manipulate,
and graph data more accurately and effectively, leaving more time to interpret
the data, perform statistical anaysies and draw conclusions. Computer-based
tutorials which supplement the laboratory material enable the students to study
laboratory techniques such as pipetting, plating microorganisms, sterile
technique, weighing samples, calculating Rf values, using the spectrophotometer,
constructing standard curves, and calculating dilution series. Software, such as
that developed by Thornton and bioQUEST for problem-solving, data collection and
data analysis, is being used in combination with hands-on experiences. The
college is contributing an amount equal to the award.
