This award funds a Research Fellowship in Plant Biology for two years. The
project is entitled "Genetic and Biochemical Analysis of Auxin Biosynthesis in
Arabidopsis thaliana." The Research Fellowships in Plant Biology are granted to
applicants trained in traditional areas of plant biology who wish to extend
their training in new techniques and to those trained in molecular or cellular
techniques who wish to gain experience working with plants. These fellowships
are designed to increase the number of outstanding young scientists in plant
biology. ***
