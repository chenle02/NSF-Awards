The goal of this project is to better understand the magnetospheric processes
involved during steady magnetospheric convection (SMC). There are two main
scientific objectives of the research, to investigate the role of bursty bulk
flows (BBFs) during steady magnetospheric convection events (SMCs) and to
investigate why the magnetosphere enters a steady mode of energy transfer
instead of an oscillatory mode (the "sawtooth oscillation" mode). The second
objective will be broken down into two sub-components, the first will compare
active SMCs that have BBFs to global sawtooth oscillations. The second component
will compare the substorm that initiates an SMC to the first injection in a
sawtooth event.

Before investigating the main objectives, an improved, more robust method for
identifying SMCs must be created. Three different methods will be tested. Once a
method is chosen, a comprehensive list of SMCs will be generated. This list will
also be shared with the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) community so that
others may also investigate the events and compare them to other modes of energy
transfer. By studying specific aspects of SMCs and comparing them to sawtooth
oscillations this research will increase the understanding of SMCs and how the
magnetosphere enters into a steady state.

While previous studies of SMCs and other modes of magnetospheric transport have
focused mainly on the solar wind drivers, this project will study the
magnetospheric parameters that play a role in determining when and why the
magnetosphere enters into different modes of energy transfer.

The new method for identifying SMCs will not only allow for a more
comprehensive list of SMCs to be created, it will also help to find SMCs in the
future. The list of SMCs created during this investigation will shared with the
GEM community. This list will allow for more in-depth studies of SMC events and
for comparative studies of SMCs to other modes of energy transport.
