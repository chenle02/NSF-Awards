The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to finalize the design of an office-based
implant for permanent relief of urinary obstruction related to benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH or enlarged prostate). This condition affects over 14 million
men in the US and imposes a significant quality of life burden. Established
treatments include only drugs, which have limited efficacy, and surgery, which
has a high complication risk. The investigational device is intended to provide
permanent symptom relief in a ten-minute procedure under local anesthesia, at a
cost far lower than all existing options. Expected pricing based on established
reimbursement codes suggests a $3-4 billion annual market
opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project involves finalizing
design of the aforementioned implantable device and its deployment system. The
device must be easily deployable, provide sufficient circumferential force to
hold back the prostate, fit within the delivery system without excessive strain
or the potential for damage, and carry a low risk of adverse events. Bench
tests, cadaver studies, and animal studies will drive device design to ensure
satisfaction of these aims.
