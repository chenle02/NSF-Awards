The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to create
replicable methods to equip as many students as possible with advanced technical
skills to contribute to the most technologically advanced generation in human
civilization. Skillsets learned through programs implemented may stimulate a
desire for students to dive deeper into technology, empower schools to educate
students through hands-on and applied learning methods, and provide students
with the skills to become programmers, freelancers, entrepreneurs, and other
professionals requiring a certain level of technology
sophistication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is focused on the
implementation of creative and unique kid-friendly content that teaches students
applied technology skillsets, distinguishing them from their peers. This project
is testing and collecting feedback on a variety of methods for curriculum
delivery of the program, including school partnerships, school licensing, and
direct-to-consumer delivery. Student participants as young as 4 years old
undertaking these specific tech programs gain the insight and motivation to
pursue technologically advanced skills.
