Microzooplankton are a morphologically and ecologically diverse group of
organisms that exhibit a wide range of swimming behaviors. These behaviors may
have evolved primarily to allow the organism to feed efficiently or to allow
non-feeding forms to stay in the water column, but they also affect the ability
of fish larvae to recognize potential prey, especially in estuaries where non-
food, suspended particles are abundant. In contrast to visual predation on
microzooplankton, little research has been done to test for selectivity of
microzooplankton prey species by visual predators, and no definitive research
has been done to understand how such selection is controlled. This project will
investigate the role of microzooplankton prey behavior in feeding selectivity by
a visual predator (the early, post yolk-sac stage of the red drum larva,
Sciaenops ocellatus). To evaluate the role of prey behavior in food selectivity
by red drum larvae, a CellTrak video-computer system for motion analysis will be
used to quantify prey behaviors in three dimensions during the encounter, attack
and capture stages of predation. Based on the research results, predictions will
be made and tested regarding microzooplankton prey selectivity by visually
feeding larval fish.
