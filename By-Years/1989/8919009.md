Cell wall polysaccharides of red algae include the commercially important
carrageenans and agarocolloids as well as cellulose, xylans, mannans, and
complex heteropolysaccharides. Due in part to the commercial significance of
these compounds and their derivatives as gelling, emulsifying, and sizing
agents, much is known of the chemistry of these polymers from selected
organisms. Relatively little is known, however, about the taxonomic distribution
of these and related natural products among major groups of the red algae
(Rhodophyta). Drs. Gretz and Sommerfeld are undertaking an extensive chemical
survey to address this problem. Cell wall polysaccharides are also potentially
useful biochemical markers that may be valuable in the assessment of natural
evolutionary affinities between algal groups. Efforts in this project will be
directed toward biochemical analysis of cell walls of "key" groups in the
Erythropeltidales, Compsopogonales, Rhodochaetales, Achrochaetiales, Nemaliales,
Batrachospermales, and Bonnemaisonales using modern techniques such as
methylation analysis (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry), nuclear magnetic
resonance and x-ray diffraction analysis. In addition to the scientific
information generated and the potential for discovery of sources of novel
natural products, this project is designed to encourage undergraduate students
to participate in original research. Students will be exposed directly to the
application of the scientific method and to modern analytical techniques and
apparatus, which will stimulate their interest in careers in science.
