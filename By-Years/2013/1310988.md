This action funds Forest Hoyt Andrews of Indiana University-Purdue University
Indianapolis to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013
at Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea. The project title is
"Exploring the Diversity of the Oxidative Folding Pathway via X-ray
Crystallography." The host scientist is Professor Se Won Suh.

Oxidative folding is the process of introducing disulfide bonds into proteins.
In most bacteria this pathway is essentially composed of two enzymes that form a
complex. However the way in which these two enzymes have evolved to interact
with one another is not quite as conserved as originally thought. This project
performs cocrystallization experiments on these various oxidative folding enzyme
partners in an attempt to identify novel interactions.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. In addition to the planned research, the Fellow will visit
local high schools and observe how teaching science is approached in Korea and
compare it to his experience teaching high school science in the US. Upon
returning the Fellow will hold an open seminar describing the cultural
differences and educational approaches in teaching science between the United
States and Korea.
