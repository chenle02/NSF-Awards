This action provides for the design (or re-design) and pre- test of several
questions intended for inclusion in the annual Survey of Industrial Research and
Development conducted for NSF by the Bureau of the Census. NSF and Census staff
have previously identified several key areas where questionnaire improvements
are needed; efforts to identify additional areas will continue during the
conduct of this project. Under authority granted by the National Science
Foundation Act of 1950, NSF collects and disseminates descriptive economic
statistics, as well as other pertinent information, about scientific and
technological resource utilization and activities. Data collected by the Survey
of Research and Development in Industry, when used in combination with data
obtained through other NSF statistical and analytical activities, provides
policy makers with an overview of R&D funding and performance in the United
States.
