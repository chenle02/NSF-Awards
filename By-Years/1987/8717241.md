This proposal requests support for an International Academic Networkshop, the
sixth in a series of highly successful annual meetings. From a modest beginning
in London in 1982, these meetings have grown in purview and stature; each has
brought together high-level technical people from increasingly many countries,
who are involved in planning, designing, implementing and operating computer
networks in support of research and higher education. This year attendance is
expected by networkers from thirty countries, and both Southeast Asia and South
America will be well represented. It is the first time the workshop has been
held in the U.S.
