This study proposes to conduct rigorous research on the strategic use of
classroom talk for teaching mathematics to middle grade non-English speaking
students. They will seek to learn whether discourse-intensive mathematics
instruction between teachers and students, and between students and students, is
effective in a three-year micro-analytic study of student learning in four
discourse-intensive versions of connected Mathematics. Paper and pencil tests of
the concepts in the lessons will be collected, students will be videotaped in
clinical interviews, and a detailed analysis of the videotapes will be
conducted. The same teachers will deliver the teaching modules in two different
formats to matched classes of 7th grade students. The student population will be
mostly non-English speaking students of low-income backgrounds. Teachers will
receive training in the methods.

The panel considered this proposal to be an outstanding proposal because it was
based on a previous study by the author of the proposal, cites other relevant
research, and has a strong group of advisors.
