Mechanisms of communication between cells constitutes one of the most
fundamental processes in all of biology. Intracellular communication plays an
important role in endocrinology, immunology, neurobiology, and control of cell
growth and differentiation. This intracellular communication is largely mediated
by the presence of specific receptors and signal transduction systems within the
cell or the cell surface. This conference will review the most recent current
knowledge about these receptors and signal transduction mechanisms. It will
involve individuals from academic settings and industry and from very senior
level to indviduals still training.
