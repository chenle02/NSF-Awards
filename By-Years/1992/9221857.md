This project is investigating possible structures for a National Power Systems
Research Institute that will involve universities in the problems of power
system infrastructure, especially manpower. The goal of the project is to
develop a structure that will allow the institute to have a key leadership role
in addressing some of the institutional and technological problems associated
with power system infrastructure in the US. It is investigating a research
focus, an educational focus, and administrative makeup, criteria for determining
its location, and criteria for outreach to other universities and other segments
of the industry.
