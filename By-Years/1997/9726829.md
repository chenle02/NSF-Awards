9726829 Callaway and Zabinski The highly aggressive invasive weed, Centaurea
maculosa, appears to utilize an unusual mechanism to exclude a native bunchgrass
in grasslands of the Intermountain prairie. The basis of this interaction is
tied to underground interactions via mycorrhizal fungi. This project will
evaluate the role of these fungi in acting as mediators of the establishment of
Centaurea by preferentially transferring carbon from native grasses to this
weed. The proposed research includes an integrated sequence of greenhouse,
common garden, and field experiments to (1) test the generality of indirect
interactions between mycorrhizal fungi and plant species native to the
Intermountain grasslands in the presence and absence of the invasive species,
(2) to determine the mechanism of the fungi-mediated interaction and (3) to
determine the ecological relevance of such interactions in the field.
