This award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) will enable the
Department of Chemistry at Pacific University to acquire an atomic force
microscope/scanning tunneling microscope (AFM/STM) to enhance undergraduate
research opportunities in electrochemistry and biochemistry. This equipment will
enhance research in two major projects: a) the structural effects and
consequences of electrochemical processes at commercially important lithium-ion
cell graphite anodes will be studied in situ; and b) the study of aggregation
phenomena on cell surfaces in aqueous environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
scanning tunneling microscope (STM) enables researchers to image atoms directly.
The technique uses the piezoelectric effect which involves bringing an extremely
sharp metal needle within a few angstroms of the sample surface. The distance is
small enough for electrons to leak or tunnel across the gap and generate a
minute current. As the gap between the tip and the sample increases, the current
decreases. As the probe crosses the sample, moving back and forth across the
surface, it traces out a contour map of the sample's surface atoms. The AFM is
used in the control of material used to fabricate semiconductor circuits.
