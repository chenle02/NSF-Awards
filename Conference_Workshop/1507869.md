The conference "Representation theory and geometry of symplectic resolutions"
will be held May 18-21 at Northeastern University, Boston MA. Symplectic
resolutions are remarkable geometric objects that are of increasing interest in
representation theory, a branch of algebra concerned with studying symmetries.
The conference speakers are experts who have made fundamental contributions to
the theory of symplectic resolutions. The conference will attract mathematicians
from underrepresented groups as well as graduate students and young researchers
who will greatly benefit from the wide spectrum of topics to be presented at the
conference.

The aim of the conference is to present current developments on various aspects
of algebraic and symplectic geometry of symplectic resolutions, and of related
aspects in representation theory. Topics to be discussed include the enumerative
geometry of symplectic resolutions, the structure of derived categories of
sympectic resolutions and their equivalences, and the structure and
representation theory of quantizations of symplectic resolutions, as well as
related questions in geometric and categorical representation theory.
