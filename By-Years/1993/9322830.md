9322830 Hopp The objective of this research work is to develop new generation
design tools for semiconductor fabrication facilities. The research involves the
use of recent results in queuing network approximations and the extensions of
already developed models. The research is targeted toward the development of
design tools that can produce an integrated logistics/economics analysis
techniques for improving existing designs and producing near optimal design from
scratch. The research result will be used to construct a workable prototype
design tool that will be linked to an industrial equipment data base and tested
in actual fabrication design processes of a semi-conductor fabricator. This
research is well focused and very likely to result in a product that has
immediate industry application. The problem addressed is real and likely to have
some lasting impact on engineering infrastructure. The outcome of this research,
if successfully accomplished, can lead to improved design of wafer fabrication
facilities and their operation. The active support given to this research by
wafer fabrication companies is a strong evidence of how the work is viewed by
the target industry.
