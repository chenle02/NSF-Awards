This project will simplify a wave equation approach to harmonic analysis for
symmetric spaces of negative curvature and extend a perturbation theory for the
wave equation on hyperbolic manifolds. The new theory is aimed at applications
to quotient spaces and hyperbolic manifolds with twist. This projects addresses
fundamental mathematical questions with potential applications for physics and
chemistry.
