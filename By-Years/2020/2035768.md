The broader impact/commercial potential of this innovation is significant. The
US has more than 3 million miles of paved roads. Roughly 3.5% of the network is
repaved annually using a free-floating screed invented in 1930. In the past 5
years, the paving industry in the US generated an average annual revenue of $25
billion. 3D paving lends itself to many possibilities, including correcting
surface problems by applying a thin, variable-thickness lift, integrating color
designs and striping, and imbedding objects such as sensors and solar panels in
the pavement. If this process leads to a 20% cost reduction (conservative
estimate) a cost savings of $5 billion per year could be realized.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I
project evaluates the feasibility of 3D paving. There are two main technical
challenges: 1) the ability to apply road surface mixtures using a nozzle (This
requires engineering the paving mixture as well as the nozzle) and 2) the
ability to control the nozzle position in three dimensions, independent of the
vehicle frame and road elevation. The project team will develop mix design
parameters to enable nozzle application, a nozzle design to enable paving speed
of 20 ft./min., a 3D nozzle control system to apply a surface independent of
existing road profile, vehicle requirements, and a commercial feasibility
study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
