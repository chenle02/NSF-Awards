Pressure to use up-to-date technology mandates that network analyzer (NA)
measurements be included in high-frequency (HF) laboratories for electrical
engineers. Therefore, this project enhances a HF laboratory through introduction
of network analyzers and through representation of standing waves on the NAs by
reprogramming the controllers to maintain this proven approach to teaching. With
the recent development of vector NAs that possess the capability of measuring
both magnitude and phase, a new era in measurement metrology has begun. NAs
based on self-contained, microprocessor-driven instruments have, to some extent,
taken over the role from manual measurements. The ability to characterize a
component in terms of magnitude and phase changes the methods used in design and
development and, thus, how the student or practicing engineer thinks about and
visualizes these processes. Vector measurements are not usually covered in
undergraduate HF and microwave laboratories, primarily because of cost and a
reluctance by instructors to move away from slotted line techniques because of
their intuitive visual representation of standing waves. It is possible to
emulate the classical standing-wave pattern on the NA display. This requires
developing new computer program modules. Therefore, the intuitive advantage of
the slotted line technique can be preserved even in the future laboratory
environment provided through this project. With new, low-cost NAs and customized
displays, students can be educated in current measurement metrology employed in
industry while teaching is based on intuitive concepts of standing waves. This
combined NA environment can be employed to enhance learning in laboratories that
can serve as a model for future laboratory development. *
