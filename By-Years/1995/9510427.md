9510427 Brooks The proposed activity is the investigation of the role of
electronic anisotropy in molecular crystalline materials. This anisotropy
influences metallic, superconducting, magnetic, and insulating states in these
materials. The main objectives of the proposed work are: to compare
experimentally and computationally the effects of electronic anisotropy; to
manipulate the degree of anisotropy by physical means to produce new electronic
states; to understand more clearly how superconductivity arises in low-
dimensional systems; to explore quantum limit effects in anisotropic materials;
to extend traditional Fermi surface studies into new regimes of pulsed magnetic
fields above 30 T; and to consider speculative new methods of physical
measurement in intense magnetic fields and very high pressures in these
materials. %%% The area of molecular crystals is an emerging one in the science
and technology of electronic (electrically conducting) materials. They link the
realms of semiconductors, metals, and biological structures. Unlike traditional
solids such as silicon or copper which are composed of atoms arranged in simple
three-dimensional ordered arrays, with little or no distinction between
directions, molecular crystals are composed of large (usually organic) molecules
arranged in either chains or layers. Hence, the electronic properties of
molecular crystals can be very different (anisotropic) in the three directions
within the solid. This anisotropy affects their superconducting, magnetic, and
semiconducting properties. The purpose of the proposed research is to
investigate experimentally and computationally the role of anisotropy in
crystalline molecular solids, including the use of electronic, magnetic,
pressure, and optical probes to measure and manipulate their physical
properties.. An understanding of the mechanisms by which anisotropy influences
these properties wi ll lead to the design and synthesis of new materials in this
class having particularly desirable physical properties. ***
