ABSTRACT 0209109 Columbia U Yannis Tsividis This research explores the
possibilities of performing linear analog signal processing using systems which
are internally nonlinear. The context is fully integrated systems, fabricated on
a single silicon chip, containing a digital signal processor or a computer plus
an analog signal processor; the latter is often a necessary part of the
interface to the physical world. Conventional linear techniques for implementing
analog processors often result in very large energy consumption, which rules
them out in many practical cases. We are investigating the use of internally
nonlinear processors to bypass those limitations. The applications of this work
extend from wireless communications and computer hardware to consumer products
to biomedical intrumentation.

The use of input-output linear signal processors which are permitted to be
internally nonlinear allows the internal signals to have, for a large input
signal range, a magnitude well above that of noise and interference, while at
the same time remaining safely below overload levels. The result is an adequate
signal-to-noise ratio over the entire input range, without requiring large power
dissipation and chip area. A number of other related ideas are being
investigated as well. One is the use of dynamic biasing, in which the bias
levels of dynamical analog circuits, such as filters, are dynamically varied
depending on the signal level; the other is the use of multiple signal
processors, each being placed dynamically in the path of the signal as required.
Since output disturbances would normally occur when the internal parameters of a
dynamical system are varied, a key consideration in this research is how to
eliminate such disturbances or prevent them from occurring.
