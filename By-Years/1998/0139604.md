The Department of Physics of the University of Michigan will administer a
Research Experience for Undergraduates program at the European Organization for
Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. This Laboratory is home of the
world wide web and a leading high energy physics center, viewed by many as the
world's premier international scientific laboratory. Approximately nine students
will be competitively recruited nationally to participate in the program. They
will spend an orientation week at the University of Michigan prior to their
journey to Geneva. During that week they will take computing courses, and hear
lectures on CERN, high energy physics and research ethics. During their period
at CERN they attend daily lectures given by experts in areas such as physics,
cosmology and computing. Each day they also work with assigned mentors on
current physics problems. An onsite Coordinator is present at CERN to assist the
students with any matters related to program or personal needs. Each student
must give a final talk on their accomplishments and participate in the program
evaluation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
