9413105 Kreisler This proposal requests three years of support for 2 faculty
members, 1 postdoctoral fellow and 2 graduate students to continue the analysis
of massive quantities of data accumulated in studies of hyperon and heavy quark
production in nucleon- nucleon scattering at Brookhaven (BNL E766) and Fermilab
(FNAL E690). These data were taken in 1986 and 1992 respectively. The PI spent
years developing and using the advanced electronic processors which allowed the
collaboration to take and process nearly 1010 events. They have recently
finished studies of the Lambda and Anti-lambda masses which have become the
world standard and an analysis of pion-pion correlations with sufficient
statistics to measure both the Bose statistical effects and the coulomb
interaction. In the next grant period they will concentrate on measuring hyperon
polarization and light meson spectroscopy. They are exploring future
applications of their data driven processors in experiments at the DESY
laboratory in Hamburg, Germany and at the CERN laboratory in Geneva,
Switzerland. ***
