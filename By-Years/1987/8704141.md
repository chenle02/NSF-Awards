This proposal requests funds for the purchase of a high power neodymium-yttrium-
aluminum-garnet laser to be located in the Biochemistry Department of the
University of Virginia. This instrument will be used by six young investigators
to support research on molecular contacts and their role in DNA replication,
origin-specific DNA binding proteins, RNA processing and nuclear
ribonucleoprotein, quantitative and qualitative analyses of complement fixing
antibody/ds DNA immune complexes, multienzyme complexes in eucaryotic DNA
synthesis, and on the specificity of protein-lipid interaction by the use of
pulsed-laser induced protein-lipid cross-linking. This instrumentation will
facilitate the application of a new technique in protein-nucleic acid assembly.
