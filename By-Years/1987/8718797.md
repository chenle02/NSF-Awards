One of the fundamental problems in psychobiology is understanding how
motivation is translated into behavior. Where motivation is dependent upon
hormone effects on brain, it is reasonable to suppose that hormone sensitive
brain systems must ultimately integrate with neural tissues more directly
involved in the control of movement. Electrical stimulation of parts of the
thalamus, a discrete brain structure, provoke coordinated locomotion. Dr. David
Edwards will focus his research on examining the potential contributions of
certain thalamic regions to the control of male sexual behavior in rats. He will
use lesion techniques to study the importance of each thalamic regionin male
sexual behavior. He will also determine other brain regions essential in the
sexual behavior of males. Dr. Edwards has been productive in this research area
in the past and his preliminary results suggest he will continue to be a leading
figure in this area of behavior.
