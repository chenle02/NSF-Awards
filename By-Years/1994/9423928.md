This grant supplies funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of
NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used aboard the R/V WECOMA, a 177
foot vessel, which is owned by NSF and operated by the University.
Instrumentation requested includes shipboard computer system upgrades, a
fluorometer, a 3-D GPS receiver, a CTD/rosette upgrade, new meteorological
sensors, a transmissometer, a multi-corer, and electronic testing equipment for
the shipboard support group. The instrumentation is requested for support of
NSF-funded cruises aboard the WECOMA during 1995 and will enhance the scientific
capability of the vessel in the future. ??
