9615475 WHITTAM Biologists are trying to understand how organisms that cause
infectious diseases originate and evolve. Under what conditions do disease-
causing organisms become deadlier (more virulent) or "friendlier" (less
virulent) to the host? To address this question, the proposed research will
examine evolution of virulence in the laboratory of a model system using
bacterium Legionella pneumophila (a cause of Legionnaires disease), a parasite
in nature of protozoans (amoebae). Laboratory populations of the bacterium and
protozoan will be grown together under conditions that favor (or disfavor)
invasion of the amoebae by bacteria. Both the ability of the bacteria to invade
cells and the degree of host resistance to invasion will be measured as the
parasite and host coevolve in the laboratory. The amount of evolutionary change
will be compared to identical measurements taken from Legionella and amoebae
from natural situations. Genes required for invasion will be studied to test
recent theory that predicts how the virulence of parasites will evolve in
specific environments.
