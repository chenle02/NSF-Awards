9505950 Baldwin Many native plants increase the concentration of toxic
metabolites in their tissues when they are attacked by herbivores. While
understanding of the mechanisms responsible for these responses has advanced
rapidly, understanding of their significance remains limited. Do these wound-
induced responses function as defenses, making plants more resistant to further
attack? If these responses protect plants, why are the defenses inducibly
deployed? Two classes of theories have been proposed to explain inducibility: 1)
theories which assume that the inducible trait is a cost-savings measure which
reduces the resource cost of defense by allowing plants to time the allocation
of resources to defense with the need for defense, and 2) theories which do not
make this assumption. This research examines these questions by testing both the
benefits and the costs of an induced alkaloidal defense to plant fitness in the
field by using 1) a recently identified damage signal which activates the
induced defense, and 2) an inhibitor of enzymes responsible for producing the
damage signal, which will allow suppression of the induced defense in attacked
plants. The results of this work will be important for the development of
sustainable agricultural practices by developing approaches to pest resistance
that move away from the exogenous addition of pesticides. Transgenic technology
has greatly facilitated the ability to move potent resistance traits among
different species and controlling the expression of these traits in crop plants.
Understanding the costs and benefits of different types of expression is
essential if these new traits are to be sustainable in agriculture.
