This is a continuation of the summer internship program at Lamont-Doherty
Geological Observatory. Students will be selected competatively from science
departments throughout the country, and they will have a wide variety of summer
researchg projects to choose from, covering such diverse fields as physical
oceanography, geochemistry, micropaleontology, marine geophysics, structural
geology, environmental geochemistry and several others. They will have the
opportunity to work closely with staff members on projects that are carefully
designed to be self- contained, yet which usually contribute to some larger
effort. This program has been highly successful in the past, with many
participants going on to graduate school at Columbia and elsewhere.
