Risks and risk management occur within a rich and complex socio-cultural
context, in which groups of individuals are predisposed to select, ignore and
interpret risk information in different ways. This exploratory project is part
of a broad program to understand the socio-cultural dynamics of risk perception,
decision-making and behavior. Specifically, this research will integrate three
recent research trajectories (affective imagery, cultural theory, and the "white
male effect") in a systematic effort to identify, describe and explain the
existence of discrete "interpretive communities of risk:" clusters of
individuals who share mutually compatible risk perceptions, affective imagery,
cultural worldviews, and socio-demographic characteristics. Results from this
study will contribute to emerging theory on the roles of affect, symbolic
meaning, cultural worldviews and socio-cultural context in risk perception and
decision making.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is guided by the following
research questions: Can we identify distinct interpretive communities of risk
among the American public? If so, what are their distinguishing characteristics?
Are these interpretive communities dynamic and in constant flux, or are they
relatively stable, transcending particular risks? In other words, do
interpretive communities that are substantially different in character form
around different kinds of risks (e.g., health vs. security risks), or are there
groups who consistently perceive and interpret a wide variety of risks in
similar ways? Finally, why do some interpretive communities perceive particular
hazards as extreme risks, while others perceive these same hazards as low or
non-existent risks?
