This research aims to identify the heritability of the ways in which an annual
plant uses water and nitrogen when exposed to water stress. Although plants of
different species vary in the efficiency with which they use water and nitrogen,
very little is known about whether such variability exists within species, and
whether the variability can be manipulated through traditional plant breeding
techniques. In this research, plants of the same species from naturally "wet"
and "dry" environments will be crossed to establish a group of progeny of known
genetic origin. Then the ways in which the plants use water and nitrogen to
produce new growth will be studied. The research will focus on the efficiency of
the photosynthetic process and biomass- allocation processes to roots, shoots
and flowers in using water and nitrogen. The investigators will also examine
whether differences in the efficiency by which plants use nitrogen and water for
photosynthesis and growth result in different yields of fruits and seeds. The
results will provide a better understanding of the genetic controls over the
photosynthetic efficiencies of using water and nitrogen to drive plant growth.
Knowledge of such genetic controls could lead to significant breakthroughs in
(1) the understanding of the evolution of photosynthetic processes in plants,
and (2) the ability to begin manipulating (through breeding programs) the
efficiency of water and nitrogen use in annual crop species of agronomic
importance.
