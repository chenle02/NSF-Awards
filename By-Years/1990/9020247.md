This is a request to fund some of the cost of publishing the proceedings of an
international symposium on "External Control of Human Extremities", to be held
in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, from August 27 to September 1, 1990. The Proceedings
contain full length papers submitted by the participants. Twenty five copies of
the Proceedings will be made available to the PI to distribute to U.S.
scientists who otherwise might not have access to these documents.
