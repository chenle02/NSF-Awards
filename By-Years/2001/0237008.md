0237008&lt;br/&gt;Gulick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the growing interest within
the scientific community to use the Gulf of Alaska to study tectonic-climate
interrelationships, this award will support a workshop to develop a strong
synergistic science plan. The workshop will be jointly funded by the National
Science Foundation (Continental Dynamics Program) and the Joint Oceanographic
Institutions (JOI). The workshop will bring together scientists representing the
fields of tectonics and geodynamic modeling, terrestrial and marine
observational geophysics, GPS-based geodesy, glaciology, marine geology and
glaciomarine sedimentation, micropaleontology, palynology, paleomagnetics,
paleoclimatology and paleo-oceanography.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
