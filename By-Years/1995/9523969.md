9523969 Stuber The proposed research will develop new algorithms for fast link
quality evaluation and new algorithms for distributed link control in
microcellular mobile telephone systems. Link quality evaluation and control are
essential elements of any cellular system. However, future microcellular systems
will be characterized by large numbers mobile customers, and many (sometimes
rapid) cell boundary crossings. Limitations on the speed of link monitoring and
control essentially determine the overall link quality, the cell sizes, and the
ability of the cellular system to react to traffic variations. These factors in
turn determine the spectral efficiency and grade of service. As a result, fast
link quality evaluation and distributed link control will be essential for the
successful deployment of microcellular telephone systems. The approaches to be
employed in the study involve a mixture of theoretical work in propagation
modeling, signal processing, teletraffic modeling, stochastic processes, and
control theory, as well as computation and simulation on workstations. A
software simulation capability in presently available at Georgia Tech that uses
either recorded strips of actual channel measurements or various theoretical and
empirical models. ***
