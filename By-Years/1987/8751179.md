Demographic studies show a severe shortage of qualified mathematics and science
teachers throughout the United States. At the same time there are relatively
untapped pools of prospective teachers particularly among scientifically
competent individuals who will make a career change at mid life either because
they wish to do so or because their employment must be terminated. This project
will develop an innovative and important model for the preparation of science
teachers for middle school teaching especially in urban areas where the need is
especially great. The California State University System has already begun such
a program in San Francisco. Under this grant the program will be improved and
evaluated. The programmatic model will also be moved to one or to Cal. State
institutions in the Los Angeles area. The mid-life prospective teachers will
receive single subject credentials for middle school teaching in California.
Their programs will involve varying amounts of cooperation from former employers
and from urban school districts. Some will undergo most of the program while
still employed by their long term employer. The various forms of the program
model will be carefully evaluated. Highly competent and professional science and
mathematics teachers are especially needed in the middle grades (5-9). It is
during these years that students form important and fundamental attitudes toward
mathematics and science and skills in those fields that strongly influence
subsequent careers and literacy. Unfortunately, many middle school students
receive very poor experiences in math and science and negative attitudes develop
early that influence many individuals throughout their entire lives. This is
especially true for urban children whose culture, language, and failure
orientation are special barriers to growth and development in science. This
project is one attempt to respond to these very important needs.
