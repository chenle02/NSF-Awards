Even though everyone has planted dry seeds in their garden, or observed the
germination of fungal spores in bread-making, very little is known about how dry
biological systems like seeds and spores survive. Recent work shows that sugars
provide protection for membranes as they are dried. Sugars are abundant in dry
seeds and spores. An additional aspect of the protection of dry systems is the
possibility of vitrification--the cytoplasm becomes a highly viscous liquid.
This project will establish the extent to which vitrification contributes to
survival desiccation in a variety of organisms. Model experiments show that
complex proteins and membrane/enzyme complexes can be preserved in the dry state
by providing "vitrifying sugars" before drying. These studies may lead to
methods of preserving genetic products. //
