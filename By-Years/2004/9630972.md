9630972 Schotland In the absence of input from the brain, neuronal circuitry
located entirely in the spinal cord is capable of generating highly complex
coordinated movements. This research proposal seeks to understand the
organization of these networks in the generation of movements. Although a
considerable body of research exists which focuses on the location and
connections of these neural networks, how the appropriate motor pattern is
chosen remains unknown. This proposal takes a different approach by evaluating
the effects of time on the organization of these neural circuits. The response
to sensory stimuli can range from a single impulse, to a few impulses, to a
train of high-frequency impulses. These different impulse patterns might
activate different kinds of neurons, might activate the same set of neurons in
different ways, or may activate different chemical neuronal activating systems.
The results of this research may shed light on how appropriate motor patterns
are "chosen" by the temporal structure of the excitation to spinal neural
circuits.
