The Department of Psychology attempts to provide its students with a rigorous,
scientifically-based education in Psychology. With the limited resources
available to a small school and Montana's current budgetary crisis, providing
and maintaining the laboratory equipment necessary for a quality education is
becoming increasingly difficult. The project would use computer-simulated
laboratory exercises to supplement and substitute for the use of expensive
standard laboratory equipment to provide a relatively inexpensive solution to
this problem, at the same time providing students with pedagogically-sound
laboratory experiences. Microcomputers can combine the functions of numerous
pieces of standard laboratory equipment. Software is available and can be
written that provides students with experience with a broad range of
psychological concepts and experiments.
