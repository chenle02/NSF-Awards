This project investigates some of the mod p and p-adic aspects of the Langlands
program, and their links with p-adic Hodge theory. Specifically, the PI proposes
to prove new cases of Serre's conjecture, to formulate precise generalizations
of Serre's conjecture to arbitrary reductive groups, to prove new automorphy
lifting theorems, and to establish results towards the Gouvea-Mazur conjecture.
In particular, the PI proposes to investigate the ubiquity of the property of
``potential diagonalizability'' for potentially crystalline Galois
representations, which will give powerful new automorphy lifting theorems thanks
to previous work of him and his collaborators. He also proposes to use
functoriality and these new automorphy lifting theorems to establish cases of
Serre's conjecture over real quadratic fields.

The Langlands program is a branch of mathematics that includes ideas from number
theory (the study of equations in whole numbers), representation theory and
analysis. The number theoretic part of the program consists of a vast set of
interlinked conjectures relating the solutions of equations in whole numbers to
other apparently unrelated mathematical objects. In recent years it has become
clear that there should be another general framework in which the number
theoretic part of the program fits, a ``p-adic and mod p Langlands program''.
The PI proposes to formulate some precise conjectures in the mod p program, and
to use a technique originally developed by Andrew Wiles in his work on Fermat's
Last Theorem to prove cases of these conjectures, and other more classical
conjectures in number theory.
