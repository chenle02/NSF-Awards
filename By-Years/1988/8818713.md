This work will provide theoretical understanding of various fundamental problems
in condensed matter physics while investigating field theoretical models
relevant to both condensed matter and particle physics. Topics under
investigation lie in the areas of low temperature physics; strongly correlated
systems; high temperature superconductivity; topological effects in condensed
matter; disordered systems, including localization, equilibrium and non-
equilibrium properties of macromolecular systems, and spin glasses; field theory
and critical phenomena, including two-dimensional phase transitions and
conformal variance; neutron stars, supernovae, the early universe, and matter
under extreme conditions.
