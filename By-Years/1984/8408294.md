The objective of this effort is to continue research in systematic
characterization of the electrical properties of metal electrode-electrolyte
interfaces. The research is conducted in conjunction with electrochemical and
electrophysiological characterization activities in the newly equipped Bio-
Electrode Research Laboratory (BERL). A unifying approach is being investigated
based on the application of linear and non-linear system theory to conveniently
analyze and model the electrical properties of the metal electrode-electrolyte
interface. A comprehensive set of experiments, coupled with extensive simulation
of the interfacial behavior, will be studied. The test base will be later
deversified to include metal and alloys typically used as implanted electrodes
in bioelectric stimulation applications.
