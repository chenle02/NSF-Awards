This Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) Track-1 award considers one of
the most important problems facing the Western US, the problem of current (and
future) water provision under climate change coupled with increasing
urbanization and demand for water. The proposal focuses on the interactions
between climate change, water rights issues and water availability within Utah.
The research examines the fundamental interactions and dynamic feedbacks among
hydroclimate and the ecological and human aspects of urban and montane
landscapes. The project brings together research universities, colleges,
business, government and the residents of Utah to address key issues related to
ecosystems research, education, and workforce development in the
state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This RII project
targets the issue of water supply and management under future climate change
within Utah. iUTAH builds the human capital, data, and supporting infrastructure
to tackle this demanding task. Integrated, multi-disciplinary research teams
will be created to identify how physical systems and human systems interact
together to affect water supply, demand and management. Investments in
instrumentation, data collection and professional expertise, support the
modeling of alternative water futures for Utah; and the development of water
management, conservation and treatment technologies.&lt;br/&gt;The integration
of physical observational data and social science survey data and models will
lead efforts to inform policy makers, resource managers and the citizenry of
Utah about possible water futures. Visualization tools and citizen engagement
will be used to create two way feedbacks between researchers and other groups.
This research will help to identify future vulnerabilities and adaptation
technologies related to water provision in a rapidly growing
state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;iUTAH develops a full
suite of formal and informal educational activities to engage a wide number of
constituents. Activities span K-12 students and teachers; undergraduates,
graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty; citizen science and
industry and federal government. Efforts are geographically broad and recognize
rural and urban participation. There is broad engagement of many
underrepresented groups in STEM such as women, Native Americans and Hispanic
populations. The iUTAH team is partnering with two museums and citizen science
programs. There is significant interaction between research and education and
the activities directly strengthen areas noted as important within the state
Science and Technology Plan.
