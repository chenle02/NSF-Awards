The loss of variety as well as the numbers of organisms in natural habitats is
occurring at a rapid pace due to human intervention. It has become crucial to
monitor habitat destruction by more than visual observation. One possibility for
early detection of ecosystem degradation is to monitor changes in diversity of
nematode populations. Nematodes are ubiquitous in all ecosystems and are a major
component of the food web in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Previous
research on the structure and function of nematode communities in global
ecosystems has shown that they are of ecological significance in soil systems.
Soil nematodes are generally classified into five feeding groups: plant feeders,
bacterivores, fungivores, omnivores and predators. More recently, the bacterial
feeders have been considered as indicators of pollution in both aquatic and
terrestrial systems. There are very few estimates of the numbers of species of
bacterial feeding nematodes in various habitats. Species determinations become
crucial as ecosystems are examined for stability/change in functioning due to
the importance of bacterial feeding nematodes in soil, there has been limited
taxonomic research directed at this group. One of the difficulties in species
determinations is that most nematodes are transparent, microscopic, and require
special techniques in handling in order to discern minute taxonomic characters,
a process that is extremely laborious. A different, exploratory approach is
proposed for examining the species diversity of bacterial feeding nematodes. Two
methods will be used: 1) traditional morphological analyses, and 2) recently
developed molecular biological techniques. It is anticipated that these
techniques will allow for the rapid determination of biodiversity within a
nematode population as well as delimitation of species isolates. These
techniques should eventually allow the enumeration of species and determination
of the loss of diversity within nematode populations from endangered habitats.
