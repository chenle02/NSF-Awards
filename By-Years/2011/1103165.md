This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants,
especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the
"Conference on Recent Developments in L-Infinity Variational Problems and the
Associated Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations" that will be held from May
12-15, 2011, on the campus of the University of Kentucky.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will focus on a variety of topics in the
theory of partial differential equations, with the overarching theme stemming
from a specific subarea of the calculus of variations, namely, from so-called
L-infinity variational problems. All of the topic areas cited in the proposal
are central to analysis and extremely active subjects of current research. The
format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample opportunities to
speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities.
