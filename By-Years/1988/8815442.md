Graduate student W. R. Hoeh proposes to study the taxonomic distribution of
various reproductive strategies, especially simultaneous hermaphroditism, in the
freshwater clam genus Anodonta. Preliminary investigations using enzyme
electrophoresis have shown notable variation in levels of self- vs. cross-
fertilization, and this class of data will be used to identify "breeding
system". Restriction fragment patterns of mitochondrial DNA will be used to
establish evolutionary relationships among regional species and subspecies. The
distribution of the various reproductive strategies will be studied by
superimposing electrophoretic and morphological data from histological sections
of reproductive tissue onto the evolutionary tree. This treatment will reveal
the number of times and the circumstances under which hermaphroditism has
appeared in the group. The proposed research has implications beyond the
immediate area of specialization. It will lead to a better understanding of the
evolutionary history of the genus, and of the evolutionary origins and
significance of different reproductive strategies.
