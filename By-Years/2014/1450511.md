There is a large number of diabetics for whom a simple breath test to determine
glucose abnormalities would be deemed superior to the current standard blood
test. Development of a non-invasive method to monitor blood glucose that mirrors
the accuracy of the painful blood test would revolutionize not only the lives of
diabetics, but also the lives of the physicians who monitor their health. The
painful blood test that is currently the standard monitoring method is
potentially expensive, and it also deters regular monitoring of glucose - often
with dangerous outcomes. It is especially dangerous for diabetics who have
hypoglycemia unawareness, in which case, only the glucose test will alert the
person to the dangerously low blood sugar levels that can lead to coma or even
death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will develop gas sensors for detection of
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled human breath that act as biomarkers
of internal bodily processes, specifically those processes existing uniquely in
diabetes patients. The gas sensors comprise organic thin-films deposited by
resonant infrared, matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (RIR-MAPLE). RIR-
MAPLE provides vastly increased processability and control over a large range of
functional organic materials for which few methods exist to effectively
fabricate films with nanoscale features.
