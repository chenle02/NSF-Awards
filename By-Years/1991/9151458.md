Two Tektronix CAChe workstations (based on a Macintosh IIx and a 17MIPS
coprocessor) and a color printer will be used to introduce a molecular
calculations component into primarily upper division courses of the chemistry
curriculum. The calculations involved are extended Hueckel, MNDO, and molecular
mechanics types. The calculation capability will also impact the organic
chemistry course in demonstration mode, and the research activities of students
in several subfields of chemistry. These improvements reflect an important trend
in the way chemistry is practiced today. The grantee will match the NSF grant
from non-Federal sources.
