The project aims to develop a comprehensive and principled framework for
reasoning about the behavior of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, which
includes explaining their decisions, assessing their robustness and providing
formal guarantees on their behavior. These considerations are critical to the
success of AI systems in real-world applications, such as the safety of self-
driving cars. The project is particularly concerned with machine learning
systems, which are learned from data and have an inherent numeric nature that
contributes to their opacity and the difficulty in reasoning about their
behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is based on a fundamental
observation: Even though machine learning systems are numeric in nature, they
often implement symbolic decision functions. The project will specifically aim
to (1) compile the numeric machine learning systems into equivalent, symbolic
and tractable systems, and then (2) reason about the behavior of the machine
learning systems by operating on their compiled symbolic versions. This allows
one to bring in a wealth of techniques from classical AI, and computer science
more broadly, to bear on this important problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
