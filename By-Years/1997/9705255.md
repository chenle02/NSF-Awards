9705255 McGowan This planning project, sponsored by the Washington MESA program,
will carry out a planning program which will result in a full proposal to
support a strong parents program in the four MESA centers in the State of
Washington. With funds from the planning grant the MESA staff will do an
assessment of need for a parents program at ten target sites, identify potential
partners in working with the project and develop a parent involvement plan for
each center. Specific tasks will be to identify a parent coordinator at each
site, to prepare the sites to deliver a program for family math, science and
technology training and to develop parent leaders at each site who will work
with the schools so that they can deliver a strong math, science and technology
to all students as well as prepare parents to become active in their children's
learning.
