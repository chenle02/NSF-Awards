The research examines the effect of long-range correlations in magnetized
plasmas. Novel structures, such as avalanches, streamers and blobs appear driven
by and in turn affecting the turbulence. The goal is to study these correlations
experimentally using the Large Aperture Plasma Device at UCLA and through
simulation.
