9304621 McNutt The PI will analyze gravity, elevation, and seismic velocity data
in the wavelength band 6000- 3000 km to constrain the pattern of variations in
viscosity , and / , the factor that relates seismic velocity to density. By
correlating the variations in and / with the tectonic and volcanic history of
the overlying plates, she will learn more about the effects of temperature,
mineralogy, stress, and partial melt on the dynamic behavior of the upper
mantle. **** Program Director Date
