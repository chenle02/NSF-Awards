The PI plans studies involving Roman analysis of gas mixtures, applied studies
on ore-deposit geology and collaborative work to bridge the gap between
analytical, experimental and theoretical approaches to fluid-rock interactions,
especially in the context of how ore deposits form and alteration occurs. Fluid
inclusion analysis of natural minerals and experimental analogs provide incite
into the composition and specification of fluids derived from igneous and
metamorphic environments, as well as the mineralizing P-T conditions.
Experimental and theoretical studies of fluid compositions at elevated T&P,
designed to initiate natural fluid evolution, provide model data and constraints
to natural systems. Field emphasis of this work will involve the rocks of the
Duluth Complex.
