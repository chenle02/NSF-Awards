A comprehensive set of algorithms is developed for end-to-end scheduling in
distributed real-time systems of different sizes, complexity, and dynamics.
These algorithms are thoroughly analyzed and evaluated in order to determine
their capabilities and limitations. In addition, rigorous design rules and
selection criteria governing their use are derived. This should help to develop
a basic framework in which strategies for end-to-end scheduling, load balancing,
concurrency control, and synchronization are integrated to enhance the
responsiveness and robustness of the overall system.
