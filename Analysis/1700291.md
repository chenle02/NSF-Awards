Dynamical systems appear naturally as models of important phenomena in celestial
mechanics, meteorology, fluid convection, economy, social sciences, and
population dynamics. Even dynamical systems in one dimension, the focus of this
research project, can exhibit extremely rich and intricate properties that
represent a challenge to understanding. The goal of this research project is to
use ideas and techniques from probability, ergodic theory, and statistical
mechanics to study one-dimensional dynamical systems, the dependence on
parameters of various objects associated to these systems, such as physical
measures and geometric Gibbs states, and sets of fractal nature like Julia sets
and the Mandelbrot set.

This project focuses on investigating the universality of the large deviation
principle in dimension one; Pesin's conjecture on the absence of phase
transitions for typical logistic maps; Ruelle's conjecture on linear response
theory; and the fine geometry of some sets of fractal nature such as Julia sets
and the Mandelbrot set. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in
the project.
