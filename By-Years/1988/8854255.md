A week-long workshop in inorganic chemistry is being held to give regional
undergraduate faculty experience in some modern techniques and some exposure to
the chemistry of binuclear organometallic compounds. It is expected that the
experience will enhance their comprehension of these developments, and that they
will adopt some of the laboratory procedures in their own curricula. The
mornings are being used for the lectures with the afternoons involving hands-on
experiments. The first day is being devoted to the bench top reaction chemistry
of Ä±Fe(Cp)(CO)2!2, Fe(Cp)(CO)2I, and related compounds. During the remaining
four days the participants are being divided into five groups, and these groups
are rotating through their choice of four out of five sessions in a sequence of
technique-oriented sessions. The sessions are: NMR; Electrochemistry; IR; MO
calculations; and X-ray crystallography. The facilities at undergraduate
institutions are adequate to conduct many aspects of these projects. The aspects
that cannot be supported by undergraduate institutions, such as X-ray
diffraction, are of value in enhancing the faculty comprehension of topics that
nevertheless must be presented to students in lecture.
