Proposal Title: Modeling and Simulation of Complex Systems

Institution: Mississippi State University

Goals: The major focus of this RII Track-1 project is the merging of biology and
chemistry through computational investigation and simulation. The project seeks
to do this by 1) linking molecular modeling to macroscale physiology, 2)
deploying high-level data mining, and 3) modeling nanoscale structures to
understand binding interactions and catalytic processes. The biological
simulation efforts are broad, ranging from whole body physiological modeling
methods to specific modeling of problems such as particle deposition in upper
lung airways. The computational biology effort centers on developing new methods
for integrating functional genomics information from high-throughput sources
such as microarrays and next generation gene sequencers. The computational
chemistry effort is geared towards theoretical characterization of nanomaterials
for sensor technologies, and the development of models to predict the effects of
nanomaterials on health and the environment.

This project seeks to capitalize on previous Research Infrastructure Improvement
(RII) investments by strengthening the quality of research in each of the
research foci, increasing the statewide collaborations in each area, and
establishing meaningful collaborations in the emerging research areas.
Underpinning all of the research components are the establishment of needed
cyberinfrastructure and the integration of education at all levels.

Intellectual Merit This project will integrate research in modeling and
simulation of complex systems to advance the understanding of complex biological
systems and networks, and the understanding of the effects of nanoparticles on
specific functions of the biological systems/networks. As such the projects
focus on problems of practical significance (simulation of inhalation exposure
to nanoparticles and the resulting deleterious effects on respiratory and
cardiovascular function); propose new models for learning biological networks
that combine Bayesian learning and numerical optimization and can lead to novel
approaches for explaining model response; and explore new theoretical
characterization of nanoscale materials with particular emphasis on using
quantum mechanics (QM) to predict changes in structure and electronic properties
of nanomaterials for sensors, and use Quantitative Structure-Property
Relationship (QSPR) and Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR)
models to predict nanotoxicity.

Broader Impacts This project will impact the diversity of the computational
sciences community of faculty and students in Mississippi and contribute to the
development of a skilled workforce that will assist Mississippi in transitioning
to a knowledge-based economy. It will also contribute to the broader
computational sciences community by investigating specific complex biological
systems and processes with significant societal impact.
