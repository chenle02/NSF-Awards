The NSF Faculty Awards for Women Scientists and Engineers recognizes the high
quality of the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship, as well as
potential research, the academic profession, and the education of future
scientists and engineers. The research to be undertaken by Dr. Farkas with this
award is aimed at understanding the mechanical behavior of ordered intermetallic
alloys. Ordered intermetallic alloys offer a unique opportunity to develop
materials with properties intermediate between metals and ceramics. In recent
years it has been shown that the mechanical properties of these alloys can be
controlled by microalloying. Microalloying controls the properties of these
materials through modification of the structure and mobility of extended crystal
defects, namely dislocations and grain boundaries. This research for the next
five years will concentrate on theoretical studies of extended defect structure
in novel ordered intermetallic alloys, with emphasis in predicting mechanical
behavior. The alloys to be studied will be both cubic and hexagonal, including,
but not limited to Ni and Ti Aluminides. Using various computer simulation
techniques, the atomic structure of grain boundaries and dislocation cores in
these materials and the interaction of dislocations and grain boundaries will be
investigated. The goal is to contribute to the understanding of the mechanical
behavior of these alloys in both single crystal and polycrystalline form and to
be able to suggest ways to improve their ductility. In the last phase of this
research, the results of the defect and defect interaction simulations will
constitute the basis for the development of models for mechanical behavior of
these intermetallic alloys and in the design of new intermetallics with improved
ductility.
