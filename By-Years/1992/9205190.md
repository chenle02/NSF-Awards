This project is a three-year study of reworked volcaniclastic deposits in the
Eocene Challis volcanic field in central Idaho. The project focuses on two major
goals. The first is identification of changes in sedimentation style and pattern
that result from different types of volcanic eruptions. The second goal is
analysis of bias in the sedimentary record of volcanism. Deposits of the Challis
volcanic field represent a long period of volcanic activity (51 to 40 million
years ago) characterized by an initial period of predominantly non-explosive
intermediate volcanism followed by caldera-forming volcanism. The sedimentary
system associated with this volcanism comprises high - and low - sinuosity
streams, lakes (claystone - tuff and turbidite components), and debris - flow
aprons deposited by lahars. The study will identify the signal of different
eruption types in a diverse assemblage of depositional environments. The study
will also identify which environments are most sensitive to perturbation by
eruption and therefore, contain the best record of volcanic activity. The study
is field - oriented, combining lithostratigraphy, tephra fingerprinting, and
petrofacies stratigraphy to produce the detailed correlation framework needed to
achieve the projects goals. These methods require measurement of detailed
stratigraphic sections, sandstone, diamictite, and conglomerate petrology, and
chemical analyses of fallout tuffs in the sections.
