A new method has been developed for the measurement of lithium isotope ratios
in geological material, as a result of an initial study funded by NSF. The mass
spectrometric technique involves the thermal ionization of lithium tetraborate
and is capable of producing 6Li/7Li ratios with an uncertainty of 1.3 0/00 (one
standard deviation). The results of a preliminary survey indicate important
variation of th eisotope composition of Li in the marine environment and
demonstrate the usefulness of Li isotope ratio as a tracer for mass exchange in
the ocean. This proposal summarizes the findings of the initial research and
requests support for a comprehensive investigation of the marine isotope
geochemistry of lithium. Efforts will be directed at determining the isotopic
composition of the sources and sinks of Li in the ocean and the isotopic
fractionation associated with the mass transfer processes. The main emphasis is
on the utilization of Li isotope systematics in the understanding of (1) the
control on the Li isotopic composition of seawater, (2) the direction and
magnitude of Li transfer during seawater-basalt interaction and (3) the process
by which Li is enriched in marine sediments. These considerations address the
problem of mass balance of Li in the ocean and is of fundamental importance in
the characterization of the geochemical cycle of Li.
