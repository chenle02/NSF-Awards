The Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico is creating citizen science projects in
five research areas (insect monitoring; coastal/river system management; bird
communities; bat assemblages; and cultural resources) that allow 140 Hispanic
residents of Puerto Rico (age 14 and older) to move along a continuum of
research involvement from contributor to collaborator to co-creator. As citizen
scientists engage in scientific research that measures the effects of urban
development on the Manati River watershed in northern Puerto Rico, the project
team is evaluating the degree to which participants show changes in science
knowledge, skills, attitudes, communication, and
behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is accelerating the
development of citizen science activities in Puerto Rico. New scientific
knowledge generated by citizen scientists will have practical importance within
and beyond the Manati watershed because Puerto Rico is undergoing rapid urban
development, resulting in the loss of biodiversity and emergence of
environmental problems such as lower water quality. Environmental data collected
by citizen scientists will form an environmental database that permits long-term
watershed monitoring and informs land use decision making.
