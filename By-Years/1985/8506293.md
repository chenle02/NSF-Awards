Many research projects related to the measurement of surface roughness are
currently in progress at the University of California, Berkeley. There is a need
to upgrade the measuring equipment currently in use for four of these projects:
surface roughness measurement of magnetic recording heads and media, acoustic
emission from manufacturing processes, abrasive and erosive wear in metals and
ceramics, and wrinkle development in sheet metal forming.
