ABSTRACT CHE-9521971 William R. Dolbier 25 September 1995 University of Florida
With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program Professor William R. Dolbier of
the University of Florida will continue studies of fluorine-containing free
radicals. A variety of experiments will be undertaken, some in collaboration
with senior investigators at other institutions as well as at Florida. The
determination of absolute rates in additions, abstractions, and cyclizations of
fluorine- containing free radicals is the major task to be performed. These
experiments will increase the understanding of the effect of fluorine as a
substituent in free radical chemistry. The work has industrial significance in
that fluorine compounds possess unique and advantageous properties (e.g.
Teflon). Some are articles of commerce and these fundamental studies may lead to
new ways of preparing such compounds.
