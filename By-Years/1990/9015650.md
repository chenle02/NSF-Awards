This research is directed at the warping of printed wiring boards, an
increasingly detrimental factor in the assembly of fine pitch components and
connectors. The research will determine the controlling factors that create the
warpage condition, evaluate the influence of each factor, and determine which
parameters can be controlled or eliminated in order to reduce the degree of
stress related circuit card warpage. Both experimental and numerical techniques
will be used for this evaluation.
