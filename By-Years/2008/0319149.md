This award will supply shipboard scientific support equipment for the Research
Vessel Ewing operated by Columbia University's Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory
and dedicated to use in support of marine research. The Shipboard Scientific
Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to
the proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. The Program provides
support for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the
deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such
as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of
research sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers and
satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and other
equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from
data retrieval sites. The Project Director, Paul Ljunggren is fully qualified to
direct this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the
acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment. This project will allow the
institution to acquire a dual frequency GPS system, an electronic charting
system, and immersion suits (via group purchase). ***
