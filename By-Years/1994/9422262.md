The research proposed includes exploratory studies of actual methods used in
corporations/business units that have been engaged in self-assessment,
integration of those results into business unit planning processes, and
identification of linkages among the assessment activities, planning activities,
identification and implementation of improvement efforts, and subsequent changes
in business processes and results. Relationships to be tested include whether
self-assessment improves results of planning efforts, whether self-assessment
accelerates systematic improvement efforts, and whether self-assessment
increases commitment to quality improvements. The research will be conducted in
eight organizations (Allied Signal, American Express, Henry Ford Health Systems,
IBM Credit, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Procter &amp; Gamble, Union Pacific Railroad,
Xerox Business Services), and will include a series of working conferences to
share results among cooperating organizations
