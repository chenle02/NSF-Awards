The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Division of Chemistry funds
Professor Theodore Dibble at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry
for studies of the chemistry of mercury. Mercury is a neurotoxin that
accumulates to toxic levels in many fish species, which is why health agencies
recommend limits on fish consumption. In order to determine how much to limit
mercury emissions from human activities, scientists work to understand how
mercury is transferred between air and soil to the water in which fish live.
Mercury enters soil and water from the air most efficiently when it is in the
form of mercury compounds. However, mercury mostly enters the air as atoms of
mercury. Once in the air, atoms of mercury can react to form mercury compounds,
but those compounds may break up to re-form mercury atoms. To understand the
transfer of mercury from air to soil and water, we need to know both the
reactions by which mercury atoms form compounds and how those compounds break
chemical bonds to regenerate atoms of mercury. Professor Dibble studies the
reactions of mercury in the gas phase by performing calculations which yield
information on the energetics and rates of chemical reactions. in addition to
the potential societal impacts in environment, this project provides research
opportunities for a graduate student, a postdoc, and several undergraduate
students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The first hypothesis of this project is that
the reaction of HOHg radical (formed by the reaction of Hg with OH) with ozone
is fast, enabling OH radical to initiate oxidation of Hg(0) to Hg(II) throughout
most of the atmosphere. The second hypothesis is that direct reaction of Hg with
ozone does not initiate Hg(0) oxidation in the gaseous atmosphere, contrary to
what is assumed in many atmospheric models. The third hypothesis is that while
photolysis of many Hg(II) compounds is fast, it often leaves mercury in the
Hg(II) oxidation state rather than reducing it to Hg(0) or Hg(I). No
experimental data exist on most of the compounds or reactions important to this
project. This research uses quantum chemistry and computational kinetics to test
these hypotheses. Specifically, the team determines the thermodynamics and rate
constants for key reactions of Hg-containing radicals, and computes absorption
cross-sections and photolysis pathways for stable Hg(II) compounds. These
results are incorporated into models of atmospheric
mercury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
