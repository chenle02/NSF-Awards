With national spotlights on community colleges, the need for technicians in
advance technological fields in STEM, and the significant promise of online
education, this research project will identify and synthesize what has been
learned through efforts at developing and implementing online courses and course
components in technical/technician education in science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM), with a particular emphasis on development
and implementation projects supported by the National Science Foundation's
Advanced Technological Eduation program (ATE). The research team will
investigate how the implementation and use of online education can or does
profoundly change the institutional culture and structure of teaching and
learning. Data collection consists of in-depth semi-structured interviews with
faculty and key personal and structured document analysis.

This qualitative research study examines the promise of online education for
technicians in advanced technological fields in STEM. The goal of the research
study is to synthesize what has been learned about online technical education in
ATE project and make connections to the broader literature about what works and
what does not work in online technical education. The research team will ensure
the credibility, dependability, and confirmability of the research findings
through an iterative process consisting of triangulation, peer debriefing, and
member checking. Data triangulation involves collecting data with multiple
methods. Peer debriefing involves an outside reviewer examining the data from
transcripts of interviews and focus groups and document analyses to ensure that
findings and conclusions represent the perceptions/perspectives of the research
participants. Member checking requires that researchers share their findings
with research participants to ensure that information was interpreted correctly.
