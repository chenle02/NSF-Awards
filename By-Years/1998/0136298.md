ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0136977&lt;br/&gt;OCE-
0136298&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent investigations of the
biogeochemistry of iron in the ocean has spurred interest in the interaction of
atmospherically sourced bioactive elements including iron, zinc, cobalt and
copper on the speciation, organic complexation and bioavailability of these
trace metals in surface seawater. In conjunction with a planned field expedition
to the central western Pacific (NSF OCE-0117917- Measures, Landing and Cutter)
this collaborative research effort will employ a range of electrochemical and
mass spectrometric based analytical techniques uniquely sensitive to the sub-
nanomolar concentrations of the elements Fe, Co, Zn and Cu found in surface
seawater. The use of competitive ligand equilibration experiments along with the
sensitive voltammetric stripping analyses used in the electrochemical studies
will provide relative indication of the binding strength of organic ligands
either produced during surface phytoplankton blooms or found in atmospheric
precipitation or dry deposition&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
