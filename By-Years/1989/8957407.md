Michael Smith is working on the design of analog integrated circuits for two
applications: integrated sensors and neural networks. He has designed CAD tools
for analog circuit design, and has used these for the design of several novel
chips. He is currently working with Kodak on sensors and neural network
techniques for image acquisition.
