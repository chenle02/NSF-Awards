This award supports a project to develop a coupled thermo mechanical model for
margins of ice streams of the type draining the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS).
This model will provide a theoretical framework for interpreting measurements of
velocity and ice temperature in ice stream margins in terms of changes in basal
sliding behavior and ice flow law across the margin. This work will allow the
investigation of the possible controls on the positions of ice stream margins,
with particular emphasis on the stability of a boundary between a frozen and a
wet bed. Since the width of ice streams affects the discharge of inland ice
through the ice streams into the ocean, an understanding of ice stream margins
is fundamental to understanding the mass balance of the West Antarctic Ice
Sheet, how it might change in the future, and what impact it could have on
global sea level.
