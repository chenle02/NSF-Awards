The primary objective of this project is to bring multi-disciplinary science to
the general public through innovative methods, and to introduce young people
from junior high school age and older - including minority students and girls -
to science via methods that will encourage scientific literacy and lead
increasing numbers of them into scientific endeavors. &lt;br/&gt;The innovative
medium used to accomplish this objective is a combination of science and the
performing arts, as a way of presenting science through the arts. A key
ingredient is to make use of the considerable skills and talents of faculty and
staff presently in science and the arts departments, and also utilizes the
infrastructure of public performance and meeting spaces at colleges and
universities, as well as the off-campus facilities and talent within their local
environments. This allows this project to become national in
scope.&lt;br/&gt;This project also brings together the creativity of the
performing arts with the project management tools of science, in order to insure
that progress towards the goals are understandable as well as measurable.
