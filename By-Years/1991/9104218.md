This award funds a postdoctoral research fellowship in plant biology for two
years. The project entitled "Characterization of GT-1, a plant nuclear factor
which mediates light responsive regulation" is to be carried out in the
laboratory of Dr. Nam-Hai Chua at Rockefeller University. The applicant received
her Ph.D. training in the area of prokaryotic molecular biology. In her
postdoctoral training, she completely switches her field to plant molecular
biology and focuses on the molecular mechanisms of light regulation of gene
expression in tobacco and Arabidopsis. The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Plant
Biology are designed to increase the number of outstanding young investigators
in plant biology.
