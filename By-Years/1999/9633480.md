The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program is supporting Prof. Mark
Gordon of Iowa State University. The research to be performed will be a
combination of theory and code development in quantum chemistry and related
areas and applications of modern quantum chemistry to problems in main group
organometallic chemistry. The new developments in theory will focus on two
areas: (1) an extension of the effective fragment method for solvation to any
solvent, to excited states, and to include higher-order intermolecular
interactions, and (2) to extend the interface between quantum chemistry and
dynamics to facilitate the study of dynamics of liquids and solvation dynamics.
One of the key applications areas interfaces with these new theory developments,
namely the study of the influence of solvation on mechanisms in organometallic
chemistry. Among the many mechanisms of interest are the nature of the ring
opening in cyclic organosilicon compounds, the effect of catalysts on reactions
such as the hydrosilation and bis-silylation reactions, and the nature of the
organometallic coupling reaction. Other applications include a broad-based study
of the chemistry of titanium and other Group IVB elements, and quantitative
studies of the thermochemistry of main group- transition metal bonding. Although
most chemical reactions occur in the presence of a solvent, until very recently,
the vast majority of theoretical studies have been carried out on isolated
molecules. Even now, most current models that include the effects of solvents do
not explicitly treat the individual solvent molecules and therefore cannot
determine the nature of the interactions between the chemical system of interest
and the solvent. The Gordon group has developed a new solvent model, the
effective fragment potential model, that is designed to treat the solvent
molecules explicitly. Currently, this model is limited to the most ubiquitous
solvent, water. This model will now be extended so that any solvent of interest
in organometallic chemistry will be accessible. The new method will be applied
to study the effects of solvation on several important chemical reactions. It is
anticipated that these studies will provide some fundamental understanding of
how these reactions occur and ultimately provide some guidance on the design of
new products.
