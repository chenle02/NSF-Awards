With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Kathryn Jakes and her
collaborators will develop techniques to identify fibers which were used by
prehistoric Native American peoples and then use the results of this work to
analyze archaeological materials from two archaeological sites. They will first
accumulate a comparative collection of plants which they believe were
potentially used for these purposes. The fibrous plant materials will then be
processed by pulling, cutting, retting and carbonizing and then examined by a
variety of techniques. These include a number of different photomicroscopy
approaches as well as scanning electron microscopy and X ray analysis. On this
basis, criteria for species identification can be established and methods
developed to determine prehistoric manufacturing processes. Finally, the results
will be applied to two sites, the Middle Woodland period Seip Mound in Ohio and
the Mississippian period Etowah site in Georgia. While textiles are sometimes
encountered in prehistoric Native American sites, currently it is often not
possible to determine either how they were manufactured or the raw materials of
which they are composed. Archaeologists are interested in these issues not only
because of the textiles themselves, but also for what they reveal about
prehistoric use of the environment and the light they shed on social structure.
It is postulated that within a site, the greater the variation in the types of
fabrics produced and the quality and techniques of manufacture, the greater the
social complexity of the group involved. This hypothesis will be evaluated
through the analysis of Seip and Etowah materials. This research is important
for several reasons. It will provide an identification key which will be useful
to a large number of archaeologists who work at many sites. It will examine the
relationship between variation in material and social complexity and increase
our understanding of two important prehistoric sites. Since graduate students
will participate, it will assist in the training of young scientists.
