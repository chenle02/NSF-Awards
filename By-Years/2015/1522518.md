Mobile applications are prevalent and are increasingly being used for business
activities. Because the mobile user environment is not directly under the
control of the companies developing such applications, it is difficult for them
to observe, reproduce, investigate, and fix failures that occur in the field.
Further, mobile environments can be heterogeneous and may lead to different
kinds of issues in the application behavior, making it harder to investigate
these issues and possible failures associated with them. Delays in addressing
these failures lead to high cost in terms of customer support and loss of
reputation on the application store due to bad reviews from dis-satisfied
customers. This I-Corps team proposes a novel approach that captures the runtime
behavior of a mobile application in the field and makes it available to the
developer.

The goal from this project is to complete the customer validation to develop a
proof-of-concept technique and tool for capturing field data relevant to the
mobile application. The technique will collect this field data, which consists
of different runtime states of the application on specific mobile environments
and the sequences of actions leading to such states. This information would be
reported in a visual format to allow developers to identify commonalities and
differences between the runtime behavior obtained from different environments.
Although the exact details of this technique might change based on interaction
with potential customers, it has essential ingredients to support the testing
and maintenance activities for the mobile application.
