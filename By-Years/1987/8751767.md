This project, Regional Educators Network and Enhancement Workshop (RENEW)
builds on the strengths of an honors workshop,(ASSIST) A Special Summer
Institute for Science Teachers funded by NSF. Twenty-five teachers per year,
from high school, middle school and elementary schools respectively, will
participate in an eight-week summer Enhancement Workshop at the University of
Michigan Biological Station. This Workshop will emphasize techniques in science
education, peer coaching, mentor-teaching and other effective strategies to
enhance their science teaching. In addition, each teacher will choose one of the
regularly offered courses at the Biological Station to update and enhance their
biology content background. Project ASSIST participants will work with these
teachers in their schools during the school year. In years two and three of this
project, a network of participants and previous participants will work in each
of five local regions in the state of Michigan to implement improved science
teaching, to communicate with each other and to disseminate information to
colleagues in their regions. State funds have been utilized in initiating a
pilot version of this network. Thirty-two percent of the budget for this project
is cost-shared by contributions from the University and school districts. The
cost of released time, substitutes and materials to implement the program is
borne by the schools. State of Michigan funds are being used to support the
"veteran" teachers in their support of participants.
