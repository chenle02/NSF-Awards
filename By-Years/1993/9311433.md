9311433 Dubin Two aspects of polyelectrolyte-colloid complex formation will be
explored: elucidation of the critical binding phenomenon, and characterization
of soluble complexes. The first theme will be pursued using two types of small
colloidal particles of variable size, and of measurable and variable surface
charge density: micelles of DMDAO, and carboxylated starburst dendrimers. The
second matter will be investigated by the application of quasi- elastic light
scattering, turbidimetry, dynamic light scattering, and static light scattering
to two systems which form soluble complexes: polycations with mixed
anionic/nonionic micelles, and polycations or polyanions with proteins. These
studies will provide detailed information about the solution structure of the
complexes. For the polyelectrolyte-micelle system, they will also use
fluorescence spectroscopy and pulsed field gradient nmr, to elucidate the effect
of the polyion on the structure and dynamics of the bound micelle. In the case
of polyelectrolyte-protein complexes, they will make use of computer graphics in
an attempt to identify the nature of the polyion-binding site on the protein.
Solution characterization of polyelectrolyte-protein complexes will focus on the
mechanism of coacervate formation. The interaction of polyelectrolytes with
oppositely charged colloids is a central component in a number of commercial
processes and is relevant to some important cellular phenomena. Coacervation
carries the potential for the development of new techniques of protein
separation and enzyme immobilization. ***
