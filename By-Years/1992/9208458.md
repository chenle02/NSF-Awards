The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division is
supporting a project at Clarkson University under the supervision of Dr. Larry
Eno on the theoretical study of laser-induced transitions between electronic
surfaces in reactive molecular collisions. The extent to which the laser field
can be used as a probe of the dynamics of a collinear reaction is being studied
with regard to variation in the laser intensity, field frequency, polarization,
collision energy, internal energy, and other factors. Complications such as
rotating wave breakdown and multi-electronic surface effects are being
considered. %%% A major current problem in chemical physics is to obtain greater
understanding of what actually happens during the course of a chemical reaction,
i.e., during the short time in which reacting molecules approach each other,
pass through an intermediate transition stage, and separate as products. This
project is a theoretical investigation to determine how laser probes can be used
to provide information during this brief period.
