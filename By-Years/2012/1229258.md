1229258&lt;br/&gt;Gillikin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports acquisition of a stable isotope
ratio mass spectrometer (SIRMS) equipped with multiple collectors, a high
temperature pyrolysis system and automated sample introduction system for the
Geology Department at Union College. The instrument will support a range of
research and research training in paleoclimatology and paleoceanography that
requires analysis of stable isotope ratios recorded in marine and freshwater
bivalves and in marine and lacustrine sediments. The instrument will also
support isotopic investigations of natural waters, glacial ice and plant
materials for paleoenvironmental and paleoecological studies of climate dynamics
and the global carbon cycle. Union College in a non-Ph.D. granting institution
and has a strong commitment to involving a diverse body of undergraduate
students in faculty-mentored research. Union College is a member of the Keck
Geology Consortium and the instrument will serve students and faculty from
several affiliated Keck institutions. The PIs plans K-12 outreach activities
aimed at at-risk and underrepresented youth for topical regional investigations
of immediate societal relevance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
