This project seeks to improve the understanding and representation, in climate
models, of the turbulent exchanges between the atmosphere and snow and ice over
oceans and land. The principal objectives are (a) the intercomparison of various
parameterization schemes for atmospheric turbulent surface fluxes over sea ice,
(b) improving the computation of roughness lengths over sea ice, as well as the
turbulent exchange coefficients under very stable conditions, (c) quantifying
the impacts of turbulent flux parameterization on the simulation of snow/ice
over ocean and land, and (d) evaluating the impact of a unified turbulent flux
parameterization over land, ocean and sea ice in a global climate
simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The improved formulations expected from this
project could be adopted in the NCAR Community Climate System Model for
community-wide use. The project will provide training for graduate students,
while research results will be included in undergraduate and graduate teaching
courses.
