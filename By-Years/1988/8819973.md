Dr. John Horowitz is continuing a line of experimentation which is designed to
understand the neural activity underlying hibernation. He is studying the
hippocampus because it is a region of the brain that appears to be involved in
the entrance into and arousal from hibernation. By using the hippocampal slice
preparation, the temperature of the bathing solution over the hippocampal neural
network can be easily precisely set to match any temperature in the range
observed in the CNS of animals entering hibernation. One set of experiments
centers on the effect of temperature on long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP has
captured the imagination of neuroscientists as a model with which to probe the
mechanisms of learning and memory in the mammalian brain, but whether these
mechanisms persist at low brain temperatures is unknown. Serotonin, a
neurotransmitter, has been shown to play a role in an animal's entrance into
hibernation. Therefore, the second set of experiments if to determine the effect
of temperature on the serotonergic response of hippocampal neurons. This work is
important because it will give us more insight into how the brain regulates and
operates during low temperature states.
