9631390 Chory An understanding of the signal transduction pathways controlling
light-regulated development of Arabidopsis, with particular emphasis placed on
the pathway defined by the negative regulatory gene, DET1, is the major goal of
this research. DET1 was cloned and shown to be a novel nuclear protein that does
not appear to bind DNA directly. The precise mechanism of action of DET1 in
repressing expression of light-regulated promoters will be investigated and
targets of DET1 action will be identified and cloned. Specifically, the
biochemical function of DET1 will be determined, proteins that functionally
interact with DET1 will be identified, any post-translationally modification of
DET1 by light or other signals will be determined, DET3, a downstream response
gene, will be isolated and characterized and the genetic analysis of suppressors
of weak det1 alleles will be genetically analyzed. The data from these
experiments will allow construction of mechanistic models for the control of
development and gene expression by light and other signals in Arabidopsis
thaliana. %%% Light signals are required for the induction and regulation of
many developmental processes. Genetic analysis demonstrates that light responses
are not simply endpoints of linear signal transduction pathways, but are the
result of the integration of a variety of input signals through a complex
network of interacting signaling components. The experiments described will
integrate genetic, molecular and biochemical approaches in Arabidopsis in an
effort to understand the mechanisms involved in plant response to light. Such an
understanding in the model plant should form a conceptual framework for how all
land plants respond to changes in their environment. ***
