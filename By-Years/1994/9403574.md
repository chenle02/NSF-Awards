9403574 Tick This award is to support a workshop on Parallel Logic and
Functional Programming and their Programming Environments, to be held in March
4-6, l994 at the University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon. This workshop will host
international researchers working in the area of parallel programming languages,
compilers and environments. The participation of researchers from ICOT
(Institute of New Generation Computer Technology) will be sponsored by ICOT. The
workshop participants will participate in stimulating discussions on concurrent
computations, concurrent run-time systems and concurrent programming
environments for logic and functional programming languages. ***
