This award support attendance of United States graduate students at the "John
Archibald Wheeler" International School on Astrophysical Relativity course
entitled "Frontiers in Numerical Gravitational Astrophysics." The course will
take place June 27-July 5, 2008, in Erice, Italy. The course objective is to
present the gamut of computational techniques for both Newtonian and General
Relativistic gravitational computation in Astrophysics. Twenty one distinguished
specialists in the field will lecture at the course. Attendees will be an
international group of graduate students and early career postdocs. The course
will promote international collaboration and will develop and extend the skill
set of students (and lecturers) in computational science. Techniques studied
will be specialized to the astrophysical setting but are generally applicable to
a broad range of complex problems in all the sciences, including economics and
demographics, as well as the traditional "hard" sciences. This award is co-
funded by the Divisions of Physics and Astronomical Sciences.
