Building on its innovation, ALOHA, a connection-free wireless communications
technology, this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from ALOHA
Networks, Inc. will investigate the technical feasibility of chip slotting in a
general Spread ALOHA Multiple Access (SAMA) data network. ALOHA Networks plans
to (a) determine the practicality of transmitting chip clock phase information
for the hub receiver in broadcast mode; (b) formulate algorithms for the use of
this information by the remote terminal transmitters; and (c) provide a
preliminary design of a SAMA hub receiver which can resolve overlapping chip
slotted SAMA packets from multiple transmitters. The benefits of a chip slotted
SAMA network will be simplifying in a major way the implementation of wideband
connection-free multiple access channels while at the same time increasing the
multiple access throughput of these channels. The potential commercial
applications of the improved performance characteristics of the ALOHA
connection-free wireless data network which the project has as its objective
will include wireless Internet access, wireless local loops, video answerback,
and large scale wideband Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSAT) networks.
