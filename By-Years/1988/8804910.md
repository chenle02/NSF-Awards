This project will support seven undergraduate students, selected competatively
nationwide, who will work on a variety of research projects in the earth
sciences. They will work with Columbia faculty members who are currently during
research in such fields as geochemistry, paleontology, marine geophysics,
seismology, structural geology, paleoclimatology, stratigraphy and
dendrochronology. The projects on which they will work are carefully designed to
be self-contained, yet usually contribute to some larger effort. The award will
augment the earth science portion of a highly successful on-going program in the
fields of physics, chemistry, biology and geology.
