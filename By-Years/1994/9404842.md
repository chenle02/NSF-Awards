Root apices have been studied through the analysis of cell lineage based on
histological sections. Theories of apical organization derived from such
analyses led to the view that there existed "ultimate initials" at the focus of
the cell lineage, just proximal to the root cap. As a result of continuous
mitotic activity, it was believed, the ultimate initials produced derivative
cells that formed the root. The discovery in 1956 that these cells rarely
divided in a growing root initiated a reassessment of root development.
Collectively, these inactive "ultimate initials" comprise a region called the
quiescent center (QC). Since its discovery, plant biologists have tried to
understand what the QC cells do, why they are quiescent, and how and when
quiescence arises. The work outlined in this proposal addresses these questions.
The objectives of this proposal are to use molecular, genetic, and physiological
approaches to link the known biochemistry of the root to the biophysics which
determines the cellular architecture of the root. Specific attention will be
directed to measuring the levels, distributions and interactions between auxin,
ascorbic acid and ascorbic acid oxidase with the objective of relating changes
in these substances to properties of the quiescent center. Using various
experimental approaches, levels of these substances will be manipulated and the
status of the quiescent center and apical anatomy investigated. The significance
of this effort lies in the advancement of a new hypothesis to account for and
understand the establishment and developmental role of the quiescent center and
ultimately patterning in roots.
