The objective of this program is to develop the network control system
technology infrastructure necessary for high-productivity greenhouses
specialized to harsh environments.

The intellectual merit of our proposed research is Global food production is
coming under increased resource pressure due to urbanization, reduced fresh-
water availability, population increase, and targeting agriculture for bio-
fuels. Greenhouses offer a 6-20X productivity increase by creating controlled
growing environments.

The rapid convergence of sensing, computing and communication technologies on
cost effective, low power, miniature devices is enabling a revolution in
Networked Control Systems. These are distributed control/estimation systems with
large numbers of sensors, actuators, and computing nodes that communicate over
wire-line or ad hoc wireless networks.

Networked control systems will enable the next generation of high-technology
greenhouses. These will include wireless sensor networks for ubiquitous sensing,
optimized control architectures for regulation of environmental variables, and
distributed fault-detection algorithms.

Broader Impact The societal impact of the project comes is in developing
technological tools that can be used for cost-effective production of food in
harsh environments through protected precision agriculture.

The scientific impact of the project will stem from developing fundamental
system-theoretic analysis and design methods for networked control systems
across a class of application contexts. Layered architecture approach will be
developed to navigate design tradeoffs such as computational resource
allocation, communication protocol choice, and power/reliability compromises.

The technological impact of the project is that it will enable the systematic,
cost-effective design of network controlled greenhouses particularly suited for
harsh environments. Specifically, control-oriented models suitable for generic
greenhouses will be developed, algorithms for distributed fault detection and
isolation will be investigated, and appropriate scalable distributed control
architectures will be devised.

The transformative aspect of this project is to develop the foundational network
control infrastructure necessary to increase crop yield by environment control
of high-volume production greenhouses.
