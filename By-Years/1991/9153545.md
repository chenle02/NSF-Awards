The objective of this project is to involve 36 eleven to fourteen year-old
girls and 18 of their teachers from nine middle schools in New York City in
activities designed to develop and reinforce their interest in science. These
include (a) a three-week Summer Workshop at the Graduate Center of the City
University of New York (CUNY) in which they are developing expertise with
computers; (b) ten Saturday Sessions for field trips to museums, research
laboratories and universities; (c) after school science/mathemtics clubs which
meet on a weekly basis to facilitate networking; and (d) Prep Time for 8th grade
students which is preparing them to take the Secondary School Aptitude Test
(SSAT). This project integrates scientists into all activities and, thus,
provides for continual access to information and role models.
