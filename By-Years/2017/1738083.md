Non-technical:&lt;br/&gt;U.S. support for International Arctic Science Committee
(IASC) and Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) provides
opportunities for U.S. scientists to exchange ideas and develop research
partnerships with colleagues in other countries. For early career scientists
these organizations offer a forum to expand research interests and develop
professional connections. SCAR and IASC's policy advisory activities help ensure
that important policy decisions about managing and protecting these regions are
based on sound scientific assessment. International collaboration through SCAR
and IASC's interdisciplinary, international research activities allows the U.S.
to accomplish scientific objectives that would be impossible for single
investigators, programs, or countries to do alone and provides opportunities for
U.S. scientists that would not otherwise be
available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;The Polar Research Board
(PRB) of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences serves as the U.S. National
Committee to two international organizations: the International Arctic Science
Committee (IASC), and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR).
IASC encourages and facilitates cooperation in all aspects of Arctic research
and in all areas of the Arctic region, provides scientific input to the Arctic
Council and other international policy organizations, and provides seed money to
support international science development. SCAR helps lead the international
Antarctic science community by implementing new research initiatives,
identifying emerging scientific themes, promoting international cooperation and
partnerships, and providing scientific advice to the Parties to the Antarctic
Treaty and others on issues related to the management and protection of the
Antarctic region and the Southern Ocean. The U.S. dues requested leverage in-
kind contributions from countries around the world.
