This award is designated as a Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) award and
is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.
This project, managed by researchers from Pepperdine University, describes the
effort to create a knowledge network linking a series of small projects related
to the SAVI theme that involve collaboration between U.S. and Finnish
researchers. The collaborations include leading STEM educational researchers
from both countries and focus on technology-enhanced learning, educational
innovation, and learning analytics. On such projects, the pairing of researchers
from the U.S. with those from Finland, a nation whose students regularly rank at
the top in international measures of STEM learning, holds great promise as these
scientific communities with complementary strengths come together. The goal is
to spur innovative at the frontiers of our knowledge of STEM
learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER will aim to hasten discovery and
knowledge sharing and to facilitate the broader impact of the teams findings in
educational enterprises in both the United States and Finland. It is the glue,
or mechanism, for linking a set of disparate U.S.-Finnish research efforts,
allowing for greater communication among the projects and making connections
through common intellectual themes and practical innovations. The project will
attempt to do so through eight sets of activities, including an active web
presence, exchanges of early career and teacher researchers, a webinar for
researchers, educators, and policy makers, the development of research toolkits,
virtual and in-person SAVI research meetings, short courses, and contributions
to research literatures and conferences that reflect the cross-disciplinary
nature of the SAVI.
