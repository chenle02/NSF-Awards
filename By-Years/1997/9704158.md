This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to extend the Phase
I results to optimize a unique temperature gradient vacuum sublimation process
which will significantly reduce the cost of fullerene purification. Phase I
demonstrated that high purity C60 (99.8%) can be produced by the solvent-free
process. The Phase II program will optimize the purification process by
investigating a large number of processing variables such as fullerene mean-free
path, unconverted re-distributed fullerenes, temperature distribution, geometric
dimension, etc. Two different temperature gradient vacuum sublimation systems,
i.e., direct sublimation and sublimation through a porous bed, will be designed
and utilized in the investigations. It is anticipated that the Phase II program
will successfully develop a solvent-free purification process to produce pure
C60 at 2 to 10 % of the current cost. Fullerenes are materials that have been
demonstrated to have near-term applications in superconductors, nonlinear
optics, polymers, gas storage for fuel and batteries, diamond nucleation and
synthesis, low porosity pure carbon composites and fibers, and three-dimensional
organic synthesis.
