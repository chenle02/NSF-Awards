Abstract

The objective of this research program is to develop a broad conceptual
understanding of geometric analysis on manifolds which takes as its paradigm the
role of sharp inequalities in Fourier analysis on the manifold as encoding
geometric information about intrinsic invariants, symmetries and the underlying
geometric structure of the manifold. Our direct focus is to obtain new and
sharper results on isoperimetric inequalities, critical Sobolev embedding, log
Sobolev and Levy-Gromov functionals, and multilinear fractional integrals that
incorporate the framework of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality, Stein-
Weiss integrals, Birman-Schwinger kernels and Riesz potentials, especially in
the setting of Lie groups, symmetric spaces, complex manifolds and affine
geometry including hyperbolic space, SL(2,R) and the Heisenberg group. Sharp
embedding estimates are a critical tool to establish existence and regularity
for solutions to pde's, and to control oscillatory behavior on a manifold. This
program reflects a natural interplay and stimulus with problems in conformal
deformation, fluid dynamics, geometric probability, statistical mechanics,
string theory and turbulence. Computational methods are essential tools to
obtain a clearer understanding of the complexity of the geometric symmetry.

Mathematical models that characterize physical phenomena and the analysis of
differential equations that describe dynamical processes require a rich and
diverse analytic framework. Scientists say that "mathematical laws underpin the
fabric of our universe." The aim of this research program is to develop a
supporting mathematical structure that helps us to understand relations that
connect uncertainty, entropy and disorder, geometric symmetry, renormalization
and scaling arguments, non-homogeneity of space-time models, isoperimetric
comparison between surface area and volume, and the fine detail of hyperbolic
geometry. We want to obtain broad and rigorous understanding of mathematical
tools that support a quantitative description of the fundamental laws of nature,
and to develop and explore mathematical structures that model physical phenomena
ranging from fluid dynamics to string theory, especially by using patterns of
symmetry and intrinsic constants that encode geometric information about the
underlying theoretical framework.
