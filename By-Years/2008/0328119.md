The PIs will investigate the evolution over time of crustal deformation in the
Sea of Marmara by studying the North Anatolian fault system. The results will
have implications for understanding earthquake frequency and prediction in the
area and thus has high societal relevance. The PIs will collect a grid of high-
resolution MCS profiles from R/V Ewing within the eastern Marmara Sea, with half
the grid at 1-2 km spacing to decipher a detailed stratigraphy of the area. The
project will be carried out in collaboration with Turkish, Italian and Greek
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
