Theoretical studies will be conducted on the physics of two outstanding
problems relating to high temperature superconductors - the anomalous
superconducting fluctuations and the strong electron correlation problem. In
particular, detailed calculations will be done to improve our understanding of
the ground state of the superconducting oxides in a magnetic field. Further work
will be conducted on the mechanism driving the superconductivity and the nature
of the pairing, as well as the anomalous properties of the normal state.
