With this new award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
the work of Professors Mark Fink and Mark Sulkes of the Chemistry Department at
Tulane University. This research project will involve the use of molecular beams
to investigate short-lived organosilicon intermediates and related energetic
molecules. Intermediates to be studied include group 14 carbene analogs and
doubly and triply bonded main group species. The unique thrust of this research
arises from an interdisciplinary collaboration combining molecular beam
spectroscopy and synthetic/mechanistic organometallic chemistry. Comprehensive
use of these combined methods will provide significant new data on reactive main
group species and will complement methods customarily used to study these
intermediates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal involve
the training of undergraduates and graduate students in an interdisciplinary
project that crosses the boundaries between physical, inorganic, and organic
chemistry. The research will prepare students for important present day
interdisciplinary enterprises such as materials chemistry and environmental
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;
