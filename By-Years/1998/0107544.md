This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2001. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Exploring
phylogenetic trends of gene sequence, protein form and function to comprehend
processes of molecular evolution." The photosynthetic gene rbcL and a large
phylogeny are being used to link molecular selection linking gene sequence to
protein form and function. Evolutionary trends are being used to reveal patterns
of molecular selection that are otherwise invisible and are helping to generate
viable theories about gene-protein relationships. The research is focused on
developing generally applicable models of gene and protein evolution and
providing informatic tools to question processes of molecular selection in other
genes and systems.
