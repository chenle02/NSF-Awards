&lt;br/&gt; L-infinity variational problems are problems where one seeks to find
the maximum (or minimum) of a functional that is an expression involving the
pointwise behavior of a function and its gradient. The study of such problems
has become very active recently and this project will support the study of a
number of important open questions in the area. A particular interest is the
relationship between minimizers of the variational problems and solutions of the
corresponding Aronsson equation. Other questions include the uniqueness and
regularity of solutions of the Aronsson equations and the characterization of
the principal eigenvalue of the infinity-Laplacian operator. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt; These variational problems are not only interesting mathematically
but arise in a number of different areas of applications. These include the
determination of optimal radiation treatments in chemotherapy, in image analysis
and reconstruction and in determining winning strategies in certain types of
games. The results obtained under this research will help describe the
mathematical models of these applications. This is a collaborative award with Dr
Changyou Wang of the University of Kentucky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt
