Through the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee, the U.S. Geological
Survey has developed and is managing several Arctic data activities. The Arctic
Environmental Data Directory (AEDD) is an on-line searchable data base
containing descriptions and locations of major U.S. and selective international
data sets. It is being added to as new or additional data are located. The
Arctic Data Interactive (ADI) is a self contained CD-ROM (computer disk-read
only memory) which contains representative scientific arctic information, select
bibliographies, and the AEDD. The IARPC agencies agreed to collectively support
these activities over the next two years. This interagency transfer of funds
partially fulfills requirements of the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 to
promote the dissemination of arctic data and information.
