This proposal received funding to investigate a proxy that determines the degree
of calcite dissolution of bottom waters. The index is based on the # of damaged
G menardii which is tied to a biogeochmical model. The dissolution proxy is
coupled to t230TH-normalized calcite accumulation rates. The approach is
considered an improvement over previous attempts to quantify the calcium
carbonate/organic flux ratios in the oceans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
