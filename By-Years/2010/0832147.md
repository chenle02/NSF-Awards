The proposal requests partial support for students to participate in MobiCom
2008 in San Francisco, Sept 14-19, 2008. The NSF support will provide
opportunities for twenty young participants to interact with established
researchers. MobiCom 2008 introduces a high caliber forum for research on
systems issues in the emerging area of mobile, wireless communication and
computing. The research and development results reported in MobiCom conferences
span multiple disciplines, including wireless communication, vehicular
communications, personal area networks, ad hoc networks, operating systems,

The broader impact of the proposal is to provide providing graduate students
conducting research in the mobile computing field the opportunity to not only
attend high-caliber technical presentations and be exposed to the state-of-the-
art research in the field, but also to interact with peer graduate students
world-wide, to meet with senior leading researchers in the field, and to take
part in discussions that are likely to shape their future careers.
