With National Science Foundation support Dr. Peter Robertshaw will conduct an
archaeological survey of the Bunyoro-Kitara region of Western Uganda. While the
prehistory of the region is not well known, limited archaeological work has
demonstrated the presence of unexpectedly complex sites which include such
features as massive earthworks. Excavations indicate the development of a
"state" the roots of which can presently be traced back to the 13th century A.D.
Ethnohistoric accounts indicate that such a large scale society with strong
centralized authority existed until recent times. The process by which this
tropical African state developed however is not understood. Dr. Robertshaw's
exploratory research will lay the groundwork for a longer term large scale
project. His goal is to set the few known large sites into a broader regional
context. To do this he will survey approximately 30-40% of the region. Random
sampling methods will be employed to analyze ceramics at each site located so it
can be placed in a chronological framework. Through the examination of site
distributions in both time and space and through comparison of site sizes at a
series of limited points in time it should be possible to trace the process of
state development. This project is important for several reasons. Archaeologists
wish to understand the processes which underly the development of social
complexity and which lead to the emergence of large complex groups. While much
work has been done in non-tropical regions of the world, because of practical
constraints such as difficulty of access and dense vegetation relatively little
is known about how states developed in tropical regions. Dr. Robertshaws'
exploratory work should help remedy this defect. It will also set the groundwork
for larger scale work.
