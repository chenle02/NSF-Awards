This award supports the research of Professor D. Kleitman to work in
combinatorics. He intends to investigate various problems in enumeration,
geometric combinatorics graph theory and extremal set theory. The research is in
the general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient
methods to study how discrete collections of objects can be organized. And, so
it is extremely important to modern communications, for example the design of
large networks as in telephone systems and the design of algorithms in computer
science.
