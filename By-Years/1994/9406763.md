9406763 BICKERTON ABSTRACT The project seeks to determine the distribution and
nature of contact languages (in particular Hawaiian) within Hawaii and the
distribution of Hawaiian as a contact language throughout the Pacific basin. The
Hawaiian and Pacific Special Collections of Hamilton Library in the University
of Hawaii contain a vast collection of materials, both published and
unpublished, including microfilmed copies of most of the many journals and
newspapers, also in several languages, published in Hawaii since the mid-
nineteenth century: this unrivalled database has been barely touched by
researchers. The project will search and (where necessary) translate these
materials with the goal of compiling an annotated bibliography of all references
to language contact in this literature and all citations of utterances used in
contact situations. The citations will be analyzed linguistically to determine
to what extent modes of communication represent unstable jargon(s) and whether
any could be described as stable pidgins. Materials so far sampled indicate that
a radical version of the role of Hawaiian (and perhaps other indigenous contact
languages) in language contact will result from this research, challenging
received opinion which gives English the major role in Hawaii contacts and an
almost exclusive role in Pacific contacts. Valuable light will also be cast on
the nature of the input that gave rise to Hawaiian Creole English.
