9522661 Hsia This combined theoretical/experimental study involves the
modelling of brittle-to-ductile transition (BDT) in cleavage fracture. The
intrinsic mechanisms controlling the BDT will be studied by examining two
competing processes that occur at crack tips: cleavage crack propagation which
results in brittle fracture and dislocation generation which occurs during the
inherent plastic deformation that develops during ductile fracture. A novel
experimental technique will be employed which involved growing a cleavage crack
in a temperature gradient field and measuring the crack arrest due to
dislocation generation. Three pieces of information essential to the fundamental
understanding of this phenomena will be sought: the transition temperature, the
crack velocity when the transition occurs, and the dislocation structure at the
crack tip which accompanies the transition. ***
