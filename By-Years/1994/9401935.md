CTS-9401935 Purdue University Research Foundation Phillip C. Wankat ABSTRACT The
central focus of this research will be the development of displacement
chromatography for the separation of gases with pressure, vacuum or thermal
swings to regenerate the column. Operation modes will be tested that utilize the
least adsorbing species in a multicomponent mixture as the carrier gas and the
strongest adsorber as the displacement fluid. Several systems will be examined
including separation of light hydrocarbons and hydrogen as well as carbon
dioxide and methane with either hydrogen or nitrogen. Theoretical descriptions
of the process will include modification of local equilibrium models and
development of realistic rate models. Separation of gases is important for a
number of industries. Current methods can be difficult and expensive to perform
in practice. New processes like those to be studied in this project may help to
production costs.
