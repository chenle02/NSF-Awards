Modern methods of data acquisition and analysis are being provided to
undergraduate physiology laboratories. This equipment is not only enhancing
existing laboratory experiments, but is also increasing the number of
experiments performed while providing quantifiable data and access to software
commonly used in scientific analysis. Physiological transducers are attached to
a commercially available data acquisition system that is connected to a personal
computer. Each system enables two student groups to utilize one computer system.
Software simulations and mathematical models are also used to enhance
comprehension. The integration of computer-based acquisition equipment should
reduce the frustration level that many students experienced with the previous
equipment. The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
