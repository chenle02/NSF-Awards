This research centers on the application of state-of-the-art computer science
technologies and the development of advanced computer applications for
engineering problems, with an emphasis on the civil engineering domain. The work
is directed towards an exploration of how computer-based technologies can be
applied to engineering problems, and how the various facets of the engineering
process can benefit from such computer applications. The basic strategy is to
identify problem areas where computer aids will be beneficial along with
maturing computer technologies which can be applied to the problems, and to
investigate the resulting issues. Specific research includes finite element
systems, database management systems, and integrated computer-aided engineering
systems. The objective throughout is to explore how computer technologies can be
best utilized to create a friendly, responsive, and powerful computer-based
engineering environment.
