This project conducts enabling research on virtual prototyping tools for
collaborative design, construction, and startup of semiconductor manufacturing
facilities. This extends and integrates ongoing research within the Center for
Integrated Facilities Engineering and the Center for Integrated Systems at
Stanford. The focus is not on design of actual projects or processes, but on the
implementation and startup of the factory building and support systems of the
manufacturing enterprise. Research is being performed in collaboration with
Intel, which is providing specifications and is guiding testing of theory and
software. The resulting tools will radically shorten the time to bring new
semiconductor facilities on-line.
