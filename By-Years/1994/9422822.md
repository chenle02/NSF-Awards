This project examines the structure of 12 major industries in post-war Japan. It
will refine measures of rents (returns) and external economies (spillovers) that
are critical to the debates in the academic and development policy communities
over the appropriateness of government support for strategic industrial sectors.
In order for other countries to emulate the Japanese trade and industrial
policies, it is critical to determine what criteria are used to choose among
strategic investment options. Data for 1955 through 1990 will be collected from
the Japan Input-Output Tables maintained by the Administrative Management Agency
as well as from the Kogyo Tokei Chosa (Census of Manufacturing).
