This NYI award will fund research in the area of computer simulation of human
movement. The research will focus on methods to scale nominal models of the
lower limbs to arrive at accurate estimates of the moment arms of various sized
individuals. The predictions will be verified using cadaver measurements.
Similar scaling studies for children will be based on MRI measurements and also
verified through cadaver studies. These scaling studies are important since
movement simulations require accurate estimates of moment arms. The model also
will be used to simulate a number of surgeries including tendon transfers,
osteotomies, and joint replacements. The NYI award also will help the
investigator create a teaching laboratory that focuses on biodynamic
simulations. Three courses based on the simulation laboratory; namely,
Biomechanics of Movement, Biodynamics Simulation Laboratory, and Advanced
Biodynamics, will be developed.
