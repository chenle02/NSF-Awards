9626144 Kispert University of Alabama Tuscaloosa This award from the Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program (CRIF) and the Academic Research
and Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Alabama Tuscaloosa acquire a CCD X-RAY Diffractometer. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:
(1) structural investigation of organic donor-acceptor solids and high-spin
polyradical ions (2) characterization of unimolecular rectifiers and organic
conductors (3) study of polyradical ions and other extractant interactions with
metal ions (4) investigation of novel superacid catalysts, and (5) study of
mutinuclear chromium-carboxylate assemblies. The X-ray diffractometer is used to
make accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure
of a molecule. The information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond
distances and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information
about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring
molecules.
