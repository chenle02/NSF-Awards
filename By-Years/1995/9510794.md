Abstract for Molecular Evolution postdoctoral fellowships This action funds a
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Molecular Evolution for 1995. This program
of fellowships is a joint activity of the Directorate for Biological Sciences of
NSF and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation of New York City. The five-year program
is in its second year. Eighteen two-year fellowships are offered each year for
research and training in theoretical, comparative, computational, and /or
experimental analyses of biological patterns and processes at the molecular
level, within the framework of evolutionary change and adaptation of organisms,
or in the use of molecular data to address broad evolutionary questions. Fellows
are elcouraged to broaden their scientific experience and perspective in
molecular evolution by selecting a host laboratory where new conceptual
approaches and experimental techniques can be learned. The research and training
plan supported by this fellowship is entitled: The evolution of megapode (Aves:
Megapodiidae) incubation strategies and their effect on mating systems: a
molecular phylogenetic approach.
