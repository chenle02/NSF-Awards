Professor Perrin of the University of California San Diego will continue his
investigations on the effects of nonbonding electron pairs, on reactions, the
asymmetry of hydrogen bonds in solution and the effects of ion solvation on
stereoelectronic properties. Each of these has subtle but significant effects on
reaction rates and stereochemistry. While they are reported in the sense of
basic research, the implications are of wide significance in organic, physical,
theoretical and biochemistry. There are subtle electronic effects caused by
nonbonded electrons, hydrogen bonds and solvation of ions which have significant
consequences in life processes as well as chemical manipulations. Thus, the
results of this investigation have broad spectrum potential impacting
fundamental and life sciences.
