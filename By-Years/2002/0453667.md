Abstract for Collins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project covers WHOI's
participation in the Ocean Bottom Seismic Instrument Pool for four years. WHOI
currently operates two different types of ocean-bottom seismometers for the
Pool: 50 short-period instruments optimized for both active-source experiments
and passive microseismicity monitoring, and 25 broadband seismometers optimized
for teleseismic structural studies and earthquake-source
investigations.&lt;br/&gt;
