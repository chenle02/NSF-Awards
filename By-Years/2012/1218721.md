This award aims to increase our understanding about the power of quantum
computers. The goal is to determine which problems have efficient quantum
algorithms and which do not. One source of problems relates to the simulation of
quantum mechanical systems. Another direction is determining which cryptosystems
are secure against quantum computers. The most commonly used cryptosystems, such
as systems based on RSA and elliptic curves, can be broken by quantum computers
and an important question is to determine which systems to use instead. This
question involves both understanding which problems are hard for quantum
computers as well as how to design secure protocols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI
and his graduate students will consider three types of problems. The first comes
from Hamiltonian complexity, which addresses computing properties of physical
systems. Depending on the setup, these systems range from being solvable
classically to being very hard even for quantum computers. The second set of
problems comes from proposals for quantum-resistant cryptography using the
Learning With Errors problem. The PI will study the recent assumptions that have
been made to make these systems more efficient to see if they are secure against
quantum computers. The third set of questions involves determining when the
security arguments work for classical protocols in the presence of quantum
computers.
