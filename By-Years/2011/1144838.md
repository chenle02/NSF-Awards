In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Christopher Reed of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of California, Riverside will explore the extremes of cation
chemistry by utilizing the most stable, least basic, least coordinating anion -
the perfluorinated carborane anion. The conjugate acid of this anion may be the
world's strongest acid. It should be a strong enough acid to add H+ to some of
the most weakly basic molecules, ones that have not been protonated before (e.g.
Xe). The acid will also be explored as a novel catalyst for acid-catalyzed
reactions such the room temperature cracking of hydrocarbons and the
decomposition of halocarbons and freons. There are potential uses in the
remediation of halocarbon chemical waste, converting it into useful hydrocarbons
fuels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research include the
possibility that new knowledge about cations, acidity and inert anions will
impact commercially important areas such as petroleum reforming, polymerization
catalysis, battery technology and fuel cell technology. The grant is primarily a
vehicle for student training in research. UC Riverside has a high population of
students from traditionally under-represented groups (e.g. Hispanics) so this
project provides excellent opportunities for involving them in frontline
chemical research and attracting them to careers in science.
