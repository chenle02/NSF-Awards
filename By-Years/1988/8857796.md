Curtis McMullen will continue his research in dynamical systems theory and its
topological ramifications. Some of this work is related to Newton's algorithm
for finding roots of equations and to the solvability of polynomials of low
degree. McMullen will investigate a geometric picture of the Mordell conjecture
over function fields and its relation to holomorphic motions, horizontally
holomorphic foliations and the Kobayashi metric. In the realm of complex
dynamics he will study Julia sets and limit sets of Kleinian groups. He will
also continue his work in topology and solvability of equations.
