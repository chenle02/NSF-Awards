To remain competitive in a rapidly changing economic environment, more efficient
operation of production facilities in the United States via on-line control and
optimization is a key factor in improving profitability. It is widely recognized
that in many industrial plants there are a number of critical control loops
where conventional single loop control is inadequate and there are significant
economic incentives for advanced control. In the Phase I study, the feasibility
of on-line multivariable system identification of industrial processes using
canonical variate analysis (CVA) was demonstrated on data from computer
simulations and experimental processes at the University of California, Santa
Barbara (UCSB). The Phase II, the integration of on-line identification and
control design will be a major focus. The CVA method integrated with on-line
control design will be extensively demonstrated on several types of processes,
and compared with existing methods. Furthermore, a detailed development of an
extension of the approach to time varying systems will be provided. The
performance of the system identification and control design methods will be
experimentally evaluated on a pilot- or full- scale industrial process.
