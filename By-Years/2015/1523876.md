This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015. The fellowship supports a research and
training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to
broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan
for this fellowship to Nathaniel Butler is "Enhancing genetic map resolution in
diploid potato using sequence-specific nucleases." The host institution for the
fellowship is the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the sponsoring scientist
is Dr. Shelley Janskey.

Genetic improvement of crops is a vital aspect of agriculture that continues to
challenge geneticists and breeders. Over centuries, crops have been domesticated
to increase yield, but fully understanding the genetic basis for improving
productivity remains an important area of research. A major constraint for
finding new traits is that many plant genomes are inherently limited by low
rates of recombination, or exchange of DNA, during the fundamental process of
sexual reproduction called meiosis. During meiosis, DNA from the male and female
mix, break and then recombine in offspring, thus producing the basis for all the
variation of life. This project will enhance the ability of plant DNA to
recombine more frequently. Rates of recombination will be increased by
engineering into potato the enzymes and components necessary for recombination.
In turn, mapping of traits will be improved and new variation can be introduced
into potato with the potential to greatly enhanced breeding capabilities of crop
plants. Through seminars and local activities, high school and undergraduate
students will participate in the project and will be trained in the new cutting
edge methods of molecular genetics and genome editing.

This project addresses the problem of limited genetic map resolution in bi-
parental populations through three objectives. The first objective is to
genetically engineer events of diploid potato to express sequence-specific
nucleases, TALENs and CRISPR/Cas and a natural nuclease, SPO11 using
Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The second is to evaluate TALEN and SPO11
events using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and in bi-parental
populations using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). The third is to map the male
fertility (Mf) locus and fine map the pigmented flesh (Pf) locus using
CRISPR/Cas events. The results will shed light on the limitations of
recombination in a crop species and provide a strategy for improving genetic map
resolution. Student involvement will contribute to training the next generation
of scientists to learn interdisciplinary approaches in molecular tools.
