The program for undergraduate laboratory research experience at Cornell
University is based on the fact that Cornell's School of Civil and Environmental
Engineering has a strong experimental research program using modern lab
facilities in all principal subareas of civil and environmental engineering. The
program is designed to generate hands- on-lab research experiments performed
with faculty in the following laboratories, based on the students' interests,
backgrounds, and talents: Concrete and Construction Materials, Environmental
Engineering, Geotechnical, Hydraulics, Remote Sensing, and Structural
Engineering. The program is building on a successful REU program in civil and
environmental engineering held at Cornell the past two summers. Each laboratory
program has a faculty member as co-principal investigator in charge. A carefully
thought-out evaluation, feedback and interaction mechanism has been designed to
assure that the undergraduate lab research experience is an enticement for
talented students to think seriously about advanced studies in engineering.
Cornell's minority recruitment, and advising and counseling program assures that
the interested minority students can be identified and recruited.
