Little research has been conducted on the potential impacts of fire following
major earthquakes in the United States and on ways to mitigate such secondary
impacts of earthquakes. This represents a serious gap in our mitigation and
preparedness activities in the United States. In another investigation, the
research team began developing a model on the technical aspects of post-
earthquake fire initiation and spreading using San Francisco as a case area.
This project will extend the research to other jurisdictions, focus on selected
high risk categories such as high-rise buildings or hazardous industrial
installations, consider system aspects of firefighting response, and expand and
implement the model on fire initiation and spreading.
