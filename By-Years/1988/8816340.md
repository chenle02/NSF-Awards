Dr. Austin is studying the sequence dependence of the elastic properties of DNA
and its implications for specificity in protein-DNA interactions. The goals are
ambitious and involve the complete integration of physical and biological
methodology. Until recently crystallographic data were only available for
isolated protein or DNA molecules, that is, not docked together in a biological
complex. As a result, models for site specific protein binding have often had a
"lock and key" quality. They attempt to understand recognition in terms of a
simple interaction between rigid and non--allosteric partners. This project will
attempt to show that the bending and torsional strain stored in DNA upon
complexation is of equal importance in binding specificity.
