The primary objective of this international conference entitled "Primate
Origins" is to assemble a series of experts who are currently performing novel
research concerning the unique adaptive characteristics of the Order Primates
(the taxonomic group to which humans, apes, monkeys, and prosimians belong).
Primates are distinguished from other mammals by several traits of the skull and
limbs, most notably the opposable big toe, nails instead of claws on the digits,
larger brains, reduction of the organs responsible for the sense of smell, and
larger more convergent eyes which are protected by additional bone around the
sockets. This conference will provide a long-overdue comprehensive reassessment
of the adaptations of the first primates utilizing the expertise of both
paleontologists and those who study living primates. We will provide the first
comprehensive analysis of the adaptive significance of pronounced morphological
and behavioral transformations during this important and interesting stage of
primate evolution which will also facilitate a fuller understanding of
groundwork for the transformations that took place during the later evolution of
higher primate.&lt;br/&gt;
