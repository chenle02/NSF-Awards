This project continues coordination of the NSF program on the Repair and
Rehabilitation Research (R/R) for Seismic Resistance of Structures. Coordination
of the program will: 1) Establish a forum in which the PIs and other interested
individuals or groups can provide input so that a comprehensive technical
document is developed for R/R design requirements and details acceptable for
engineering practice. 2) Facilitate exchange of information between U.S. and
foreign researchers and designers so that all parties involved keep abreast of
the state-of-the-art. 3) Encourage rapid transfer of technology from research to
practice.
