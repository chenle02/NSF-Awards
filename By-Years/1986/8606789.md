This is an engineering research equipment grant for an advanced graphics
workstation to provide computational and display capability for research in
engineering at Iowa State University. The equipment will be used for the
calculation of thermodynamic physical properties data bases from established
state equations and for the display of these data in the form of wireframe and
continuous-tone surfaces. Such drawings will show both the structures of a
particular fluid's phase behavior as well as the consequences of process designs
based upon it. Through its powerful graphics features, the workstation will
resolve quite complicated solution effects while simulating in real time the
physical and chemical factors influencing those equilibria.
