Extensive remagnetization of rocks in orogenic zones is a widespread
phenomenon, which complicates the use of this technique in determining rotation
and translation of the rock bodies involved. Causes of such remagnetization are
not well understood. Late Paleozoic remagnetizations are common in the
Appalachians and have been recognized in redbeds and Limestones ranging in age
from the Cambrian to the carboniferous. Analysis of current data indicate the
remagnetization occurred over approximately 60 m.y. and began earlier in the
southern Appalachians. This project will collect additional redbed and limestone
paleomagnetic samples with the purpose of developing an adequate spatial and
temporal data base on remagnetization in the Appalachians and to explore several
hypotheses for the underlying causes of such remagnetizations in tectonic
mountain belts.
