T.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Lattice
Points, the Gauss Circle Problem, and&lt;br/&gt;the Riemann Zeta-
Function&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator studies the properties of lattice
points close to smooth&lt;br/&gt;curves and surfaces and applications of these
properties to classical&lt;br/&gt;number theory problems. One objective is to
improve on the Iwaniec-Bombieri&lt;br/&gt;method and to obtain new results in
the Gauss circle problem and on the&lt;br/&gt;order of the Riemann zeta-function
on the critical line. Another aim is to&lt;br/&gt;improve on the Fouvry-Iwaniec
method for estimating exponential sums with&lt;br/&gt;monomials and to obtain
new applications on the distribution of almost-prime&lt;br/&gt;numbers in short
intervals and B-free numbers in short intervals.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator and
his colleagues are also using Pade approximation&lt;br/&gt;polynomials to obtain
new bounds on the fractional parts of rational numbers&lt;br/&gt;and
applications to diophantine equations and on the irreducibility
of&lt;br/&gt;polynomials. Another line of research is on the convergence of
Minmod-type&lt;br/&gt;numerical methods for hyperbolic differential
equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gauss circle problem and the
problem of the order of the Riemann&lt;br/&gt;zeta-function on the critical line
are two of the most famed problems&lt;br/&gt;in number theory. The Riemann zeta-
function is closely related to the&lt;br/&gt;distribution of prime numbers.
Knowledge about prime numbers plays a&lt;br/&gt;crucial role in the areas of
cryptography and data encryption which are&lt;br/&gt;important both for national
security and e-commerce. Hyperbolic differential&lt;br/&gt;equations find
applications in problems involving flow (some examples are&lt;br/&gt;gases
around aircraft, wake of aircraft, underground contamination,&lt;br/&gt;weather
patterns). In most cases it is impossible to solve&lt;br/&gt;exactly the
relevant differential equation, so numerical schemes for
an&lt;br/&gt;approximate solution are applied. The investigator and his
colleagues&lt;br/&gt;have achieved progress and are working toward completely
solving an&lt;br/&gt;important open problem in the mathematical theory of
numerical methods for&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic differential
equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
