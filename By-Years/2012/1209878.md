This action funds Keiko M. Tuttle of Washington State University, Pullman, WA to
conduct a research project, entitled "Investigating the control of wheat seed
dormancy and germination by plant hormones," during the summer of 2012 at RIKEN
Plant Science Center in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture. The host scientist is Dr.
Mitsunori Seo.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to advance knowledge about the
hormonal control of wheat seed dormancy and germination by measuring hormones
Abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA), and jasmonic acid (JA) levels in seeds
that are either dormant or subjected to dormancy-breaking treatments. It is
essential to advance knowledge about the hormonal control of seed dormancy
directly in wheat where problems with preharvest sprouting of seed on the mother
plant due to insufficient dormancy under cold or moist conditions cause economic
losses for farmers. Identification and localization of the hormone signal for
dormancy release could transform current knowledge leading to new breeding
strategies for preharvest sprouting tolerance.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of Japan; and an orientation to the
society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for
international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers,
and educators, thus ensuring a globally awareness of the U.S. scientific
workforce.
