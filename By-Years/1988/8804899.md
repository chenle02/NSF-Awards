University of Oklahoma is being supported to establish a Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research chemists.
For the summer of 1988, the program will support 8 students recruited from
Oklahoma and other institutions. Research activities will include studies in the
following areas: o Micellar solutions in separation and purification processes o
Fast ion conductors o Partially ordered liquid crystals o Analysis and synthesis
of highway materials o Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons o Structure and function
of multicomponent mixtures o Enzymatic mechanism of Vibrio fischeri nitrite
reductase o Reaction of coordination compounds in the gas phase o Hydroboration
reactions exposed to the atmosphere o Matallocene-based liquid crystals o
Mechanism of allosteric influences on enzyme activity
