There is a growing demand for inexpensive, sensitive and reliable humidity
sensors with microprocessor-controlled electronics. Next to temperature,
humidity is the most important variable in environmental measurement and control
applications. In terms of detrimental effects on the life and performance of
electronic equipment and quality control in manufacturing, humidity is often the
more important parameter. Humidity sensors have broad industrial and domestic
applications for increasing the reliability and effective use of electronic
equipment, as well as decreasing energy consumption. Most commercially available
relative humidity sensors use hydrophilic hydrocarbon-based polymer films as
humidity-sensing elements. However, they are not sufficiently resistive to water
or to elevated temperatures and cannot be used at high humidities for extended
periods of time. In this project, the simple processing steps associated with an
organic polymer will be taken advantage of in fabricating a highly sensitive,
stable and durable humidity sensor. Shortcomings encountered with hydrocarbon-
based polymers will be overcome by using highly stable proton-conducting
fluorocarbon polymer materials. These materials have an established performance
record in electrochemical system, e.g., fuel cells and chlor-alkali
electrolyzers, under highly oxidizing and aggressive environments. The physical
and chemical properties associated with proton-conducting fluorocarbon polymers
make them very attractive as the sensing elements in humidity sensors.
