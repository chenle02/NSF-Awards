With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, Purdue University
acquires an atomic force microscope (AFM). Scanning probe instrumentation, such
as a force microscope, has become central in characterizing materials at
submicron scales for applications ranging from photolithographic patterning to
studies of biological structure. In the past decade, substantial advances in
atomic force microscopy have led to the ability to characterize materials in
some cases down to the atomic scale, opening new doors in the understanding of
how material structure impacts properties. In addition to its impact on
research, the instrument advances the training of students at all levels in this
modern technique preparing them for careers in the modern workplace.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is aimed at enhancing research especially in
areas such as: (a) robust amphiphilic interfaces for energetic materials and
biological structure; (b) self-assembled DNA nanomaterials for scalable
nanomanufacturing; (c) functionalized collagen peptide supramolecular
assemblies; (d) bioresponsive nanocarriers based on pseudorotaxanes; (e) block
copolymers for organic photovoltaics; (f) energy transfer and charge carrier
dynamics in solar energy conversion systems; and (g)conjugated materials and
polymer composites for flexible printed electronics.
