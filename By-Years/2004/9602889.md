9602889 Prothero Under this award, Professor John Prothero of the Department of
Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle, will spend three months
in Australia to amass a database on organ and energetic scaling in marsupials as
a function of body size. He will be centered at the laboratory of Professor T.J.
Dawson of the School of Biological Sciences, University of New South Wales, but
will make extensive contacts with colleagues throughout Australia. The database
will be used to test the hypothesis that metabolically expensive organs (chiefly
brain, heart, kidney, lung, skeletal muscle) in marsupials scale with body
weight the same way they do in eutherians, as determined by regression analysis.
Such data will contribute to an understanding of the degree to which the same
structural rules apply to all mammals. ***
