The project will develop techniques for monitoring systems to check if their
executions satisfy a property specified by an automaton or a temporal logic
specification. Systems to be monitored are modeled as a stochastic system. The
project proposes accuracy measures that denote how accurately the desired
property is monitored. The research will implement the accuracy measures as
monitors for such systems. The research will also develop active monitors that
interact with the underlying system to ensure the correctness properties, as
well as techniques for detection of failures from a system?s external behavior
and static verification techniques based on model checking employing symmetry
based reduction. The work will lead to mathematically rigorous and powerful
techniques that will improve the reliability of increasingly complex systems.
