Methods developed by using higher order Taylor polynomial, as well as those
obtained by taking a generalized predictor-corrector approach, will be studied
for solving linear programs. Efficient methods for solving structured linear
programs will be developed. Methods for finding vertex solution within the
framework of interior point methods will be investigated. Approaches will be
pursued to extend the research to parallel methods and to convex problems.
