The upper level chemistry laboratories are being improved by the incorporation
of Fourier-transform infrared methods. The chemistry courses which are using the
new FT-IR are Molecular Spectroscopy, Physical, Advanced Inorganic, Instrumental
Methods of Chemical Analysis and Biochemistry. In addition, two chemically-
oriented courses in geology (Mineralogy and Petrology are using the FT-IR.
Compared to the dispersive IR instruments used previously, the FT-IR provides
better resolution, higher sensitivity and superior performance in the far IR
region. While it is difficult to use dispersive IR for the analysis of impure
liquids and solids, the FT-IR (and its diffuse reflectance and multiple internal
reflection accessories) are permitting students to gain hands-on experience with
more modern analytical techniques, including mixture analysis and solution
chemistry. Furthermore, students are becoming acquainted with the mathematical
manipulations and computer methods involved in Fourier-transform techniques. As
a result of this project, students are better prepared for graduate school and
careers in industrial laboratories. The grantee is matching the award from non-
Federal sources.
