The research addresses control design for mechanical systems. Specifically, the
intent is the development of a highly transparent practical design methodology
for the synthesis of robust controllers for mechanical systems, systems often
characterized by nonlinear differential equations and such phenomena as
friction, saturation, dead zones, backlash and hysteresis. The methodology to be
developed parallels Quantitative Feedback Theory and is based on frequency
domain design tools. Unlike recent new theories of robust control which have
emphasized mathematical elegance at the expense of practical design tools, the
proposed work has an engineering style and is aimed at developing a realistic,
easy to use design tool. The research entails both theoretical and experimental
work and will include a number of simulation case studies.***//
