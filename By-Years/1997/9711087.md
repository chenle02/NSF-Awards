9711087 Gauri This proposal is to develop new durability factors, DF, based on
pore-size distribution., for calcareous porous rocks, limestones and dolomites.
Existing criteria for rock soundness are based upon the damage caused by the
crystallization of salt and freezing of water in the pores; however, these
criteria have often failed to predict accurately the actual service life.
Wetting, freezing, salt crystallization, and expansion of clays are the major
sources of disruptive pressure that develop in the pores of the stone. The
increase in pressure in the pores given by dp -- 2-y ((dA) (dA)R)l where y is
the surface tension and A dV dV and V are the area and volume of small (r) and
large (R) pores, suggests that the pore size distribution should be a
fundamental factor in the durability of stone. Using mercury porosimetry to
determine pore-size distributions and by training the computational method of
Artificial Neural Network (ANN ), the PI has developed durability factors (DF)
for the differentially weathered strata of the Sphinx. These predicted values
correlate well with the present condition of the strata after their exposure to
weathering for nearly 5000 years. The proposed research plan will include older
rocks, such as the Mesozoic limestones of Texas and the Paleozoic limestones
found in Mid-America older rocks, where the porosity has been altered by a
variety of complex processes concerned with the recrystallization of calcite.
Also included will be even younger limestone from Florida of Cenozoic and
Quaternary age. Dolomite will be studied as representative carbonate rocks where
porosity has been completely altered. By extensive field study the PI plans to
develop a column or columns of weathered limestone, irrespective of age, in
which the strata are ordered according to their durability and assigned DF from
one to ten. Pore-size distributions will be determined for the unweathered
samples of these rocks obtained from the deeper in terior or from nearby recent
roadcuts and quarries. These distributions will be made the dependent variables
while the DF will be the independent variables in the training of ANN. This
proposal then aims at developing model equation(s) to predict DF for many types
of porosity distributions found in limestone and dolomite. ***
