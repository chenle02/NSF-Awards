9413372 Johnston, David This Academic Research Infrastructure (Instrumentation)
award is made to provide partial support for the acquisition of a Constructed
Infrastructure Testing System. Research using the new system will emphasize the
integrated aspects of constructed Civil Infrastructure Systems in the areas of
structures, pavements, geotechnical and construction. Coupling and environmental
issues in large test specimens can be better studied with such a test as
compared to small specimens in individual tests. ***
