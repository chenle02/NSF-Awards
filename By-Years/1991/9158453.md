This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award. Dr. Judy Callis' research
concerns the reaction pathways and function of the post- translational
modification of proteins by the addition of ubiquitin in plants. Her post-
doctoral research laid the groundwork for this area of plant biochemistry. As a
faculty member in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the
University of California, Davis, she is continuing to pursue this important
problem in Arabidopsis, an excellent higher plant system for the molecular
genetic and biochemical approaches she has been exploiting so successfully.
Since joining the faculty at Davis in 1989 she has been active in training
graduate and undergraduate students. ***//
