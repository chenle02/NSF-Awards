Abstract

Understanding the dynamical behavior of virus particles, e.g., the self
assembly and subsequent maturation steps that lead to an infectious virus
particle, is a key challenge in basic biology (e.g., the understanding of
protein-nucleic acid interactions) and in medicine (e.g., the development of
drugs that interfere with viral replication). This research contributes to that
goal by developing new computational tools for structural biology, emphasizing
experimental approaches appropriate for the study of dynamics and emphasizing
the bi-directional interplay of new structural biology problems and new
formulations of existing structural biology problems with the development of new
computational tools.

Models and computation for new types of experiments are under development, e.g.,
x-ray scattering from solutions of labeled viral particles which are oriented by
immersion in a strong electric field thereby transforming solution scattering to
something analogous to the more informative fiber diffraction. New computational
approaches to standard problems are also under development, e.g., phase
retrieval for the x-ray crystallography of particles with non-crystallographic
symmetries based on iterative phase retrieval algorithms applied to lattices
that are computationally oversampled by interpolators based on the symmetry.
Computational areas involved include fast 3-D Radon transform algorithms, a
component of computing the cryo electron micrograph predicted from a given virus
structure, and global optimization, in order to improve the values of the
parameters that describe the virus structure.

The PIs have a long term interest in undergraduate involvement in research and
financial support for undergraduate research assistants is included.
