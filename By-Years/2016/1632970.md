This award is to assist approximately 25 US-based graduate students to attend
the Thirteenth Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI
2016) in Santa Clara, CA, on March 16-18, 2016. The conference focuses on the
design principles of large-scale networks and distributed systems and the common
challenges across diverse systems. This conference brings together researchers
from across the networking and systems communities including computer
networking, distributed systems, and operating systems to foster cross-
disciplinary approaches and to address shared research challenges.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this trip is to provide students with the
opportunity to interact with more senior researchers in the field, and exposes
students to leading edge work in the field. The support requested in this
proposal will enable the participation of students who would otherwise be unable
to attend NSDI.
