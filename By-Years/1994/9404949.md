9404949 Tarn The objective of this project is the design and experimental study
of a dual-robot assembly workcell based on the event-based planning and control
method developed at Washington University. The workcell will be able to perform
various coordinated/cooperated assembly tasks and capable of automatic response
to some unexpected events such as the occurrence of obstacles or the
misplacement of parts. Several problems related to fundamental computer and
robotic engineering need to be solved to achieve the above stated goal. The
focus of the work will be on the following specific problems: (1) Integration of
sensed event with the action planning and control of robotic manufacturing
system, and (2) Develop a computing and control architecture and computational
algorithm to experimentally implement the event-based action planning and
control method for dual-robot assembly workcell. The proposed research project
is aimed (1) to elevate dual-robot assembly workcell to a new level of task
performance capabilities and (2) to reduce the down-time of robotic workstations
in various application environments. ***
