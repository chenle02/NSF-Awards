The objective of this multidisciplinary project is to develop software that
provides the mechanisms and methods that enable and encourage scientists to
exchange data, ideas, and results across geographically distributed research
sites. The motivation is twofold: the need for better methods of processing and
visualizing data in environmental research; and the need for collaboration
across and within disciplines. The work, which will extend the Khoros 1.0
software, will provide a working environment that will motivate scientists from
different locations to interact over a computer network. When combined with the
data base and management capabilities now in place at many research sites (e.g.
Long Term Ecological Research sites) the proposed technology can lead to
network-wide data analysis, interpretation, and even manuscript preparation in
ways not currently possible. Standard audio communication will augment the
computer interaction to provide an environment similar to a workshop conference.
Scientists in different geographical location will be able to use their
workstations to cooperatively examine, interpret, and change each others data,
figure, text, or visual program in real time as if sitting around a table in the
same room. This technology will lead to a level of network interaction that is
unprecedented in environmental science. In addition, the combined research teams
in Biology and Computer Engineering will train scientists to use the
collaboration software. Feedback from the training process will identify new
ways to apply the technology and improvements in the existing applications.
