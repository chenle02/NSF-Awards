This project proposes to combine new and existing methods in computer vision to
partially automate the tedious procedure of reconstructing ceramics from
unearthed fragments. This will involve development of new computer vision
research technologies that can assist this reconstruction process, thus enabling
enhanced analysis, interpretation, and presentation of history evidence. The
focus of the project are ceramic and other artifacts from one of the best
preserved and most diverse American urban colonial archaeological sites ever
excavated - the Mall at Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania. The project proposes to develop 3D models based on surface
properties of thousands of fragments found and approach this vast collection
with novel theoretical and computational vision research technology. A strong
collaborative methodology will be developed between the information
technologists and practitioners in the domain. The project is actively support
and endorsed by U.S. Department of the Interior National Park Service. A long
term goal is to have a positive and profound impact on the study of historical
archaeology and laboratory practice of artifact analysis.
