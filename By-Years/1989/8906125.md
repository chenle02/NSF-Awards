The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Professor Breckenridge in a
continuing investigation of the details of energy transfer and chemical reaction
involving excited metal atoms and dimers. This work will help contribute to an
enhanced general understanding of fundamental processes in collision dynamics.
Metal atoms and dimers are being generated using a pulsed laser vaporization
source. A second laser produces the excited metal and a third laser is used to
probe the products of reaction or inelastic energy transfer after collisional
interaction with a target atom or molecule. In addition, Breckenridge is
investigating energy transfer and reaction between excited atoms and molecules
initially bound in a van der Waals complex. The complexes are first formed in a
supersonic expansion following the laser vaporization, the metal atom is
selectively excited within the complex, and the resultant products are detected
as in the collisional process. This "half-collision" experiment can often be
used to provide unique selectivity on the initial molecular geometries, orbital
alignments, and angular momenta of interacting systems.
