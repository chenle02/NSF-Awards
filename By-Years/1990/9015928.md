This grant supports Dr. Gombosi's efforts at modeling the environments of
comets. The main thrust of the work will be the further development of a time-
dependent, multidimensional dusty model of the inner coma. In addition, new
models of the nucleus- coma interface, the radiative transfer processes, as well
as the plasma environment of the comet will be developed. The historic
encounters with comets Halley and Giacobini-Zinner have begun to lead to a
better understanding of the major physical and chemical processes controlling
cometary environments. The quantitative and qualitative leap of available
information paved the road to a new generation of comprehensive comet models,
which will synthesize our knowledge in such diverse areas as nucleus formation,
orbital evolution, gas and dust emission, dynamics and aeronomy of partially
ionized dusty gas flows, and solar wind interaction. A new generation of
cometary models will evolve from a series of intitiatives by various groups and
individuals simultaneously cooperating and competing. Dr. Gombosi will be an
active participant in this effort.
