The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was designed to
increase the participation of minorities in scientific and engineering research.
The program provides support to strengthen the research environments and
capabilities of institutions that have substantial minority student enrollments.
Eligible institutions must also have graduate programs in science or programs in
engineering. Howard University will use RIMI support to acquire a Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer for use in the synthetic areas of the
Department of Chemistry. Research studies will be done on organic synthesis,
inorganic complexes, and the photochemistry of small molecules and radicals.
This work will lead to the development of new reactions and reaction sequences
that will contribute to our knowledge of synthesizing organic materials through
novel procedures. Organic synthesis research will help strengthen the research
infrastructure of a productive urban institution that educates minority students
at the cutting edge of science. The principal investigator has performed funded
research on synthesizing organosilicon compounds and is well qualified to direct
this study. This project will encourage more minority students to choose
research careers in chemistry.
