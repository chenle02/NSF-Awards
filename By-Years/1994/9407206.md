IBN-9407206 Edmund Fantino This is a study of choice behavior and conditioned
reinforcement. Dr. Fantino has developed a very well-known theory, called the
Delay Reduction Theory, that will be refined and tested in several experiments.
According to the theory, the effectiveness of a particular stimulus as a
conditioned reinforcer may be predicted most accurately by calculating the
reduction in the duration of time between the onset of the preceding stimulus
and the primary reinforcement. This theory has wide application in several
important areas, including foraging behavior, memory and self- control. The
experiments to be done will refine the theory and extend it to new areas. For
example, Dr. Fantino will investigate whether the theory can be extended to
situations where the reward is uncertain or risky. The results of these
experiments are relevant to several issues in learning and motivation.
