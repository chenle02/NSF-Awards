Defining the mechanism that regulates the insertion of the voltage-dependent
potassium channel 1.1 into the surface membrane of neuronal dendrites The number
of voltage-dependent potassium channel subunit 1.1 on the cell membrane tightly
regulates a neuron's resting state and determines how a neuron responds to its
environment accordingly. In the dendrites of neurons, voltage-dependent
potassium channels that contain the 1.1 subunit influence changes in synapses
that are considered to reflect the different types of learning or formation of
memories. This research aims to identify the molecular mechanism governing the
insertion of the voltage-dependent potassium channel subunit 1.1 into the
surface membrane of dendrites. The proposed study will examine how the voltage-
dependent potassium channel subunit 1.2 promotes the surface expression of
subunit 1.1. Furthermore, this research will investigate the mechanism by which
the suppression of the mammalian target of rapamycin, a protein that positively
regulates translation, leads to the protein synthesis of the voltage-dependent
potassium channel subunit 1.2. The discoveries from this study will expand the
current understanding on the mechanisms that influence learning and memory at
the molecular level. Furthermore, findings from this investigation will provide
a holistic characterization on how the protein-the mammalian target of
rapamycin-regulates the production of other proteins. Data generated from this
project will be used to gain a faculty position and establish a laboratory at a
university that will further elucidate the molecular events that regulate
learning and memory, and support the education and research training of
underrepresented populations in science.
