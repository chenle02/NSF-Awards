A Scalable On-Line Associative Deep Store

The deep store architecture solves the problems of being able to store data on
inexpensive magnetic hard disk at high rates of compression by storing similar
data based on content and compressing files using differential compression. Deep
store file retrieval performance obviates the need for traditional archival
storage media such as magnetic tape. The deep store computes data fingerprints,
and then summaries, from files. Files are organized into data clusters by using
a content-based file similarity metric; file content, which is immutable, is
addressed by content and stored using hashing.

The research comprises development of a scalable system architecture,
development of new algorithms, integrating existing technologies, and
identifying and addressing new problems: searching for similar files in a very
large corpus to improve compression, maximizing storage throughput, distributing
a large system for throughput and reliability, and managing file similarity data
for billions of files.

Improved archival data storage density and retrieval performance (latency and
data throughput) will impact all computing environments including scientific
experimentation and simulation, commercial and government document management,
and expand knowledge of information retrieval by content.
