Photoionization cross sections and photoelectron angular distributions will be
calculated for excited states of atoms and ions, utilizing Hartree-Slater wave
functions. A broad range of energies, atomic states, nuclear charges and
ionization stages will be studied. The objective is to understand the
systematics of the cross sections and distributions. Hartree-Fock level
calculations will be done as warranted. It is also proposed to formulate a new
methodology for highly excited states based on the quantum defect theory.
