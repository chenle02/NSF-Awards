Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the contours of the global economic
system and what are its mechanisms of change? This project examines
systematically and empirically one measure of globalization-the structure and
configuration of world trade networks during the twentieth century. A
preliminary analysis of global trade networks at four time points--in 1928,
1938, 1960 and 1990--suggests that, in the twentieth century, there were two
phases of a long cycle of the global economy: a "globalization" phase and a
"polarization" phase. This proposed research will extend these preliminary
findings to investigate all of the years from 1920 to the present in order to
map the contractions, expansions, structure of global trade networks, and the
overall shape of the global system. This research has the potential to
contribute to a general understanding of the nature of global cycles and the
characteristics and nature of global economic change. This research will involve
undergraduates as research assistants and contribute to the development of a
research infrastructure at California State University, Los Angeles.&lt;br/&gt;
