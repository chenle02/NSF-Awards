With the advent of high-quality digital seismograms from the Global Digital
Seismic Network, and with our increasing analytic and computational ability to
invert such data for earthquake source characteristics, it is becoming possible
to probe more finely the asperity size distribution during rupture of an
earthquake. In order to gain a better understanding of the effect of tectonic
setting on rupture process, we propose to investigate source characteristics of
large earthquakes at periods of 1 to 30 seconds. We wish to compare source
spectra, source time functions, and spatial distribution of moment release for
shallow subduction earthquakes from several different zones, outer-rise
earthquakes that occur within oceanic lithosphere seaward of subduction zones,
and intermediate and deep earthquakes.
