Geometric Programming is an established technique for solving certain classes
of algebraic, nonlinear optimization problems. It has been applied to problems
in a variety of areas, and has been especially useful in engineering design. In
this project, an alternative approach to geometric programming will be analyzed
which replaces the nonlinear primal-dual pair with a linear equivalent.
Specifically, the project will (1) develop, code, test, and implement and
algorithm based on the reformulation,(2) adapt sensitivity analysis procedures
from linear optimization to geometric programming, (3) adapt linear programming
decomposition principles to large geometric programming problems where the
constraint sets can be partitioned based on the design variables that appear in
them, (4) characterize multiple optima in geometric problems which possess the
same, and (5) explore the approximation of certain classes of general nonlinear
programs by geometric programming.
