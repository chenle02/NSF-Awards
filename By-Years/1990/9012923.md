This dissertation research award will support a cultural anthropologist
studying the reaction of working-class townspeople in Palermo, Sicily to
immigrant laborers from the third world. The racial stereotyping by Sicilians of
"people of color" will be compared with their own understanding of bias directed
against Sicilian immigrants to Northern Italy and elsewhere. The methods include
participant observation in a working class neighborhood, interviews with union
officials and a sample of workers, as well as a structured questionnaire
distributed to neighborhood residents. This research is important because
migrant laborers are common in many societies in the world. Increased
understanding of the causes of anti-migrant bias, especially as expressed in
racial terms, will help policy makers deal with these problems.
