This three-year grant will support the research group of two faculty who are
investigating the nucleon-nucleon interaction using polarized proton beams and
an internal polarized hydrogen target at the Indiana University Cyclotron
Facility Cooler storage ring. The experiment would illuminate the role of heavy
meson exchange in the short range nucleon-nucleon interaction by measuring the
spin correlations in neutral pion production near threshold in p+p reactions.
Another experiment will measure spin correlations for the p+d breakup reaction
in the medium energy regime, which would elucidate the role of three-body
forces. Polarized target development would continue; this work may lead to
significant improvements in the luminosity of polarized gas targets used in
storage rings. The nature of the weak interaction in nuclei will be studied with
a measurement of the spatial asymmetry in the decay of laser trapped, polarized
38K. This experiment is sensitive to the existence of heavy right-handed gauge
bosons, and also to more exotic particles such as leptoquarks. The Madison group
provides an important role in the education and training of graduate students
and post-doctoral fellows.
