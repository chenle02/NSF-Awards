This four-year project promotes teacher "learning in practice" to bring out and
build on the cognitive strengths of their students for science learning in the
classroom. Using culturally sensitive approaches and understanding the broader
contexts of their students lives will enable teachers to make classroom science
teaching more effective and more relevant for their students. Within the
professional development school setting, teachers and researchers will
collaborate intensively to develop theories of action, document and disseminate
practices that support teacher learning, and to design a model for sustainable,
school-wide improvement of science teaching and students' science learning
outcomes. Focusing intensely on one well-described school affords this project
the opportunity to explore in-depth research on teacher content and pedagogical
content learning.
