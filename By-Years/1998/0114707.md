Prediction of protein structure based on sequence information is of great value
for the interpretation of genomic sequence data. Such method would reduce the
number of protein structure that must be determined experimentally to obtain a
structural complement for an organism. The new method integrates tools such as
secondary structure prediction and distance-based torsion angle dynamics with
the idea of patch-based tertiary contact prediction and bootstrapping. The first
class of proteins will be those that take on an alpha-helical structure, the
class of proteins for which prediction has been most successful. The method will
be extended to predict arrangements of transmembrane helices. A further
extension to the structure of beta-sheet proteins will involve motif detection
and accumulation of motifs into larger structures. The methods will be optimized
and scored to aid in selecting the best model structure. The result will be
automated high accuracy software that can be used on whole genome sequences.
