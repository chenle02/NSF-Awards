9512834 Faust This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in
polymers between Rudolf Faust at the University of Massachusetts in Lowell and
Jean-Pierre Vairon at the University Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris, France. The
objective of their research is to enable the synthesis of polymers with well-
controlled structures by generating mechanistic understaning and kinetic
information of living cationic polymers. The U.S. investigator brings to this
collaboration expertise in polymer synthesis. This is complemented by French
expertise in ionic polymerization. The collaboration also takes advantage of
specialized equipment developed by the French group to study the kinetics of
polymerization.
