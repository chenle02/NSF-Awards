It is proposed to develop a two-course sequence on particle technology, and to
offer it as an option in the Chemical Engineering curriculum at CUNY. Both
theoretical and experimental aspects will be covered. The particle technology
laboratory will be equipped with new instrumentation, with funds co-sheared by
the university and industry. Two other courses from the graduate curriculum.
Fluidization and Fluid Particle Systems, will be adapted for the undergraduate
students in order to provide a continuation of the new two-course sequence. The
program will be open and advertised to all interested universities and
industrial companies. The course will fill the need for training specialists in
the area of particle science and technology for materials synthesis and
processing, manufacturing of bulk chemicals, mineral processing, pharmaceutical
and other industrial processes.
