A grant is awarded for the pruchase of a VAX 520 graphics workstation. This
equipment will help in the development of computer simulation studies in the
following research areas: (1) studies of the microgeometry of mutiphase
materials; (2) attainment of a fundamental understanding of crystal growth from
the melt; (3) combustion in refractory tubes, including prediction of ignition
and the production of pollutants; (4) models of the behavior of cell populations
near varying concentration gradients of chemcial stimuli called chemotaxis); and
(5) synthesis and optimization of chemcial processes including reactors,
separation equipment, etc. The equipment will provide three-dimensional pictures
that will aid faculty and students in visualizing and interpreting the results
of their models.
