Howe&lt;br/&gt;0129081&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental restoration uses land
reclamation techniques to test fundamental ecological theory and thereby inform
management practices. This work will maintain an existing example of a grassland
restoration to (1) monitor vole-driven changes in plant dominance over enough
time to distinguish among several possible outcomes; (2) determine whether
initial changes in standing crop are persistent or transient, and (3) determine
whether vole-driven effects produce persistent increases or decreases in plant
richness and diversity. Initial results to date raise the following issues: (1)
Will the established vole-driven change in plant dominance result in the
promotion of a new single dominant species? (2) Will initial reductions in
apparent aboveground productivity persist? (3) Will vole-driven changes increase
or decrease diversity? If voles effectively replace a palatable grass with a
distasteful single large dicot species, such as Rudbeckia, community aspect will
change but apparent productivity and diversity may not. If smaller clonal dicots
become co-dominants aspect will change, standing crop will decline, and plant
diversity may increase. The outcomes of these questions are compelling for
understanding the origins and maintenance of tallgrass communities because they
would not simply be incremental changes in relative abundance of species. Within
the limits of the experimental set of species, they could amount to rodent-
driven changes in fundamental properties of the communities. This is a known and
understood possibility for ungulate effects on tallgrass communities, but the
potential for rodents to have effects of similar magnitude is not widely
recognized.&lt;br/&gt;
