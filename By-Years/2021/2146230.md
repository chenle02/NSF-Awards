The objective of this Disrupting Operations of Illicit Supply Networks (D-ISN)
project is to better understand illicit supply networks by studying the
emergence of dangerous illegal synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, and the rise
of counterfeit prescription opioid medications. The project will advance the
national health and welfare by addressing a nationwide epidemic of fatal drug
overdoses. Through complementary theory development and systematic comparison of
illegal opioid markets with other illegal markets (e.g., human trafficking,
counterfeit products, wildlife smuggling, etc.), the project will identify and
test explanations for key questions prompted by the recent emergence of potent
synthetic opioids. An improved understanding of supplier operations, trafficker
decision-making, and economic foundations of illegal supply networks will help
guide effective policy responses aimed at disrupting supply. For opioids,
systematic characterization of supplier decision-making can offer valuable
lessons to reduce harms. Contrasting findings for opioids with those for other
illegal supply networks may offer additional insights across a range of
trafficking domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will draw on methods from
economics, operations research, computer science, and social sciences to address
three major aims: (1) collect and analyze new data related to the illegal supply
of synthetic opioids through web-scraping of online listings for these drugs,
reviewing federal court documents for trafficking in synthetic opioids, and
conducting interviews with law enforcement involved in countering synthetic
opioid trafficking; (2) expand existing theoretical frameworks of illegal
markets derived from risks and prices to best explain the patterns associated
with the illegal distribution of fentanyl; and (3) synthesize findings across
networks for different illicit commodities through the drafting of comparative
volumes with external experts in trade in other contraband. Data collection will
leverage automated software tools, natural language processing, and semi-
structured interviews. Economic and supply chain modeling will be used to
interpret data and formulate findings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
