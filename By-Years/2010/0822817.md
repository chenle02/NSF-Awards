The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program
project is to produce analytical and computational models illuminating the
dynamics of schooling, advancing methods from the field of geometric mechanics
to enable the analysis of both the energetics and the stability of coupled
swimming. A robotic prototype will be developed with integrated biomimetic
sensing and actuation, and control methods will be derived for this system to
demonstrate energy-efficient wake drafting and vortex-assisted turning, two
essential components of schooling locomotion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydrodynamic
interactions among fish swimming in a school can dramatically reduce the
school's collective drag. This drag reduction has been documented
experimentally, but the interactions responsible are not fully understood. This
problem is of basic scientific interest, but it is also of engineering interest.
Biomimetic underwater vehicles are being developed within the robotics community
to exploit performance advantages enjoyed by marine animals; the concurrent
deployment of schools of underwater vehicles for distributed environmental
sensing or military reconnaissance is a common
objective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to derive energy efficiency through
fluid-structure interactions, particularly in the context of schooling,
practical underwater vehicles will need to employ feedback systems incorporating
distributed flow sensor data into motion control algorithms. No such systems
exist, but novel flow sensors comprising micromachined hair cells provide a
platform for their development.
