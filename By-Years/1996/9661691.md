*** ABSTRACT 96-61691 Black This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project will develop a novel magnetic field sensor for in-situ process sensing.
The system under investigation responds to the need for new techniques for real-
time process control in semiconductor fabrication and Intelligent Fiber Optic
Systems (IFOS) proposes to develop a room-temperature benchtop testbed
comprising a magnetic orientation electromagnet and a portion of a semiconductor
substrate chuck in conjunction with a magnetic sensor based on an innovative
combination of technologies including fiber gratings and magnetostrictive
coatings. During Phase I, IFOS will: (1) establish details of the sensor
specifications, and design and model the sensor probes and system, (2) fabricate
fiber sensor probe substrates involving fiber grating with claddings partially
removed and coated by magnetostrictive material, (3) construct a feasibility
prototype testbed, (4) test and evaluate prototype, and (5) deliver a final
report and submit a Phase II proposal. This first-time incorporation of magnetic
sensors in plasma Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) is expected to offer improved
process control for thin film head fabrication with higher sensitivity and
reliability than conventional approaches. The electrically passive, in-line,
multiplexible, low-cost, and mass producible sensor design developed during this
research can be applied in in-situ process sensing and will find additional
applications in the aerospace, electricity generation, and other industries. The
aforementioned features make the proposed sensors marketable and will likely
attract non-federal and private sector commercialization funding. ***
