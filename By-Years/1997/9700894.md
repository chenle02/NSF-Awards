MAKAR-LIMANOV, ABSTRACT 9700894 The main objects of the research in this
proposal are locally nilpotent derivations on various algebra, a new invariant
which was recently introduced by the principal investigator, and their possible
applications to algebraic and geometric questions. The motivation of this
research is the development of algebraic tools which allow one to distinguish
rings (in commutative and non-commutative settings). The invariant which was
originally introduced in order to distinguish some factor-rings of a polynomial
ring with four generators also is useful in a description of groups of
automorphisms of a certain class of surfaces and in cancellation type problems.
Ring theory and group theory provide a means for describing geometric objects
through the study of certain properties like symmetry and reflections and how
these "operations" leave "invariant" certain geometric features of the objects
of study.
