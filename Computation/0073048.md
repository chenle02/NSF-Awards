Pseudospectral (PS) methods are high-accuracy alternatives to finite difference
(FD) and finite element methods (FEM) for the numerical solution of PDEs. They
are particularly effective for solving convection-dominated equations over long
times and in relatively simple geometries. Both the algorithms themselves and
the analysis of them have traditionally been closely tied to expansions in
different classes of orthogonal functions. The recent book "A Practical Guide to
Pseudospectral Methods" (by the present investigator) notes that a large body of
generalizations, enhancements and insights can be gained by viewing PS methods
instead as special cases of FD methods. Several such opportunities were explored
under the grant DMS-9706916. Building on these experiences, we will now
introduce radial basis functions (RBFs) as an additional component to be
integrated with PS schemes. Although computationally quite costly, the spectral
accuracy of RBFs, combined with their extreme geometric flexibility, would seem
to make them ideally suited to complement PS methods in the vicinity of
irregular boundaries. To realize this requires much research regarding the basic
features of RBF approximations, as well as research on issues related to
interfacing them with PS and FD methods.

Pseudospectral (PS) methods were first proposed in the early 1970's (in
connection with meteorology and turbulence modeling). They have since been shown
to be extraordinary effective for high-accuracy calculations in numerous other
fields, such as computational electromagnetics and nonlinear waves.
Strategically important application areas include simulating the radar
scattering from airplanes, the electrical interference between components on
computer chips, and the transmissions of signals in optical fibres. The main
weakness with PS methods has been the difficulty to apply them in complex
geometries. Some of this has been overcome in recent years (usually by splitting
a complicated domain in simpler parts, and then applying some suitable
computational means for coupling of the subdomains). A quite different and
highly promising approach will be introduced and then explored under this grant.
This involves combining 'classical' PS methods with the geometrically extremely
flexible approach known as radial basis functions (RBFs). This has never been
attempted, and the research falls in the 'high risk, high gain' category.
Success is by no means certain, but if it happens, it could have a major impact,
particularly on computational electromagnetics in applications such as
simulation of radar scattering / stealth properties of objects.
