This proposal represents a collaborative effort between F.S. Spear of
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and T.M. Harrison of SUNY-Albany. The objective
of the proposed research is the determination of pressure-temperature-time paths
for metamorphic rocks from central New England during the Acadian orogeny. The
areas chosen for study comprise four transects across central Massachusetts,
southern New Hampshire and Vermont, and northern new Hampshire. Pressure-
temperature paths of metamor- phism will be determined for rocks of different
structural levels utilizing a combination of petrologic techniques including
geothermobarometry, zoned metamorphic prophyroblasts, petrogenetic grids, and
textural analysis. P-T paths will be correlated with structural evolution
through analysis of mineral growth in relation to fabric development. Age
constraints on the cooling histories of the rocks will be obtained from analysis
of 40 Ar/39 Ar release spectra in hornblende, muscovite, biotite and K-feldspar.
Zircon chronology on the ANU SHRIMP ion microprobe will be used to obtain
absolute ages on pluton emplacement and to constrain the timing of structural
development. The ultimate goal of this research is to obtain 4- dimensional
(x-y-z-time) control on the thermo-tectonic behavior of the crust during the
Acadian orogeny. It is anticipated that these results will lead to an improved
understanding of the evolution of the continental lithosphere during collisional
orogenesis in general.
