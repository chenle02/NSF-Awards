A study will be made of the expression of disease symptons by Cauliflower Mosaic
Virus (CaMV), a double strand DNA containing plant virus. This work will focus
on the regulation of a particular viral gene, CaMV gene VI, whose protein
product has been implicated in production of a disease phenotype. Questions that
will be asked include determining whether the product of gene VI regulates its
own expression and, if so, determining which domains of the protein are
involved. These studies will be carried out in both transgenic plants and in
transient expression systems. Quantitation of gene VI promoter activity will be
obtained by use of the luciferase reporter gene system.
