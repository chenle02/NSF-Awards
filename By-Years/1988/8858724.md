The development of a number of advanced engineering concepts is currently
limited by the tribological problems which are experienced by components and
systems, when they are exposed to severe environments. Solutions to many of
these problems lie in advanced ceramic-ceramic composites with improved
toughness and high temperature resistance. The aim of this study is to develop
the basis for microstructural design of composites in this family of materials
for tribological and structural applications. Initial work will focus on the
behavior under tribological conditions of titanium aluminide matrix materials
reinforced with continuous silicon carbide fibers. The wear and friction
behavior will be related to the micromechanics of deformation and fracture
which, in turn, will be related to microstructural parameters and bulk
mechanical properties. The results will be used to develop a suitable model,
which then will be extended to other systems.
