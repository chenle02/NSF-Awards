Crandall 9302995 This project continues mathematical research on nonlinear
partial differential equations. A very broad class of equations referred to as
fully nonlinear will be under consideration. Also included will be the
associated evolution equation one can form from a time-dependent differential
equation. The thrust of the work carries forward investigations into a class of
solutions developed during the past decade known as viscosity solutions. To be
precise, a viscosity solution is a class of functions within which one expects
to find a solution to the equation. The methods are closely related to that of
continuous game theory in that from many possible solutions one wants to show
that a best can be determined. There has been considerable success in obtaining
existence results for viscosity solutions in which the basic operators involved
are bounded. The present work seeks to expand the possibilities for extending to
unbounded versions and infinite dimensional generalizations. A second line of
investigation will be carried out in an effort to obtain numerical
approximations of fully nonlinear equations. The work proceeds in several
directions. One must determine what an effective type mesh would be and in terms
of this give error estimates. This will first be done without regard to boundary
conditions, but with the understanding that such cases must be taken into
account at a later date. A modest beginning will be made on uniformly elliptic
equations. Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical modeling
of the physical world. The role of mathematical analysis is not so much to
create the equations as it is to provide qualitative and quantitative
information about the solutions. This may include answers to questions about
uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition, analysis often develops methods
for numerical approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these
approximations. ***
