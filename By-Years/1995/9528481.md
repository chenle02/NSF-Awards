9528481 Lodge Polymer mixtures - blends, copolymers, and combinations thereof -
are an increasingly important source of superior macromolecular materials. Four
specific project areas are identified. The first concerns the underlying
timescale for segmental rearrangements, which impacts all dynamic properties
through the monomeric friction factor. A second project will examine tracer
diffusion in weakly-segregated copolymers and blends. The third thrust
emphasizes more strongly-segregated structures, namely block copolymers in the
ordered state, and the tracer diffusion of copolymers, homopolymers, and small
molecule probes therein. The final area of interest is the role of solvent
concentration and quality in determining the morphologies adopted by block
copolymers. Particular emphasis will be placed on continuously-variable solvent
selectivity, to be achieved in part via mixed solvent. %%% This research will
lead to fundamental understanding of structures and interactions of polymer
chains in mixtures of polymers and copolymers with extensions on processability
and property optimization. ***
