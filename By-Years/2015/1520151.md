The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project can lead to a revolution in thin film
measurement, which is an integral part of quality control and verification of
component and device production. This can impact a broad range of industries,
including semiconductors, transportation (such as airplane coatings and
insulation), and polymer coatings in construction and building materials. The
proposed technology will result in broader adoption of non-destructive
measurement, cost reductions via reduced material usage, increased in-line
measurement techniques. The technology and system will offer flexible and mobile
test solutions in comparison to the current immobile, expensive systems that
have a high degree of operational constraints.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop
an optical measurement system designed to perform film thickness determination
on layers that are constructed with turbid media and surface conditions that are
far from optically smooth. The film thickness will be measured in a non-contact,
non-destructive manner, with potential for real-time assessment. The material
properties of the films are the primary reason for the constraints on film
thickness measurement by the currently available measurement devices. The
accurate film-thickness and conformal coating thickness measurement are made
possible by a proprietary novel noise reduction technique which enables the
system to make accurate measurement from interference images with significant
speckle and scattering noise. The goal of this research program is to augment
this technology into a portable system that can provide quality control without
requirements for steady state conditions and can be applied in a variety of
manufacturing processes.
