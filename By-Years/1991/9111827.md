This action is part of a coordinated project to document and maintain special-
purpose computer codes which can be used to study different aspects of the runup
of a tsunami (seismic sea wave) onto a coastline. It involves a collaboration
between Professor Philip Liu at Cornell University, and Professors Kobayashi and
Grilli at the University of Delaware. Quite a large number of special-purpose
computer programs have been developed as part of student doctoral theses. Some
of these codes were later found to have wider applicability, and are of interest
to other researchers. At the time that they were developed, the substantial
investment in effort and time needed to document them for general usage was not
made. There is now a growing recognition of this need, but there are no agreed-
upon standards for such documentation. This project is intended as a pilot study
for documenting and maintaining three existing computer programs. The objective
is to develop guidelines for documentation and maintenance of such large
computer codes, thereby defining a standard which other code developers can
follow. This action is for the work by Professors Kobayashi and Grille at the
University of Delaware's Center for Applied Coastal Research. Professor Grilli's
code solves the exact two-dimensional nonlinear potential flow equations, for
arbitrary bottom geometry, and can be used for short wavelengths (e.g. wind
waves) and long wavelengths (e.g. tsunamis). Professor Kobayashi's code
calculates the one- dimensional nonlinear long wave runup on an impermeable
slope of arbitrary geometry and roughness characteristics.
