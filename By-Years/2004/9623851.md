As the application of computers to the physical world widen, there is an ever
increasing need for computational tools to deal with the physical attributes of
objects, such as their geometry. The field of Computational Geometry has made
impressive strides in the last twenty years in providing an algorithmic
foundation for the solution to many geometric problems in computer graphics,
computer vision, robotics and manufacturing, and many other application areas.
The purpose of this proposal is to develop a set of novel geometric
representations and algorithmic techniques that will make computational geometry
more useful in modeling physical-world objects and processes. The aim is not to
obtain universal, domain-independent solutions --- such as a complete solution
to robustness concerns in geometric computing. Instead the focus will be on
certain key issues, such as scale- sensitivity, shape variability, and motion,
that arise in many of the important uses of geometry in modeling physical
objects and systems. Geometric models that properly capture certain key aspects
of the uncertainty or variability in models of physical objects and processes
will be investigated, and efficient algorithms for manipulating these models
effectively will be developed. It is expected that this set of research
directions will generate new mathematical and algorithmic problems that will be
interesting and worthy of study on their own right, in addition to producing
geometric tools that are well-tailored to physical world applications. ***
