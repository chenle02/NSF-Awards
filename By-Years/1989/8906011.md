Dr. James Elliot will use the observational technique of stellar occultations of
Solar System objects to probe the characteristics of planets and their rings in
the outer Solar System. The spatial resolution of this technique should be about
4 kilometers which is several thousand times better than is possible with
ordinary Earth-based methods. In 1989 Dr. Elliot will observe an occultation of
a bright star by Saturn and its rings. Saturn is expected to occult such a
bright star once every 80 years, on average, so this upcoming event presents a
unique opportunity to probe the ring system at high spatial resolution from
Earth. These and subsequent observations should improve the kinematic model of
Saturn's rings by a factor of 20 over what has been possible with data from the
Voyager spacecraft. From these data should come answers to fundamental questions
about the structure and time scales of evolution of the ring system of Saturn.
The occultation studies also include investigation of the upper atmospheres of
Saturn and Uranus, since the technique can produce temperature, pressure, and
number density profiles at high spatial resolution.
