This award supports the U.S.-India Planning Visit: Floras of Antarctica and
India, Implications for Gondwana Assembly and Paleoclimatology. Professor Sankar
Chatterjee, Texas Tech University and Dr. Rajni Tewari, Birbal Sahni Institute
of Paleobotany (BSIP)will undertake exchange visits in order to finalize a
comparative study on the morphology and palynology of Glossopteris and
Dicroidium floras. The collaborators will also study their utility in
paleobiogeography and climate evolution, which has never been integrated or
synthesized in any detail. Excellent collections of Permo-Triassic Gondwana
floras from India are currently housed at the BSIP, and similar contemporary
floras from Antarctica are at the Museum of Texas Tech University. This award
supports a unique scientific collaboration between the two investigators who
will study and compare the Permo-Triassic floras of India and Antarctica and
explore their significance in paleobiogeography and paleoclimatology. The
collaboration will integrate the expertise of the investigators and
institutional resources, as well as strengthen the USPI?s proposal, which will
be submitted to the GEO/EAR Sedimentary Geology &amp; Paleobiology Program
following this planning visit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
