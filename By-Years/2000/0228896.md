This award provides partial funding for a symposium to be held at the Materials
Research Society Meeting, Dec 2-6, 2002 in Boston, Massachusetts. The symposium
will address issues of Rapid Prototyping Technologies as applied to biomedical
applications, with specific concerns for the materials development for solid
freeform fabrication of 3D structures ranging from the macroscale down to the
nanoscale. Funding is request for participant support.
