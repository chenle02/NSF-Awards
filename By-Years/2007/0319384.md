This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
fast, reliable and sensitive technology that can identify the nature and the
content of the particles in aerosol samples, and provide an early warning of the
presence of bio-warfare agents. Current biological agent detection systems rely
on point detectors that cannot sample actual aerosol condition in real-time.
Additionally, standoff detectors are large, expensive and not suitable for use
in urban terrain. With a unique combination of bio-identification and ultra-
sensitivity particle counting, the proposed project will develop an extremely
sensitive, yet reliable detection and monitoring system that can satisfy most
current and potential needs for bio-agents detection. This Phase I project has
two specific aims: (1) to determine the optimal conditions for the detection of
bacterial spores (eg. Bacillus subtilis) with highest sensitivity using
antibodies; and (2) to demonstrate that the retained bacterial spores can be
detected by a particle counter operated in solution at a sensitivity sufficient
to detect few hundred particles. A testing device will be designed and produced
based on these results at the end of the project.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of homeland security.
