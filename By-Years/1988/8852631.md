Astronomy is a highly popular science for non-science majors and this provides
an efficient route for presenting scientific techniques and methodologies to
such an audience. There are however serious difficulties e.g. weather and sky
conditions in adding an effective lab experience for these students. The
Astronomy Program at the University of Maryland has developed a series of
computer labs which simulate astronomical observations. These are currently
limited by available memory and by the resolution of the monitors in use. It is
proposed to develop a more sophisticated system which will provide a more
realistic simulation which can be used to demonstrate more sophisticated
observing scenarios.
