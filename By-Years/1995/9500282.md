9500282 Gerhardt The objective of the proposed research is to determine the
relationship between pore microstructure and thermal treatment for the creation
of controlled porosity materials. To accomplish that task the following
activities will be carried out: (1) Fabricate colloidal silica/soluble silicate
monoliths having systematically varied microstructures with respect to both
average pore size(s) and polydispersity. The pore structure will be engineered
by modifications in chemical processing. (2) Characterize the microstructure of
the precursor materials fully before sintering using a combination of microscopy
(optical, and electron microscopy), and several different measurement
techniques. (3) Quantitatively characterize the evolution of the microstructure
ex-situ by means of pore size, shape and distribution measurements on
isothermally sintered and quenched samples. Extend the sintering studies to in-
situ isothermal sintering and simultaneous scattering experiments by means of a
unique small angle neutron scattering furnace at the NIST reactor. (4) Utilize
computer simulation and modeling to help elucidate the microstructural
mechanisms responsible for the observed pore structure evolution. %%% Numerous
engineering applications such as superinsulators, filters, and sensors require
porous materials. Understand- ing the pore structure evolution during sintering
is essential for the fabrication and control of the final microstructure in
porous materials. Materials such as those studied in this project offer a
notable opportunity, to tailor thermal conductivity for insulating purposes,
dielectric constant for sensing devices and elastic modulus for porous
structural ceramics.
