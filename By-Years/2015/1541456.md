The University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB) over the last several years has
developed innovative and productive research groups exploring topics in
bioinformatics, nanosciences, security analytics and biotechnology. One
challenge that continues to confront all research groups and projects at UAPB is
that of the limited ability of the campus network to support large science data
movement between research laboratories, national and global research partners.

This project is designed to enhance the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff's
campus network infrastructure to enabled dynamic network services for research
activities in two interwoven ways, first it will enhance existing large-scale
research activities to take advantage of new network capabilities. In particular
by separating research network traffic on the campus, and among partners onto a
specialized local dedicated research network (DRN), this will enable faculty,
postdoctoral researchers, students who have appropriate knowledge to make great
and immediate strides in their research activities. Secondly, the dedicated
research network will serve to provide an education and training ground for a
new generation of researchers and majority minority student population from a
Historically Black/College University (HBCU), in cutting-edge research
disciplines within Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).
