Borough of Manhattan Community College is a large urban two- year college whose
student body is two-third female, and over 80% minority. With a 1989-91 NSF
Calculus Reform Grant they have succeeded in attracting and retaining more women
and minorities in the Calculus sequence. This was accomplished by adding
computer-based collaborative workshops, based on the Treismann model, to
Calculus I, II, and III. It has become increasingly clear that to recruit and
retain women and minorities the program must begin at an earlier level; so they
are pushing their successful efforts back to the precalculus level. With
increased computer support they are attracting and preparing more women and
minorities for careers in mathematics, science, and the technologies.
