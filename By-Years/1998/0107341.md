The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S. scientists and
engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The
program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique
or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.

This award will support a six-month postdoctoral research fellowship by Dr.
Jason T. DeJong to work with Dr. Mark Randolph at the University of Western
Australia in Nedlands, West Australia.

Deep foundations are being constructed at an ever increasing rate in regions
with cemented sand deposits throughout the world. However, current empirical
design methods perform inadequately, and thus advances must be made to improve
design performance. Before advanced computer modeling methods can be properly
implemented, the mechanisms governing deep foundation behavior must be
understood and incorporated into models. This project will investigate these
mechanisms and provide a preliminary framework for modeling deep foundations in
cemented soils.

The University of Western Australia is one of the premier institutions in the
design of deep foundations. The host is a leading authority in the field of deep
foundations.
