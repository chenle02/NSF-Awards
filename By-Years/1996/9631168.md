The purpose of this project is to provide a class of adaptive nonparametric
procedures similar to Hogg's procedures, but for more general situations,
including (I) testing for ordered alternatives in the c-sample location problem
(c&gt;2), (ii) testing for ordered alternatives in the c-sample scale problem,
(iii) testing in the c-sample location - scale problem, (iv) testing, estimation
and multiple comparisons in the one-way layout, two-way layout and multi-way
layout analysis of variance (ANOVA) models. In addition, we will resolve the
practical problem of handling ties. Based on the theoretical arguments as well
as some extensive Monte Carlo studies, the supremacy of the procedures over (I)
the usual (non-adaptive) procedure of working only with the ranks and the
resulting statistics, such as Wilcoxon, and (ii) the usual parametric procedure
(based on the assumption of normality of the underlying distribution function)
will be established. This project will broaden the knowledge and explore new
techniques related to the study of the adaptive distribution free procedures in
several problems in the analysis of variance (univariate as well as
multivariate), multiple comparisons, estimation of contrasts, among others. It
will enhance the existing techniques and assist the future research projects in
the related fields.
