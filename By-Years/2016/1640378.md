This project consists of laboratory experiments that will lead to a better
understanding of the physical and chemical properties of atmospheric aerosol and
the dynamics of exchange between gas-phase and particle phase species. This
research is important for making future predictions of aerosol behavior and the
influence of atmospheric aerosol on global climate and regional air
quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to define the role of
particle phase, species diffusivity, and species volatility in the dynamic
exchange and reactivity of secondary organic aerosol. Experiments have been
designed to address the following objectives: (1) better understand how
temperature and relative humidity affect the diffusivity of various organic
species; (2) determine how the reactive history, including the volatile organic
carbon precursor of the particle, affects the diffusivity of the organic
species; and (3) develop structure-function relationships between the
diffusivities of organic species and their functional groups/molecular weights.
