Within recent years, the United States' excess electrical generating capacity
has diminished. In order to provide a dependable supply of electricity in the
face of less generating margin, responsiveness, availability, and reliability of
existing power plants need to be improved. To provide this improvement, a Bailey
NETWORK 90 distributed microprocessor based control system is requested which
will be interfaced with other computer capabilities at Penn State in order to
create a multi-user laboratory for research in the field of intelligent
distributed control for electric power generation. The new and unique research
laboratory will be attuned with the current evolutionary trend in commercial
power plant dynamic control system organization. In addition to digital forms of
classical control algorithms, the full capabilities of digital control systems
depend on implementation of advanced software applications: automation of
routine equipment monitoring, process fault diagnostics, effective and reliable
communication, rule-based programming, and modern control algorithms. The
research need is to fully develop these software capabilities in the distributed
control environment in order to achieve the desired improvement in power plant
performance. Advanced control research for electric power generation requires an
interdisciplinary approach and researchers from the Electrical, Mechanical,
Industrial, and Nuclear Engineering departments will be involved.
