The Center for Fluid Mechanics, Turbulence and Computation and the Division of
Applied Mathematics at Brown University will purchase high performance, color
graphics, computer equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research
in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several research
projects including particular: Dynamical systems and computation, Dynamics of
two-phase flow and turbulence, Markovian models in vision and image processing,
and Applied mathematical modelling.
