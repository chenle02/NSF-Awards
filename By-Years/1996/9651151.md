This project involves developing a curriculum revision to increase students'
experience with modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The
modifications are giving all chemistry majors earlier exposure to this
fundamental spectroscopic tool and are expanding their experiences to include
more modern FT-NMR applications. Five computers, an air dryer, and NMR
processing software are allowing off-line PC processing of NMR data and
enhancing the variable temperature capabilities of the department's FT-NMR
spectrometer. Students have opportunities to work directly with NMR data
beginning in the sophomore year. They gain experience with processing NMR data
and learn to operate the spectrometer and apply it to a variety of chemical
problems. Experiments involve investigation of dynamic processes and the use of
spectral simulation to analyze second-order spectra. Computerized problem
assignments supplement the laboratory applications at each step. The
experiments, NMR data sets, and computer exercises are valuable in other 4-year
educational settings, and the data sets and computer exercises are applicable at
2-year institutions and other sites lacking an NMR spectrometer.
