Parents in many traditional and industrialized societies have been seen to
invest differentially in given offspring according to the total pool of
resources available, as well as the offspring's age, gender, and perceived vigor
or condition. The discipline of evolutionary ecology offers a framework for
understanding these differential parental investment strategies. Evolutionary
models of parental investment predict that parents adjust the magnitude and
scheduling of resources allocated to their children according to the likely
fitness payoffs of current investments and those from alternative uses of
resources. To date, however, little research has attempted to test hypotheses
explicitly derived from this body of theory. This project seeks to test several
predictions of evolutionary parental investment theory using data from an
observational study of mother-offspring proximity, and breast-feeding and
supplementation practices among the Au of Papua New Guinea. Prolonged lactation
leads to a protracted anovulatory period as well as to long-term declines in
maternal energy reserves which have been documented to affect maternal health
and survival. As such, lactation is one of the costliest forms of investment
expended by mothers on their newborn offspring and should vary systematically
with individual characteristics of the mother and child. This study will yield
important data on variation in infant feeding patterns in a traditional society
and will help to identify the conditions under which specific children are at
elevated risk of growth faltering, morbidity, and death. It will also provide
one of the first critical tests of evolutionary parental investment theory.
