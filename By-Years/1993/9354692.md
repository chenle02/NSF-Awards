9354692 LoPresti Wheelock College is undertaking a three year project, Focus on
Science, which runs simultaneously with the pre-service collaborative project
Teacher Education Addressing Mathematics and Science in Boston and Cambridge
(TEAMS-BC). Through TEAMS-BC, Wheelock College faculty are developing new
courses and revising existing courses in science and mathematics education in
order to develop a coordinated science and mathematics program for students in
elementary and early childhood education. In addition, Wheelock is working
closely with professional development schools in Boston and Cambridge to assure
that the field experiences of students support their learning in science and
mathematics for children. This project focuses on the implementation of an
intensive formative assessment process within the courses undergoing change, to
both document and analyze student growth, and to develop assessment practices
that are embedded into the design of the new courses. This project also supports
collaborative efforts with the Martin Luther King, Jr. School in Cambridge to
build a professional development school. Teachers and faculty are working
closely together to build the science teaching capacity at the school, to
provide the clinical experience for students that will enhance their skills in
teaching science to children, and to reach out to the community of the school.
