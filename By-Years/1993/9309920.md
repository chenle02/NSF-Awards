This award provides travel support for Dr. John Cheeseman and a graduate
research assistant from the Department of Plant Biology at the University of
Illinois to go to Australia in order to conduct cooperative research with Dr.
Barry Clough of the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS). The research
will focus on the control of photosynthesis in mangroves under natural
conditions. Mangrove forests of tropical coasts and estuaries are highly
productive and essential to the maintenance of associated ecosystems. Mangroves,
noted for their exceptional tolerance to high temperatures and light intensity
as well as salinity, are also a notable exception to the rule that plants found
in demanding environments would grow better in less demanding ones but are
excluded by competition. The research team will travel to the Daintree River
estuary in north Queensland where a combination of biochemical and biophysical
approaches will be applied to the problem of short term control of
photosynthesis in mangroves. Among the topics to be investigated is the apparent
lack of photoinhibitory damage to leaves exposed to high light and high
temperatures for prolonged periods with their stomates closed.
