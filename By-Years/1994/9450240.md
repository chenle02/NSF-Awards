9450240 Berenfeld The Global Laboratory Curriculum provides an
interdisciplinary, one-year course at the secondary level that supports science
standards and school reform through intercultural, scientifically meaningful,
collaborative student investigations in environmental studies. Students are
given the opportunity to experience all aspects of genuine scientific research:
problem identification, background study, project design, collaboration, data
acquisition and analysis, publication and defense. The students begin with small
experimental activities in the first semester and build toward a research
project in the second. The curriculum builds upon earlier Global Lab Projects
which emphasized research activities at various grade levels. The Student
Research Guide of reference materials and research techniques supports a wide
range of activities and telecommunications. The Teachers' Guide includes
classroom management techniques, equipment information, lesson plans, assessment
guidance and references to standards. The Toolkit will supply a versatile set of
instruments piloted in previous projects and also the Alice Network Software.
The Workshop package supports teachers to facilitate and lead student-based
research. The materials are pilot and field tested.
