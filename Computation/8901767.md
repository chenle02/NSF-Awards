This research is concerned with pattern formation of Rayleigh-Benard convection
in a cylindrical geometry. Numerical simulation together with analytic
bifurcation theory will be used to investigate and to understand pattern
formation. This will be used in collaboration with experimental studies to
confirm or refute conjectures regarding the structure or stability of convective
flows. As new areas of inquiry open up, new and improved numerical methods will
be pursued. Visualization techniques will also be developed for interrogating
and for interpreting the computed results.
