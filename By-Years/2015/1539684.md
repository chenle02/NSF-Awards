Cyber security is an important area for computer science and engineering
education, and strengthening our cyber infrastructure has been recognized as an
area of national interest. It is a well-known fact that the U.S. does not
produce enough high-quality cyber security experts. The lack of hands-on cyber
security experience as part of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM)
Education is one such source of challenges. The proposed technology, "VLab," is
designed to address this challenge and to establish an open and hands-on
E-learning laboratory for cyber defense. The proposed technology is expected to
fill the gap between incorporating hands-on experience into cyber security
curriculum at a large-scale and enhancing personalized and customizable
educational features that can be tuned towards an adaptive E-learning
environment for higher education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VLab will enhance cyber
security education that is very cognizant of the growing national need to keep
infrastructures secure, including securing communications, reducing cyber
threats, developing resilient systems for the homeland, and for learning
technologies in online educational pro- grams. The proposed hands-on laboratory
solution can greatly improve the cyber security education?s quality and attract
more students to work in this area. The presented VLab will not only be an
important complementary component for existing in-class and online education
approaches, but also provide a new hands-on centric learning approach that can
greatly improve the effectiveness for learning cyber security technologies.
Moreover, VLab has great potential to be incorporated into other STEM fields
that demands hands-on experiments that can be benefit from such as virtual
hands-on laboratory to support their course projects.
