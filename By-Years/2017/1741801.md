NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project focuses on the synthesis of a new class
of oxide materials using an advanced state-of-the-art thin film deposition
technique. These materials possess high conductivity and a wide bandgap - so
light can pass through easily, making it optically transparent. These properties
are of great interest for next generation electronic devices such as high-power
electronics, transparent displays, touchscreens and solar cells. The research
activities contribute to the professional development experience for students
from local high schools, minority organizations and community colleges through
education, training and hands-on workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL
DETAILS: Through a combination of experimental and computational techniques, the
project is investigating fundamental factors, at the atomic level of detail,
that influence the defect formation and electronic properties in strain-
engineered alkaline-earth stannate (Sr1-xBaxSnO3) thin films. In particular, the
project is seeking to understand, and control defects specifically dislocations,
local structure, and electronic mobility in these materials with an ultimate
goal to create a new class of high-mobility semiconducting materials with wide
bandgap for room-temperature applications. The project is also exploiting
synthesis methods for atomic level control of point defects and structural
defects in complex oxides. The project is providing opportunities for graduate,
undergraduate and high school students to obtain training on cutting-edge thin
film deposition approaches, advanced characterization techniques, and
theoretical calculations.
