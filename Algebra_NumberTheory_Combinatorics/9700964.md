LUNTS 97-00964 This project is a study of the localization construction for
quantum groups with emphasis on the roots of unity case. It is a continuation of
the joint project with Alex Rosenberg where the localization was constructed for
the generic case. The second part of the project is the study of the Kodaira-
Spencer Lie algebra which arises in deformations of algebraic varieties. This is
the "mirror dual" picture to the one developed recently with Eduard Looijenga.
Quantum groups are algebraic objects which have recently arisen from physics.
However, these objects whose study not only has applications to physics can also
be used to study various questions of a purely algebraic nature.
