Remote detection using microcantilever based sensor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
objective of this research is to develop a highly sensitive and reliable sensor
module for detection of analytes in harsh environments in air and liquid media.
The approach uses a resonant microcantilever sensor with integrated deflection
transducer. The cantilever will operate in a vacuum enclosure interacting
electrostatically with external functionalization layers that adsorb analyte
molecules in air or liquid media and result in a change in surface potential.
This approach has the potential for wide ranging applications in defense and
homeland security, industrial process monitoring, environmental monitoring, and
medical diagnosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed structure utilizes a non-contact
detection method allowing the functionalization layer to be separated from the
resonant microcantilever, which can be enclosed in vacuum leading to a dramatic
increase in its sensitivity and reliability. A GaN microcantilever integrated
with an AlGaN/GaN piezoresistive deflection transducer results in a highly
sensitive sensor suitable for operation in harsh environments. The usage of
AlGaN/GaN epitaxial layers grown on Si wafer leads to possibility of integrating
the resonant sensor, transducer, and signal transmitter on a
chip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational
and outreach activities of the project include development of a graduate course
on microelectromechanical (MEMS) sensors, involvement of undergraduate and high
school students in research activities, minority recruitment, and development of
a highly informative website on MEMS based sensing. The research activities will
also involve industrial collaborations that can open up exciting new
applications of III-V Nitrides leading to significant economic impacts.
