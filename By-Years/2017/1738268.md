The 2017 IEEE North American School for Information Theory will be held at the
Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, from June 7-9, 2017. This
Project provides support for the expenses of school participants from the United
States, including graduate students and postdocs. These participants will
benefit from attending the school, learning from senior colleagues, presenting
their own research in poster sessions, and expanding their network contacts
within the community, but who lack funds and would not be able to attend without
travel support. The student selection criteria emphasize ethnic diversity,
gender equality, and geographic diversity, to ensure broad participation in the
workshop.
