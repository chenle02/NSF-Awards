9217432 Young This award will support collaborative research between Michal
Young, Purdue University, and Mauro Pezze, Politechnico di Milano, Italy. The
project will investigate integration of multiple operational models of
concurrent software. Research issues for the project include methods for
reasoning about the relation between different behavioral models of the same
component; techniques for analyzing the behavior of systems in which components
may be modeled in different ways; automatic generation of state-space analysis
tools with support for multi-formalism analysis; and models of time amenable to
practical state-space analysis. The Italian investigator will contribute
expertise in Petri net models of concurrent systems. The US investigator will
bring expertise in the analysis of concurrent software and the integration of
analysis techniques and tools in software development environments. Pezze will
take the lead in the more theoretical side of the work, and Young will lead in
the design and evaluation of the analysis tool generator. ***
