The University of Miami proposes to provide fleetwide operational support for
the various X-band radars that exist in the Academic Research Fleet (ARF).
Although this proposal was submitted to the Oceanographic Instrumentation
Program, it will be considered under Oceanographic Technical Services (OTS)
which is more appropriate. There are salaries involved, and the proposal follows
the model of centers of expertise throughout the fleet that provide specialized
support for a particular discipline (e.g., ADCP, MAC, R2R, etc.). All these
centers are funded through OTS. This is a proposal for a 3-year continuing
grant. The Program will recommend the initiation of a pilot program to pursue
the goals outlined in the proposal. Continued support for Armstrong and the
addition of Sikuliaq to the project are the starting points. The goal is
ultimately to expand the support to all vessels in the ARF that have these
radars. The first year will be recommended at proposed levels. It will be a
3-year continuing grant with the outyear funding being negotiated with the
Program based on the receipt of the annual report. The Program recommends an
award of $292,547 for the first year.

Broader Impacts

The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2
of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
