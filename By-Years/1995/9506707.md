9506707 Duraiswami The research is directed at developing a PC-based, user-
friendly, on-board multitasking ship maneuvering simulator incorporating
operation in confined water and under the action of wind and waves. The
objectives are to extend the multi-objective identification method to on-board
identification using on-board measurements; reduce structural uncertainty in the
model through invoking alternative mathematical models for the same ship and
create a database of models for various types of ships and different environment
conditions. This would lead to the development of multitasking software for
simulating several ships simultaneously and its implementation with a user-
friendly and realistic graphical interfaces. A library of mathematical models
for different ship configurations, and environmental conditions of wind, sea
state, proximity of channel-sides and walls will be created based on existing
fundamental models for ship hydrodynamics. A new multiobjective identification
approach that uses a set of mathematical models for parameter identification of
the same system will also be developed to reduce structural uncertainty of the
model. These developments will allow simulation of different types of ships
navigating in critically important situations.
