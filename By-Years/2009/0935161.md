This engineering education research award to North Carolina State University
will addresses energy and environmental issues in creating academic as well as
non-academic forums in which students are expected to learn and interact with
professionals. The project is composed of three main components. The first is
curriculum development, where instructional modules will be prepared and courses
will be developed or modified to include sustainability content. The second will
enhance the existing REU programs in Green Chemical Engineering and
Sustainability, Energy and Environment. The third element of the project will be
the development of web-based instructional materials. Existing technologies will
be evaluated to extend learning communities so that students can be connected
with representatives from industry, government and alumni for professional
development and data exchange. The proposed work will improve engineering
education through integration of sustainability concepts and experience so that
students will be better prepared for engineering jobs of the future.
