This planning grant addresses the issue of students losing interest in STEM
during the ages of 8-12 years. The PIs propose that STEM content provided
through electronic media will be more readily accepted by youth because it is on
their "home turf." IMX.org will be a new, highly engaging, online destination
for tweens and kids at large. It is designed to leverage the Web 2.0 and tweens'
fascination with media and popular culture, and to demonstrate the connections
between the real world, everyday life, and STEM. The project will test a
preliminary design with a focus group of 8-12 year-olds, convene a panel of
experts and Advisory Board, and create a beta Web site to conduct formative
research.
