Endohedral fullerenes (molecular compounds in which an atom with an electronic
moment resides inside a hollow "buckyball" molecule) are attractive candidates
for quantum bits (qubits) because the endohedral fullerene chemically and
electrically protects the electronic moment that will serve as a qubit leading
to long spin relaxation times and the opportunity to build the computer on
surface without the need for burying. The goal of the project is the application
of a magnetic resonance force microscope to the detection and study of
individual endohedral fullerenes, and to the fabrication, characterization and
readout of the computer, ultimately with single spin sensitivity, it is hoped.
To achieve this techniques for manipulating and studying fullerenes on surfaces
will be developed, and high sensitivity magnetic resonance force microscopy
studies of their magnetic properties will be performed.
