0400521 Romm This proposal by the Global Environment &amp; Technology Foundation
(GETF) will identify and document the basic engineering and scientific questions
and educational challenges evolving from this global interest in hydrogen --
questions that are central to the NSF and other basic research institutions.
This proposal will focus a Workshop entitled "Future Directions for Hydrogen
Energy Research and Education" that will bring together an international group
of engineers, scientists, and other experts to identify and articulate the basic
engineering, scientific and educational questions evolving from both U.S. and
international interests in an expanding role for hydrogen as a component of a
national energy strategy. The Workshop will be set in the context of the global
hydrogen energy effort, but will focus on the specific directions for basic
research and science and engineering education of particular interest to the NSF
and to the science and engineering communities - and subsequently submitted as
an article for publication in a journal such as Science or Nature, planned to
make the impact to the largest members of society with interest.
