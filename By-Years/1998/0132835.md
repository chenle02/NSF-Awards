Drs. Sibrina Collins and Isiah Warner of Louisiana State University are
supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry and Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities Programs for support of minority students to attend
a special poster session at Pittconn 2002, a major international meeting for
analytical chemists in New Orleans LA March 17-22, 2002. The poster session is
to be held in conjunction with a special symposium celebrating diversity in the
field of analytical chemists, featuring reknown speakers from a variety of
backgrounds. The requested funds are to support the travel costs of
undergraduate minority students, making possible an increased attendance of
minority students at this meeting.&lt;br/&gt;
