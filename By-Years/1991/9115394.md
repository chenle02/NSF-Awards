This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at Georgetown University acquire an entire new
integrated single crystal x-ray diffractometer and structure analysis system,
with rotating anode generator and low temperature capabilitities. Among the
areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are the
following: 1. The Bioinorganic Chemistry of Oxo-Bridged Dinuclear Iron Proteins
2. Structural Investigations in Heteropolyanion Chemistry 3. New Categories of
Heteropoly Complexes and New Insights 4. Structure and Reactions of Novel
Nitrones and Their Metal Complexes 5. Mixed-Valence Ruthenium Dimers Involving
Less-Effective Cross-Bridge Electronic Interaction 6. Orientation-Dependent
Chemistry on Molecular Crystal Surface 7. Sterochemical Control of Vitamin B-12
Functionality 8. Chiral Columns and Channels from Discotic Mesophases 9.
Magneto-Structural Correlations in Di- and Trinuclear Imidazolate-Bridged
Complexes of First-Row Transition Metals %%% Single crystal x-ray
crystallography is the most powerful analytical method for structure
determination of solids. In synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and
organometallic chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable tool
to characterize molecular structure. The information gained from the knowledge
of the intermolecular composition and structure helps to develop new reactions
of potentially general interest in catalysis or organic synthesis.
