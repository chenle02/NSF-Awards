The focus of this investigation is the depositional and tectonostratigraphic
history of the Early Paleozoic paleo-Pacific margin of Gondwana as seen in the
Transantarctic Mountain Chain. The Cambrian succession of the southern Argentina
Range is almost unknown, but the range occupies a critical position at the
Weddell Sea terminus of the chain, in a region that seems to have been
fragmented and displaced during the breakup of Gondwana. the sedimentological
and faunal history of this sequence will be documented and related it to what is
known in adjacent ranges. Available evidence suggests that a fault with major
displacement separates the Argentina Range from the Shackleton Range such that
Cambrian rocks of deep-water facies lie cratonwards of those laid down is
shallower settings. Conceivably, one or more suspect terranes are present. In a
second area, the complex Early Paleozoic deformational history south of the Byrd
Glacier, suggests that current views of the Skelton Group in its type area are
in error. These strata may be a Lower Paleozoic sequence rather than a deformed
Upper Proterozoic unit. Detailed faunal, sedimemtological, and radiometric age
dating will improve understanding of its true age and significance.
