There is a long period during the Arctic fall, when much of the soil profile is
suspended near 0Â°C. The investigators propose that this time of year may hold
key information needed to better understand how Arctic ecosystems can be
affected by climate change. The investigators hypothesize that there exist
specialized cold-adapted microbes, which produce methane, a potent greenhouse
gas, and that these microbes are active during this period when much of the soil
column is at the freezing point. The investigators also argue that these
specialized microbes may be responsible for a large fraction of the annual
methane released from Arctic soils to the atmosphere. The study will test
whether such specialized cold-adapted methane producing microbes are active
during this period, and if so, how much they contribute to the annual soil flux
of methane. To test this hypothesis, this study will bring to bear, field,
laboratory, and computer model simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
aims to predict how the Arctic will respond to current and future climate
change, and to better inform decision makers. This project will also continue a
well-developed outreach program involving local communities and students from
the North Slope of Alaska and San Diego.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flux tower
measurements have shown steady and significant methane emissions well into the
Arctic fall, when the soil profile is nearly isothermal at zero degrees celsius.
The investigators argue that this fall flux is maintained by specialized cold-
adapted methanogenic microbial communities that live in the soil column. The
study will test whether such specialized cold-adapted methanogenic communities
are active during this period, and if so, how much they contribute to the annual
soil efflux of methane. The proposed study includes field isotope work,
laboratory incubations, methane flux monitoring, and modeling. The modeling
aspect of the work was added as a response to suggestions from a previous panel.
