Montec Associates, Inc. project presents a novel mechanical method to cause low-
frequency, sonic-energy driven cavitation of liquids for application as an
advanced oxidation reactor. Local high temperatures (>5000 C), high pressures
(several hundred atmospheres) and high shear forces have been demonstrated to
occur within cavitation bubbles generated by ultrasonics. The high energy
environment created during implosion of the cavitation bubble acts as a
"microreactor" to enable and/or to accelerate chemical reactions. The production
of hydroxyl ions and peroxide for use as an aggressive oxidant via
ultrasonically induced cavitation is well documented. The proposed technology,
termed ResonantSonics, has been used at Montec to produce highly energetic
cavitation in liquids and slurries at low-frequencies, e.g., <2000 Hertz. The
ability to cause cavitation with low-frequency sonics has profound implications,
as it overcomes the severe scaling and cost restrictions that have prevented the
commercial ultrasonic processing applications. Exploratory tests conducted at
Montec have demonstrated that ResonantSonics can destroy (oxidize) cyanide and
greatly enhance removal of cyanide and fluoride, as well as heavy metals, from
contaminated materials. The results of these exploratory experiments provide a
strong motivation for Montec to develop ResonantSonics as a viable commercial
advanced oxidation process. The technology has the potential to provide a
viable, sonochemical means, suitable for efficient scale-up to destroy or
convert a broad range of hazardous waste types. Commercial applications are
numerous and include treatment of mixed and hazardous wastes at government and
industrial sites. ***
