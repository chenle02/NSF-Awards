The rapid prototyping of systems with unconstrained design spaces is limited by
the present need to effectively re-develop all aspects of a new system. The work
here is the first step towards reusability of subsystems and the capability to
achieve such reusability from a variety of CAD platforms and for a variety of
implementation technologies. There are several challenges to be met in achieving
the stated goal of subsystem reusability. The foremost challenge is the need to
maintain consistent and documented representations of the various modules at
various levels of design such as printed circuit boards, netlists, functional
models, behavioral models, or design specifications. Moreover, any useful
solution must be applicable to various CAD tools and environments and not
limited to one choice. The research here consists of three phases: the study of
representation models and how consistency can be maintained across various
representations, the development of subsystems according to the representation
models developed in the first phase, and the rapid development of a variety of
systems with the new approach. Existing CAD tools for system design are used
extensively, and new tools are developed largely to drive existing tools rather
than replace them.
