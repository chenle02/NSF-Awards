9617031 Keszler The objectives of this work are to prepare and study new
inorganic solids that will function as nonlinear optical (NLO) materials or as
hosts for laser and other luminescent ions and to develop an understanding of
the factors that control physical properties. Optical and thermal properties,
ionic conductivity's, and crystal structures of a new family of
noncentrosymmetric aluminum borates will be examined. The generation of new
silicate fluorides containing alkaline-earth metal atoms will provide
opportunities to realize new hosts having unique oxoanion oxide environments for
substitution of luminescent ions. A detailed understanding of the relationships
between crystal structure and optical emission characteristics of the gallium
and indium ions will be developed through optical, photoconductivity, and
nuclear magnetic resonance studies of several doped and stoichiometric compounds
in powder and single-crystal form. %%% The focus of this project is on the
preparation and characterization of novel, crystalline inorganic materials that
exhibit nonlinear optical properties or have the potential to function as hosts
for luminescent ions, including ones that can be induced to laser. The design
and synthesis of materials with the ability to manipulate light is important in
a variety of endeavors, including telecommunications, medical applications of
lasers, collision avoidance systems for automobiles, and military systems. ***
