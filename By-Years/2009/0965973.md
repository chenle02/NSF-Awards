This NSF award by the Chemical and Biological Separations program supports work
by Professors Wilfred Chen and Rachel Chen at University of California,
Riverside and Georgia Institute of Technology, respectively, to develop an
integrated platform for the extracellular secretion of affinity tagged proteins
and their non-chromatographic purification. The integration of the development
of genetically engineered capturing scaffolds with protein secretion represents
a unique effort that expands the fundamental development of protein engineering
with the implementation of purification technology.

The proposed research will provide a flexible platform for the direct
purification of mature authentic proteins from the growth medium while retaining
the high specificity of the affinity-based interaction. The integrated platform
is expected to simplify and lower the cost of protein production and can be
easily adaptable for any affinity tagged protein of interest. This research will
combine the expertise of the two PIs in order to provide a proof of concept
study for the implementation of this transformative technology for protein
purification. Moreover, graduate students participating in this research will
gain an integrated perspective of the important interfaces and synergies
connecting biochemistry, modern genetics, and process engineering.
