This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II Project will validate
the polymer infiltration/microwave pyrolysis (PIMP) process and ceramic product
whose feasibility was demonstrated in Phase I. The Phase I project demonstrated
a reduction in pyrolysis time of greater than 90%; the Phase II project will
confirm a corresponding cost reduction. During the Phase I, a strategic
partnership with a major original equipment manufacturer (OEM) was established.
The Phase II project will refine the process to produce ceramic parts for a
specific commercial application, and will validate the weight and performance
enhancements projected in Phase I. The PIMP process will be expanded to the
pilot plant scale, and with the collaboration of the OEM and a business
development specialist. Commercial applications exist for fiber-reinforced
ceramics, if they can be produced at low cost. The potential applications range
from gas-fired turbine engines for power plants and aircraft to brakes, waste
incineration and chemical production.
