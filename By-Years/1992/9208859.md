The Fellow will examine the theoretical development of thermodynamic equations
of state for surface complexes in order to determine whether the primary mode of
geochemical mass transfer is by partitioning of species between aqueous
solutions and minerals through the formation of chemical bonds at the surfaces.
Development of a thermodynamic model for surface complexes will focus on a
number of oxides and silicates. Models will then be extended to include other
classes of aqueous species and minerals and tested with available experimental
data. The Fellow has chosen to conduct her fellowship tenure at the University
of California at Berkeley.
