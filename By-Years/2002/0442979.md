The project is developing materials for an activity-oriented college algebra
course. The course addresses educational needs of pre-service teachers and the
need for better quantitative literacy among the general student population. The
materials for the course are data-driven and deepen the students' conceptual
understanding and ability to apply mathematics in real contexts. One of the
features is the inclusion of problem situations emphasizing social and economic
issues, including hunger and poverty, energy, and the environment.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is creating a learner-centered environment for
the college algebra course, and approaches taken are based on current
educational research and reforms in mathematics education. Learning is being
enhanced by the use of a mobile computer lab and Fathom Dynamic
software.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;An extensive evaluation plan and student
assessment plans are in place. Materials developed and results of the project
are being disseminated nationally. &lt;br/&gt;
