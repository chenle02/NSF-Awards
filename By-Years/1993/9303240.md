Lind will continue his investigations of the dynamics of commuting mappings and
other topics in symbolic dynamics. Lind has recently found two invariants of
Markov shifts based on spanning trees. These will be further studied. Tuncel
plans to continue his study of the structure and classifications of Markov
chains and related positivity problems. Obstructions arising from periodic
points approaching the boundary of the polytope will be studied with the aim of
using the polytope and its faces in an inductive construction. This project
involves research in ergodic theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns
understanding the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated
or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail. Under the heading "dynamics can
be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract transformations act on
smooth spaces. In this way ergodic theory makes contact with geometry in its
quest to classify flows on homogeneous spaces.
