Funds are provided to study the application of numerical methods to the solution
of time dependent flows of viscoelastic fluids. These studies are motivated by
flows occuring in industrial forming processes of polymeric materials. As
Eulerian-Lagrangian methods is utilized. An important feature of this technique
is its applicability to multi-mode fluids whose properties are characterized by
a spectrum of relaxation times. Results of numerical calculations will be
compared with experimental data, taken in industry, on how an abrubt contraction
with a Borda entry can suppress melt fracture of polyethylene during industrial
processing.
