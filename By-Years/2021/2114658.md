This Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (PRF) is directed towards the development
of a system for integrating large amounts of data using machine learning
algorithms to provide new insights into the understanding of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) in the urban atmosphere. The results of this effort are
expected to help regulatory agencies estimate emissions from non-traditional
sources of VOC in the atmosphere and improve the overall accuracy of emission
inventories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this research focus on: (1)
categorizing emitted (primary) and chemically formed (secondary) VOCs from
comprehensive measurements; (2) investigating local (vehicles, indoor, industry,
landfill, etc.) and regional (wildfire, ocean, etc.) origins of primary VOCs;
(3) identifying the dynamic and spatial hotspots of specific VOC emissions; (4)
understanding the implicit and nonlinear relationships between primary VOCs and
their secondary VOC products; and (5) the influence of environmental factors on
primary VOC degradation and secondary VOC formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
