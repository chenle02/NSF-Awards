This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of
electrochemistry. The thrust of this experimental activity is the evaluation of
fluorinated vitreous carbon materials as anodes for the electrooxidative
preparation of inorganic persulfates. The presently known electrochemical
methods for the production of these chemicals, which are used as bleaching and
oxidizing agents and as etching solutions in the electronics industry, use
platinum anodes which leads to high initial capital and operating costs,
especially since the platinum anodes are partially consumed under the extreme
conditions necessary for persulfate production. The alternative anode material
that is being evaluated in this Phase I activity is specifically fluorinated
carbon. This substance is a stabilized form of carbon which is fluorinated only
at the edge sites, grain boundaries, dislocations, and other defects, thus
rendering this carbon resistive to oxidative attack at these sites. This
research will investigate the effectiveness of the fluorination treatment in
increasing anode lifetime and lead to the definition of conditions for the
successful operation of persulfate electrosynthesis cells using these improved
anodes.
