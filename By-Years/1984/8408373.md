The 4th International Conference on Structural Safety and Reliability (ICOSSAR
'85) will be held in Kobe, Japan, in May 1985. The ICOSSAR conferences,
including the one proposed in Kobe, Japan, in 1985, are international in
participation and significance. Subjects covered in the conferences encompass
such areas as civil engineering, space structures, naval architecture and marine
engineering, nuclear power plants, mechanical engineering, and materials
science, as well as earthquake and wind engineering. U.S. participation in all
past ICOSSAR conferences has always played an important role in terms of the
organization of the conferences as well as technical contributions. Support will
be provided for the travel of a limited number of U.S. experts and specialists
in structural reliability.
