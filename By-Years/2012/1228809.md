This exploratory project is designed to identify and describe evaluations of
Professional Development in Science Teaching (PTST) interventions with the
ultimate goal of improving the quality of science instruction in elementary
school classrooms. The project will 1) identify and describe evaluations of PDST
interventions and 2) develop mechanisms and examples for systematically
reviewing, meta-evaluating, and aggregating results of these evaluations. The
focus will be on establishing a credible base of appropriate professional
development STEM evaluation reviews, developing meta-evaluation techniques, and
identifying the most appropriate strategies for determine the cumulative
effectiveness of PDST programs. In order to increase the capacity of
professional evaluators in STEM education to conduct rigorous and useful
evaluations, the project will disseminate project findings to education
researchers and evaluators, sponsors, and developers of PDST interventions
through research presentations, papers, and reports to the extent feasible.
Dissemination products will clearly communicate the
following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Methods for identifying and retrieving PDST
evaluations, as well as their limitations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2)
Characteristics of accessible PDST evaluations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Research
designs and methodologies used in PDST evaluations Suitable methods for
assessing the performance of available evaluation documents against evaluation
standards and frameworks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(4) Suitable methods for assessing
the performance and impacts of PDST intervention
