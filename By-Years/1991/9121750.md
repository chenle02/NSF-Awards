Opiod receptors of the brain are important in understanding mechanisms of
central nervous system processing of the perception of pain or discomfort. Under
a variety of conditions the numbers and sensitivity of these receptors be
regulated (up- or down- regulated to adjust the nervous system sensitivity to
these chemicals. It is unknown where these receptors are normally located or the
mechanism of their regulation, i.e., the balance between synthesis, degradation
and recycling. These studies will provide new information on the mechanism and
sites of action of pharmacological agents that may activate or alter these
receptors.
