This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on addressing
the demand for high quality, innovative, educational software that dramatically
increase the motivation to learn about mathematics, as well as the depth of
mathematics learning, in children. The objective of this effort is to
demonstrate the feasibility of the development of an educational software
product that teaches children mathematics in practical contexts relevant to
their lives. As such, the research in this Phase will be devoted to extracting
core principles of design and concepts in the literature that best lend
themselves to this endeavor, and to then developing an application framework and
subsequent specific creative content ideas to meet the objective. It is expected
that the effort will yield promising results and approaches for commercially-
viable educational software products for the teaching of mathematics. Further,
it is expected that the design techniques and process can potentially be
leveraged for the design and development of educational software products for
other domains as well.
