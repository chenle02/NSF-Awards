With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Foote of UCLA will
continue to elaborate the mechanisms of photooxidations. In addition to
investigating the details of singlet oxygen, the research group will investigate
the processes involved in the reaction of singlet oxygen with substrates such as
sulfides, dienes, alkenes, fullerenes, and organometallic compounds. The results
of this work address the effects of oxygen on materials such as coatings,
fabrics, foods, and biological materials in general. This research endeavor has
broad significance regarding degradation reactions and inhibition of degradation
reactions of substances common to man.
