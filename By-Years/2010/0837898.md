This project aims to advance understanding of how people learn in communities
where schooling has not been prevalent Most research on learning has been done
with people who have extensive experience in Western schooling, which is often
organized with a recognizable structure. Many scholars had practitioners have
turned to informal learning as a model for how to develop a broader
understanding of learning and to improve instruction.

The ultimate goal of this work is to advance understanding of how indigenous-
heritage communities' ways of learning about scientific ideas with the
expectation that findings and outcomes from this type of research may eventually
inform STEM formal and informal learning.
