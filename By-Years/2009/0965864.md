The proposed project is preparing scientists and mathematicians to enter the
workforce or pursue graduate degrees in STEM fields by supporting between 30 and
42 academically talented but financially disadvantaged undergraduates pursuing
degrees in biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, mathematical
sciences, and physics. The project is doing so by dovetailing with an existing
NSF STEP grant at the University of Central Oklahoma that aims to create a
seamless transition to university life for a cohort of incoming freshman STEM
majors during a four-week Summer Bridge program. The project is sustaining
efforts initiated with Summer Bridge initiative, providing financially
disadvantaged Bridge students with academic support that enhances faculty and
peer interactions by engaging them in a comprehensive orientation program,
effective academic advisement and tutoring, and undergraduate research.
