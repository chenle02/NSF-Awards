The objective of this proposal is to test general theories of late life - both
evolutionary and&lt;br/&gt;non-evolutionary - using fecundity. Thus far,
fecundity has been shown to plateau late in life and&lt;br/&gt;evolve according
to evolutionary theory. Alternative non-evolutionary hypotheses have not
been&lt;br/&gt;able to satisfactorily explain these results, as late-life
fecundity plateaus do not arise from&lt;br/&gt;diminished male sexual function,
nutritional effects, or mortality-rate plateaus.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
experiments will specifically test the heterogeneity and
antagonistic&lt;br/&gt;pleiotropy theories of late life, using Drosophila
melanogaster. Heterogeneity in fecundity will&lt;br/&gt;be tested by measuring
lifetime individual fecundity within a large cohort and
comparing&lt;br/&gt;fecundity patterns of females that survive to the fecundity
plateau with those that do not.&lt;br/&gt;Antagonistic pleiotropy between late-
life fecundity and early fitness will be tested using 25&lt;br/&gt;generations
of selection for earlier reproduction, followed by a comparison of late-life
fecundity&lt;br/&gt;between the early-reproducing cohorts and the original
later-reproducing cohorts.&lt;br/&gt;
