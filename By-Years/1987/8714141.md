This project is a summer seminar in applied mathematics to be held at Colorado
State University and to be sponsored by the American Mathematical Society and
the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics. The seminar will provide a
wide-ranging survey of the current major thrusts in the numerical solution of
nonlinear systems of equations. It is hoped that the participation in this
conference will furnish ideal preparation for research-level graduate students
and young researchers embarking upon careers in this area. In recent years
significant progress has been made on the numerical solution of nonlinear
systems, including: Global Newton or homotopy methods, continuation methods,
nonlinear conjugate gradient and quasi-Newton methods, piecewise linear methods,
complexity theory of certain nonlinear methods, mesh refinement and nonlinear
multigrid methods. Experts in all of these techniques will participate in this
meeting.
