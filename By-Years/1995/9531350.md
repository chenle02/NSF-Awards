9531350 Manduca The Keck Geology Consortium combines the resources of twelve
predominantly undergraduate colleges and universities to offer high-quality
projects designed to engage students and faculty in collaborative research. Two
types of projects will be offered: five-week summer projects for students who
have completed their sophomore years, and year-long projects for students who
have completed their junior years. All students will present the results of
their work at the Keck Research Symposium in Geology. Twenty sophomore and six
junior students of minority heritage and eight minority faculty will be
recruited nationally to participate in the Keck Geology Consortium program.
Students of color who participate in this program can test their interest in
geology early in their academic careers, obtain excellent credentials for
employment or further study, and become part of an extended network of students
and faculty that will aid them as they move into the professional world. Past
experience indicates that these students will continue successfully into
advanced schooling or careers in geology.
