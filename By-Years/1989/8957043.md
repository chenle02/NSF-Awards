This grant is to support a Presidential Young Investigator. The research is
focused on small solid or imiscible fluid particle immersed in another fluid,
and their interaction with each other as well as the continuous phase. The
primary interest is on the effect of inertia. The research is applicable to the
prediction of rheological properties of suspensions and emulsions, separation
processes, and the motion of cells.
