This is a proposal to continue the development of robust systems for automated
drug delivery. The emphasis is on combining technology used in chemical industry
to control multiple outputs by multiple inputs with expert systems methodology
that assesses patient state and selects initial drug infusion rate. The project
depends heavily on cross-disciplinary interaction of team members with expertise
in anesthesiology, biomedical engineering, and control engineering. The project
has the promise of advancing the technology of controlling biological systems,
and it may also eventually contribute to improved management of anesthesia.
