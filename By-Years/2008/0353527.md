This REU Site aims to reconstruct and analyze changes in demography, settlement,
and landscape use on the islands of Westray and Papay (Orkney, Scotland) over
the past 300 years or so. This period begins with a traditional, low intensity
form of agriculture combined with fishing, passes through various economic and
environmental shocks (the kelp-making boom and bust, the collapse of fisheries,
the intensification of agriculture), and culminates in the current regime of
depopulation and population aging. The project will analyze the response of
families and households to these changes using an innovative combination of
approaches from historical demography, ethnology, settlement archaeology, and
landscape history. Every summer eight undergraduates will spend eight weeks on
Westray and Papay for training and fieldwork. They will be involved in all
phases of the project, including archaeological field survey, analysis of old
vital registers and censuses, mapping and documenting abandoned farm structures,
and interviews with living informants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students
into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.
