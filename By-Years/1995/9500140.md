9500140 Bisgaard This grant provides funding to develop a theoretical foundation
for the tolerancing of mechanical and electro-mechanical products. This
foundation will be based on modern statistical theory and decision theory. It
will provide a framework that unifies technical as well as economic aspects of
the problem. Specifically the approach will take into account the inherent
variability in maunfactured products coming from raw materials, maufacturing
processes and measurement errors. In addition it will incorporate information
about the cost of functional losses coming from deviating from target
specifications, manufacturing, and inspection. It will integrate several
previous attempts to provide a foundation, including that of the Japanese
engineer Dr. Taguchi. The research plan is to build up a unified theory starting
with simple problems and increase the complexity as the ideas are tested on
practical applications in collaboration with industry. If successful, this
research will lead to a more concise language for engineering communication of
tolerance information that will avoid current ambiguities; the economic design,
manufacturing, and us of products that perform the desired function in a safe,
reliable, and predictable manner depend on clear and unambiguous tolerance
information. Moreover, the successful completion of this research will provide
engineers with scientific and mathematical tools not currently available for the
design and evaluation of the performance of tolerances. The current trend toward
computerization of engineering information and in particular the use of computer
aided design (CAD) and computer aided manufacturing (CAM) tools necessitate a
theoretical and mathematical foundation. If this research is successful many
problems with current CAD/CAM tools will be alleviated.
