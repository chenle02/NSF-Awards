This project will estimate of the long-term capacity of forest soils to
sequester atmospheric carbon under elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2).
Investigators from a small, undergraduate institution in Maine will conduct this
research at The Duke Forest in North Carolina where the Duke FACE (Free-Air CO2
Enrichment) experiment is being conducted. This FACE experiment involves
experimentally doubling atmospheric CO2 concentrations over large circular plots
in a loblolly pine forest. The forest plots have been exposed to elevated CO2
continuously since 1996 and treatments will continue through the course of the
NSF-funded soil study. The researchers will investigate processes that control
carbon storage and turnover in forest soils under current conditions and under
global projects of doubled atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The results will be
relevant to the issue of the long-term sustainability of carbon sinks in
forests. Additionally, this research will provide opportunities for
undergraduate students in biology and chemistry at Bowdoin College to
participate in important, interdisciplinary global change research, including
opportunities to attend national scientific meetings.
