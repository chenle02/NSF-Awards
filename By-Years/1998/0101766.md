The primary applied research question posed by this project is: " What is the
impact of inquiry science on student outcomes compared with the impact of other
instructional strategies and approaches?" The project will: 1) identify studies
to be included; 2) review and organize the studies into clusters; 3) code and
analyze studies within and across clusters; 4) prepare written reports and
articles and 5) disseminate findings to researchers, reformers, educators,
parents and the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
