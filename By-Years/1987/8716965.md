Deep winter convection far from land boundaries is an important process for
transferring momentum and heat between the ocean and the atmosphere on seasonal
and interannual time scales. The Gulf of Lions in the northwestern Mediterranean
is one of the very few areas in the world's oceans where direct observations of
this process can be made. In this region, deep convection occurs over a brief
time of the order of about six weeks, when it is forced by outbreaks of cold,
dry north winds known locally as the "Mistral". During the winter of 1987, the
P.I. and collaborators carried out measurements of convection in the Gulf of
Lions during one of the most intense Mistrals on record. Included were moored
current meters and acoustic current profilers, and a variety of shipboard
measurements on several cruise legs in the area. This project will support
processing, analysis, and initial publication of the results of this study.
