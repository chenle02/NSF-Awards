The PI proposes two major themes of research for the next three years. One is
the study of eigenvectors of sparse but large random graphs. Although such
eigenvectors are of both theoretical and applied interest, very few results are
rigorously known about them. The PI proposes to use techniques from Random
Matrix Theory and combinatorics to continue his investigation of spectral
properties of sparse random graphs. A particular goal will be to study the
effect of cycles in the graph on the localization/ delocalization property of
the eigenvectors. The other line of work is related to models used in
mathematical finance. Particle system models from statistical physics have been
recently successfully used to explain observed financial data and construct
portfolios that can be thought of as arbitrage opportunities with respect to the
market index. The PI proposes, on the one hand, to further study the properties
of these processes as particle systems, and on the other, collaborate with
industry groups to help them build more efficient portfolios.

The mathematics we study has the following broader impact. Random graphs and
networks are popular in diverse areas such as social networks, models for the
internet, computer vision, and number theory. Several natural optimization
problems on graphs (e.g., figuring out clusters, or ranking algorithms such as
Google PageRank) involve what are called eigenvectors of the graph. If the
network grows randomly, its eigenvectors are random, and it is of interest how
they behave. The proposed work in finance is useful in building portfolios that
gain from the presence of volatility in financial market. As such it is of great
interest to practitioners who would like to harvest growth out of market
fluctuations. The proposed research is a further study in an area which is
already being applied by portfolio managers, some of whom are in consultation
with the PI and his students.
