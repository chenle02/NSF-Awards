This award supports the research of Professor A. Zelevinsky to work in
combinatorics. He intends to investigate problems arising from the study of
Aomoto-Gelfand hypergeometric functions and their generalizations. Applications
to classical elimination theory, real algebraic geometry, Chow varieties,
Grobner bases and matroids will also be considered. The research is in the
general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods
to study how discrete collections of objects can be organized. And, so it is
extremely important to modern communications, for example the design of large
networks as in telephone systems and the design of algorithms in computer
science.
