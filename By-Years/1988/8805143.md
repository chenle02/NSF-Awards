This proposal requests funds for the purchase of a scanning electron microscope
with x-ray microanalysis attachment. The microscope will be part of the Electron
Microscopy Center which provides ultrastructural research facilities for users
from almost every science department, institute, and college, including the
College of Engineering and Departments of Biology, Chemistry, and Geology.
Primary users are from the Departments of Biology/Marine Science, Geology, and
Physics and the College of Engineering. The principal investigators, Director of
the Electron Microscopy Center, has a productive research record. The user
group, a number of whom have NSF grants, is also quite productive. Support is
recommended.
