This project will explore the synthesis of metal-matrix nanoparticle composites
using solidification processes, including stir mixing technique. In the
synthesis of the composites using the stir mixing process, there will be
uncertainties such as difficulty in the introduction and dispersion of nanosize
particles, increase in viscosity in melts due to high surface area of nanosize
particles, and flotation/sedimentation velocities of nanosize particles. The
incorporation of nanoparticles can lead to metal-matrix nanocomposites with
improved mechanical properties, including high strength, high fatigue and high
creep properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, mixing technologies
will be developed to mix nanosize particles in aluminum melts, and optimum
solidification process will be identified for obtaining a uniform distribution
of nanosize particles in cast materials. Mixing conditions, including feeding
rate of nanosize particles, stirrer speed, particle volume fraction, wetting
agent, ultrasonic energy, and melt temperature will be optimized for a uniform
distribution of nanosize particles. The fluidity of a melt containing nanosize
particles and velocities of flotation or settling of nanosize particle will also
be determined from the final distribution of the particles in the melt and in
the matrix. The solidified microstructure and the distribution of nanoparticles
in the matrix will be analyzed to understand nucleation and growth behavior in
the presence of nanosize particles. Selected properties, including the density,
modulus and compressive properties will be measured related to processing
variables. It is anticipated that the results of this work can lead to
technology transfer for nanocomposite castings.&lt;br/&gt;
