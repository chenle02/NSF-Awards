This proposal requests funds to support the Seminar on Stochastic Processes 2008
to be held April, 3-5, 2008 at the University of Delaware. These seminars have
been held annually since 1981; they have become one of the most important
regular conference series for probabilists in North America, also reaching far
beyond the limits of the North American continent in attracting participants.
Each seminar brings together a diverse group of accomplished researchers and
young investigators in probability and stochastic processes. The primary goal is
to provide a platform for the dissemination of the most recent significant
progress in research, and to enable participants to discuss their work in an
informal atmosphere. For this purpose, there are five invited speakers,
successful young researchers as well as accomplished senior researchers, who
lecture on the latest developments in the field during the morning sessions. The
list of past invited speakers is a "Who is Who" in the world of probability
today. The afternoon sessions give graduate students and young researchers a
unique opportunity to expose themselves to the most recent research trends by
engaging in high level open discussions, and by offering them the opportunity to
present their own research to leaders in their field in an informal setting. The
synergy made possible by this original formula is very rarely found in more
traditional meetings. Financial support to attend the conference will
preferentially be given to graduate students, postdocs, women and minorities as
well as junior faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend the conference.
