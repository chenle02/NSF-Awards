9730351 Gould A network of automated telescopes that can be controlled from the
classroom may greatly enhance the teaching of middle and high school physical
and Earth science. The investigations emphasize practical understanding of core
concepts of motion, light and color, thermodynamics, and size and shape.
Students guide the telescopes and have ownership of the images and data
provided. They are encouraged to engage in inquiry-driven student projects share
data, enter into informal collaborations among students and between students and
scientists, and communicate and publish their results. The investigations move
teachers toward more effective practice by engaging them in discovery-based
activities with their students. Curriculum developers learn about effective use
of on-line scientific instruments and collaborations. Evaluation determines the
changes in students' learning and teacher practice.
