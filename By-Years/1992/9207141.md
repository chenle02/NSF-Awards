This Research Planning Grant is to investigate the relationship between uplift
and exhumation in the Northwest Himalayas, Fieldwork will consist of obtaining
gravity data across the Nanga Parbat-Haramosh Massif of northern Pakistan. These
data will be used in conjunction with mathematical models to investigate
dynamically consistent controls on exhumation and pressure- temperature-time
paths.
