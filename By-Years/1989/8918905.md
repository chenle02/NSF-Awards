Peridotites and dunites are rocks that are found only rarely in the ocean
basins and are thought to come from the mantle below the ocean crust and to be
an important component in the genesis of the crust. This project will study the
petrology and geochemistry of peridotites obtained from the Kane fracture zone
in the North Atlantic. The petrology of abyssal dunites will be studied to
determine the amount of interaction of ascending magmas with the ocean crust and
the implications for the chemistry of the upper mantle.
