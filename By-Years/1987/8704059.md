Constitutive Potassium Transport Systems in E. coli: Several constitutive
potassium transport systems of the Gram- negative bacterium,-Escherichia coli,
will be analyzed. The analysis of the moderate affinity Trk system will include
determination of the four genes implicated in that stystem but not yet
sequenced. The subcellular location of the gene products and interactions among
these proteins will be defined. Residual potassium transport activity in mutants
lacking Trk will be the subject of genetic analysis. Major systems of potassium
efflux will be identified by mutational analysis. After the systems are
identified, their protein components, kinetics and regulation will be
deterimined. The results of this research should increase our understanding of
the mechanisms and regulation of all ways that potassium homeostasis is
maintained in E. coli. It is not unreasonable to assume that the patterns,
mechanisms and principles discovered in bacteria will be useful in understanding
similarities in other cells with walls such as plant cells. Moreover, because
the high affinity Kdp transport system is homologous to transport ATPases of
higher eucaryotes the results should be instructive for the bioenergetics of
mammalian systems.
