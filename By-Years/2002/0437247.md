The goal of this investigation is to perform a definitive study of the various
mesospheric bore phenomena, combining analysis of multiple layer airglow
observations with modeling in order to evaluate existing theories. Mesospheric
bores are sharp airglow fronts observed by imaging systems at several locations.
They are characterized by small-scale waves tracking behind the sharp onset of a
large-scale front as seen in all-sky camera photographs. These features are
called mesospheric bores because of their resemblance to tidal bores in river
channels. Current theories are that mesospheric bores are nonlinear structures
propagating within a thermal inversion layer, but confirmation of these ideas
require observations of airglow layers with simultaneous temperature and/or wind
vertical profile data available. This investigation includes data analysis from
multiple instruments, including airglow imagers, lidar, and meteor radar, all of
which are currently operating on Maui as part of the Maui-Middle Atmosphere
Lower Thermosphere campaign. The study consists of a four-part approach: 1.
Analyze data from multiple instruments to look for correlation between bores and
thermal inversion layers or wind shears; potential guiding structures for bore
propagation. 2. Model airglow response using 2-D chemistry & 2-D time-dependent
dynamics models to explore the airglow response to ducted gravity waves, and in
turn, the geographical and vertical coupling relationships which may exist. 3.
Analyze new bore events, including, inverse bores, bore trains, and crossing
bores. 4. Maintain airglow database for bore analysis. By combining the analysis
of experimental data with modeling and theory, the study will yield important
information on the morphology and dynamics of the mesospheric bores, their
effects on the background flow, and their effects on energy deposition in other
regions.
