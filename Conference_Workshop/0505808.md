A conference titled ``Geometric and Probabilistic Methods in Group Theory and
Dynamical Systems'' is planned as a concluding event for the ``Special Year 2005
- Asymptotic Group Invariants and their Applications'' organized at Texas A&M
University. The wealth of ideas and applications related to the study of
asymptotic invariants of infinite finitely generated groups is immense and it
touches upon many different areas of considerable current interest.

The Conference will bring together people of various backgrounds and interests
and provide an outlet for exchange of ideas, information and discussion of the
most significant open problems relating the various areas involved. It will
showcase the recent advances and achievements, provide strong momentum and set
directions for further research. The list of invited speakers that tentatively
confirmed their participation includes Baumslag, Bestvina, Bridson, Diaconis,
Farb, Ghys, Gordon, Guentner, Kapovich, A. Katok, S. Katok, Lubotzky, Mozes,
Olshanskii, Popa, Reid, Saloff-Coste, Sapir, Shlyakhtenko, Vogtmann, and
Zelmanov. The organizers will make deliberate efforts to bring graduate students
and researchers in early stages of their career to the Conference and will
reserve talk slots for such participants. The mixture of participants ranging
from the world's most established researchers in the areas related to the
conference topic(s) to young researchers in early stages of their careers and
graduate students will provide a sense of community and continuity and will add
an important mentoring and role model component to the event.
