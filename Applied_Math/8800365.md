This research will investigate the normal modes of fluid motion in a rotating
spheroid when the fluid is both stratified and subject to a magnetic field. The
mathematical model allows important physical effects to be isolated. Results
will contibute insights which should be helpful in interpreting graphically
displayed solutions of complicated numerical calculations. This work will
contribute to an understanding of oscillations in the earth's fluid core. It
will thus advance both the mathematical theory of waves and geophysical fliud
dynamics.
