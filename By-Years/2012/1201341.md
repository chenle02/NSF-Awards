This project concerns a number of open questions in non-archimedean dynamics, a
field bridging the interface between number theory and traditional (archimedean)
dynamical systems. In the past ten years, it has become clear that Berkovich
spaces, a certain class of technical objects in non-archimedean analysis, are
essential for the non-archimedean theory. In particular, the construction of a
probability measure invariant under the dynamical system requires the use of
Berkovich spaces. Also in the past decade, our understanding of ramification of
functions on Berkovich spaces has grown, and with it has grown our ability to
apply the existence of invariant measures to certain problems in non-archimedean
dynamics. In addition, the use of one-parameter families has been used to great
effect in constructing pathological examples of non-archimedean dynamical
systems. Using all these newly available tools in tandem, the PI plans to study
several open questions that have resisted previous less sophisticated attacks.
The proposal draws on tools from both complex dynamics and non-archimedean
analysis, and the problems to be studied have applications to the theory of
arithmetic dynamics over global fields and hence to certain problems in
Diophantine geometry.

This project joins together the very different realms of dynamical systems and
of number theory. On the one hand, non-archimedean dynamics is a subfield of
arithmetic dynamics, which concerns a particular class of Diophantine geometry
problems. Such problems, i.e., understanding the set of rational number
solutions to a naturally arising set of polynomial equations, have been a major
theme in number theory from the ancient Greeks through Fermat and into the
present day. On the other hand, the study of dynamical systems, and especially
of complex dynamics, has arisen far more recently, exhibiting not only a purely
mathematical beauty but also spectacular computer drawings of fractals and
related sets. This project's proposed study of non-archimedean dynamics thus
draws on, builds on, and joins together both fields, the ancient and modern
alike. In addition, as in two earlier successful projects, the PI plans to
supervise some students in an REU summer research project to aid in their
mathematical training. Depending on the interest of the students, the REU may
involve some intensive computer computations to generate interesting examples;
if so, any relevant data generated will be published or posted on the web, for
the benefit of the larger research community. Naturally, any results will also
be disseminated via websites such as ArXiv and publication in mathematical
journals. In addition, the PI is currently writing a graduate-level textbook on
dynamics in one non-archimedean variable, as the field has too few expository
texts today.
