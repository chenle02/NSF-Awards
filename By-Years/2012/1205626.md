MASON is an open source massive multiagent simulation toolkit, that is, a set of
software tools designed to make it easy to build simulations of large numbers of
agents -- robots, people, organizations, animals, etc. -- interacting with one
another in a complex fashion. Such toolkits are used by scientists to model
everything from schools of fish, to swarms of flying robots, to the rise of
historic trade routes in Asia. These kinds of models are becoming increasing
popular both in the scientific and engineering communities as computer power is
enabling the study of large numbers of "agents" to interact with one another in
interesting and nontrivial ways. MASON is considered to lie at the "high
performance" end of software of this type: it runs on everything from laptops to
supercomputers. As such it has become a popular tool for simulating thousands,
even potentially millions of agents interacting with one another. MASON is now
at a turning point in its development. Models are being developed which are
pushing it to its limits, MASON's complexity is proving daunting to newcomers,
and it is increasingly attractive to use MASON in the context of massive model
optimization. A MASON workshop is intended to solicit community and expert
feedback and input on extending and improving MASON in at least three potential
ways: 1. A massively distributed version of MASON enables the library to harness
large clusters of computers for even bigger and more costly models. 2.
Connecting MASON with Integrated Development Environments, and developing a
lightweight model development language can make it much easier for non-experts
to use MASON. 3. Integration with large-scale stochastic optimization toolkits
enables scientists to use MASON as a kind of modeler's assistant: the modeler
specifies the high-level rules he believes to be true or wishes to test, and
provides an assessment procedure for model output, and then the optimizer
proceeds to "fill in the gaps", hunting for the remaining model rules which
produce models which optimize this assessment procedure. Similar tools enable
sweeps of model parameters. Output from the workshop will go towards development
of a community-based plan and methodology to improve MASON in these and other
aspects.

Tools and techniques like MASON are having an increasing and unusually broad
impact on society at large: they're used in large economic and financial models,
social models of terrorist networks, game development and special effects, air
traffic control, and ecological models ranging from coral reef damage to the
impacts of climate change.
