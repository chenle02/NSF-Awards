9632712 Tarn International travel support is provided by the National Science
Foundation to attend the IARP Workshop on Subsea Robotics to be held in Toulon,
France, March 27-29, 1996. Professor Tarn's functions at the workshop will be
the following: 1) to present a paper on "Dynamical Model for a Free-Floating
Underwater Robotic Vehicle with Multiple Robotic Manipulators", and 2) as an
IARP representative to the workshop from the United States. His paper is the
first attempt to obtain an analytical model for an undersea vehicle with many
robot-arms in the field of underwater robotics. His presence at the workshop
will undoubtedly facilitate international cooperation and fertilization of ideas
on advanced research in the field of robotics. ***
