9634255 Ilic Electric power systems in the United States and many other parts of
the world are undergoing drastic restructuring. The trend is toward deregulating
an industry that has traditionally been a regulated monopoly to allow for
economic competition. Much confusion arises in discussing technical and economic
concepts supporting the two extremes of industry structure. At one extreme, some
advocate preserving and building upon the present technical framework and
standards for operating an interconnected system while yet accommodating
competitive non-utility-owned generation. At the other extreme are those who
believe electric power systems should be restructured based entirely on economic
competition. A change of thinking is needed in both engineering and economic
circles to put the debate in a meaningful framework, which is essential for
ensuring that, whichever industry structure prevails, basic principles of
technical operation as well as the free market economy are met. This is a tall
order for researchers concerned with large dynamic electric power systems. The
issues are system-theoretic in their basic nature. True, researchers with a
strong back-ground in large systems could identify many new theoretical issues
and their solutions within the context of existing problems directly relevant to
the power industry. But in order to avoid technical assumptions that may not
hold in all cases, one needs a systematic framework for posing these problems.
In this project, we will use much of our acquired knowledge as the starting
point to further study the problems of hierarchical controls in a changing
electric power industry. In what follows, we describe the importance of the
envisioned control structures in a changing industry, and propose several
specific problems that will be studied. ***
