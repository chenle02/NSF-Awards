This is a project to build a mesh multiprocessor, in which memory busses run
along the rows and columns. A dual-ported memory at each grid point in the
square mesh is connected to its row bus and its column bus. There is one
processor for each element of the main diagonal, which can be connected either
to its row or its column. The multiprocessor is to be used in image processing,
and may also have some application to the matrix computations used for
simulating neural networks.
