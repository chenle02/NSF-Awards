The principal investigators will study problems in geometric analysis that arise
in the calculus of variations and mathematical physics. These problems include
the motion of level sets by mean curvature, existence of multivortices of the
electroweak theory in a periodic cell, and boundary value problems for surfaces
of constant Gauss curvature. In addition they will study various problems
associated with minimal surfaces such as rigidity and symmetry loss for periodic
minimal surfaces. Many problems in mathematical physics may be framed in terms
of a minimization problem. For example, given a closed curve in space one might
want to find a surface with average curvature equal to zero and which has the
given curve as its boundary. This problem may be restated as the problem of
finding the surface of minimum area with the given curve as boundary. Such a
surface occurs in a physical setting as a bubble, for example, a soap bubble.
This type of problem is known as a variational problem. The principal
investigators will study these problems using techniques from analysis and
geometry.
