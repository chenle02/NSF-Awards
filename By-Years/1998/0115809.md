EIA-0115809&lt;br/&gt;Thomas A. DeFanti&lt;br/&gt;University of Illinois at
Chicago&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MRI: Development of Instrumentation for AGAVE: the
Access Grid Autostereo Virtual Environment &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a
proposal for instrumentation development under the Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) program to support research and student training in tele-
immersion technologies for a networked, collaborative virtual-reality
environment. The focus is on AGAVE, a tiled, high-resolution autostereo display
that integrates well with very-high-speed networks. &lt;br/&gt;
