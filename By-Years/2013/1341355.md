This award provides funding to Hampton University to continue a program that
aims to increase the number of students, particularly under-represented minority
students, electing careers in aquatic sciences. The program recruits minority
students and REU students, faculty and professionals interested in aquatic
sciences, as well as faculty working at Historically Minority Colleges and
Universities (HMCU). Participants received a free membership in the Association
for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) and support to attend the
annual meetings and special pre-meeting workshops that focus on current
oceanographic or limnology research and on career advancement in the sciences.
The present proposal will cultivate the development of past participants and
incorporate new cohorts of students.
