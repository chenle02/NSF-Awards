A two-part study of tropical plant species related to potatoes, emphasizing
questions of phylogenetic relationship and processes of evolutionary change,
will be conducted by Drs. Greg Anderson and Robert Jansen of the University of
Connecticut. They will generate a large data set of characters pertaining to
chloroplast DNA and nuclear ribosomal DNA. These and other data will be used to
construct a tree or cladogram of putative genealogical relationships of Solanum
section Basarthrum species. A second series of studies will provide data bearing
on hypothesized mechanisms of evolutionary change, data from morphology,
breeding systems, geographical distribution, and chromosome composition. These
process-oriented studies should help in understanding how the phylogenetic
patterns were created. The studies focus upon a group of approximately 25
species that are native to the high mountains of Latin America and are closely
related to potatoes. The group also includes the "pepino dulce," an Andean
species domesticated for its fruit. Taxonomic relationships of the pepino are
unclear and its origin unknown; thus, the study will benefit crop improvement by
locating sources of useful traits that can be incorporated into the cultivated
varieties. In addition the study will help explain the origins of dioecious
solanums, species with separate male (pollen) and female (ovule) plants, an
otherwise unusual breeding system in the genus.
