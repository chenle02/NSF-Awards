Professor Teitelbaum will work on the p-adic analytic theory of modular curves
and its arithmetic implications. He will study higher weight invariants of
modular forms, the arithmetic of Shimura varieties and the arithmetic of
Drinfeld modular curves. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic
geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number
theory and geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful -
having recently solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many
consequences are new error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both
modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
