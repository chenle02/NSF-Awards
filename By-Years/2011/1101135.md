This award will be used to support several research projects in the theory of
automorphic forms especially in the context of the Langlands program. The
projects chiefly concern the theory of both local and global theta
correspondences. Among other things, the PI intends to solve the so-called non-
vanishing problem of the theta correspondences by establishing the second term
identity of the Siegel-Weil formula in full generality and obtaining certain
expected analytic properties of local zeta integrals.

The theory of automorphic forms is one of the core themes of modern mathematics.
This is not only because it has been found one of the deepest and most beautiful
subjects, but also because it is closely connected to various areas of both pure
and applied mathematics, in particular number theory and representation theory
as well as harmonic analysis. Aside from those intellectual aspects, it should
be mentioned that this award will be used to benefit a wide range of
intellectual communities at various levels through publications and
presentations in national and international professional meetings, through
communications with researchers in related areas and other fields, and through
formal and informal educational activities such as supervising students at both
graduate and undergraduate levels.
