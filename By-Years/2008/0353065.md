The proposed project is an international partnership of interdisciplinary
archaeology, paleobiology and paleoenvironment research in the Central Aleutian
Islands, Alaska. The proposed goals of the research are to understand coupled
natural and human systems during the Holocene by exploring questions of "A) how
human cultures and behavior have been shaped by Holocene climatic, biotic and
geologic change; and B) how human cultures have used and shaped biotic
environments." The PIs propose that in order to understand the broad scope
changes occurring in the contemporary Aleutian archipelago, e.g., global
warming, decline in sea mammal and fish populations, and resultant economic
impacts, it is necessary to have comprehensive research on long-term human-
environment interactions that the proposed research on the Holocene can provide.
In addition, the PIs are proposing an innovative hands-on science education
project with Adak students, "Adak Discovery."
