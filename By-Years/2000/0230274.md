Whole-house Design through the Application of&lt;br/&gt;Multi-functional Precast
Panels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multi-functional Precast Panel (MPP)
systems for residential construction promise to advance the goals of whole house
design by providing homes that are more durable, more resistant to natural
disasters, more energy efficient, and more affordable than homes constructed
with current practices. With MPP systems, high performance precast concrete
materials comprise the structure of the house as well as the interior and
exterior finishes. Insulation is embedded within the concrete assembly where it
forms a continuous barrier to heat and moisture transfer. Utility distribution
systems including radiant heating and cooling and electrical raceways are
incorporated directly in the precast concrete panels. Energy collection is
achieved from sunlit roof surfaces. The entire system is formed in panels at a
precast manufacturing plant and shipped to the job site where the exterior of
the home can be erected on a concrete slab in a matter of days. Properly
designed manufacturing processes, reduced site labor, and the benefits of system
integration can help to keep the first cost of the home at or below the cost of
current construction while the durability and energy saving advantages can
dramatically reduce the long-term costs of ownership.&lt;br/&gt;The objectives
of the proposed research include the development of: (1) conceptual plans for
manufacturing systems for MPP systems; (2) methods for on-site assembly; (3)
designs for embedded energy collection and distribution systems; (4) detailed
estimates of the effect of MPP construction on the cost of ownership; and (5)
implementation plans for MPP technology. These objectives will be pursued in
collaboration with housing industry participants and will support the
development and deployment of an entirely new technology for the housing
industry.&lt;br/&gt;
