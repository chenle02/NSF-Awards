The applicant's research program, in general, is concerned with the study of
the behavior of polymers at the interfaces of colloid particles and applying
these studies towards the engineering of high performance colloid based
materials. Specifically his program involves developing coating materials to
cross link colloid particles to improve material mechanical strength,
theoretically modelling the behavior of polymers at interfaces, and adsorption
and adhesion of molecules to surfaces.
