During the period of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research award, the
principal investigator will complete an initial investigation of the
applicability of a unique mathematical technique based on the methods of
stochastic state-space modeling and Bayesian filtering to the prediction of
protein structural class. This research will complete a pilot study, which so
far has demonstrated that our approach is capable of correctly discriminating
more than 80% of the time between predominantly all alpha and predominantly all
beta proteins. In addition, it will allow for a proper comparison with other
methods, and a full statistical evaluation of the predicted classification
sensitivity and specificity. One of the fundamental problems in molecular
biology is that of relating a protein primary sequence to its function. The
function, whether structural or catalytic, is encoded in the protein's
structure, often in the details of the three-dimensional arrangement of amino-
acid side chains on the surface. The principal investigator is suggesting a
method of prediction of protein structural classes from protein sequence data.
His method employs stochastic modeling and Bayesian filtering.
