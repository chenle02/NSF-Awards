This award provides support for one year of funding to perform carbon-14
analyses on samples (seal skin and Adamussium colbecki shells) collected in firm
stratigraphic position within numerous raised beaches along the Scott Coast of
the western Ross Sea, Antarctica. These measurements will enable the development
of a radiocarbon chronology and will result in detailed relative sea- level
curves for five separate localities along the Scott Coast. These relative sea-
level curves will help to constrain the timing of deglaciation in the western
Ross Sea. During the last glaciation, West Antarctic ice expanded into the Ross
Sea, merged with East Antarctic ice emanating from outlet glaciers in the
Transantarctic Mountains, and extended to (or close to) the edge of the
continental shelf. With an accurate, well-constrained chronology for ice
recession in the western Ross Sea, those factors that could have triggered
deglaciation and hence may have controlled the extent of the West Antarctic ice
sheet will be able to be evaluated.
