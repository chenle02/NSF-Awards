Adaptive radiations have long been recognized as prime examples of natural
selection and speciation. To understand the processes that bring about these
radiations requires a phylogenetic reconstruction of the relationships among the
species. However, adaptive radiations usually occur extremely rapidly and
therefore traditional methods of phylogenetic reconstruction often fail. The
proposed research will investigate whether DNA sequencing of the 3'-untranslated
region of multiple genes will provide the data necessary for the phylogenetic
reconstruction of a particularly rapid adaptive radiation, that in the columbine
genus Aquilegia. After sequencing the 3' ends of expressed genes, specific PCR
primers will be designed to amplify both coding and non-coding gene regions.
These gene regions will then be sequenced for multiple species of Aquilegia and
a phylogenetic reconstruction will be made.

Understanding the processes that generate bio-diversity is essential to
understanding how bio-diversity can be maintained. Adaptive radiations represent
instances of remarkable diversification yet without information on the
evolutionary relationships of their species, little progress can be made on
understanding their origin. The proposed research will investigate a technique
that would be applicable to reconstructing relationships for a wide range of
taxa.
