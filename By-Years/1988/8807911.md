Naturally emitted nitrogen oxides are of biogeochemical significance in terms
of local nitrogen budgets and influences on atmospheric chemistry. Two of the
most important nitrogen oxides in the context are nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric
oxide (NO). Present evidence suggests that tropical soils may be primary source
of N2O on a global basis and that pastures converted from tropical forests may
be especially active sources of N2O. Because neotropical forests are being
converted to pastures on such a large scale, it is evident that the neotropical
forest- to-pasture transition is the most important kind of ecosystem in which
N2O flux measurements should be made. Much less is known about NO flux than
about N2O, but available data suggest that NO may be more important as a
naturally emitted nitrogen oxide from tropical soils than is N2O. Data strongly
indicate that NO fluxes should be measured along with N2O fluxes if tropical
soils are to be evaluated as an NOx source to the atmosphere. This research
entails field measurements of N2O and NO flux from replicated plots representing
primary forest, secondary forest, and pastures on relatively fertile alluvial
soils and relatively infertile residual soils in the Caribbean Lowlands of Costa
Rica. These measurements together with concurrent measurements of soil
properties such as H2O content and NH4+ concentration will not only provide an
estimate of annual fluxes from soils to the atmosphere, but will provide a
statistical means to screen for potential causal relations. Such multivariate
analyses will be related to field and laboratory experiments to define causal
factors driving these fluxes. The overall importance of this research derives
from two primary sources. First, the oxides of nitrogen under study are felt to
the major components of the array of atmospheric "greenhouse" gases that
contribute to global climate changes. As well, the study will yield important
fundamental information regarding the system effects of land use changes in
tropical environments. In this context it should produce significant results of
wide utility.
