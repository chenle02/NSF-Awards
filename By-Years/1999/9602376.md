TITLE: Advancing Scientific and Technological Education in American Indian
Communities This is a conference project which proposes to help promote
increased involvement of Indian people in scientific and technological areas so
as to improve the lives of native individuals and communities while also
promoting their latent creativity in scientific fields and society at large. The
intensive conference on this topic will involve national Indian organizations,
Native American community leaders and members, leading Indian scientists and
educators, and some representatives of main-stream (i.e. non-Indian) science and
technology organizations. Focused, prepared presentations at the conference will
serve to stimulate deliberations and planning by small breakout groups. Indian
college students trained in facilitating group discussions will help catalyze
those deliberations. A final plenary session will consider and integrate the
work of the small groups generating plans for partnerships of communities,
national Indian organizations, higher educational institutions, and industry.
There will be a document of the proceedings of the conference with all of the
recommendations and summaries of the presentations. The conference is expected
to be held in the fall of 1996 or spring of 1997.
