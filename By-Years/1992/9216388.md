An ultramicrotome is requested to help investigate cellular polarity and
subcompartmentation. One project uses a developmental approach to dissect the
various mechanisms that polarize the distribution of membrane proteins in
simple, transporting epithelia. Another project examines the ordered arrangement
of 3 isoforms of dynein associated with the microtubules of flagella in
Chlamydomonas. This arrangement is required for flagellar bending. Two projects
examine the polarity of the neuron. The first addresses the polarized
distribution of the 5 -tubulin isotypes presumably confers different functions
to different classes of microtubules. The second project examines the polarized
distribution of tyrosine kinases, isoforms of protein kinase C, and their
substrates. Ultramicrotomy is central to all of these projects. Standard
transmission electron microscopy is require to relate the structure of
reconstituted axonemes, or axonemes isolated from mutants with defective
flagella, with their behavior in functional assays. In the other projects,
proteins of interest will be localized by immunocytochemistry at the light level
(using immunocluorescence staining of 0.5-1.0 M frozen thin sections) or at the
electron microscopic level ( using immunogold and immunoperoxidase methods).
