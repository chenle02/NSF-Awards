9422765 Beck The purpose of this research is to develop a theoretical and
empirical foundation for the liquidity demand for money. This research extends
the investigator's previous work on the theory of the value of money. In that
work money was modelled as a call option on capital gains opportunities in
securities. Two stages of research are planned. The first is to incorporate the
liquidity value of money in a simple intertemporal general equilibrium model to
derive the liquidity demand for money function. This macroeconomic model will be
used as the basis for extensions to more realistic applications in future
research. The second stage is to estimate the money demand function implied by
the theory. Since the function changes over the range of interest rates, regime-
switching time series techniques will be investigated. Evidence will be obtained
on the validity of this theory of liquidity demand. The results of this study
will determine the feasibility of modelling the liquidity demand for money based
on this theory; they will also serve as a foundation for future research on
other applications of the option value approach to pricing liquidity. ***
