This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of electroanalytical chemistry. The thrust of this project is to
extend a theory which the principal investigators have recently developed and to
use it to compute the time-dependent behavior in response to a potential step
for electron transfer at various ultramicroelectrode geometries. The theoretical
predictions will be experimentally verified to access limitations either in
experimental design or in theoretical models. This research will significantly
aid in understanding the fundamental electrochemical behavior of microelectrodes
and will make possible more extensive utilization of these powerful
electrochemical probes. This research will also have impact on other fields
involving time-dependent multidimensional diffusion phenomena such as
chromatographic processes, biochemical reactions at localized membrane sites,
and heat transfer.
