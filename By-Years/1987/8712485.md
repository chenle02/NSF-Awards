The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is being supported to establish
a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE
is to provide meaningful hands-on research opportunities in contemporary
chemistry for outstanding undergraduate students under supervision of
experienced research chemists. The program will support 8 students for the
summer of 1987, of which almost half will be recruited from other institutions.
The research activities will include the following: o Photoelectron Photoion
Coincidence Studies of Ion Structures and Dissociation Dynamics o
Diasteroselectivity in Reactions of Organometallic Complexes o Polymer Assisted
Asymmetric Reactions o A Theoretical Study of DNA Sequence Specificity to
Alkylation
