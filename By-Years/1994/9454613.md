Multimedia-based curriculum materials have been developed to support technology
education in data acquisition, embedded systems, and multimedia and high speed
networks. These materials, which include networked laboratory manuals, text and
student exercises, are available in a modular format to facilitate their
incorporation into technology education courses at other institutions. A
significant evaluation component is included to assess the effectiveness of the
multimedia materials, especially with respect to learning outcomes for members
of underrepresented groups. Six one-week summer workshops (two each year over a
three-year period) are offered to disseminate products completed in the project
and to assist faculty to develop the capability to author effective multimedia-
based instructional materials.
