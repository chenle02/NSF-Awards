This proposal requests funds to purchase an Automated Carbonate Preparation
Device (ACPD) for attachment to a new Finnigan-MAT Delta E light stable isotope
mass spectrometer at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The ACPD will
enable large numbers of carbonate samples to be analyzed for oxygen and carbon
isotopic composition very rapidly, efficiently and with high precision. The
labortory is to be used for oxygen and carbon isotopic studies as applied to
paleoceanography/paleoclimatology/ stratigraphy; sediment diagensis;
paleoecology of mollusca; stromatolite geochemistry and isotopic changes at the
Cambrian/ Precambrian boundary; carbonatites, marine biology and other studies
on carbonate materials. The ACPD has been loaned by Finnigan-MAT until December
31,1988, at which time it must be purchased or returned. We needed to be
convinced that this system works and, thus, conducted intensive calibration and
precision tests related to a wide range of standards. These have been highy
satisfactory and we are already making extensive use of the facility which will
be crucial for our future proposed research programs.
