This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of fluorescence spectroscopy. During the tenure of this grant,
Professor Warner and his students will examine interactions between
cyclodextrins and a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) using a
suite of spectroscopic methods. %%% This research will employ infrared
spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography, and
fluorescence spectroscopy to elucidate the molecular details of complexation
between cyclodextrins and PAHs together with the ternary effects arising from
the addition of alcohols to these systems. These investigations continue work
initiated by Professor Warner at Emory University under NSF grant CHE-9001412.
The results of this research will be useful in the development of analytical
methods for naturally chiral compounds and for compounds with induced chirality.
