Mott Community College and Baker College request support from NSF for
connection of their campuses to NSFNET. MERIT is the midlevel network located in
the state of Michigan that will provide operations and network information
services. It will give the colleges a 56 thousand bits per second connection to
the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The colleges needs greater functionality and network speed to be able
to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being
able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research
will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.***//
