It is believed that the strong forces in atomic nuclei arise from even more
elementary constituents, which are known as quarks and gluons. Quarks and gluons
are well established in elementary particle physics, however, our knowledge of
the role they play for the strong nuclear force is largely unknown. This
research project will provide a microscopic understanding of the nuclear forces
on this level. The method used is computer simulations of multi- quark and
-gluon systems. The focus of the research is similar to the current experimental
efforts at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility and will complement it
in some aspects. An Infrastructure Award towards a workstation for performing
the lattice gauge calculations is being provided by the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences
Directorate.
