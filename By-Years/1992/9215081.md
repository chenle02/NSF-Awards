This proposal is for partial support of a Gordon Research Conference on Active
Phenomena in Solar System Plasmas to be held July 13-17, 1992 in Plymouth, NH.
The requested funds, including also $12,000 from the Gordon Research Conferences
and $6000 from NASA, will be utilized to support subsistence and/or travel for
invited speakers, discussion leaders, and students and others who require
financial assistance in order to attend the Conference. The biennial Gordon
Conference in Space Plasma Physics has provided an ideal informal setting since
1977 to address "hot" topics. This year's theme, active phenomena, is a crucial
topic because most solar system plasmas are not in equilibrium and thus contain
free energy which can be released rapidly. In certain regions, explosive energy
can occur; examples include solar flares, coronal mass ejections, cometary tail
disruptions, and magnetospheric substorms.
