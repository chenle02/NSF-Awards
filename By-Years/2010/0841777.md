Members of the 'worm-snail' family Vermetidae occur in temperate and tropical
seas and have developed numerous highly unusual traits, including a gregarious
cementing habit (making them important reef builders as well as nuisance species
when transported globally) and a rapid rate of gene-order change. Their colonies
also mark former sea levels, making them important indicators of sea level and
climate change. While their potential as an environmental indicator and as a
model system for studying gene order change is very high, their full potential
has not been realized because of confusion concerning species delineations and
relationships. This project uses a combined approach of morphology, molecules,
and ultrastructure to discern relationships in the group, and will provide a
stable classification, as well as new inferences about the tempo of
diversification and historical geography of these species.

The project involves extensive and interdisciplinary student training and will
provide a collaborative platform for worldwide efforts in research and
understanding of this diverse and important group of mollusks. The results will
be widely disseminated through many media to a broad range of audiences,
benefiting science education and conservation. Increased knowledge of this group
will be particularly valuable for addressing questions about invasive species
and sea level and climate changes.
