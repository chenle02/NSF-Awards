9223482 Todd A significant commercial opportunity lies in providing software
systems which take real world engineering problems, expressed in engineering
rather than mathematical terms, and convert these problems into systems of
mathematical equations. These equations may then be analyzed using the symbolic
and numerical facilities of a general purpose mathematics package. This approach
separates application specific engineering knowledge from the application
independent capabilities of general purpose mathematical software. In the last
four years, Variational Geometry has emerged as a natural and powerful language
for the expression of mechanical engineering problems; particularly, problems in
the realm of engineering mechanics. The opportunity to be addressed by this
project is to develop an engineering mechanics package which will serve to
convert a variational geometry based description of the engineering problem into
a symbolic mathematical description, which may then be analyzed inside a general
purpose mathematical package. The Phase II research will develop a prototype
system capable of accepting an engineering problem phrased in terms of
Variational Geometry and outputting a symbolic mathematics description of the
problem. ***
