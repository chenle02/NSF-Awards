9531279 Pirmez This project by researchers at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory
of Columbia University in New York will develop a high-resolution gamma-ray
logging tool for use in ocean drilling, and specifically for studies carried out
onboard JOIDES Resolution, the deep-sea drilling vessel operated on behalf of
the international partnership of the Ocean Drilling Program, of which NSF is the
lead partner. This development of improved resolution of loggilg provides a key
element for improving fine-scale correlation between recovered cores and precise
depth in section, and is of special importance to detailed studies of climate
and ocean history. It is anticipated that the new design will improve resolution
by at least a factor of 2-3 over present technology, allowing recognition of
climatically-induced cycles in the borehole in many regions where this is not
presently possible. The combined development of a "universal" downhole telemetry
system will make the system compatible with the existing shipboard logging
system on JOIDES Resolution, and the telemetry system will be compatible with
other systems, expanding the capability of JOIDES Resolution to run multiple-
tool logging experiments. ***
