Abstract ATM-9709948 Song, Jie Northern Illinois University Title: Modification
of Current Surface Models to Determine the Impact of Irrigation on Regional and
Continental Precipitation Change in a Transient Increase of CO Scenario This
proposal is for a research planning grant. In the proposed stage, the PI will 1)
collect existing micro-meteorology, hydrology, and biology data from two Long
Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites to obtain data necessary to quantify five
basic components of the land surface models and their inter- relationships, and
2) to calibrate and validate the modified land surface models with the help of
collected data. The overall goal of the proposal is to investigate the impact of
potential increase in irrigation in a transient CO2 increase scenario.
