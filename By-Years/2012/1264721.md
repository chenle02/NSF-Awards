1264721 - Prorok&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conventional culture and susceptibility
tests continue to remain the ?gold standard? for identifying pathogens in
clinical and other settings. Many new pathogen detection approaches have aimed
at replacing this standard by providing more rapid, more accurate and less
expensive detection. Very promising techniques such as PCR, surface enhanced
Raman, and others have proven adept at pathogen detection, but end users have
not warmed up to their expense, extensive sample preparation and skill set
necessary to perform them. The field continues to search for a rapid, sensitive,
and specific detection technology that is cost-effective and easy to use. The
proposed work aims to develop such a biosensor based on magnetic resonance
relaxation switching. The method leverages a large body of work involving
nanoscale contrast agents employed in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging.
The aim here is to develop a detection approach that mimics the human immune
response to an invading pathogen, the release of 109 to 1012 specific antigens
to guarantee quick contact with the pathogen. This proposed technique will
employ magnetic nanoparticle contrast agents conjugated with specific capture
agents to achieve a similar contact goal. Detection of the species will involve
monitoring the average relaxation time (T2) of water protons in the solution,
which is highly sensitive to the concentration and distribution of the magnetic
nanoparticles present. With multiple nanoparticles attaching to each individual
target species their distribution will be altered, and correspondingly, the
average proton relaxation time will change. Although, this method leverages well
established principles of NMR imaging, this measurement can be accomplished with
a simple hand-held relaxometer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Content in layman?s
terms&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will develop new ways to detect bacteria and other
pathogens in food or bodily fluids. This technology will use magnetic particles
whose magnetic properties will change in predictable ways upon binding of
bacteria. The authors envision being able to detect multiple bacteria using sets
of unique magnetic nanoparticles.
