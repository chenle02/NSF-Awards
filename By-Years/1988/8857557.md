This research is directed towards developing cost-effective screening (complete
inspection) procedures for use in automated inspection systems for high-volume
production. Several important techniques are involved, such as using screening
procedures for incoming material inspection and vendor evaluation, designing the
economic inspection precision level, and using a correlated variable in lieu of
the quality characteristic of interest in screening when the inspection on the
quality characteristic is destructive, too costly, or time consuming. The
procedures developed can be easily implemented by a microcomputer or included in
the software operating quality information equipment. Research results will be
integrated into a total quality control information and decision support system
for automated manufacturing systems.
