0130355&lt;br/&gt;Renne&lt;br/&gt;This research by an anthropologist from the
University of Michigan will examine the impact of Islamic education on the
perspectives and practices of women in Northern Nigeria. This demographic
anthropological study of married Hausa Muslim women's participation in Islamic
adult education programs in the town of Zaria, Nigeria, will report on women's
perceptions of moral conduct in social relations, and will examine women's views
of what they have gained-intellectually, socially, morally and economically-from
their attendance at Islamic education classes. The project will compare the
moral views, social and economic preferences, and aspirations for daughters of
schooled and non-schooled women through a survey of 540 women. The role of
women's education in affecting changes in marital age and health is important to
understand, as prior research shows that a mother's increased education is one
of the best predictors of gains in maternal and child health. This project's
focus on Islamic, as opposed to Western education, has wider implications as it
will advance our understanding of this relationship in a different educational
regime.&lt;br/&gt;
