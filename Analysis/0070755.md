This research involves localization type effects for ergodic Schrodinger
operators, the general study of spectra and wave functions of multidimensional
Schrodinger operators, and also of the transport phenomena of quasiperiodic
operators and two-dimensional magnetic operators in the integer quantum Hall
regime. An important objective is to develop nonperturbative methods of proving
localization type effects for Schrodinger operators with deterministic
potentials. The other goal is to study the relation between spectral and
quantum-dynamical properties and behavior of the generalized eigenfunctions,
particularly outside the localization range and in the multidimensional case.
Another goal of the proposed research is to study singular continuous spectrum
that exhibits critical behavior and/or anomalous transport, particularly for
models where it appears for critical values (or intervals) of the parameters.

The proposed research is centered around the fundamental properties of
disordered systems that serve as models of systems with impurities.
Deterministic, particularly quasiperiodic, potentials are most often used to
model quasicrystals. In order to be able to understand much of the experimental
data on quasicrystals, it is particularly important to investigate the transport
coefficients like the electrical and heat conductivities of the microscopic
models. Such an understanding is most helpful for finding new materials with
desired physical properties. This may lead to various industrial applications
(the first one nowadays being the covering of pans replacing the conventional
Tefal film). Disordered systems are also used in modeling many other micro and
macro effects: from quantum localization to earthquakes. Our research concerns
the anomalous spectral and diffusive properties of quasiperiodic and other
deterministic structures. The quantum Hall effect is since 1985 used by the
National Bureau of Standards to define the Fine Structure Constant (and hence
the electrical charge of an electron). It is still not well understood why the
experiment can be reproduced with a relative error of only $10^{-8}$. Our
research is concerned with a microscopic theory of the quantum Hall effect that
is aimed at getting deeper insights of this phenomena.
