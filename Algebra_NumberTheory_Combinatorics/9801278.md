9801278 Retakh This awards supports the 22nd conference of the University of
Arkansas Annual Lecture Series in the Mathematical Sciences. This meeting will
bring together leading experts in the fields of combinatorial methods in
algebra. It will provide a forum for an exchange of ideas as well as an
opportunity for young researchers and graduate students to interact with
prominent researchers in their areas. This conference is concerned with the use
of combinatorial methods in algebra. Such methods are being widely used in a
broad range of areas in algebra including ring theory, Lie algebras, and
algebraic geometry. This conference will bring together individuals with
different perspectives and will encourage interaction among them.
