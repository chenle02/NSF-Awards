IBN-9723798 PI: Sorensen Pheromones are molecular compounds that are detected as
odors, but produce effects like hormones in stimulating particular reproductive
behavior and physiological changes. Some insect pheromones that act attract
mates are well known, but we still do not have a case in any vertebrate species
where we know the precise identity and behavioral correlates of a pheromone.
This project continues to develop the goldfish as the first vertebrate model
system to specifically address this issue, because the goldfish shows responses
to a preovulatory pheromone with at least three steroidal components.
Behavioral, and biochemical tests are used to identify all the goldfish
pheromone components that are part of the natural mixture, the ability of the
fish to distinguish among different mixtures, and whether the natural signal is
species-specific. Electrophysiological recordings also will test whether the
pheromonal signal in the olfactory system has a distinct spatial or temporal
pattern. This model system will provide fundamental advances in our
understanding the sensory mechanisms for distinct pheromone actions, and will
have impact beyond sensory science to endocrinology, comparative physiology, and
likely lead to applications in aquaculture.
