This project is a follow on to a successful NSF-RAPID award that will carry on
an archiving of solar magnetic features maps through McIntosh Maps dating back
to 1964 and inclusion of synoptic charts from 1955-1964 from the Kodaikonal
Solar Observatory, will provide a comprehensive set covering 5 solar cycles.
This archive will be available to researchers via the NOAA's National Centers
for Environmental Information (NCEI) archiving service ensuring they will be
preserved. NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center generates McIntosh Maps, thus
the archive is highly relevant and growing. This unique archive provide a
consistent and long term view of the evolution of the global solar field and is
an important tool for improving predictive capabilities of solar activity
cycles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The maps are digitized through an IDL program with
makes plots from input FITS files. To date, maps for solar cycle 23 (1996-2009)
have been processed. The McIntosh maps from 1964-1996 will be digitized along
with H-alpha synoptic charts from (1955-1964). These were produced by at the
Kodaikonal Solar Observatory following procedures laid out by Pat McIntosh
before he began his mapping efforts in 1964. These maps contain information on a
multitude of solar magnetic features including polar crown filaments, coronal
holes and cavities, as well as active regions. This long term information is
very important for solar cycle and dynamo researchers who do long term studies
of solar climate.
