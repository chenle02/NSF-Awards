ABSTRACT Harvey Greenspan CTS-9522703 MIT This research is based on the
development of a method of centrifugal spectroscopy by which particles of any
size can be separated from a mixture and sorted according to sedimentation
velocity. The concept applies to the separation and fractionation of particles
across the size spectrum from the larger plastic beads used in technology to the
minute proteins and viral factors used encountered in bioprocessing. This final
phase of the program will encompass a three pronged approach: 1. An experiment
to examine the basic flow properties of the centrifugal spectrometer that was
developed with prior NSF support. The sorting efficiency of the device will also
be established. 2. Development of a broadly applicable numerical program for the
accurate simulation of the non-linear, axisymmetric, time-dependent motion of a
mixture in any disk stack in the centrifuge. 3. Theoretical analysis of the
flow, sediment and boundary layer instabilities and their effect on the
separation process. This fundamental research will set the stage for industrial
development of an ultra centrifuge with varied and wide spread applications.
