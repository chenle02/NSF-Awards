In 1986, the Eastern Virginia Medical School and the Norfolk Public School
System initiated a Magnet High School for the Health Professions, targeted
toward minority students. The Young Scholars Program will add a logical and
important dimension to the program by introducing the students to career
opportunities in the sciences as well as emphasize the ethics of science and
scientific method in small group problem solving conferences. The students will
also participate in research projects in the life sciences under the direction
of EVMS faculty. These research projects will be initiated during the summer
phase and continue through the academic year. Students will be expected to
continue their research laboratory experience during all three years of the
Magnet High School Program.
