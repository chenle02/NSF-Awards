&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Communicating
Research to Public Audiences (CRPA) project, the University of Missouri is
collaborating with the St. Louis Science Center on the development and
implementation of exhibits and programs related to the principal investigator?s
NSF-funded research on tissue engineering and organ printing, Understanding
Molecular Self-Assembly. The research is exploring basic research and
technologies that could provide alternatives to organ donor transplants,
especially given the mismatch between the demand and supply of organs. The
exhibits will become an offering in the science center?s new life sciences
gallery whose goal is to help visitors better understand the applications of
life science research that affect people?s everyday lives.&lt;br/&gt;
