Conservation biology and population biology suffer from an almost complete lack
of information on how new populations of rare species become established. This
project will investigate the roles of dispersal and disturbance in the formation
of new populations by experimentally introducing seeds of 14 rare plant species
into numerous sites at the Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts, which
appear to be suitable for the species but where the species do not occur. The
sites will be censused in subsequent years to determine if populations of rare
species become established on these sites. Transplants of seedlings and
juveniles, exclosures and other procedures will be used to identify the stages
at which population establishment fails in certain species and sites. The
results will be important to restoration biology by developing new methods to
establish additional populations of rare species and so prevent their
extinction.
