This proposal concerns theoretical and observational studies of the effect of
large-scale convection on helioseismic oscillations. Over the past few years
this work has concentrated on solving the forward problem for the effect of
convection on heliosesmic oscillations and on performing numerical simulations
to determine the observable signature of giant-cells. The theoretical work will
concentrate on four areas: (1) investigating the numerical application of quasi-
degenerate perturbation theory so that the PI can model the heliosesmic effect
of poloidal flows such as banana cells, (2) improving the numerical simulations
with particular emphasis on developing a more realistic simulation of the source
time history, (3) attempting to produce an approximate theory that governs
nonstationary flows, and (4) investigating the application of asymptotic, ray
theoretic, and scattering theories in the hope of illuminating the inverse
problem. The recently initiated collaboration with Dr. Brown will concentrate
first on developing robust methods by which individual apparent-m modal line-
width measurements can be made. The technique will be optimized to extract the
characteristic signature of giant-cells.
