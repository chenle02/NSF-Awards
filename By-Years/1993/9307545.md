9307545 Tao This proposal describes a project to explore a new area of adaptive
control and to address open problems of urgent relevance to theory as well as
applications: adaptive control of systems consisting of a linear part and a
nonsmooth nonlinear input- output characteristic being in either an actuator or
a sensor. Typical examples of such nonlinear characteristics are dead-zone,
backlash and hysteresis. An adaptive inverse approach is proposed to control
such systems to meet desired performance specifications, which exploits an
adaptive inverse for an unknown nonlinearity and a linear controller structure
nonadaptive/adaptive for a known/unknown linear part. Choices of nonlinear
models, design of adaptive inverse control algorithms, stability, convergence
and robustness analysis, and applications will be investigated. The results of
this research will provide new tools to handle unknown nonsmooth nonlinearities
which are common in practical control systems. ***
