9706396 Coe Flood basalts are the second most significant accumulation of mafic
igneous material on the surface of the Earth, and their rate of eruption has
long been considered to be three to four orders of magnitude greater than occurs
at present-day central basaltic volcanoes. This idea depends on the assumption
that a single flow is emplaced without significant interruption. Recently it has
been proposed that such flows may have grown endogenously, that is, in a
multistage process by which lava is injected into the interior of an already
solidified flow and jacks up the top surface. If endogenous growth is a common
mechanism of emplacement, it would reduce the enormous eruption rates and
associated rapid production or storage of vast quantities of melt that are
required for single-stage emplacement of very large individual lava flows
characteristic of these provinces. Our pilot project is to test the hypothesis
of endogenous growth by determining the magnetic fabric of the Birkett flow of
the Columbia River Flood Basalts, for which field observations of interior
vesicle layers have already suggested the possibility of multistage emplacement.
Magnetic fabric analysis can detect zones where more intense shear occurred
during flow: for multistage emplacement, two or more shear boundaries should be
present inside the flow. If the vesicular layers coincide with shear boundaries,
consistent with the injection of lava after initial solidification, the stage
will be set for a larger investigation of the role of endogenous growth in
continental flood basalts.
