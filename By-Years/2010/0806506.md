Studies of Arctic vegetation change have typically been done at either the plot
level or at regional/ecosystem scales. The intermediate scales associated with
patches of individual shrubs have largely been ignored. This research will
explore patch scale dynamics of arctic shrub expansion by quantifying and
modeling the changes in shrub cover previously documented by repeat photography
for the Colville River basin. Additional historic aerial photographs of the same
sites will be acquired and the shrubs mapped to determine in more detail the
changes that have occurred over the latter half of the 20th century. The
approach relies on the spatial characteristics of the expansion as the critical
indicator of whether we understand the process. Cellular models will be
developed that rely on a set of simple rules to determine how much shrub cover
increases and if the pattern matches those patterns shown in the Colville
photos. A similar approach has been effective for modeling forest expansion at
the alpine treeline. Manipulating the strength of feedbacks between existing
vegetation and the establishment probabilities of new shrubs will be used to
develop plausible hypotheses to guide future experimental research. Although the
controls on establishment and expansion in this version of the model are
relatively simple and not explicitly based on the biogeochemical processes that
are thought to be the key controls on shrub growth in the Arctic, the model
produced here can easily be modified in the future to include these processes
more explicitly once the patch level controls are
known.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The model that will be created is a very simple
stochastic cellular model that is spatially explicit. The model will use a
logistic growth model and place the new shrubs on the landscape in ways that
test the importance of different types of reproduction and with different
feedback strengths. This project will expand significantly what we are currently
able to learn from the repeat photo pairs and serve as a crucial link between
the plot and ecosystem scales that currently characterize research on this
topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
