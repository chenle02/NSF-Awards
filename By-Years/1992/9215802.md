The goal of this research is to understand how microscopic interactions such as
bonding, electronic states, order-disorder, vibrational density of states affect
macroscopic properties (bulk thermodynamics) in complex inorganic systems,
mainly crystalline oxides, perovskite, ilmenite and lithium niobate structures.
High- temperature reaction calorimetry and structural and spectroscopic tools
are used to explore why given structures exist. Emphasis will be placed on the
energetics of the metastable materials, both crystalline and amorphous, and on
radiation damaged and mechanically damaged materials. Ceramic processing will be
examined as well from the point of view of energetics of intermediate phases
formed.
