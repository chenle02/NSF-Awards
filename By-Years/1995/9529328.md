AST-9529328 Martin Weinberg Excitation and Evolution of Structure in Galactic
Halos and Disks. Dr. Weinberg will study the dynamics of galaxies with active
halos. More specifically he will examine the nature and excitation of long-lived
perturbation modes in halos, the influence of an excited halo on an embedded
disk, and long-lived modes in disks and their effects on parent halos. The
research will use a closely coupled combination of perturbation theory and
N-body methods. The PI plans to make his numerical codes available to the
community at theend of the project.
