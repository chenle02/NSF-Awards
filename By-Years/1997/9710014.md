This collaborative research team employs computational and mathematical models
to improve an understanding of the nature and performance of decentralized
political systems. The project has two principal goals. The first is to
understand better the advantages and disadvantages of different institutional
arrangements in federal political systems. More specifically, the investigators
study the effects of different degrees of power-sharing and coordination among
central and local governments. The methodological goal is to continue extending
and analyzing computational models as a methodology in political science and the
social sciences in general. In federal systems, there are several layers of
institutions, including those in the central government, those that specify
relations between the central government and local governments, and those that
decide policies at the local level. The basic idea behind the project is that a
federal system as a whole (a country or an international organization like the
European Union) can benefit when local jurisdictions develop innovative
policies, yet incentives for policy experimentation are not independent of
institutions set up at the system-wide level or at the local level. The
researchers analyze closely models that incorporate institutions resembling
those in two federal systems, the United States and the European Union.
