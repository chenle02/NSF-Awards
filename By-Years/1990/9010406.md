Research is on high level synthesis tools that translate a program-like
behavioral description into a design suitable for implementation. The tools must
meet designer constraints, especially timing constraints, while producing high
quality designs. The research is being done in three phases. First, algorithms
are being developed to produce an initial schedule that meets timing
constraints, thus providing a starting point for the synthesis process. Second,
a new framework is being developed for synthesis and design exploration using
simulated annealing. The framework represents scheduling and allocation
decisions and provides a set of moves that will modify designs while maintaining
all timing constraints. Third, it is planned to expand the framework to
incorporate physical design information and to provide a bridge to logic
synthesis tools.
