The University of Maryland Baltimore County has been given a grant to engage
collaborative student teams (comprising Biologists and Computer Scientists) in
developing integrated, web-based software improving algorithms for homology
detection, optimizing synthetic gene design and predicting protein structure
from sequence data. The software will generate detailed predictions of (i) the
relative rates at which amino acids interchange over evolutionary time; (ii) the
optimal encoding of any given gene within any given genome; and (iii) the a
priori reasons why patterns of synonymous codon usage vary within genes
according to the protein secondary structures that they encode. The toolkit will
use computing techniques such as integrated XML data objects constructed by CGI
query of specialized databases and SOAP wrapper integration of modular
algorithms delivered as web services.
