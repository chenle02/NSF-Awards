*** 96-61335 Spiegelberg This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I program
will develop an affordable instrument for measuring normal forces in polymeric
materials subjected to simple shearing flows. Rheological characterization, or
the flow behavior of a material, provides essential information both about the
chemical structure of a polymeric material and about the desirable processing
conditions. A polymeric material subjected to a simple shear flow will exert a
force in the direction normal to the flow direction, which is a direct
measurement of the elasticity of the material. Only two companies produce a
rheometer capable of measuring quantitative normal forces, and these retail for
close to $100,000. This firm proposes to use affordable OEM force transducer
technology to construct a normal force device for integration with existing
shear rheometers without normal force capability, making use of the precision
motors and controllers in these units. A second stand-alone rheometer will be
constructed with its own drive motor for those without a shear rheometer. The
application of the technology to on-line measurements in a process flow line
will be examined. It is anticipated that the add-on unit will retail for less
than $10,000. *** ??
