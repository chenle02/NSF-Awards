The investigation of fractal formation is currently dominated by theory and
computer simulation. An experimental study is proposed to document those
conditions under which self-affine fractal structures result, and to prepare
surfaces of varying fractal dimension. Three deposition parameters will be
varied: deposition rate, substrate temperature and deposition material. Three
experimental techniques for measuring fractal dimension will be carried out:
Nitrogen (77 K) isotherms, adsorption by adsorbates of various sizes, and small
angle x-ray scattering. Future studies of the superfluid onset of He adsorbates
and interfacial friction are planned.
