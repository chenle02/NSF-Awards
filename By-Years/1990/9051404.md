Most chemical engineers have no required exposure to non- traditional areas.
However, there is a growing need for biochemical engineers and many graduates
will find themselves working on bioprocess related problems. The addition of new
equipment will provide for bio-related experiments in the required chemical
engineering laboratory and the process control course insuring that all students
have minimal exposure to bioprocessing. Further, the same equipment can be used
to supplement elective courses in biochemical engineering such as bio process
engineering and controlled cultivation of cells Bioprocess engineering is an
emerging filed for which no suitable educational infrastructure currently
exists. This equipment will develop a model, which if successful, will be
emulated by many other chemical engineering departments.
