9452407 Coler The proposed project will establish a CAD Lab for the Drafting and
Design Program as well as the Electronics, Manufacturing Engineering Technology
and Automation/Robotics. Students will benefit significantly from increased
learning opportunities due to three key aspects of the project; (1) advanced
computer aided design capabilities, (2) the networking of computers, and (3) the
interdisciplinary laboratory experiments. The equipment requested, fifteen (15)
80486DX33 System Unit computers, fifteen (15) Autocad Rel 12 software packages,
Softdesk software, and Novell Network software will be utilized with current
equipment to establish a drafting and design laboratory capable of replicating
advanced industry level design experiences. In the CAD Lab, students will be
able to solve problems related to manufacturing tolerancing, part fit, and
dimensioning factors which cannot be taught with manual or two-dimensional
techniques due to the tedious, repetitive nature of those methods. Students will
spend more of their time on problem solving and projects requiring critical
analysis and utilization of design principles. Networking the equipment will
increase each student's access to design information and enhance opportunities
for teamwork in the design process. In addition, the project proposes innovative
experiments, incorporating equipment from other related programs, that offer
students the opportunity for interdisciplinary cooperation in the production
process. Thus, the proposed laboratory improvement would both upgrade the
education of technical students in the disciplines affected by the project and
prepare a model for interdisciplinary curricula for other colleges.
