This project will integrate GLOBE activities sponsored by the Los Angeles
Unified School District (LAUSD) with environmental research projects at UCLA's
Institute of the Environment. A research program in air quality and human
exposure that utilizes GLOBE data collected at LAUSD schools will be created. In
addition, an innovative teacher training program will be implemented that
reflects GLOBE research themes and includes new professional development
extension courses offered by UCLA. Advanced placement environmental science
courses that reflect GLOBE protocols will be established in a number of low
socio-economic status schools in the Los Angeles area.
