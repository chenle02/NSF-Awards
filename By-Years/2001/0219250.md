ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Synergistic Effects of Multiple Environments on Composite
Degradation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project employs an integrated approach to
assess the long-term durability of polymer matrix composites exposed to complex
multiple environments. Degradation conditions are simulated using several
simultaneously operating environments to closely parallel real-world conditions,
and the kinetics of main degradation mechanisms and their interrelations are
identified through an extensive multi-disciplinary analysis. Finally,
comprehensive experimental characterizations (mechanical, chemical and physical)
of the degradation mechanisms across multiple length scales (nano to macro) are
coupled with sophisticated analytical/numerical techniques to develop predictive
models of long-term reliability. By integrating life-prediction methodologies
and the appropriate kinetic descriptions of physicochemical degradation, this
project provides predictive capabilities for the service life of composite
materials in real-world, multiple environmental conditions, e.g. composite
material retrofit and replacement of structurally deficient bridges, all-
composite automobiles with enhanced fuel-efficiencies and deep-water offshore
oil drilling platforms.&lt;br/&gt; This project involves active collaboration
with industrial partners (Cytec Engineered Materials, Inc. and Resolution
Performance Products, Inc.) and support from research/federal agencies
(Brookhaven National Labs and Army Research Labs at Aberdeen Proving Grounds).
An educational component provides for the significant enhancement of learning
for both undergraduate and graduate students by integration of research and
teaching. Specific activities also provide mentoring and outreach for
underrepresented minority students in collaboration with other programs at Stony
Brook.&lt;br/&gt;
