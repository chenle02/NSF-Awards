Many problems in science today require the analysis of massive datasets.
&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the fundamental problem of extracting
latent hidden regularities from high-dimensional scientific data sets,
specifically from two different types of spectroscopic measurements -- three-
dimensional hyperspectral imaging used in remote sensing of the Earth and other
planets, and one-dimensional spectral signals arising from chemical analyses
from laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), such as used currently by the
Curiosity rover on Mars. The project is applying recent advances in deep
learning, optimization, and machine learning to practical real-world scientific
applications involving the analysis of materials from Earth and outer space,
such as Mars, as well as the mapping of Martian and terrestrial surfaces through
hyperspectral imagery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep learning uses multi-layer
neural networks to construct a hierarchy of latent representations of high-
dimensional datasets. This project designs novel architectures and algorithms
for deep learning, and applies them to spectroscopic domains, such as LIBS and
hyperspectral imaging. Three challenges from spectroscopic domains guide the
research. First, in many applications such as the Curiosity rover on Mars, the
number of available LIBS spectra are limited as it requires an active sensing
operation followed by transmission of data by a robot situated millions of miles
from Earth. A further challenge is that data from Mars is inherently unlabeled,
and instrumental variations and terrain variations between Earth and Mars
require solving a key transfer learning problem. For hyperspectral imaging, the
project is extending work on deep learning applied to two-dimensional images to
data that involves two spatial dimensions as well as the third spectral
dimension, where images are recorded at multiple wavelengths. This project
explores a variety of ways of designing new convolutional neural networks and
other approaches that can effectively exploit the third spectral dimension.
