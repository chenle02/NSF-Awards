Majority of the research results in the field of wireless sensor networking have
been substantiated mostly through simulations and empirical measurements, as is
common in traditional networking research. For efficient design, in terms of
latency, energy, robustness, etc., models that abstract node hardware and the
network characteristics are needed for systematic algorithm design and analysis.
The proposed work will demonstrate that models of computation for sensor
networks (from a parallel and distributed systems' perspective) will create a
modular, layered paradigm for application development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit of this research is the development of computation models and
robust, adaptive, energy-efficient collaborative algorithms for computation and
communication in wireless sensor networks. High-level models will allow
designers to make informed decisions regarding energy and time tradeoffs, and
robustness at the node and network level - eliminating most of the ad-hoc-ness
in application design for sensor networks. The benefits of our approach will be
demonstrated on two classes of end-to-end applications. Highly optimized
computation and communication kernels for information dissemination in sensor
networks, and distributed image processing will be
developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this work is in
understanding, modeling, and exploiting sensor networks as a computing substrate
- not just a loose federation of nodes equipped with sensors, processors, and
radios. We expect this to lead towards a new discipline for programming sensor
networks by providing the application developer with high-level technology-
independent 'knobs' for analysis and performance optimization. A direct
educational impact of the proposed activity will be the introduction of new
curriculum in academia to impart knowledge on algorithm design for sensor
networks.
