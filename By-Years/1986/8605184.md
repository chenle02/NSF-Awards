Current practice in earthquake engineering is to model earthquake- induced
strong ground motions as accelerations occurring at single locations; or at most
to use simple physical wave propagation models employing simple waveforms. This
research program will develop a description of the spatial variation of
earthquake ground motions that models observed motions, using data from strong-
motion seismograph arrays. In addition, the effects of these spatial variations
in ground motion on the response of structures will be studied. The
investigation will utilize digital signal processing techniques, simulation of
correlated multiple excitations, random vibration analysis, and deterministic
dynamic analysis. The research has direct application to the design of
structures on large foundations, such as dams and containment structures for
nuclear power plants; to spatially extended structures with multiple supports
such as occurs in long-span bridges and surface pipelines; and to long buried
structures, including electric power, telecommunication, oil, gas, water and
sewage lifelines. The principal investigator is highly qualified and has the
institutional facilities available to undertake the proposed research program.
