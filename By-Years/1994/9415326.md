9415326 Sullivan This minority career advancement award supports mathematical
research on applications of linear codes to organizing and classifying designs.
The work focuses mainly on the mathematics of the codes themselves, less on the
designs. Originally work of this type revolved around Steiner systems, in
particular Steiner Triple and Quadruple systems and their corresponding binary
codes. This work leads to consideration of weight-one vectors adjoined to the
binary code of a projective geometry. It is conjectured that the new system is
again a Steiner triple system. While this is expected to be worked out soon,
there is further work to be done on the extension of this conjecture to
extensions where more than one element is involved. Work will also be done on
the question of whether all Steiner triple systems extend. This will be done by
considering a relatively new class of designs, the Bagchi-Bagchi designs. ***
