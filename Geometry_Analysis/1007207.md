Abstract

Award: DMS-1007207 Principal Investigator: Matilde Marcolli

This proposal aims at using techniques from noncommutative geometry, especially
analytic techniques based on functional analysis, operator algebras, global
analysis and index theory, to approach questions of relevance to arithmetic
geometry. The main themes covered in this proposal include: the theory of
noncommutative tori with real multiplication as a parallel for real quadratic
fields to the theory of elliptic curves with real multiplication; the use of
quantum statistical mechanical systems associated to number fields and function
fields as an approach to explicit class field theory; an application of
techniques from functional analysis and quantum statistical mechanics to the
study of the asymptotic problem for error correcting codes; the construction of
invariants of curves with p-adic uniformization from noncommutative geometry, in
terms of index theorems and spectral triples; investigating the relation between
motives and noncommutative spaces, in relation to L-functions of varieties and
motives; relating the noncommutative geometry approach to the Riemann zeta
function to arithmetic topology, matrix models, and foliated spaces;
understanding manifestations of modularity on the noncommutative boundary of
modular curves.

The project is interdisciplinary in scope, as it is aimed at exploring the
interactions between tools and techniques from noncommutative geometry and
motivating problems from number theory and arithmetic. This presents a novel
approach to classical questions of modern mathematics, where we plan on using
techniques and ideas derived from the world of quantum mechanics, statistical
mechanics, and quantum field theory. Noncommutative geometry is especially
suitable as a tool, since it was developed precisely a a geometry adapted to
quantum physics: as such, it provides a way to combine quantum mechanical ideas
and techniques with more classical algebro-geometric and number-theoretic
methods. We expect that a continuing investigation of this approach will lead to
further advances and developments within the field of noncommutative geometry
itself, by the challenge of fine tuning the available theory to fit specific
number theoretic problems, while at the same time it will provide new possible
approaches and different viewpoints on questions of number theoretic relevance.
This proposal has a strong educational components, with six graduate students
involved in various parts of the project. A network of international contacts
and collaborations will also be involved.
