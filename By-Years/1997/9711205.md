9711205 Fornes The aim of this work is to understand interactions between
macroions and small counterions. The specific focus is to measure counterion
transport in solutions of polyelectrolytes to (1) establish experimentally the
dependence of transport on linear charge density; (2) to elaborate a
comprehensive and practical model for the combined effect of electrostatic
interaction and complex formation; and (3) to determine experimentally the
effects of polyelectrolyte morphology. Charged colloids and micelles will also
be investigated, as ill the electrochemical kinetics of reduction of metal ions
bound to macroions. %%% Improving the ability to predict the behavior of natural
systems of macroions, and designing and controlling their behavior in materials
systems consisting of charged polymers, colloids, or assemblies of charged
species such as micelles are important to both nature and commerce. Examples
include the transport of nutrient ions by clay particles in plants, and the ion
binding properties of the polyelectrolyte DNA. Paints, cutting fluids, drug
delivery systems, adhesives and lubricating coatings are all examples of
important industrial uses for macroions. ***
