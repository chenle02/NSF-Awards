9360895 Dixon This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in the
general area of analytical chemistry and in the subfield of infrared
spectroscopic instrumentation. Tunable diode laser spectrometers based on lead
salt diodes are capable of measuring part per billion concentrations over an
absorption path of a few meters but require cryogenic cooling. The objective of
the Phase I research is the design of a diode-laser-based intracavity difference
frequency generator tunable in the 3.2-3.5 micrometer range. By combining the
difference frequency generator with FM modulation detection it should be
possible in Phase II studies to build a tunable diode laser spectrometer capable
at operating at room temperature rather than the cryogenic temperatures now
required. %%% High resolution diode laser spectrometers capable of operating at
room temperature are expected to find numerous applications in trace gas
detection, biomedical applications, analysis of complex gas mixtures and
industrial process monitoring and safety. ***
