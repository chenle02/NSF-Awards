This project is an interrelated theoretical and experimental work on the
kinetics of adhesion and fusion of cell-size vesicles, based on physical
chemistry and hydrodynamics of thin films. The study focuses on the similarity
between the kinetics of aggregation and coalescence of bubbles and drops in
colloid systems and the kinetics of adhesion, instability, and fusion in
membrane systems, where the specific mechanical and permeability properties of
membranes are taken into account. The rate of mutual approach of deformable
permeable membranes, the stability of films between interacting membranes, the
rate of expansion of membrane contact during adhesion, and the rate of shape
relaxation after membrane fusion are evaluated theoretically. From these
results, the total times of vesicle adhesion and fusion are calculated as a
function of the membrane tension, membrane permeability, intermembrane forces
and liquid film viscosity. The times of adhesion and fusion of cell-size
phospholipid vesicles, held by micropipettes, are measured as a function of the
vesicle membrane tensions and the concentration of ions in the water solutions
where the vesicles are placed. The theoretically calculated times of adhesion
and fusion are compared with the experimentally measured values for
phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine vesicles.
