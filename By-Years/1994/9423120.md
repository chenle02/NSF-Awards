This proposal is concerned with the interaction of the solar wind, or other
flowing plasma, with non-magnetic solar system bodies such as Venus, Mars, Titan
and comets. Research in this area contributes to a broader understanding of
solar-planetary relations in general and of comparative magnetospheres and
ionospheres. The research emphasizes two particular aspects of solar wind
interactions with non-magnetic planets: (1) collisional interactions between
plasmas and neutrals, and (2) evolution of plasma distribution functions in
induced magnetospheres. Specifically, proposed research tasks are: (1)
completing a two- dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic model of the inner coma of
comet Halley, (2) developing a two-dimensional, MHD model of the ionospheres of
Mars and Titan, (3) investigating cometary pickup ions using test particle
methods and quasi-linear theory, and (4) studying superthermal neutral and ion
populations in the inner coma of comet Halley.
