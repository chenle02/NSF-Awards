Graphene, a single-atom-think layer of graphite, has exceptional electronic
qualities, such as the ability to carry charge at great speed, that make this
new nanomaterial attractive for the next generation of electronic devices.
Synthesizing and characterizing such ultra-thin material however is especially
challenging. Laser irradiation of a single-crystal of silicon carbide (SiC) is
proposed as a graphene synthesis method. Laser light absorption causes the
decomposition of the SiC and selective evaporation of silicon leaving a graphene
layer on the surface. Using the x-ray beam at the Stanford Synchrotron source
crystalline perfection and orientation of the laser-synthesized graphene layer
will be investigated. Furthermore, bonding defects of the graphene layer will be
investigated spectroscopically. Finally, one-step synthesis and patterning will
be demonstrated by masking parts of the laser beam during
irradiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The societal benefits of having a graphene
synthesis method that can be scaled to large wafers, similarly to silicon, would
be very significant. Indeed, making large areas of graphene suitable for the
fabrication of devices is one of the main challenges to the development of this
material. Furthermore, students working on the project would be trained in the
Materials Science of a novel material that is likely to play a role in the next
generation of advanced electronic devices. Outreach activities are also planned
through the summer institute for middle-school teachers at the Stanford-based
NSF center for probing the nanoscale and through the development of hands-on
activities that can be exported into a classroom environment.&lt;br/&gt;
