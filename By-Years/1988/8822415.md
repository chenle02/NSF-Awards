Realistic modeling and animation of human and animal figures has long been a
goal of researchers in computer graphics, and this has always been viewed as a
multi-disciplinary effort. Developments in computer graphics, robotics and
psychology, as well as the growing availability of powerful graphics and
simulation workstations, make it timely to have a multi- disciplinary workshop
on the topic of mechanics, control and animation. A meeting of approximately
twenty leading researchers in graphics, psychology, robotics and mechanical
engineering will be convened. The workshop will allow researchers to become
familiar with results and methodologies across disciplines, provide for an open
exchange of ideas in an area of growing interest, and perhaps most
significantly, provide the basis for what can be highly fruitful collaborations
in the future. Position papers will be solicited from each participant.
Arrangement for rapid publication of workshop proceedings are underway.
