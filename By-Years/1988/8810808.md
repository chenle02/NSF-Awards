The response of rigid frame structures constructed of glass fiber reinforced
plastic (FRP) pultruded profile sections will be investigated. The experimental
program will examine the behavior of full-sized structural frames under short
term loading to failure and under long term loading in which creep deformation
will be significant. Strain gages, rosettes, and dial indicators will be used to
monitor the strains and deformations in the frames. Hydraulic jacks and dead
weights will be used to load the frames. The theoretical program will account
for the anisotropic and viscoelastic properties of the material and develop a
code to analyze both the short term nonlinear response and the long term creep
response. The analysis of the frame will include the effects of shear
deformation which is known to be significant in composite thin-walled beams. The
theoretically predicted forces and deflections will be compared with those
measured experimentally. The results of this investigation should provide
important data which will be used to develop future methodologies of analysis
and design with standardized pultruded fiber reinforced plastics.
