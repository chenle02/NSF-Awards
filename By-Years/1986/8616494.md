This project proposes to use a variety of techniques to establish separately the
kinetic behavior of different types of sites on nickel-alumina. Such information
would be very useful in understanding overall behavior on these commonly used
catalysts and in designing new forms of them with better selectivity. It would
also establish the feasibility of studying multiple sites separately; previous
studies have relied on measurements of overall behavior.
