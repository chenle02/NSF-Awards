William Jorgensen is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his research involving theoretical simulations of
organic reaction mechanisms in solution. This work involves the use of ab initio
MO theory to obtain information regarding the gas phase potential energy surface
for organic reactions. This information is then used in conjunction with Monte
Carlo simulation techniques to simulate the chemical reaction in solution. The
combination of these methodologies provides estimates of the solvated free
energy changes involved in a chemical reaction, and provides important
background information on the role which solvation plays in chemical reactions.
These methodologies are being applied to various important reaction mechanisms
including the (2+2) cycloaddition, oxy-Cope rearrangements, and alkoxide
alkylations. Simulations of host-guest systems are also being performed with an
emphasis on predicting binding preferences of importance in the design of
catenanes and rotaxanes which show promise as the basis for molecular devices.
Computer-assisted design of catalytic hosts using transition state geometries
and charges obtained from ab initio calculations is also being pursued. This
research is important for the elucidation of molecular-level effects of
solvation on reaction rates, intermolecular interactions and host-guest binding
in solution, and the influence of solvation on the structures of molecules. The
theoretical studies closely parallel and complement experimental work on the
optimization of organic reactions and on the development of catalysts, selective
receptors for organic molecules including drugs and metabolites, materials with
novel properties, and molecular devices.
