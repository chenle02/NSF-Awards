This proposal is for the purchase and installation of a SCS-40 minisupercomputer
that is compatible with a CRAY supercomputer. This system will increase the
numerical computational capacity at the University of North Carolina as well as
facilitate the development of computer code to be used at the NSF supercomputer
centers. The research for which it will be used consists of the application of
density functional theory to chemical reactivity, nonlinear dielectric response
of a collection of finite dipoles, protein computer modeling on synthetic
proteins, protein-water interactions and dynamics, direct phasing techniques in
macromolecular structure determination, application of energy
minimization/molecular dynamics/2D-nmr-distance geometry to the structure of
coagulation proteins and to DNA base sequence specificity in mutagenesis, the
importance of stochastic boundaries in the theory of ionic solutions and the
relationship between spin states and reactivity in reductase models.
