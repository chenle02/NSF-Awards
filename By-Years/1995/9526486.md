Woodward, Charles 95-26486 Dr. Woodward will address five research problems in
the study of classical novae evolution: (1) chemical abundances of nova ejecta
from coronal and forbidden emission line spectroscopy; (2) determinations of the
grain size distribution and mineral composition of nova dust; (3) differences in
the temporal evolution of the broadband spectral energy distribution and light
curves in the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen vs oxygen-neon- magnesium novae; (4)
dynamical studies of nova ejecta; and (5) measurements of the density and masses
of the ejecta. ***
