The Department of Chemistry will acquire a computer-controlled ultraviolet-
visible-near-infrared spectrophotometer for use in the undergraduate laboratory.
Five new and modified laboratory experiments in physical chemistry will take
advantage of the new computer-assisted spectrophotometer. The approach is to
allow students to acquire kinetic and spectroscopic data in digital format and
to subsequently analyze these data using a scientific spreadsheet, such as RS/1.
In this way, the arbitrary experimental constraints often imposed on the design
of kinetic experiments can be relaxed, allowing the more general forms of rate
laws to be evaluated from the data directly. Both second order and enzyme
kinetics will be encountered; rate constants will be obtained using numerical
methods of analysis. Information enhancement of absorption spectra will be
demonstrated using the second derivative technique that will be applied in real
time, or through subsequent data processing. This method will be applied to
obtain information about excited states of molecular systems and complex
mixtures. Students will also be taught how to use a powerful scientific
spreadsheet, in the numerical and statistical analysis of data. The generation
of professional graphics and the use of statistical information will be
emphasized.
