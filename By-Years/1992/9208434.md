This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Vermont acquire an upgrade of a 400
MHz NMR spectrometer which will be used in research investigations in the
following areas of chemistry: (1) the total synthesis of natural products, (2)
novel inorganic rings and polymers, (3) studies of chromatographic supports at
the molecular level, (4) biologically active platinum compounds, (5) fundamental
structural and conformational studies related to electron-transfer processes,
(6) molecular sterodynamics, and (7) heterocyclic chemistry. Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to the chemist
for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify
unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research.
