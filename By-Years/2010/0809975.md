This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will support a pilot study that
compares traditional disciplinary divisions to two natural classification
systems: one based on a journal classification system and the other based on an
article-level classification system. The first task will focus on mapping and
comparing existing conventional classification systems: the structure of
chemistry funding organizations, and two different journal classification
systems. The remaining tasks will develop and characterize an article-level
classification system. Ten years of article-level data will be clustered into
paradigms (groups of highly cited references). The dynamic structure of
chemistry will then be explored using both retrospective and prospective
approaches, both of which will generate Ptrends, or clusters of paradigms over
time. Results from these two approaches will be compared to identify early
indicators of emerging trends. Third, grants will be linked to paradigms to
Ptrends to show the funding patterns for different dynamic structures.
Hypotheses about how funding correlates with different types of dynamic
structures will be tested. Results from many of the computations will be
reviewed and/or compared by experts in chemistry to provide a judgment on their
accuracy or applicability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this
bibliometric analysis will be widely reported though publications and a sequence
of high quality maps that show the disciplinary sub-structure of chemistry and
its dynamics over time. This project will develop and test algorithms to
generate scientific structures that, along with appropriate visualizations, have
the potential to change the way science is funded, organized and tracked. This
will have timely and positive implications for R&amp;D managers, policy makers,
educational institutions, and corporations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
