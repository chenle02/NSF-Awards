This is a Research Planning Grant for Women Scientists and Engineers. A research
program in determining the relationship between structural and physical
interconnect in IC design is being planned. Typical area estimates for the
structural design of an IC count the number and size of the structural modules,
but ignores interconnect, which can use significant chip space. The approach is
to design experiments which explore the relationships between register-transfer
(RT) measures and area devoted to interconnects. Experiments are being conducted
with designs produced by IC synthesis tools and statistical evaluation is being
used to determine correlations. The first experiment is to establish
relationships between the RT design and the physical design independent of
particular cell bindings. The second experiment is to determine if a
relationship exists among RT measures and interconnect area, and to characterize
that relationship.
