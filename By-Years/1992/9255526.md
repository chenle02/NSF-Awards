This three-week course offers 40 instructors of undergraduate marine sciences
and related physical and biological science disciplines first hand exposure to
California coastal marine environmenta. Participants will collect and analyze
oceanographic data aboard the R/V Gordon Sproul, conduct field exercises in
modern day mid-lattitude marine habitats and an active continental margin
tectonic terrain; develop laboratory exercises using satellite imaging; interact
with local experts in marine biology, fisheries management, geology, and
physical oceanography; and participate in a choice of special topic mini-
workshops.
