This proposal addresses a novel form of gene regulation in eukaryotes by asking
how a circadian clock regulates the transcription of specific plant genes. The
study of clock-regulated transcription will provide an important insight into
molecular mechanism of the clock itself, which currently remains a puzzle.
Arabidopsis thaliana has been chosen as our model system, because this plant
offers numerous advantages for molecular genetic studies. Transcription of the
three Adrabidopsis Cab genes is differentially regulated by a circadian clock.
The basis for this difference will be investigated by analyzing the cis- and
trans-acting factors that mediate the circadian response. This will entail
detailed in vitro analysis of specific DNA-protein interactions using nuclear
protein extracts prepared from different time-points during the cycle. The in
vivo relevance of these interactions will be assessed by analysis of sites-
specific constructs in transgenic plants. In addition, novel circadian-
regulated marker genes will be identified and characterized by differential and
subtractive hybridization. Knowledge of how transcription is regulated by
cellular clocks will provide insight into a novel form of gene regulation in
plants and will, perhaps, provide information which can be extrapolated to other
organisms.
