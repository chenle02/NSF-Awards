The investigator proposes to study the K-theory of group C*-algebras and its
applications to geometry and topology of manifolds. The K-theory of group
C*-algebras are receptacles of higher indices of elliptic differential operators
and have important applications to problems in differential geometry and
topology of manifolds such as the existence problem for Riemannian metrics with
positive scalar curvature and the Novikov conjecture on homotopy invariance of
higher signatures. The methods to be employed include group actions on Banach
spaces, uniform embedding into Banach spaces, and infinite dimensional index
theory of elliptic operators. Manifolds are spaces glued together by Euclidean
spaces. Roughly speaking, these are spaces on which one can do calculus.
Examples of manifolds inlcude spheres and tori. Manifold theory plays an
important role in mathematics and physics. A fundamental problem in manifold
theory is the classification of manifolds. By surgery theory, the classification
problem for higher dimensional manifolds is essentially reduced to the Novikov
conjecture. The investigator plans to study the Novikov conjecture using methods
from infinite dimensional analysis such as noncommutative geometry. The
investigator also intends to apply noncommutative geometry methods to study
analysis on loop spaces of manifolds.
