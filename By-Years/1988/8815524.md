Shear action is an important factor in the failure of reinforced concrete
structures. A softened truss model theory has been developed that is capable of
predicting the behavior of various types of structures when shear is
predominant. The first objective is to generalize the softened truss model
theory so that it can be applied to situations where shear (torsion) is combined
with axial loads. The second objective is to perform tests on 40 full.size
reinforced concrete panels in order to determine the material laws required in
the general theory, including the softening law, the constitutive law of cracks,
and the law governing the contribution of concrete. The research will be carried
out in a $440,000 panel.testing facility recently completed at the University of
Houston. This facility consists of a giant steel frame embedded with 40 jacks of
100.ton capacity each, which can test reinforced concrete panels 55 inches
square and up to 16 inches thick. Establishment of a general truss model theory
in conjunction with the finite element method will permit one to predict the
behavior of a whole range of structures subjected to membrane stresses (walls
and shells).
