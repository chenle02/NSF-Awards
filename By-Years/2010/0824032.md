0824032&lt;br/&gt;Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this grant will support
continued operation and maintenance of the Electromagnetic Study of the
Continents (EMSOC) National Instrument Facility. The EMSOC National Instrument
Facility began in 1998 as a confederation to provide a pool of broadband
(0.001-1000 s) and long period (100-30,000 s) magneto telluric (MT) instruments
in support of NSF/EAR funded science. The facility provides instruments at
minimal cost (shipping and insurance only) for academic scientific research.
EMSOC support will also allow for continued translation of MT time series data
into SEED format so that is can be hosted through the freely available web-
accessible IRIS Data Management Center. MT methods are sensitive to fluid and
partial melt contents in the crust and mantle and therefore provide
complementary subsurface information to the structural and compositional
inferences that can be gleaned from seismic reflection and refraction imaging.
Support also covers consortium licensure costs for WinGlink MT processing and
analysis software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
