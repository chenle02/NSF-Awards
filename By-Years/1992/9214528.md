This award is for funding to upgrade the infrastructure of Westnet, a regional
computer network in the West connecting together Universities, High Schools, and
research institutions. The network serves many communities including isolated
Hispanic and Native American communities. The upgrade is to improve the routers
at major sites of the network to improve speed and throughput. The upgrade to
the network will improve access for both researchers and educators. The research
projects that are accessible through Westnet range from weather modeling to high
performance computing to remote telescope operation.
