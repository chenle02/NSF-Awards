The objective of this research is to address a pressing need for techniques that
control the power outputs of large-scale, grid-interconnected wind farms, so
that wind energy may be utilized efficiently, reliably, and economically. The
approach is based on a blend of advanced theories in nonlinear control, energy
conversion, and power system reliability, which involves theoretical research
and algorithm development, including modeling of wind farms for power system
operation, seamless control of such farms so that they can operate in both the
maximum power tracking and power regulation modes, and analysis of their dynamic
power output characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project bridges the gap
between advanced control theory and power system engineering practice, by
providing novel control technologies for enabling integration of large-scale
uncertain wind generation into the power system. The research requires state-of-
the-art modeling of electric machines, wind turbines, and power system
reliability. In addition, the research supports nationwide development in wind
energy and addresses a set of theoretical challenges in advanced nonlinear
control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project promotes national policy on renewable
energy, by providing solutions to several defining issues in reliable and
economic utilization of wind resources. It also promotes integration of
interdisciplinary research with education at state universities. The integration
will be realized through incorporation of new topics in traditional energy
conversion and power systems courses, field trips to actual wind farms, graduate
research mentorship, design of a new graduate course, and involvement of
underrepresented groups. The principal investigator is also currently a mentor
at two high-school robotics teams.&lt;br/&gt;
