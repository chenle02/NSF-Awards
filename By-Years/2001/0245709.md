Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt; The long-term goal of this research is to develop
and use analytical and experimental methods to describe the complex
relationships between mechanical and biochemical stimuli, cell metabolism,
tissue growth, and biomechanical function for cartilaginous tissues. Ultimately,
this may lead to a better understanding of the processes of cartilage growth,
degeneration, and repair. Specifically, the first aim is to develop a model of
cartilage growth and remodeling. This will be accomplished by integrating an
existing continuum mechanics theory for growing biological tissues with a
commercial poroelastic finite element model. Then, the cartilage growth model
will be used to perform several parametric studies to describe how changes in
the model parameters affect the biomechanics of cartilage growth. The second aim
is to obtain and use experimental data to determine input parameters and to
calibrate the cartilage growth model. This will be accomplished by obtaining
experimental data that quantifies how the tissue composition and mechanical
properties change during the in vitro growth of bovine cartilage constructs
subjected to a dynamic compression loading protocol. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
