Intellectual Merit. The 17th Annual Meeting of the RNA Society will be held May
29-June 3, 2012 at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. The meeting will
bring together scientists working on many aspects of RNA biology. There will be
numerous sessions covering a broad range of topics including: RNA-protein
interactions, non-coding RNAs, ribosomes and translation, RNA-protein
architecture, RNA-seq and computational structure prediction, RNA turnover,
interconnections and regulation, ribozymes and riboswitches.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. As in the past, the meeting will include
special events aimed at engaging students and postdocs. The roster of speakers
is diverse and includes many junior scientists. The format of the meeting (short
talks, workshops and poster sessions) offers an excellent opportunity for
sharing latest research findings and for building the kinds of professional
networks that are so crucial to scientific success.
