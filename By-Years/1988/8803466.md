Two different two-layer models will be used to investigate the role of eddies
in determining climate and climate sensitivity. One model will be a conventional
quasi-geostrophic model, and the other will be the two-layer model proposed by
Lorenz (1960b) which allows the eddies to interact with the static stability.
The circulations will be forced by differential heating parameterized by
Newtonian cooling. Dissipation will be in the form of Ekman suction at the lower
boundary. Initially topography will be omitted, but it will be added at a later
date. The models' horizontal resolution will not be constrained a priori, but
previous studies indicate that the eddy fluxes can be simulated accurately with
relatively low truncation. The study will differ from other climate studies with
low-order models because of the inclusion of the eddy-mean flow interactions
associated with the meridional eddy flux of momentum and with the vertical eddy
flux of heat, and because of its focus on how the interactions are affected by
diabaticity and dissipation. The results of the study should yield information
of fundamental importance for understanding climate and climate sensitivity, and
information of value for parameterizing the effects of eddies in simpler climate
models.
