The primary motivation for fracture research on ice is related to the prediction
of maximum load-transmitting capability and the minimum load- bearing capacity
of ice masses. This proplem is common to most engineering applications involving
ice: i.e., loads on arctic structures, bridge piers, ships, and bearing capacity
of ice islands, ice roads airstrips, etc. The specific objective of the proposed
research is to investigate the effect of loading rate, testing temperature, and
microstructure of fresh water ice on its fracture toughness. Preliminary to such
studies, the effect of specimen size and shape will be established. Three types
of ice that are common on many nortnern rivers and lakes during winter will be
examined. The information obtained in this research will be extremely useful for
the prediction of maximum load-carrying capacity of ice; and it will lead to the
establishment of standardized fracture testing techniques for ice. The PI ie
highly qualified to conduct the proposed research. An award is recommended.
