Specific disease resistance is manifested by a hypersensitive response (HR) to
the pathogen that includes localized necrosis, production of phytoalexins, and
changes in cell wall structure. Specific R/A mediated HR's often differ
phenotypically, even among congenic lines of plants. This observation suggests
that an R/A gene interaction does not simply trigger a universal plant defense
response. Instead, the defense response may, in part, be uniquely specified by
the interactive R/A gene pair. This hypothesis will be tested by comparing, at
the molecular genetic level, two specific R/A gene interactions in the Capsicum
annuum/Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria interaction (bacterial leaf spot
disease of green pepper). As part of this comparison the specific R genes will
be identified and cloned. Once a specific resistance gene is cloned many
experiments can be done that will elucidate the mechanisms of specific disease
resistance. If a specific resistance gene can be cloned and characterized, a
major breaktrhough will occur in our understanding and ability to control
disease in plants. But even if a specific gene cannot be identified, a detailed
comparison of two different R/A gene interactions at the molecular genetic level
will provide insight into how specific resistance is conferred.
