In this research project, an innovative methodology is developed for analysis,
design and simulation of high-order complex nonlinear dynamic systems having an
underlying multiple time- scale structure. A general approach is formulated for
time-scale identification, efficient numerical simulation, and reduced- order
model development for high-order nonlinear systems encountered in the context of
designing machines, processes, structures, vehicles and robotic manipulators.
The methodology is based upon the use of Computational Singular Perturbation
(CSP) technique, which is an iterative decoupling procedure originally developed
for singularly perturbed linear systems. The application of this methodology has
been successfully demonstrated for stiff problems in chemical kinetics. In this
research, both initial and boundary value problems are addressed. Formulating
system design problems in the framework of optimal control leads to Hamiltonian
boundary-value problems which often have multiple time-scale structures. The
modified and extended CSP method is used as a user friendly software-oriented
general tool for such problems, and provides a significantly new capability for
complex nonlinear system analysis and design.*** //
