Cutin and suberin are the structural polymers of plant cuticle, functioning as
protective barriers to the environment and also among various plant organs.
Although these biopolyesters are composed of known fatty acid constituents,
their insolubility has hampered investigations of how the monomer units are
linked together chemically. Several new research strategies are proposed herein:
(1) 13C NMR spectra and spin relaxation studies (cross-polarization and direct
acquisition with magic-angle spinning) of intact cutin to assess cuticular
resiliency at extremes of temperature; (2) 13C and 2H NMR investigations of
molecular interactions in cutin-wax and cutin-water mixtures; (3) production and
spectroscopic identification of cutin oligomers and residues from selective
depolymerization treatments; (4) 13C NMR studies of chemical bonding and
polymer-polymer interactions in suberin-cell wall assemblies. With this
coordinated approach to supramoleclar structure elucidation in plant cuticle
polyesters, it should be possible to test existing hypotheses and develop new
mechanistic ideas regarding their function in crop protection, plant
development, and livestock nutrition.
