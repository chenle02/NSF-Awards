The Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology-Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship (CREST-PRF) track within the CREST program supports
beginning CREST Center investigators with significant potential and provides
them with training and research experiences that will broaden perspectives,
facilitate interdisciplinary interactions and establish them in positions of
leadership within the scientific community. This CREST-PRF project is aligned
with the research focus of the CREST Center for Innovation Research and
Education in Environmental Nanotechnology at the University of Puerto Rico â€“ Rio
Piedras Campus. The goal of this research is for the post doctoral fellow to
investigate water remediation treatment from salinity intrusion via a
desalination method based on novel polymers. The proposed work has the potential
to increase understanding about the waters in the Las Cucharillas community.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work intends to study salinity intrusion into
water aquifers through a detailed examination of water remediation treatment
from salinity intrusion via a desalination method using novel polymers. A
specific aim of the research is to synthesize materials with non-biofouling
features that may be used in seawater environments. An environmentally friendly
zwitterionic poly(carboxybetainmethacrylate) (PCBMA) based polymer will be
studied and characterized. This utilization of this hydrophilic polymer has the
potential to have water purification applications which may prevent organic
matter attachment. This proposed method has the potential to preserve the island
groundwater sources and associated natural ecosystems. The successful
implementation of this project has the potential to yield significant
information to advance understanding regarding the use of hydrophilic polymers
via emerging polymeric grafting techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
