0137728/Wajsowicz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to untangle the
complex pathways taken by water from different sources as they meet in the
western tropical Pacific. One particular premise that will be tested is the idea
that the location and strength of the Mindanao and Halmahera Eddies and of the
Mindanao Dome may exert a strong influence on the relative mixture of water
masses entering the North Equatorial Countercurrent, the Equatorial Undercurrent
(EUC) and the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF). In part, this study is motivated by
differences between the relative mixture of water of North and South Pacific
origin in the EUC and ITF seen in data and the proportions seen in numerical
general circulation models. The approach involves the dynamical study of two
process models. One is a multi-layer diagnostic model, the second is a high-
resolution version of the multi-layer POSEIDON model. In addition, the
variability of the tropical gyre closure in the output from a GFDL data
assimilation run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
