This research investigation brings together research and methods from
behavioral decision theory and computational modeling to explore process
theories of voting. Combining survey data with computer simulations, in what is
called computational experiments, the investigators can compare and evaluate
process theories of candidate evaluation and choice. The investigators undertake
five experimenal studies using this method to investigate important isssues in
the candidate evaluation process, including the impact of issue complexity
(whether candidates qualify their positions or state them simply), information
order, presentation format, and the affect of trait inferences of candidates on
the evaluation of the candidates. This unique investigation allows significant
methodological advances in our understanding of the affect of issue and trait in
candidate evaluation and candidate selection.
