NOWELL 9402081 The relationships between mineral charge and texture, sorption of
organic matter to mineral surfaces, and the preservation of organic matter in
marine sediments will be evaluated in the course of this research. Strong
correlations between organic carbon preservation and mineral fluxes &amp;
surface areas indicate that processes involving minerals influence the amounts
and types of organic matter preserved. Over 90% of the organic matter present in
typical marine sediments is sorbed to mineral surfaces and possibly impart
stability to inherently labile organic matter, dramatically slowing or stopping
the rate at which it is remineralized. Mineral characteristics (mineralogy,
cation exchange capacity, surface area and microtopography) will be compared
with organic measurements and lability tests to estimate the extent that changes
in mineral type and texture affect the sorption and stability of organic matter
in marine sediments. The analytical approach proposed here should allow a first-
order estimate of the importance sediment mineralogy and texture have on organic
matter preservation.
