Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal includes research and educational
goals involving the integration of magnetooptical garnet isolators onto Si with
the initial application being telecommunications at near infrared wavelengths.
This research will have a broad impact on photonic integrated circuits (PICs)
and opto-electronic integrated circuits (OEICs) for applications such as optical
computing and interconnects as well. The integration of garnet will also further
the realization of other nonreciprocal devices such as mode converters, and
circulators, and the integration techniques will be transferable to other
semiconductors platforms, such as InP and
GaAs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The integration of
garnet with semiconductor platforms has long been thought impossible. However,
the PI has recently developed a technique for the integration of garnet with
semiconductors. In the current proposal, this novel technique will be applied to
the first integrated garnet devices using two designs. The prototypes developed
here will be the first rotators with garnet cores that have been realized on
semiconductor platforms. The traditional roadblock of birefringence in garnet
waveguide isolators will be overcome with core shape tuning. Also, a novel
approach of using both in-plane and perpendicular magnetic biasing will
contribute new understanding to the PIC and OEIC communities.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance
discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning
through graduate student training, industrial interaction, and undergraduate
research. It will also benefit society through advances optical interconnects,
optical computing, telecommunications. This project truly enables the ?missing
link? in photonics such that first generation light sources can be integrated
with photonic integrated circuits and optoelectronic integrated circuits using
this exploratory work.&lt;br/&gt;
