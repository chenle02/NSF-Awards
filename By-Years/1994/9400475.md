9400475 Baer The research consists of creating engineered microstructures of
incompatible polymers with up to 8,000 alternating layers of two polymers. The
unique advantages that can be achieved with these microlayered and nanolayered
composites will be studied. A fundamental study of the interactive
microdeformation processes that lead to enhanced mechanical properties in
microlayers of thermoplastic polymers will be carried out. The basic physics of
crystallization with simultaneous interdiffusion will be investigated with
microlayers of two miscible polymers. Controlled interfacial reaction in
microlayers will be studied to model interfacial effects of reactive
compatibilization. New microlayer and nanolayer composites will be made to
explore the feasibility of creating film and sheet materials with multiple
functions, including unusual mechanical, optical, and electronic properties. %%%
This research on layer-multiplying devices that permit continuous melt
processing of two polymers into sheet or film with hundreds or thousands of
alternating layers will create new opportunities for coextrusion technology. The
unique microlayered and nanolayered structures are used to study fundamental
problems in polymer science, and to create new materials with unusual, coupled
properties.
