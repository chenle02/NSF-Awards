This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will acquire an ultraviolet laser
for novel quantum imaging experiments at Colgate University. The grant will
support and enhance the infrastructure of a very vigorous research program in
optical physics at Colgate where undergraduates are the prime researchers and
coauthors of its published research output. The Laser will be used to produce
non-classical states of light in the form of photon pairs. With this unique
light form we will study a novel concept in optical physics: the helical spatial
modes of light, where the wave-front of the light has corkscrew shapes. In
recent years there has been much interest in the study of these modes from a
quantum mechanical perspective because of their potential use in encoding
information and imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad impacts of
the acquisition of the equipment are to enhance the research experience of
undergraduates at Colgate University, and prepare them for future careers in
science. In addition, the outcome of the research to be done with this laser
will make fundamental contributions to the field of quantum information, a topic
that is at one of the forefronts of physics research today.
