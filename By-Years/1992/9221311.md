This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of heterogeneous photoprocesses. During the tenure of this three-
year continuing grant, Professor Lewis and his students will investigate
structural and electronic properties of semiconductor/liquid interfaces. Using
well-defined semiconductor/liquid contacts, this research seeks insight into
those factors which control (a) electric fields in the semiconductor domain of
the interface, (b) the rate at which charges move from the semiconductor phase
into the contacting phase, and (c) the semiconductor/contacting phase surface
chemistry. %%% Semiconductor/liquid contacts are important in many technologies
including solar energy conversion, photochemical remediation of toxic wastes,
chemical sensors, and molecular electronic devices. The successful attainment of
the goals of this research should result in the more efficient and widespread
use of semiconductor systems in the aforementioned and related technologies.
