Middlesex Community College's two-year ATE project focuses on Integrating
Nanotechnology and Technician Education into the Curriculum (INTEC) to support
workforce development and transfer of students to baccalaureate programs in the
sciences and engineering. The project includes an in-depth workforce needs and
job skills analysis to determine the regional technical workforce requirements
related to nanotechnology and other relevant emerging technologies. In addition,
the project includes professional development in nanotechnology for faculty and
the development and the revision of curriculum to integrate nanotechnology into
current courses in response to the workforce needs analysis. The project is
building institutional capacity to provide education and training to support
future workforce development related to nanotechnology and other emerging
technologies. Other participants in the project include North Shore Community
College and universities with extensive nanotechnology research: the University
of Massachusetts, Lowell, Northeastern University, and University of
Massachusetts, Amherst.
