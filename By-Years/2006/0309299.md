A grant has been awarded to Dr. Francois Lutzoni and Mr. Heath O'Brien at Duke
University to study cyanobacteria in the lichen symbiosis. Cyanobacteria,
previously known as blue-green algae, are a group of photosynthetic bacteria. In
addition to being important light harvesters in both aquatic and terrestrial
ecosystems, cyanobacteria form symbiotic associations with a variety of other
organisms, including the endosymbiotic origin of the chloroplasts responsible
for photosynthesis in plants. Not unlike chloroplasts, the lichen symbiosis is
an association in which algae or cyanobacteria live within a fungus and provide
it with energy derived from photosynthesis. Unlike chloroplasts, these
photosynthetic symbionts are not passed on from parents to their offspring and
must be re-acquired anew each generation. This study will use DNA sequence
comparisons of cyanobacteria from different lichens, as well as free-living
cyanobacteria to trace how these cyanobacteria move among different lichens and
the environment from generation to generation. It will also attempt to determine
their identity by comparing these sequences to ones obtained from reference
strains with established taxonomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will make a
significant contribution to our understanding of both cyanobacterial systematics
and the life-history of cyanobacterial symbioses. This may provide some insight
into how the plant chloroplast could have formed from free-living cyanobacteria,
giving rise to all modern plants. Knowledge of the diversity of lichen
photobionts associated with different lichen species will also further the study
of lichens, where at present, the identity of the photosynthetic partner is
known for only about 5% of species.&lt;br/&gt;
