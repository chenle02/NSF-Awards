The goal of this research is to analyze the equilibria of economies in which
time and uncertainty play important roles. A new class of economies with limited
insurance possibilities is proposed. In these economies, the operation of asset
markets is subject only to endogenous constraints on the level of debt consumers
can accumulate. Analyzing economies of this type will provide an alternative to
studying models with incomplete markets or models with private information for
explaining the observed correlation between fluctuations in individual
consumption and individual income. The project will also develop efficient
algorithms for computing the equilibria of such economies. In addition, the
possibility of taxes and externalities causing the multiplicity of market
equilibria will analyzed. This research is important because it will provide new
tools for computing equilibria in an economic system which will enhance our
fundamental understanding of how market economies work.
