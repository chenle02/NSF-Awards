This is a one-year regular grant that investigates mathematical model-based
methods for coordination in intelligent agent societies. The research addresses
how to construct an general model of coordination that is based on a
identification of a set of state variables that characterize relevant aspects of
agent behavior in an agent society. Coordination is defined as the management of
dependencies among activities, following a widely used definition of
coordination. The problem of coordination is then the problem of exerting
control over these dependencies. The research aims to discover logical orderings
of state variables based on dependencies, and thus to develop mathematical
models of coordination strategies. Once coordination and control relationships
are known, coordination problems can be treated using constraint satisfaction,
constraint-propagation, ad optimization approaches. The mathematical models will
be further explored and validated through simulation.
