This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project targets the synthesis
of very large-scale integrated circuits (ICs) and systems on chip (SoC) in very
short CPU time. The expected short CPU time comes from relying on binary
decision diagram (BDDs) that replaced the traditional algebraic representations
used pervasively in present-day tools. This Phase II SBIR project is devoted to
developing further the capabilities of swift and integrating it with a number of
commercial tools. The development plan includes new capabilities, such as
improving area by adding new logic transformations and improving the speed of
processing by implementing novel decomposition algorithms. This project will
significantly advance the theory of modern logic optimization and promote its
understanding in industry and academia. It would also promote the inclusion of
faster logic synthesis tools in existing Electronic Design Automation (EDA)
systems. It would benefit the national EDA industry, and help the US to maintain
its competitive advantage against its foreign competitors in this strategically
important market.
