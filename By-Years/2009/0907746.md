The project is concerned with sensor array imaging in heterogeneous (cluttered)
richly scattering media. It is motivated by applications in reflection
seismology, ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation, ground-foliage penetrating
radar, and synthetic aperture radar. Mathematically, the study is on inverse
problems for the wave equation with rapidly fluctuating wave speed, due to
numerous small heterogeneities in clutter. The goal is to locate (image) strong
reflectors buried in clutter, using measurements of the scattered waves at
remote arrays of sensors. Because the clutter inhomogeneities are not known and
they cannot be estimated from the array data, they are modeled with random
processes. The work is divided in three main themes: (1) Filtering random media
effects for array imaging in heavy clutter. (2) Optimal subspace projection
methods for selective illumination and imaging with array sensors in random
media. (3) Robust and efficient imaging methods for persistent surveillance
synthetic aperture radar. All problems are new and challenging, they involve
theory, extensive numerical simulations, and algorithm development in realistic
setups, motivated by applications.

Sensor array imaging is an important technology in oil exploration, earthquake
prediction, nondestructive evaluation of materials, radar, persistent
surveillance of complex urban scenes, and elsewhere. Progress in sensor
technology has improved dramatically the ability to collect new types of data
and vast amounts of it. The current imaging technology is inadequate, specially
in highly heterogeneous (cluttered), low visibility environments. The project is
concerned with the development of new imaging methodologies that can adaptively
mitigate the clutter effects and the uncertainty in the data, and can optimize
sensor array illumination waveforms for achieving the best possible images.
