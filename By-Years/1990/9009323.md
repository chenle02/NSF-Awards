The numerical solution of ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and
PDEs) provides an important class of large scale scientific computing problems.
Fourier analysis has been used by applied mathematicians as a simple and
effective tool to analyze the numerical properties of approximation schemes and
solution methods for ODEs and PDEs. This includes three main objectives: (1)
exploiting Fourier tools used in the areas of digital filtering and digital
control for solving ODEs and elliptic PDEs, (2) analyzing numerical ODE and
elliptic PDE algorithms with Fourier techniques so that they can be understood
by electrical engineers in a more familiar setting, and (3) development of new
parallel algorithms and study of their performnce on parallel algorithms and
study of their performance on parallel computers such as the Connection Machine
CM/2 and Alliant FX/80.
