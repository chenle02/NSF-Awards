&lt;br/&gt;The expressed goals of this proposal are to conduct a series of
workshops. The first series of workshops will establish and disseminate visions
of good research and methodology practice that address perceived weaknesses that
appear in some educational research, and provide guidelines for the improvement
of future educational research efforts. The second series of workshops addresses
curricular issues in the development guidelines in support a national K-16
statistics curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator is the executive
director of the American Statistical Association, would establish a series of
workshops to bring together members of the research statistics community and the
mathematics education research community. The expressed goal is to establish and
disseminate criteria for high quality quantitative research in the sub-field of
mathematics education and education more generally.&lt;br/&gt;
