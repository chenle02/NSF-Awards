Chlorine is the most commonly used disinfectant and oxident in water treatment
in the U.S.A. However, chlorination of water produces various halogenated
organics including trihalomethanes (THMS) which are suspected carcinogens.
Presence of halogenated organics are frequently correlated with mutagenic
activity in water, ozone, UV radiation, have been used as effective
disinfectants. However, ozone and UV light do not leave any residual in water
treatment. Presence of a residual disinfectant in thedistribution system is
desirable for protection of the microbiological quality of water and prevention
of aftergrowths. This research is to investigate the combined treatment of UV
radiation and chlorination as an innovative technique in drinking water. It is
expected that this process might produce much less chlorinated organics as end
products then chlorination alone, while achieving removal of organic compounds
by oxidation. UV light acts as a catalyst for the reaction of chlorine with the
organic compounds in water. The UV light not only makes possible the oxidation
of compounds which would otherwise be resistant to chlorine, but also increases
the rate of oxidation of oxidizable substances. The proposed research will
address the extent of the organic removal and the formation of any halogenated
organic products driving UV/Chlorination of humic material under controlled
laboratory conditions. The P.I. is a qualified investigator to carry out this
research. She has 15 research publications in water treatment research. An
Expedited Award for Novel Research (Bulletin 85-25) of $30,000 for 12 months is
recommended.
