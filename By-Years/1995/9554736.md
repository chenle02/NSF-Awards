Mathematics is undergoing remarkable advances, the scope of mathematical
applications is broadening into new disciplines, reaching a more diverse student
population. Courses and other educational experiences for prospective
mathematics teachers at all levels provide an important wedge that will help
bring about this revolution in the undergraduate curriculum. Just as many
current college faculty are not in a position to infuse contemporary mathematics
and its applications into their teaching, many undergraduates who are currently
preparing to teach at the elementary and secondary levels are also not
sufficiently aware of important current mathematics. It is important that the
presence of contemporary applications of mathematics be increased in the
undergraduate preparation of those who will teach at all levels. To address this
opportunity and challenge, workshops are scheduled for the summers of 1996 and
1997. These workshops will each be of two-week duration, with 25 participants
per workshop. The workshops in 1996 will be held at Virginia Commonwealth
University and the United States Military Academy. The focus of each workshop
will be contemporary applications of mathematics in the broadly defined areas of
mathematical modeling, discrete mathematics, and geometry. They will feature
mathematical topics of increasing emphasis and importance.
