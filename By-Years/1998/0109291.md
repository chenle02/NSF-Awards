This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility of fabricating low volume, low parasitic, i.e., low series
resistance and inductance, high energy density capacitors using stacked, thin-
film tantalum pentoxide dielectrics fabricated on Kapton film and tantalum foil.
Low resistance capacitors will shorten both charge and discharge time, as well
as lower the resistive load on the battery or power source. Low inductance is
also important in high voltage systems. Power supplies have high transformation
ratios with many turns for secondary windings that induce high leakage
inductance. Therefore, capacitor inductance must be minimized in order to reduce
the total system inductance, ultimately improving power usage factors and system
efficiency.

Numerous high power systems are used in the medical, defense, space, and
consumer electronics industries, where substantial reduction in size and weight
and increased speed and performance are desired. Special anodization techniques
used to form capacitor dielectrics will allow fabrication of capacitors with a
wide range of high performance configurations and characteristics that are
expected to benefit all of these industrial markets. Miniaturized, high energy
density thin-film capacitors are used in many high power devices, such as
defibrillators, DC power supplies, and automotive electronics.
