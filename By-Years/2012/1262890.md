This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) site at Louisiana State University. The intended impact of this program is
fostering interest in careers in science, by introducing students to the nature
of research-oriented careers in physics and astronomy and by developing
research-related skills and knowledge. REU students are recruited nationally;
students can be of any academic year and need not have a declared major, but
must have completed the general physics sequence at their school. For the ten-
week program, the participants will be matched with faculty mentors based on
student interests. Students will join their mentors in active research projects,
such as: &lt;br/&gt;- performing analysis on data from the long baseline
neutrino oscillation experiment T2K;&lt;br/&gt;- simulating black holes and
supernova explosions on the nation's fastest supercomputers, to determine their
visibility in gravitational, electromagnetic, and neutrino detectors;
and&lt;br/&gt;- designing quantum error correction codes and quantum memory for
photonic qubits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weekly seminars and workshops introduce
the students to faculty research, to skills development, to common research
resources, and to professional development topics such as ethics and
patents/intellectual property. Students participate in field trips and other
activities, some of which are coordinated with concurrent LSU summer science
programs in computer science, biomedical science and other areas. Students from
all programs are lodged in proximity at on-campus apartment-style housing, to
foster group interactions and a sense of community.
