This award is for an REU Site in Political Science at Indiana State University.
The project theme is Democracy and World Politics, with students working on one
of three issue areas: Foreign Policy in a Democracy, Democratization and
Democracy Promotion, and Democracy and Conflict. These issues are engaging and
dynamic, with both academic and popular value. Each summer, 12 students will
work with faculty members to develop research questions and designs within the
themes mentioned above. Students will gather and analyze data and produce
scholarly papers reporting their findings. Activities will include research
methods seminars, intensive project development workshops, special presentation
by guest scholars, community-forming events, and research under the guidance of
project mentors with established records of research and publication.

This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract
talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research
experiences.
