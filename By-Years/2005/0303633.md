0303633 Haas The principal investigators of this project intend to develop a
response for terrorist attacks. Specifically, they propose to model the gaseous
disinfection processes of an office after an anthrax attack. Development of such
a model is a necessary precursor to an efficient decontamination strategy. Two
existing indoor air-quality codes, will be modified to include features required
for predicting inactivation rates of bacterial spores.
