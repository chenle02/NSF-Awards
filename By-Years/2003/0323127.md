This project will provide 60 middle and high school teachers from the greater
Los Angeles area with training in information technology and applications
related to the study of ocean habitats. The Center for Image Processing in
Education, in collaboration with the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary
and the Environmental Systems Research Institute, will work with the teachers
and 200 of their students over a period of three years to develop and pilot
information technology-based curriculum units based upon ocean study.

The target population of teachers and students will be drawn from populations
currently underrepresented in the technology workplace. The project leadership,
consisting of scientists, educators and technology specialists, will instruct
the teachers in Geographic Imaging Systems and Image Processing Applications
during 8-days of school year workshops and a 7-day summer field experience at a
Santa Cruz Island research facility. Staff and teachers will work together
designing the curriculum units, which will be piloted during a 4-day field
experience with local students. These units, following field tests and
revisions, will be disseminated nationally through fee-based workshops.
