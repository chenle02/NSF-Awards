Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility of preparing biopolymer supported
phase change materials to store useful quantities of energy. By chemical
modification of clothing-type polymers with phase change materials, it was shown
that the derivatized products can reversibly store significant quantities of
energy as heat. The products were found to release the heat energy at
temperatures that are attractive for a clothing application. It was found that
the temperature of transition could be adjusted as desired. The Phase II program
continues and expands upon this research study. The proposed work includes a
detailed study of the polymer functionalization reactions and a determination of
the scope of the latent heat capabilities of the products. Extension of the
chemistry to fibers and synthetic polymers is also planned.
