The project will seek to understand the sediment distribution through space and
time in the Indus basin and continental margin. Existing sediment provenance
data around the Indus delta, continental shelf and fan cannot be explained by a
simple "conveyor belt" transport system from mountains to deep-sea. The
proponents frame the existing data in clear hypotheses of sediment flux to be
tested with the help of additional samples and by linking an understanding of
the sediment provenance study to the sediment dynamics of the drainage system.
The link to recent human activity on the fluvial drainage will also be
considered. The PIs plan to apply modern isotopic fingerprinting and dating
techniques to study the history of flux and provenance of sediments. Cooperation
with the local institutions in planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
