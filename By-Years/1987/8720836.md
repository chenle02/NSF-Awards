This award provides partial funding to convert an existing 9.inch magnetic
sector mass spectrometer into an instrument that uses resonance ionization and
incorporates simultaneous multiple isotope detection with electron multipliers.
The conversion will build on a laser resonance ionization system developed at
the National Bureau of Standards. Development, installation and operation of the
instrument will take place at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the
Carnegie Institution of Washington. The new system will allow measurements of
the Re.Os isotope system at higher levels of precision and sensitivity than
possible at present, and its successful development will provide important new
research capabilities for the isotope geochemistry research community. Because
of the geochemical behavior of the Re.Os system its study provides unique
information on the evolution of the Earth's crust, mantle and core.
