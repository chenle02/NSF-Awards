The research will focus on two major areas of research: first, a preliminary
investigation of the performance of transportation systems subject to earthquake
ground motions; and second, the assessment of impacts of travel behavior on the
physical environment using theoretical and operational models of complex travel
behavior previously developed by the researcher.
