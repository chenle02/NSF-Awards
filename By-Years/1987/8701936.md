The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus
Lie, has been one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the
mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, Lie
theory has had a profound impact upon mathematics itself and theoretical
physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics. The
research proposed by Professor Jenkins utilizes the representation theory of
nilpotent Lie groups to study certain classes of differential operators. These
include Schrodinger operators, which are the operators that determine the
dynamical laws in quantum mechanical systems. Given a differential operator, one
constructs an appropriate Lie group in which that operator is realized
infinitesimally in the universal enveloping algebra. This construction leads to
a convolution semigroup of probability measures having the differential operator
as infinitesimal generator. In this way, Professor Jenkins uses the theory of
these semigroups to study the spectrum and corresponding eigenfunction expansion
of the given operator.
