The SBIR research addresses a new technique for improving the working
properties of water-based ceramic formulations and the production yields for
objects manufactured from these materials. This extensively used class of
materials is employed in applications ranging from ceramic substrates to
bathroom fixtures to monolithic insulators used for high voltage transmission
lines. While many additives have been used to improve the handling properties of
clays, the losses due to cracking of large ceramic objects during drying remain
at a very high level. Recently, a new additive has been invented which has been
proven by our pilot studies to greatly increase the rate and uniformity of
drying of certain water-based clays used for decorative ceramics. However,
virtually nothing is known about the mechanism by which this additive works nor
how to successfully apply it to ceramics of industrial important. Therefore, a
scientific study is planned to explore the interaction of this new additive with
water-based clays and to develop a model of this mechanism. The model will then
be used to guide the experimental work needed to successfully use this additive
with selected ceramics with large commercial markets.
