A model laboratory is being developed which will enable individuals who are
preparing to be elementary school teachers to undertake realistic, hands-on
mathematics and science experiences. The laboratory is making both computer
related technology equipment and hands-on mathematics and science equipment
available to preservice teachers. The equipment is providing students with the
opportunity to explore, analyze, construct models, collect and represent data,
and solve problems in realistic situations. The laboratory is providing a model
for how preservice teachers can use specific scientific equipment and technology
in their own work with students.
