This research project examines the evolutionary genetics of a group of New
World primates. The goals of the study include a reconstruction of the ancient
invasion of Central America by howler monkeys and, as a secondary objective, a
genetic analysis of social structure in a well-studied population of mantled
howlers. These objectives will be accomplished by comparing the genetic
similarities between pairs of populations and pairs of individuals,
respectively, using a DNA fingerprinting technology we developed specifically
for these species. This study will significantly augment our understanding of
primate evolution in two ways. First, we will provide a preliminary model for
the population genetics of Central American primates in general, thus, providing
a useful contrast with better known primate systems from Africa and Asia.
Second, the information generated by this study about New World primate genetics
will provide basic information that can lay the foundation for future ecological
and evolutionary studies in this group.
