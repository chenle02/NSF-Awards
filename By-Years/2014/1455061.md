In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Oleg Larionov of The University of Texas at San Antonio is
developing catalytic systems that can control the reactivity and
stereoselectivity of nitroxy compounds. In particular, this work is seeking to
provide fundamental insights into the interactions of transition-metal catalysts
with highly reactive nitrosoalkenes, N-oxides and oxazines that are valuable
precursors to alkaloids, many of which have important medicinal properties. The
educational plan involves the development of a course focused on organic
synthesis for graduate and advanced-level undergraduate students implementing
process-oriented, guided-inquiry learning techniques. In addition, outreach
efforts promote the ideas and principles of sustainable chemistry in the K-12
education by engaging local K-12 science teachers who are working with
underserved populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chemistry of nitroxy
compounds is distinguished by a diversity of chemical properties and
reactivities. This unmatched diversity is a challenge for the development of
synthetic methods exploiting unique reactivities of nitroxy compounds. In
particular, control of regio- and stereoselectivity is a long-standing problem
for these compounds. This study focuses on the fundamental factors that
influence the regio- and stereochemical outcomes of cycloannulations and carbon-
carbon bond-formation reactions of nitrosoalkenes, N-oxides, and oxazines. The
catalytic reactions discovered in this project are expected to impact several
adjacent research areas, including materials science, bioorganic chemistry and
catalysis.
