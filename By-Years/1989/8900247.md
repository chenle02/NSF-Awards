The renewal project is to continue the gathering of field data, viz.,
simultaneous wind speeds and dynamic response records on the Shanghai Television
Tower. Instrumentation has been installed and data has started to be recorded.
Two more years of data gathering will take place, taking advantage of the site's
high intensity and frequence of extreme winds episodes. The data base produced
will benefit the structural and wind engineering community, and will also
improve the knowledge on the effects of lateral loads on structures caused by
natural hazards thus, the safety design of buildings and structures.
