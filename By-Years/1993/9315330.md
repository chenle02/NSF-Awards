9315330 Latanision This award supports the participation of 12 U.S. scientists
and engineers in a U.S.-Japan Seminar on Development and Environmental
Characteristics of New Materials, to be held in June 1994 in Mount Hood, Oregon.
The seminar is co-organized by Professor Ronald Latanision, Department of
Materials Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and
Professor Koji Hashimoto, Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University,
Sendai, Japan. Several new and advanced materials will be discussed at the
meeting, including amorphous alloys, composites, coatings, electronic materials,
and intermetallic alloys. The speakers will focus on the environmental
degradation of such materials. The objective of the seminar is to understand the
present status of new materials known to have high resistance against
environmental attack, and the environmental characteristics of other new
materials that have attractive physical and chemical properties but whose
chemical behavior must be determined before such materials may be used in
service. The seminar brings together leaders in the corrosion science and
engineering communities (university, industry, and national laboratories) from
both countries to establish a shared research agenda that will lead to more
timely and effective introduction of new materials into engineering systems that
serve society throughout the world. ***
