Proposal Number: CCF 0916605 TITLE: SHF: Small: Automated Debugging Techniques
for Modern Software Systems PI: Alessandro Orso

Debugging, which consists of identifying and removing software faults, is a
human-intensive activity responsible for much of the cost of software
maintenance. Existing approaches for automated debugging can help lower this
cost, but have limitations that hinder their effectiveness and applicability.
This project aims to overcome these limitations by developing a family of
debugging techniques that (1) target realistic debugging scenarios, in which
faults can involve multiple statements and manifest themselves only in specific
contexts, (2) apply advanced static and dynamic analysis techniques to
automatically reduce the amount of both statements and inputs that developers
must examine when investigating a failure, (3) leverage information collected
from the field to increase the relevance and effectiveness of the debugging
process. These newly defined techniques will be evaluated through rigorous
experimentation performed on real software, in real settings, and under
realistic assumptions. Debugging tools, infrastructure, and experimental
subjects developed within the project will be made freely available to
researchers and practitioners to help dissemination and enable further research.
By advancing the state of the art of debugging, this research will help
developers build more reliable software systems and, ultimately, increase the
overall quality of our software infrastructure.
