This award provides partial support for participants at a conference on
Algebraic Topological Methods in Computer Science to be held at Stanford
University, July 30 through August 3, 2001. There has been increasing interest
in the potential applications of algebraic topology in recent years. Topology
has now become a valuable tool in computational geometry, as well as a method
for studying various problems in algorithms and combinatorics. This conference
will cover several different themes, including topology in computational
geometry, topology and algorithms, topology in combinatorics, and topology as an
aid to visualization. The speakers include many of the leaders in this area,
including both mathematicians with an interesting in computational questions as
well as computer scientists who are applying algebraic topology in various ways.
We expect substantial participation from researchers in Silicon Valley who ae
working in this area. Further information, including invited speakers, schedule
of talks, and housing information, is available at http:// math.stanford.edu and
