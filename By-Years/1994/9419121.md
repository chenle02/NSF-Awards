Abstract A.Garcia San Jose State University CTS-9419121 This proposal involves
the study of the flow between the read/write head and the disk in computer disk
drives. In a computer disk drive the read/write head does not touch the platter
but rather aerodynamically flies a very small distance above it. The head is
very small (about 1/16th of an inch long) yet its distance from the platter is
microscopic (about 1/10th the wavelength of light). Because of these dimensions,
this study will employ the direct simulation Monte Carlo method which permits
computations at high Knudsen numbers. The studies will include the effects of
surface roughness and the dimensions of the actual read/write head.
