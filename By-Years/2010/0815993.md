DRL-0815993&lt;br/&gt;PI: Andy Anderson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT
ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This empirical study develops a science learning
progression that extends from 4th grade through the first year of college and
focuses on key bio-geo-chemical processes in socio-ecological systems at
multiples scales, including cellular and organisms, metabolism, ecosystems,
energetics and carbon cycling, carbon sequestration, and combustion of fossil
fuels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project investigates the learning progression
hypothesis that there are patterns in the development of students' knowledge and
practice that are both conceptually coherent and empirically verifiable. Using
an iterative, design-based research process, the project develops: (1) a
validated framework; (2) assessment resources; and (3) studies of sequences and
mechanisms of conceptual change based on teaching experiments at the elementary,
middle, high school and college levels.
