This research is to expand a study of earthquake source parameters and the
seismotectonics of major intraplate earthquakes in stable continental areas and
apply the results to implications of seismic hazard in the seismically active
New Madrid area of the central U.S. The seismicity of the central and eastern
U.S. is a significant hazard. Yet, due to lack of a suitable conceptual
framework, the origin of large earthquakes in the stable interior of continents
remain a challenging problem for earthquake seismology and tectonics. One of the
contributions of this study is to provide a consistent description of intraplate
earthquake parameters on which to base earthquake hazard estimations. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
