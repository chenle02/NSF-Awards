Most transportation actions regarding disaster conditions cannot be tested or
evaluated in a laboratory or inferred from normal situations. They have to be
acquired through real-life events which in the case of an earthquake is a rare
occurrence. The most significant events in the transportation and transportation
related-field that followed the October 17, 1989 San Francisco Bay Area
earthquake is the collapse of transportation facilities, particularly bridges,
which caused discontinuity in the transportation network. These failures
impacted several emergency management functions such as search and rescue, fire
fighting and site evacuations. They also restricted the movement of people and
goods among the various communities of the Bay Area. The main focus of this
project is to study and assess the impacts of transportation system failures on
emergency management functions and to evaluate the development and
implementation of various traffic diversion strategies carried to provide
accessibility and mobility to the travelers in the affected region. The
developed strategies and models will enhance the work conducted after the Mexico
City earthquake in this field, and test its applicability to the U.S.
environment. The results will assist emergency managers and planners in the
location and allocation of personnel and equipment, in the dispatch of emergency
vehicles, and in the development of traffic diversion strategies that will avoid
bottlenecks and minimize delays. They will also bring into focus the tremendous
transportation costs incurred by business as well as by individuals as a result
of the failure of key elements of the transportation network.
