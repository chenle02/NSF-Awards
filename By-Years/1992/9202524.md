This award is made by the Divisions of Chemistry, Materials Research and
Electrical and Communications Systems under the Materials Synthesis and
Processing Initiative. The research will develop novel site-specific nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) methods for the analysis of epitaxial structures and
defects in III-V semiconductors and will correlate the information obtained with
growth procedures and existing analysis techniques. By modifications of
demonstrated methods of optical NMR, the sensitivity of NMR will be extended to
allow the observation of small numbers of nuclear spins in very small volumes.
This represents an improvement of about ten orders of magnitude over ordinary
NMR in the number of spins detectable, making possible surface and interface
studies of important electronic and photonic materials. The spectral resolution
for optically excited states will be improved about ten-thousand fold.
Applications will be made to interface chemistry, strain fields, electronic
structure, and the spatial distribution of defects both in bulk crystals and
quantum-confinement structures. %%% The development of time-sequenced optical
NMR will allow the detection of surface defects and sites in solid state
materials with extremely high sensitivity and resolution.
