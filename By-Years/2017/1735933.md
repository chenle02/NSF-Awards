Digital data repositories have become increasingly important across research
communities in recent years due to changing expectations around data from
funders and scientists. Managers, funders, and users of digital data
repositories are interested in assessing and communicating the impact of such
repositories. A systematic approach and well-understood metrics, that may be
quantitative or qualitative in nature, are needed to determine impact. Various
stakeholders that include repository evaluators, repository managers,
information studies scholars, and researchers and other data producers need to
come together to develop relevant metrics to measure and document impact and
outcomes. To this end, the College of Information Studies, University of
Maryland, College Park proposes to facilitate a workshop that will gather these
various stakeholders for open discussion around digital data repository impact
and evaluation. The goal of this workshop is to identify the current metrics,
tools, and practices that are effective, and the issues that will require
additional research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improvements to metrics used for the
evaluation of digital repository services and their impacts on research is a
topic which is well-suited to the workshop format in this proposal.
Conversations across stakeholder communities do not happen often enough, but
they are vital to the sustainable development of digital data repositories. This
workshop will bring together a diverse set of stakeholders around digital data
repositories to discuss strategies and methods to better assess the impact of
repository services. Impact assessments are key to understanding outcomes and
necessary to refine and modify programs and infrastructures. The development of
more robust repository metrics will influence and transform practices in these
organizations, broadening access to research data. Additionally, a report will
be publicly released following the workshop so the results will have increased
visibility beyond the participants and their&lt;br/&gt;institutions.
