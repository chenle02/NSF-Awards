The proposed equipment will be the basis of an electro-optic sampling system
for the picosecond characterization of very high speed photodetectors,
modulators and superconducting striplines and associated devices, such as
superconducting resonators. The high speed dynamics of gain switched and mode
locked semiconductor lasers will be characterized. The short high power pulses
from this laser will be used to study the high speed transport and optical
characteristics of compound semiconductors, particularly superlattices and
quantum confined structures in the A1GaAs and GaInAsP material systems. Finally,
this laser will be used for optical pumping and characterization of
semiconductor lasers, particularly surface emitting lasers and high speed
modulation doped multiquantum well lasers.
