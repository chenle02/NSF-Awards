This project is a doctoral dissertation improvement award to determine whether
changes to the enforcement levels of federal anti-discrimination legislation
have been effective in increasing the extension of residential mortgage credit
to minority neighborhoods by retail lending institutions. In particular,
amendments were implemented in 1989 to the Fair Housing Act of 1968 that
substantially increased the type of cases that the Department of Justice could
pursue as well as allowed for compensatory and punitive damages in these cases.
This project purchases Home Mortgage Act Disclosure (HMDA) data which all retail
banking institutions are required to file yearly. The data has been collected
yearly since 1975 and includes information on the types of loans, number of
loans and dollar amounts of lending by geographic area. Thus HMDA data is ideal
for utilization in answering the question of interest. The HMDA data purchased
will be housed at the University of California at Los Angels' Institute for
Social Science Research (ISSR) Data Archives for potential use by other
researchers and students.
