During the first year of the PYI program research will concentrate in the area
of computer vision inspection. An element of success will be the integration of
state-of-the-art technology into the development of an automatic on-line
inspection system. The system, consisting of a mechanical handler, a vision
system, and a dedicated computer, will inspect parts with a polygonal profile
and reject those with out-of-tolerance dimensions, or surface flaws.
Optimization techniques will be developed to analyze digital images in order to
determine the orientation of parts and to perform dimensional measurement. The
techniques must have the flexibility to handle parts with different polygonal
shapes, size, and tolerance levels. Quality control issues and procedures to
facilitate the real-time implementation of the techniques will also be
investigated.
