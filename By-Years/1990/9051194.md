A new laboratory equipped with Macintosh II computers running Mathematica and
LOGO is benefiting calculus students, prospective K-6 teachers, and students in
differential equations and modeling courses. Instructional modules are being
tested that emphasize experimentation, interpreting and organizing information,
problem solving, and drawing logical conclusions. The institution will
contribute an amount equal to the award.
