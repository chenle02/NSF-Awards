9316419 Mehldahl As a young, actively rifting ocean basin, the Gulf of
California represents an excellent opportunity to combine studies of modern
marine sedimentary environments and faunas with studies of the Neogene rock
record to understand better the evolution of rift basins and the fossil record
that they accumulate. PI will provide models of lithofacies, biofacies and
taphofacies for paleoenvironmental analysis of marine rift basins, with specific
application to tectonic evolution of the Gulf of California. He will also
investigate factors that control time-averaging and taphonomy in fossil
assemblages. Collaboration is established with Mexican colleagues.
