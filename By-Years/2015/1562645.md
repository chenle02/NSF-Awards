Medical research has recently established the high frequency of New-Onset
Diabetes After Transplant (NODAT), which refers to the incidence of diabetes in
transplanted patients with no prior history of diabetes. The dynamic and complex
interactions between immunosuppressive drugs used to ensure organ survival,
medications used to prevent NODAT, and the simultaneous risks of NODAT and organ
rejection has created a conundrum for physicians, leaving them in an ambiguous
state in their post-transplant decisions. To assist physicians, the research
will develop mathematical models using techniques from operations research,
statistics, and econometrics. The models will consider multiple perspectives
including a patient's quality adjusted lifespan, the risk of developing NODAT,
the risk of organ rejection, the potential errors in estimating the health
transition and observation probabilities, and the sensitivity and specificity of
available medical tests. If successful, this collaborative award will help
generate new guidelines and a data-driven decision support system that has the
potential to increase patient safety and help hospitals reduce NODAT, organ
rejection, and patient mortality.

The intellectual merits of the research include new directions for applications
of operations research to healthcare. Specifically, the models consider the
decision-maker's pessimism/optimism, direct incorporation of time-varying
medical risk factors, and empower the decision maker to dynamically optimize
with respect to a "cloud" of models (as opposed to a single model), thereby
gaining robustness to potential model misspecifications without the need to
perform sensitivity analyses. This is in sharp contrast with currently available
techniques that solve a single dynamic optimization model (with parameters
estimated from data sets), and then attempt to mitigate potential estimation
errors via sensitivity analyses. Although motivated by the interactions between
immunosuppressive drugs and diabetes medications for NODAT patients, the
methodological contributions have other potential uses, such as in advancing the
science of medication management for a variety of diseases for which therapeutic
interventions have conflicting effects.
