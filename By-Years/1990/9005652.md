The 1990 Theoretical Advanced Study Institute will be held June 4-29, 1990 at
the University of Colorado in Boulder. This summer school for advanced graduate
students in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on testing the
standard model of the fundamental forces and particles. Lectures will be given
by leading physicists on a variety of topics both within and somewhat beyond the
standard model. The summer school will make a very important contribution to the
advanced education of graduate students from throughout the United States. In
view of currently emerging data which sensitively probes the standard model, the
topic of the school is very timely.
