In this project studies of the circulation in the Gulf of Maine will be carried
out using data from an NSF-sponsored field program conducted during 1982-1986.
Coupling of the currents with the wind stress, wind stress curl, and subtidal
current fluctuations will be addressed. Additional studies of tidal harmonics
and nutrient fluxes will be attempted, incorporating data from other studies as
well.
