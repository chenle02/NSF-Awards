The emergence of optical fabrication as a viable process to produce
3-dimensional models and parts rapidly and economically will have significant
impact in several industrially important areas. Computer-designed parts can be
converted overnight to plastic models which can be used to make precision
tooling, verify design suitability and many other functions. Students are able
to create models from their CAD/CAM programs, creating the opportunity for
numerous laboratory projects and experiments. This technology is being
introduced immediately into the undergraduate curriculum in mechanical
engineering, manufacturing, industrial engineering, architectural engineering
and physics. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal
investigator's institution. //
