The Wabash seminar and miniconference series, which is organized by a consortium
of Midwestern mathematics departments, has for over forty years provided a
catalyst for the stimulation and dissemination of significant contributions to a
wide range of areas of modern analysis, with a primary focus on functional and
harmonic analysis. The format for Wabash events provides ample opportunity for
graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.
