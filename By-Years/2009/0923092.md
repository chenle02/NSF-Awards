With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the
Department of Chemistry at Knox College will acquire a stopped flow apparatus to
investigate protein design, structure and folding for oligomeric proteins. The
stopped-flow unit will allow the identification of a fast (burst) phase that is
often associated with the initial step of folding of a protein, especially for
many oligomeric proteins that involve the initial folding of the monomer
followed by individual monomers interacting to form the quaternary structure.
The model oligomeric proteins, WT GrpE and GrpE 1-112, and various other
appropriate GrpE variant proteins will be investigated.

A stopped-flow apparatus is used for rapid mixing and monitoring of changes
using spectroscopic techniques to observe the progress of the change or a
reaction. In these studies the change in a circular dichroism spectrum will be
monitored, or else the protein fluorescence or the absorbance spectrum, as
appropriate. This acquisition will permit more projects for student researchers
and improve the quality of their research training. Additionally, students
majoring in biochemistry or chemistry at Knox College will have the opportunity
to use the stopped-flow accessory in upper level elective courses with
laboratory components.
