This project analyzes non-standard forms of language use that arise in sustained
language contact scenarios. Using elicited and spontaneous language production,
the effects of implicit and explicit langauge attitudes are also analyzed.
Languages that are in sustained contact often experience language change that is
the result of one language on the other. These transfer effects may occur for
grammatical features that are present in one language but absent in the other.
This difference may give rise to the increased use of non-standard forms as
compared to non-contact varieties of the same langauge. This research
contributes to the understanding and description of non-standard language use in
a large scale analysis that systematically investigates language use across
levels of education, bilingual profiles, generations, and location. By examining
such non-standard language use, this research contributes important empirical
data on whether smaller minority languages can have transfer effects on a
majority language. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior observations on non-standard
language use in contact settings have traditionally related non-standard forms
to lower levels of education. This project tests this claim by investigating
age, native language, language of schooling, level of education, as well as
linguistic contexts. To investigate non-standard forms, speakers engage in a
45-minute-long semi-structured sociolinguistic interview. Participantsâ€™ implicit
attitudes towards non-standard agreement are examined in an experimental task
where they hear standard and non-standard forms, while rating what they hear.
Explicit language attitudes are measured by participants' response to two
explicit questions on their attitudes towards non-standard language use. The
data obtained from this research provides a rich data set with comprehensive
information on the social and linguistic factors that influence non-standard
language variants, as well as the influence of language attitudes on production.
This research contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying
language change in contact scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
