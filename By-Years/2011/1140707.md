One significant social problem in many countries is the very poor social health
in indigenous communities. While every native community has a substantial
proportion of people who are healthy and well, there are also often a proportion
of the population suffering from substance abuse, including especially from
alcohol and gasoline sniffing; from suicide and domestic violence. The rates of
these indicators of poor social health can be much higher in native communities
than in either the general population or among ethnic minorities in the general
population. This comparative research project will work with four native
populations: two small groups in North and South Carolina, which although
historically stressed by poverty and prejudice have very good social health, and
two northern (sub-arctic) populations (both Inuit and Indian/Innu) where the
social health is less good. This research project will focus on developing and
refining the concept of lived history: the various ways native people see and
live the connections between a not-quite-past and their sense of an impending
future. This sense of a continuing history that people live, in their everyday
lives, will be examined to see what role it plays in the production and
maintenance of social health in native communities.
