In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Hochstrasser will study ultrafast molecular dynamics in condensed
phases using femtosecond laser pulses to obtain spectra in the visible and
infrared. Energy flow in molecules which are subject to collisions in a liquid
and the flow of the energy out of the molecule into the surroundings are the
subject of these experiments. Three areas of study are torsional relaxation of
polyenes, proton transfer reactions, and reactive and nonreactive vibrational
relaxation. The collisionally induced processes are examined in the liquid phase
on the time scale of collisions themselves. %%% The study of the transformation
of energetically excited molecules in condensed phases from one molecular
isomeric configuration to another will significantly expand our knowledge of how
a complex molecule undergoes internal rearrangements and how these are mediated
by a surrounding solvent.
