This award supports fundamental research to provide new knowledge toward
understanding the effect of market-based incentives on the implementation of
carbon capture and storage systems for reducing carbon emissions from coal and
natural gas power plants. The results of this research can help policy makers
evaluate proposed policies dealing with carbon capture and storage methods.
Additionally, the research program encourages underrepresented undergraduate and
graduate students to become researchers and will broaden science, technology,
engineering and mathematics participation. The program provides pre-college
students the opportunity to participate in an interactive educational activity
involving both environmental science and operations management. Overall, the
results from this research will benefit education at all levels from pre-college
to post-graduate. The data and code developed under this award will be shared
with the research community.

The research objective of this project is to determine the effect of market-
based incentives on the implementation of carbon capture and storage technology
through theoretical extensions of mechanism design and simulation optimization.
The research team will investigate the intrinsic relationships among contract
prices and quantities, cost structures, and emissions profiles using a mechanism
design framework. This approach will help the storage operator decide which
emissions sources to serve, what contract prices and quantities to offer to
induce emission sources to participate, and what pipeline capacity to build.
This research will also examine the impact of a cap-and-trade policy by
incorporating permit trading explicitly in the decisions of carbon capture and
storage participants, and compare the efficiency against that of a carbon tax
policy. Lastly, the team will create a simulation optimization framework to
optimize contract design when data is available but the mechanism design
formulation is analytically intractable.
