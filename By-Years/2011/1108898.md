The surfaces of icy Solar System bodies are predominantly water ice, with small
amounts of methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and ammonia. The
outer surfaces are constantly subject to photon irradiation and particle
bombardment, the solar wind, cosmic rays, and chemical reactions on surfaces, in
addition to thermal cycling. In this project, the collaborating team will
continue, with renewed NSF support, their laboratory experiments on the physics
of extreme ultraviolet (EUV)-vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photolysis of cosmic ice
analogs. They plan simultaneous investigations of photon-induced chemical
reactions and photodesorption in ice analogs containing water and other relevant
species. A tunable intense synchrotron radiation light source available at the
National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan, will provide the
required EUV-VUV photons. The team will identify the type of molecules that form
in the ice samples, and those that come off the ice surfaces, quantify their
production yields, understand their production mechanisms, the destruction
yields (lifetimes or stabilities) of the parent ice molecule(s), and ascertain
their significance in astronomical environments. Much of the sophisticated
equipment and advanced experimental techniques required for the proposed work
have been developed by the team with prior NSF funding. The results will be
particularly relevant to understanding of the water-rich icy satellites of the
giant planets, comets, the interstellar medium, molecular clouds, and
protostellar regions. The research results will also be incorporated into
teaching materials for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses. The project
will train a postdoctoral associate and a graduate student, with an emphasis on
working with a synchrotron radiation facility.
