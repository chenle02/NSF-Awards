*** 9760425 Hood Cornerstone Research Inc. will develop a dynamic latching add-
drop multiplexer for use in reconfigurable dense wavelength division
multiplexing optical communications networks. The device is designed to tap an
optical fiber carrying several communication channels, and is dynamic because
any channel can be electronically selected. Furthermore, the device has a
latching capability because no electric field is required to maintain the
optical configuration of the device once it is set. These performance
capabilities are made possible by a newly developed class of electrooptic
material. ***
