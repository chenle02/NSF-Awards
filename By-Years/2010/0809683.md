This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports Professor Frederick Luzzio at the University of Louisville to
investigate alkynylogation in order to promote the transmission of electronic
effects between a nucleophilic or electrophilic center through the intermediacy
of a triple bond, and the conversion of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) into
functionalized fluorinated building blocks through C-F activation of some
fluorines within the molecule. The alkynylogation effects will be studied using
a triple bond extended aldol (alkynylogous aldol) reaction as a working model,
utilizing modern synthetic tools capable of controlling the regio- and
stereochemistry. Specifically, the effect of size and Lewis acidity of the
cation counterion of a base on the gamma-directed alkynylogous aldol reaction
will be investigated; the effects of Lewis acid on the regio- and
stereoselectivity of Mukaiyama type alkynylogous aldol reaction, and the
reaction of silylketene acetals with electrophiles. Transformative fluorination
will be pursued through the functionalization of industrially available,
ecologically benign, three- or four-carbon HFCs by selectively removing
fluorine, utilizing C-F bond activation reactions. A second generation of
difluoropropargyl synthons will also be developed utilizing environmentally
friendly reagents and conditions, capable of engendering cyclic precursors
fitted with synthetic handles that maximize structural diversity.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims for practical approaches, and
environmentally friendly uses of materials and for organic synthesis. The
project will train a younger generation of chemists in synthesis and
organofluorine chemistry and advance the education of underrepresented
minorities.&lt;br/&gt;
