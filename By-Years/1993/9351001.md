Parallel processing as a subject has already been introduced in the CSE
curriculum by an Honors program in Parallel Processing. Through this ILI
program, we introduce an instructional plan to make the subject available to all
CSE majors in order to prepare them for large-scale, meaningful parallel
processing projects in the Senior Design Project courses. This plan includes:
introducing an applied parallel processing topics course, covering parallel
processing as a subject in the Senior Design Project courses, and making the
proposed equipment available to undergraduate courses for programming exercises.
In addition, several new industry-sponsored, parallel processing student
projects will be introduced in the Senior Design Project course sequence.One of
the goals of the Senior Design Project course sequence is to provide real-life
industry-like experiences for our undergraduate students through industry-
sponsored projects. Because of the interest of local industries in the proposed
ILI program, a major portion of the institutional matching funds has been
provided by contributions (contingent on this NSF grant) from E-Systems and
Mercury Computer Systems. Thus, this project will provide a unique opportunity
for us to achieve our goals through the cooperation and contributions of the
NSF, UTA, and industry.
