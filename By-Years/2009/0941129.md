The principal investigators (PIs) plan to carry out an exploratory research
campaign in a mega-city environment in Tianjin, China (near Beijing). The PIs
will focus on three topics: 1) accuracy and completeness of the gas phase
emission inventory with an emphasis upon understanding emission sector
contributions; 2) analysis of ozone indicator species, photochemical processing
of volative organic compounds (VOCs) and related features of VOC/NOx (nitrogen
oxide) limitations in the region; and 3) investigation of particulate emissions
and aging with an emphasis upon partitioning of semi-volatile compounds (SVOC)
between gas and vapor phases. The end products will be a better understanding of
ozone and aerosol formation and fate within this megacity region and a better
basis for placing the impact of this megacity in perspective with respect to
future change in China. In the three week field program, the PIs will operate
from a tall flux tower. This will involve chemical speciation of ambient VOCs
and size distributions of aerosols coupled with NOy, CO, SO2, and O3
measurements and boundary layer lidar sensing. This work will be carried out in
collaboration with scientists from the local Tianjin University as well as with
NCAR scientists, who will be at the field site during the same time period
(September 2010).

Gaining an initial understanding of atmospheric chemical cycles within this
region will benefit overall understanding of megacity impacts on regional and
global chemistry and thus benefit societal decisions regarding global change.
The work will also target undergraduate and graduate student education through
the PIs' NSF REU atmospheric chemistry program and a new and novel Atmospheric
Policy Trajectory (APT) program.
