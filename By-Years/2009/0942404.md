Multidisciplinary or Interdisciplinary (99) &lt;br/&gt;Northwestern University's
Searle Center for Teaching Excellence together with the City Colleges of Chicago
(CCCs) are piloting a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
faculty development program focused on improving higher order learning outcomes
of STEM students. This pilot program consists of STEM faculty from two very
different higher education institutions (a Private Research university and a
large urban Community College and) with very different missions, faculty and
student populations. Equal numbers of faculty from each institution participate
in a linked series of workshops spanning one and a half academic years. This
faculty development program is designed to assist STEM faculty in developing
skills in critically reflecting on key issues in learning and teaching in higher
education to improve STEM students' higher order learning outcomes. The project
includes a rigorous evaluation plan to examine the effectiveness of the program
both sites with respect to changes in (i) instructional and assessment
practices, (ii) faculty approaches and conceptions of teaching, and (iii)
student learning outcomes. In addition the effectiveness of this program is
compared to the effectiveness of other Faculty Development programs. A unique
model of faculty development is incorporated that goes beyond both traditional
teaching-focused and student-focused conceptions and focuses on learning-
centered conceptions and approaches to teaching. The program draws upon the
latest research, scholarship and best practices on learning, teaching and
faculty development. Participants design discipline-specific assessments based
on the Critical Thinking Assessment Test (CAT), to collect data on their
students' learning outcomes, across two successive cohorts, for the purpose of
informing their teaching and ultimately improving their students' learning. The
project addresses a very wide gap in the research and literature on the impact
of STEM faculty development with respect to bringing about meaningful change in
faculty teaching and, more importantly, in the higher order learning outcomes of
their students and the national use of assessment in program and school
accreditation. More immediate impacts include those on the higher order learning
outcomes of undergraduate STEM students across a wide level of expertise and
preparedness. The project's research findings and program model have the
potential to impact STEM faculty and their students across the spectrum of
higher education.
