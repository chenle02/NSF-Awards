9320497 Grether Psychologists have identified a number of rules or heuristic
that individuals may use in making judgements about the likelihood of uncertain
events. Recent studies in experimental economics and psychology have focused on
finding the best fitting model from an ex ante natural class of models to some
experimental data in ways that allow for subject differences in decision rules.
But these data mining exercises limit subjects to a few pre-determined rules.
Proper statistical analysis of these data may be impossible, if patterns of
behavior do not fit into one of the pre-specified models. The contribution of
this project comes from generalizing the single model selection approach by
allowing subjects to be explained by different models and generalizing the
standard data mining approach by choosing rules that best explain the subjects'
behavior from a large potential class of rules. The project develops a procedure
for analyzing data on individual choice and market experiments that rigorously
estimates the number of rules used by subjects, estimates what those rules are,
and classifies subjects by decisionmaking rules used. The theoretical and
practical aspects of this procedure are studied. The procedure is used to design
and conduct experiments that can best discriminate between different decision
rules, minimizing misclassification errors and biases in estimates. The
technique is applied to data from double auction experiments.
