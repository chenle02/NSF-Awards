The genetic response to pH change will be investigated in Escherichia coli.
External pH is a major environmental parameter for bacteria, and internal pH is
significant in terms of bacterial physiology and energy transduction. Two novel
pH- regulated loci, isolated as lacZ operon fusions, will be studied: ina
inducible by membrane-permeable weak acids and protonophores, and alx inducible
by external base. These loci will be cloned and sequenced, and their sequences
analyzed for promoters and regulatory sites. The possible regulatory role of
acid-sensitive sequences such as H-DNA will be investigated. The pH dependence
of ina transcription will be tested in vitro. Regulator genes for ina and alx
will be isolated, by screening Tn10 pools for isolates which are either
constitutive or uninducible. Mutants exhibiting defective pH homeostasis will be
sought.
