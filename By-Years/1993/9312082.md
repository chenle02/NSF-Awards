9312082 Espenson This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State University in the purchase
of a high resolution 400 MHz, multinuclear, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectrometer. This upgrade will enhance greatly research in a number of areas
including the following: 1) Organometallic chemistry of the transition metals,
2) The development of new synthetic routes to alkaloids using bridgehead
radicals and carbanions, 3) The exploration of novel synthetic routes to
pleurotin and podophyllotoxin using photochemical hydrogen atom
abstraction/cycloaddition, 4) The coordination and organometallic chemistry of
metalloporphyrins, 5) Structural and conformational characterization of novel
atranes, 6) Non-covalent binding of substrates by synthetic receptors, 7) A
study of the fundamental thermal reactions of organic compounds, 8) An NMR study
of free radical and electron transfer processes. %%% A nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectrometer is used to obtain information about molecular
structure (what types of carbon and/or hydrogen atoms and/or hetero-atoms are
present, what are the relative number of each type of atoms and how are they
connected to one another in the molecule) and molecular dynamics (how rapidly
are the various parts of the molecule moving). This instrument is essential for
any meaningful, modern synthetic chemistry research program. ***
