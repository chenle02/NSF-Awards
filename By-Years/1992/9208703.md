This project, supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program, involves a combined experimental and theoretical study of the
photochemical reactions of a variety of dinuclear metal carbonyl complexes. The
objective of the study is to develop a detailed understanding of the elementary
processes that accompany absorption of a photon by the organometallic molecule
and how these are affected by changes in the ligands. The research will proceed
with conventional preparative scale photolyses, matrix isolation, and flash
photolysis studies of several series of dinuclear compounds in which the
bridging ligands, terminal ligands and metal atoms are varied. These studies
will be followed by detailed, ultrafast laser studies designed to probe the
elementary processes. In addition to monitoring by conventional visible
spectroscopy, picosecond, transient Raman scattering and infrared techniques
will also be used in order to obtain structural information concerning transient
intermediates. Finally, molecular dynamics will be modeled via theoretical
electronic structure calculations using both approximate and ab initio
computational methods. %%% This research is designed to experimentally and
theoretically investigate events that occur extremely rapidly following
absorption of a photon by an organometallic compound. Through the combination of
experimental and theoretical studies to be utilized it is expected that our
understanding of these events will develop to the point that in the future
predictions can be made about how the reactivity of an organometallic compound
will be affected by changes in the groups attached to the metal atom. Ultimately
these results may be important in the synthesis of new materials and in the
design of new catalysts.
