This request is for an integrated system of state-of-the art instruments for
recording and analyzing human multi-joint movement. These instruments will
enable simultaneous measurement of movement kinematics (position-time
functions), kinetics (forces), and muscle activity patterns. The system will be
used for both research and research training related to the control of human
posture and movement. The focus of the research activities will d the control of
goal-directed arm reaching movements and associated postural adjustments.
However, the system will also support work on other multi-joint behaviors
including gait and balance control. In addition to instruments for measuring
kinematics, kinetics and electormyographic (emg) activity, the system will
include a device for servo- controlling the forces exerted hand during arm
movements and for controlling the visual information available to the subject
during visually guided reaches.
