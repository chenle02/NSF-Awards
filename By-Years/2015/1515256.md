Mobile phones have become an ever-present part of our society bringing to the
forefront increasing concerns related to security. Mobile devices are being used
to commit crimes and are becoming a target to gain user information for harmful
intentions. Mobile security remains a top concern to businesses. The project
advances both knowledge and education in the field of mobile cybersecurity and
cyber forensics by creating an online Mobile Forensics and Security (MFS)
certificate program and developing and implementing a train-the-trainer program
for Computer Information Systems faculty. This will increase Robert Morris
University's capacity to train MFS specialists and the capacity of other
institutions to offer programs in this area once their faculty has been trained.

The project will provide the MFS train-the-trainer program through onsite and
online training programs using Blackboard and VMWare to 20 faculty members by
the end of the grant period, and annually thereafter and offer an online
certificate program in Mobile Forensics and Security by Fall 2016. The
certificate program will be combined with hands on internships that will equip
students with the skills needed to secure a mobile environment. Through
partnerships with Middle Georgia State College and Southeastern Advanced
Cybersecurity Education Consortium that serve a large number of African American
students and rural students, the project will expand training and certificate
course offerings for these underrepresented groups. As a result of the project,
by 2018-2019, at least 20 additional faculty members will be trained and fully
equipped to teach mobile forensics. They, in turn, will be able to train others
on their campuses and potentially impact thousands of students trained in mobile
security, thereby improving cybersecurity in a variety of U.S. industry sectors
and government.
