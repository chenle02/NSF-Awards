Six investigators, plus postdoctoral associates and graduate students, will
carry out research in elementary particle theory (Physics). Subjects to be
studied include: continuum quantum chromodynamics (QCD); lattice QCD with
special reference to matrix elements of weak processes; supergravity and
superstring theory, including loop-by-loop string perturbation theory and
unitarity and loop corrections to the string equations of motion; special field
theories with generalized statistics and anomalies (related to so-called quantum
groups); early-universe dynamics, including out-of- equilibrium inflation and
high-temperature non-classical sphalerons; gauge theories with fermions and
scalars that are asymptotically-free in all couplings; resonant e+-e- pair
production in heavy-nucleus collisions. The studies will include both novel and
more conventional approaches to some of today's most important and most
interesting problems in elementary particle theory.
