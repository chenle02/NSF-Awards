This engineering education research award to Purdue University will employ
researchers to use current technology in 3-D virtual world environments and
virtual organizations to improve the development of design skills for
engineering students. The virtual design studios would provide the opportunity
for team-based inquiry and collaboration and would help students learn both
content and processes such as evaluating design alternatives and making design
decisions. Students would participate in a virtual research and design firm and
would analyze and design aircraft and compete for contracts. The methods and
results of this research will advance general understanding of how virtual
design environments and serious games using technology that is familiar and
attractive to students can be used to improve engineering education, provide
collaboration opportunities for geographically distributed teams, and help
prepare students for engineering jobs.
