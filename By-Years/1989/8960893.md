AZDU, the dimethyl analog of AZT, is slated for clinical testing as a
therapeutic in the treatment of AIDS. The current production of AZT is by the
solution method and what small amounts have been made of AZDU have also been
made via the solution method. Isolation and purification of the product is
expensive, labor-intensive and results in substantial losses. Maximum yield that
can be realized is around 40%. The objective of this research is to develop an
alternative, more efficient process for the production of AZDU. It is based on
the basic principle that product isolation from a reaction mixture is trivial if
the product is attached to an insoluble polymer. Isolation then involves nothing
more than a simple filtration of the resin. During Phase I of this Small
Business Innovation Research project the possibility of making AZDU on a resin
support will be explored. Specifically the PI will attempt to (1) select a
suitably functionalized polymer to act as insoluble support in the conversion of
deoxyuridine to AZDU, (2) effect the synthesis of AZDU on several samples of
polymer in at least respectable yield, (3) learn enough about the kinetics of
the individual steps to plan optimization for the future work of Phase II, and
(4) generate a base set of quantitative data for a preliminary economic
analysis, i.e. materials use, yield, polymer recycle, etc.
