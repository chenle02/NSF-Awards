This award provides funding to support the participation of graduate students at
the 2003 International Society of Industrial Ecology meeting to be held in Ann
Arbor, Michigan at the University of Michigan June 29-July 2, 2003. Founded in
2001, this is the second meeting of ISIE, a new professional society dedicated
to advance the evolving discipline of industrial ecology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the field is about a decade old, this new avenue for
disseminating international research and education advances reflects the
expanding activities of this community of researchers. The ecological frame
lends a broad systems orientation, typically going beyond the concepts of
narrower academic fields, and participation in this international meeting will
broaden the experiences and open up directions in pollution prevention for
graduate students while advancing their professional career paths. &lt;br/&gt;
