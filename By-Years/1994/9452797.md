9452797 Lee The Louisiana State University at Baton Rouge will initiate a four-
week, residential, Young Scholars Project in astronomy and space science for 24
female students entering grade 10. The participants will learn the methodology
of science research by immersion into the research activity of senior faculty in
the Department of Physics and Astronomy and other faculty in the physical
science departments of the College of Basic Sciences. The students will be
involved in classroom lectures and discussions, hands-on laboratory and research
activities, field trips, and seminars that will expose them to the nature and
excitement of space research and its application to additional disciplines such
as computer and information science, geophysics and the environmental sciences.
