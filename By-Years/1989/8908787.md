In the midst of growing participation of women in the labor force generally and
in service jobs in particular, numerous studies have explored the effects of
women's employment per se on family life. What these studies have largely
neglected, however, are the processes by which these effects (for example, on
marriages) come about, as well as the emotional aspects of work roles. This
planning grant proposes several activities relevant to the PI's future research
into the relationship between women's management of emotional expressions on the
job and the performance of women's roles in the home. Among these activities is
the identification and measurement of emotional components of jobs, largely
overlooked in the previous and extensive literature on job characteristics. Also
planned are interviews with samples of women whose jobs involve extensive vs.
modest emotional components and interviews with personnel managers of companies.
