The ability to express scientific ideas in both written and oral form is an
important 21st century skill. Teachers, employers, and college faculty lament
the inability of many high school graduates to write clearly. This deficit in
writing is due in part because teachers do not have the time to provide
appropriate, timely feedback to students on their writing. This project would
help teachers help students achieve these skills through automating an effective
feedback process, in ways that are customized to particular disciplines and
local classroom needs, particularly in high needs districts. The project will
contribute to knowledge about how students learn to write and how computer
assisted systems can support this learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will develop and test three tools: 1) Teaching resources organized as
developmental trajectories for teachers to use (e.g. from more simple to more
complex; with diagnostics and strategies for addressing particular challenges);
2) A teacher dashboard that uses Artificial Intelligence tools to provide timely
formative assessment to teachers by highlighting problem areas in their
students' writing and peer reviews; and 3) An online teacher resource exchange
to rapidly grow the set of appropriate assignments that can be used with this
approach, critically filtered by student performance metrics. The project builds
on a current system called SWoRD, which supports student peer reviewing in many
disciplines within and beyond science. Working with six lead teachers and larger
set of pilot teachers, the project will develop a trajectory of effective
writing assignments in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. In year three, there
will be a summative evaluation with 90 teachers.
