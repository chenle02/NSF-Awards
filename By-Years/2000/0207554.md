&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Planning Grant for Infrastructure in Technology,
Engineering, Mathematics, and Sciences (ITEMS) will enable Lawson State
Community College (LSCC) to assess the current status of its science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) infrastructure; provide the
institution the opportunity to identify and describe the challenges and barriers
to SMET infrastructure development; and, develop a plan of action to engage more
community college students in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning
grant will lead the way for a more focused effort designed to fill&lt;br/&gt;the
STEM infrastructure gaps at LSCC and help prepare proficient STEM professionals
for the current and future workforce. Proposed efforts involve partnerships with
business and industry.&lt;br/&gt;
