Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to improve
inquiry-based instruction of science, technology, and mathematics in Appalachian
middle schools. The program will provide fellowships for eight graduate and four
undergraduate students per year to work with twelve science and mathematics
middle school teachers from six different middle schools. Each Fellow will team
up with a middle school teacher and a university mentor to develop and implement
inquiry-based activities, designed to meet Kentucky and national education
standards. Several training sessions, including an intensive one-week summer
workshop, are planned for all participants. Overall the project will have broad
impact, as it is expected to lead to enriched learning by middle school
students, provision of professional development opportunities for middle school
teachers, improved communication and teaching skills for the Fellows, and
strengthened partnerships between EKU and regional middles schools. Part of the
support for this project comes from the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical
Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Enhancing Inquiry-Based Science and Math
