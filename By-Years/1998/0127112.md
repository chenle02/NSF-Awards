Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is adapting and
implementing a pair of laboratory courses to teach the microfabrication
techniques required to create microdevices. Materials and instrumentation for
microfabrication techniques are being procured and constructed in a laboratory,
and process sequences are being adapted from similar programs and implemented in
the laboratory. Using these facilities and techniques, students are making
transistors and simple MEMS devices. Assessment involves student course
evaluations and peer review where faculty, industrial and government
representatives interested in microfabrication examine the course content,
student work, and student course evaluations. Dissemination plans include
reporting results in journal and conference publications and on a web site and
developing an Internet-based course on microfarication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
