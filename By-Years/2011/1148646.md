Innovation in computer hardware, ranging from the simplest consumer devices to
the most powerful scientific computers, relies on availability of software and
hardware design and evaluation tools. The development of the cyberinfrastructure
is itself a significant undertaking due to the complexity of today's computers
and applications. This complexity has lead to ad-hoc infrastructure that is
difficult to quickly extend in new ways, minimally tested, and arduous to use
for comparing innovations. This burden greatly impedes progress of computer
hardware research and development. The community-driven creation and maintenance
of robust cyberinfrastructure can overcome this challenge by leveraging and
combining effort and investment made by multiple groups. This workshop sets a
foundation to grow a community for developing more reusable, better tested and
interoperable tools. The energy, performance, reliability and cost of
information technology will be further improved at a faster pace as a
result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cyberinfrastructure for computer architecture
(hardware) includes software simulation, hardware emulation, analytic models and
benchmarks for CPU/cache, network-on-a-chip (NoC), memory and storage. These
tools are used to analyze existing systems and their bottlenecks, develop new
hardware capabilities, and study and evaluate design trade-offs. While the tools
are deeply ingrained and fundamental to computer architecture, the architecture
cyberinfrastructure suffers badly from fragmented, ad hoc and disparate efforts,
arising from research expediency and development burden. To address the
situation, this workshop brings together tool developers and users to assess the
current state of the cyberinfrastructure and to establish strategies and build a
community for more coordinated and joint development. The workshop develops 1)
an assessment of the current state of the cyberinfrastructure; 2) roadmaps of
needed tool capabilities and support for future technologies; 3) ways to
leverage and combine disparate development effort by multiple groups; and 4) a
methodology to establish and sustain a cohesive community that builds and
supports a set of open-source, extensible, scalable, validated and interoperable
tools. The workshop outcomes serve building a community framework for simulating
computer architecture.
