Reliable anchors are required to safely develop the strength of composite
prestressing tendons. A program is presented to define, test and evaluate
mechanical, swaged and resin socketed anchors. Both static and fatigue
characteristics of the anchor system will be evaluated. Finite element analysis,
which includes modelling the slip plane surfaces initiate the program. Physical
samples will be manufactured and tested for both solid rod composite tendons and
stranded wire type composite rods.
