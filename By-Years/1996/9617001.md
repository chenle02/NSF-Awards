This award is made under the high performance connections portion of NCRI's
"Connections to the Internet" announcement, NSF 96-64. It provides partial
support for two years for an OC-3 connection to the Very High Performance
Backbone Network Service (vBNS). The connection is through the MREN
(Metropolitan Research and Education Network) ), an OC-12 ATM ring connecting
several research institutions in the Chicago area to each other and to the vBNS.
Applications include projects on compilers, VLSI CAD, distributive higher
performance computing, optimization techniques, and x-ray research.
Collaborating institutions include San Diego Supercomputing Center, Argonne
National Laboratory, Cornell Theory Center, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center,
and the National Center for Supercomputer Applications.
