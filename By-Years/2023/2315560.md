This project aims to serve the national interest by investigating curricular
innovations to engage online STEM students in undergraduate research. While the
benefits of traditional undergraduate research are well-studied, little work has
been done in providing a framework for supporting undergraduate research in a
globally distributed wholly online learning environment. This project will
create an undergraduate STEM research minor to address some of the
administrative and student barriers to engaging in a course-based undergraduate
research experience, and support the minor with workshops available to all
students, mentor training, and a diffuse group of faculty to support students.

The projectâ€™s goals are to broaden the implementation of undergraduate research,
improve student perspectives, and promote STEM career pathways. The discrete
objectives of this 3-year project are to develop and administer a Research
Scholars Program in a wholly online learning environment. The program is
anticipated to increase undergraduate research participation for students
completing STEM degrees exclusively online at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
University and lead to impactful student research outputs, including student
authorship of papers and conference presentations. Engaging in the research
minor and the research experiences is expected to positively influence students'
STEM attitudes and support them in choosing and pursuing STEM career pathways.
Research data include institutional data and qualitative interviews with
students and other stakeholders to best determine the efficacy of the developed
courses and workshops as well as their impact on students and the institution.
The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve
the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged
Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and
implementation of promising practices and tools.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
