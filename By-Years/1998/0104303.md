0104303&lt;br/&gt;Tanis&lt;br/&gt;This award supports John Tanis and students of
Western Michigan University to cooperate with Nikolaus Stolterfoht of the Hahn
Meitner Institute in Berlin, Germany. The research will focus on the
investigation of double-core vacancy production by ions and photons in three-
electron systems. The use of three-electron systems enables a clear
interpretation of the results of measurements, and the relative simplicity of
the systems lends itself to theoretical analysis. A core vacancy in an atom or
ion can occur when an inner-shell electron is excited or ionized through
collision with a photon or a charged particle. If two such vacancies are
produced in a single collision, the mechanisms for the production of the double-
core vacancies can involve electron correlation effects. As a result, the study
of such processes gives insight into the atomic structure and collisional
dynamics of systems with multiply interacting particles. Complementary
facilities and expertise in the German and U.S. groups promise a wide range of
new results from various perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;
