9412481 Golden This Americas Program award will support travel and related
expenses for two US. scientists and four US. students for a collaborative
research project between the Center for Materials Characterization (CMC) at the
University of North Texas and the Instituto Tecnologico de Saltillo (ITS),
Mexico. The group will study and correlate chemical analyses, structure, and
corrosion resistance of films formed by electrode-less deposition. Preparation
of samples, X-ray diffraction, and mechanical testing will be carried out at the
ITS facilities in Saltillo, Mexico. Auger electron spectroscopy, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron, transmission electron, and
scanning tunneling microscopy will be done at CMC in Denton, Texas. This study
is likely to lead to the development of better corrosion resistant coatings and
improved understanding of the relationship of properties to performance. The
project will also serve to provide an international experience to graduate
students through the sharing of facilities and research environments in both
countries. ***
