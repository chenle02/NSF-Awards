9319280 Keating This is a study to find out about how the brain controls the
movement of our eyes during voluntary visually guided tracking of a moving
target. The experiments in this study are designed to determine what role a part
of the forebrain called the frontal eye field pursuit area plays in the control
of these smooth pursuit movements of the eyes. To do this, parts of the
forebrain will be inactivated by either cooling or anesthesia and the effects on
visually guided tracking movements measured. The changes in the eye movements
that result from inactivation will be compared to some of the different
scientific models of how eye movements are controlled. The work will make
significant contributions to our understanding of the frontal eye fields in the
control of voluntary eye movements.
