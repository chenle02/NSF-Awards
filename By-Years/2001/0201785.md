This research will study the incidence of civil unrest in Early Qing China,
from the full establishment of the dynasty in 1645 to the beginning of its
decline in 1795. A database of unrest events, state power, commercial
development, and population to land ratios will be developed based on official
records. Comparisons over time and across areas will be used to evaluate
political, economic, and ecological explanations of social unrest. The results
will be compared to similar studies of China in more turbulent earlier and later
periods in order to evaluate whether the origins of the unrest that pushed China
into its confrontation with modernity can be traced back to the Early Qing
period. The results will also be compared to studies of unrest in Japan and
Europe in order to evaluate the multiple paths to modernity in the East and
West.
