CTS-9500067 Lin U of Cincinnati A magnetron sputtering systems will be purchased
and used to fabricate inorganic membranes. The substrate temperature, substrate
to target distance and deposition time can be controlled manually or
automatically. Termination of the sputtering deposition at a specified film
thickness is also possible. The equipment will allow the development of semi-
permeable nano-structured composite membranes. Ceramic membranes will be used as
the support. The new membranes will have applications in gas separations for the
environmentally conscious manufacture of petrochemicals.
