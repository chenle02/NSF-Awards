This proposal will continue the operation of and data processing for the
magnetometer array across northern Canada namedMACCS (Magnetometer Array for
Cusp and Cleft Studies). The array is jointly operated by Augsburg College and
Boston University, with Augsburg taking responsibility for the four stations in
the western half of the array. Scientific analysis of the data from the array is
foucused on waves, currents and plasma flows associated with the cusp and cleft
regions. Specific investigations will proposed include: determination of the
source (cusp or mantle) of the broadband Pc 1-2 waves observed at very high
latitudes using combined satellite and ground data; determine the source and
generation mechanism for broadband Pc 3-4 waves; investigate SC events using
very high latitude magnetometer data to further elucidate the global morphology
of these events.
