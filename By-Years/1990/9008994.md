This study attempts to understand the evolution of organized religion in
America by focusing on the life-histories of mainstream Protestant denominations
over nearly a century. In particular, it analyzes the determinants of schisms,
by which most new denominations have come into existence, and the demise of
existing denominations through merger. The more conventional approach focuses on
doctrinal disputes as the major determinant of denominational boundaries. By
contrast, this study follows Weber, Troeltsch, and Niebuhr in treating doctrinal
disputes as reflections of larger debates about the relationship between
denominations and the wider social order, and about the nature of authority
within religious communities. Schism and merger are treated as organizational
processes. Drawing on life-histories of 175 mainstream Protestant denominations
between 1890 and 1980, the empirical analysis will be conducted in two parallel
phases. First, they plan to collect detailed qualitative data from archival
sources on subsets of denominations that have experienced schisms and mergers.
The goal is to understand the internal processes by which disputes become
codified into ideologies that set the terms for insurgency and coalition-
building. In the second phase, they will use longitudinal data from the entire
sample of denominations to test hypotheses about the propensity to schism and
merger. They will draw on organizational theory to develop three kinds of
models: structural models that emphasize the internal characteristics of
denominations; ecological models that emphasize competition for organizational
resources; and institutional models that emphasize shifts in the normative
structure of society. The potential contribution of the study to organizational
theory arises from its attention to rates, types, and processes of birth and
death. By synthesizing micro- and macro-level analyses, this study promises to
yield a comprehensive understanding of the process of denominational
reorganization in America.
