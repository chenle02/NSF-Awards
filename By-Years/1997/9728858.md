97288858 Kadanoff This grant supports theoretical research and is funded jointly
by the Divisions of Materials Science and Physics. Topics to be investigated
include: the development of singularities in partial differential equations;
development of techniques for measuring and modeling well-developed turbulence;
the study of interface motions and flows; and the study of models of granular
materials. The research done here will be integrated within a larger effort
which involves close contact with experimentalists, computations and
mathematicians. Specific projects include: (1) the study of singularity
development in second and fourth order partial differential equations, in part
through similarity solutions; (2) further applications of the methods of
statistical physics to the development of dynamical theories for granular
materials; (3) development of models for turbulent behavior with particular
focus upon the time-dependence of the solutions of turbulence models; (4) the
study of interface motion, with particular reference to chaotic dynamical
behaviors and applications to sonoluminescence. %%% This grant supports
