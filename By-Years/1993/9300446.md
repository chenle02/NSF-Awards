Conventional computer models of physical processes demand precise mathematical
accounts of the laws governing the domain and precise numerical measurements of
the particular system being modelled. Human reasoners, by contrast, can often
come to useful conclusions even when they have only a partial model of the
underlying physics or partial knowledge of the parameters of the particular
system. It would be of great practical value and theoretical interest to
implement a computer system that could do likewise. Artificial intelligence work
on qualitative physical reasoning has obtained interesting but limited results
in this direction. Building such systems of greater flexibility and power will
require an extensive study of the issues of representation and inference that
arise within physical reasoning. This work will concentrate primarily on
formally characterizing a wide range of physical domains and the perceptual and
effectual interfaces between robotics and physics; on developing useful
representations for qualitative spatial information and techniques for dealing
with this information; and on developing inference techniques that support
temporal reasoning over extended intervals.
