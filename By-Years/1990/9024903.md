One of the important global changes of the Cenozoic took place during the late
Tertiary (Neogene) when the climate of the present arctic region shifted from
warm temperate to sub arctic. This award supports the study of two sedimentary
sequences in southern Alaska that record the cooling trend near the Arctic
Circle during the Miocene. These sediments represent almost continuous
deposition from about 24 to 4 million years ago (Ma), and include a detailed
record of the cooling from ca.16-5Ma. This project will integrate the results of
pollen analyses and fossil leaf studies to reconstruct a detailed vegetation and
climate chronology of the Miocene and early Pliocene for southern Alaska. The
objective is to build a climate curve based on the ratio of warm-loving and
cool-loving plants for each section. The detailed pollen and climate chronology
can help establish a base-line datum of use in interpreting marine data for the
Neogene of the North Pacific rim.
