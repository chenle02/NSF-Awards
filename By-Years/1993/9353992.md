9353992 Ganesan The objective of this workshop is to both present a course and
develop a problem workbook on air toxics and their control. Offering such a
course in this critical area for 20 undergraduate teaching faculty and involving
them in developing a workbook will significantly enhance their understanding of
the subject and also help them to develop new courses in this area. It is also a
very cost-effective way to disseminate information and to transfer technology.
The workbook, problems and solutions will be generated by an interdisciplinary
environmental team of engineering and applied science faculty. Topics include:
regulatory issues related to air toxics; measurement and estimation of toxic
emissions; control systems for toxic particulates and gaseous emissions;
pollution prevention; economic considerations; health risk assessment,
management and risk communication, control analysis for specific industries;
ethical considerations; and, health/safety and accident/emergency management.
The first draft of the problem workbook will be prepared during a two week (July
94) summer workshop session in 1994. The 1994-1995 academic year will provide an
opportunity to class-room test the effectiveness of the problems in the
workbook. A three day follow-up summer session in late June of 1995 is scheduled
at Manhattan College in New York to provide an opportunity to revise, update,
and edit the workbook, and finalize production and distribution plans for
implementation in undergraduate engineering and applied science curricula. This
is a collaborative effort between two four year undergraduate colleges; Montana
Tech in Butte, Montana, and Manhattan College in Manhattan, New York. ***
