This award supports the research in arithmetic algebraic geometry of Professor
William McCallum of the University of Arizona. Dr. McCallum's project is to
study the Shafarevich-Tate group of elliptic curves and Abelian varieties
defined over number fields in order to verify a number of conjectures of
Kolyvagin. The elliptic curves under consideration will be modular, while the
Abelian varieties to be studied will all be Jacobian varieties of Fermat curves.
Arithmetic algebraic geometry is a subject that combines the techniques of
algebraic geometry and number theory. In its original formulation, algebraic
geometry treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest
equations, namely polynomials. Number theory started with the whole numbers and
such questions as divisibility of one whole number by another. These two
subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from the
earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual influence has
increased greatly. The field of arithmetic algebraic geometry now uses
techniques from all of modern mathematics, and is having corresponding influence
beyond its own borders.
