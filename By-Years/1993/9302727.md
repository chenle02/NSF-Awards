This project will provide information on scientist, engineer, and technician
(SET) employment in industry. It will develop national estimates from the on-
going Occupational Employment Statistics Survey of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS) which provides annual information on employment in detailed
occupations by industry. The OES is a Federal-State cooperative program in which
State Employment Security Agencies collect data following BLS specifications.
Data collection occurs on a three-year cycle, sequentially covering
manufacturing, non- manufacturing, and trade and regulated (communications,
public utilities, and transportation) industries and colleges and universities.
The OES data help NSF meet its mandate under the National Science Act to develop
and maintain a database of demographic, educational, and employment information
on SET. The OES surveys are a key part of the system for developing such
information. Thus, the survey data: a. helps in developing an accurate profile
of U. S. SET personnel; b. are used in analyzing the supply of and demand for
scientists and engineers; c. are used to develop current estimates of SET
employment in total and by detailed SET field and industry; and d. allow
identification of SET growth fields, and those in decline or otherwise changing.
