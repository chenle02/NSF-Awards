The outstanding Princeton research group will carry out a broad program of
theoretical and experimental work on extragalactic astronomy, cosmology and the
physics of the early universe. Among the topics to be studied are: 1. Sky maps
of the 2.8 K cosmic background radiation. This can better test theories but
requires new techniques, considerably larger experimental efforts, and better
observing sites. 2. The long wavelength part of the 2.8 K CBR. Measurements at
10 to 50 cm wave lengths require detailed treatment of radiation from the
galaxy, but the results would be invaluable for tests of theories of the origin
of perturbations to the spectrum. 3. Observational studies of galaxy formation.
An experiment designed to measure fluctuations in the sub-mm background may
detect young galaxies with high star formation. Proposed X-ray observations of
rich clusters at redshifts z ~ 1 are a critical test of the biased cold dark
matter theory. 4. Theoretical studies of the evolution of the large-scale
structure of the universe. A new numerical technique should be well suited to
the study of the primeval mass fluctuations needed to produce observed
structures by gravity. The numerical renormalization group method will be used
to study evolution from fractal primeval density fluctuations. Semi-
phenomenological theories of the origin of the large-scale structure of the
universe will also be explored.
