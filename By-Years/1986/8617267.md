This research project is for a broad, systematic investigation of statistical
earthquake recurrence models, with the objective of improving engineering
seismic hazard analysis. The models to be studied range from current renewal
models to a variety of new models, including (l) "characteristic earthquake
processes," (2) hybrid and coupled slip-time predictable models, (3) and
stochastic models of spatial and temporal variation along the fault plane. This
suite of models will be used interactively, e.g., the more physically- based
models helping to support and/or constrain the more empirical models.
Comparative numerical studies will be made with the different models concerning
both recurrence predictions and site-hazard analyses. This comparison will set
the limits of validity of current (Poisson) models. Also to be considered are
the parameter uncertainties, as well as a new representation of the "areal
source zone." The senior principal investigator is internationally recognized
for his many contributions to earthquake engineering research and practice,
especially in the area of this study. The associate investigator has also
demonstrated his ability to contribute to this project. They have the necessary
institutional facilities, and together the principal investigators are expected
to make a significant advance in seismic hazard assessment.
