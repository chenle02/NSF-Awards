Modern society increasingly relies on processing, storing and communicating
large amounts of information. The exponential growth of databases necessitates
the development of algorithms that structure, compress and query them
efficiently. The goal of this research is to develop new tools based on
probabilistic models to achieve these objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new
class of "undirected bipartite graphical models" is studied that embeds
documents into a low dimensional "topic-space". These representations are
efficient and capture semantic relationships. Training of the underlying
probabilistic model is achieved through a technique called "contrastive
divergence learning" which is particularly well adapted to the UBG model. The
main contributions of this research are the development of a new class of
probabilistic graphical model, the development of improved learning algorithms
that scale up to large data-sets and the application of these novel techniques
to two real world applications: image restoration and information
retrieval.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research is integrated with teaching through the
development of new classes in machine learning both at the undergraduate and the
graduate level, where students will be engaged in research in the above
application areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research makes important
contributions that can have a broad impact on security, web-technologies,
commerce, multi-media, medical expert systems etc. In particular, the proposed
projects in image restoration and information retrieval have the potential to
make an impact on tomorrow's technologies. An open-source, web-based repository
with freely available software will be developed to help achieve that goal.&lt;b
