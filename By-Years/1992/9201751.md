This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. The long-term goal of
this research is the recovery of accurate camera motion and dense three-
dimensional shape information from television images at video rate. In prior
work, the Principal Investigator developed a matrix-based factorization method
for this task, based on a set of feature points tracked from frame to frame of a
dense image sequence. Experiments with the method demonstrated a dramatic
performance improvement over existing shape and motion recovery systems. This
research will now develop a characterization of the noise sensitivity of image
sequence analysis, explore efficient and incremental numerical methods for
factorization, and reformulate the method for perspective projection, multiple
motions, and dense shape results. As an exploratory advance into a new area of
research an investigation of the link between motion analysis and multi- frame
of object recognition will also be conducted. This research should contribute to
a better theoretical understanding of visual motion analysis, and produce a
vision module that would let a robot localize itself in the environment, draw a
map of its own surroundings for navigation and obstacle avoidance, and perceive
the shape of objects in order to recognize or manipulate them.
