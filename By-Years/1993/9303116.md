Research in this project will focus on the fabrication and evaluation of a new
apparatus to assess gas permeabilities through membranes and composite
membranes. A novel gas sampling system and automation of the equipment are to be
examined as a means of providing high precision data of molecular transport with
temporal resolution on the order of seconds. Planned tests include study of
metal-ceramic, polymer-ceramic and polymer blend membranes. Membrane separation
processes are economical, energy-efficient methods which help to make American
industry more competitive and environmentally responsible. Development and
characteristics of new membranes for gas separations can impact processing in
the fuel industry, environmental efforts to control volatile organic compounds
or greenhouse gases, and air fractionation for hospital oxygen supplies.
