9521004 Salmon An on-going investigation of large scale ocean dynamics will be
continued using the planetary geostrosphic equations (PGE), a simplified set of
equations that omits fluid inertia, but includes the advection of buoyancy. The
focus of the study will be to calculate abyssal flows over real bottom
topography with application to several regional models. The underpinning idea
for using the planetary geostrophic equations is that realistic bathymetry is
more important that higher order physics.
