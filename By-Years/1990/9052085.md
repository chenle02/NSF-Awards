Columbia College Chicago has a significant tradition of training future
communications professionals, including a substantial proportion of women and
minority students. The Science and Mathematics Department incorporates this
tradition into the chemistry curriculum by offering courses which examine the
impact of chemistry on areas of social concern like the environment, drugs and
drug testing, and consumer product quality Results of student research projects
in these and other areas are integrated with the students' communications
specialties through the presentation of reports such as videotapes, films,
artwork and other creative presentations. Student projects have appeared on
local cable television, and have been presented nationally and internationally
at numerous science museums, science centers, conferences, symposia and special
lectures. Laboratory experience, which is a strong emphasis throughout the
curriculum, features numerous applications of analytical technique, including
gas chromatography. The acquisition of the high pressure liquid chromatograph
through this project expanded the analytical methods component of the
institution's laboratory program as a logical extension of their chromatography
capability. The Atomic Absorption Spectrometer permitted analysis of metals in a
variety of settings. The instrumentation allowed students to investigate and
report on a wide variety of realistic problems in the application of chemistry
to the concerns and needs of society. The institution contributed to the project
in an amount equal to the NSF funds.
