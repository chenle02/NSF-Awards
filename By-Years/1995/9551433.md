Future investigators in basia cell biology and in the health professions will
require more extensive training in molecular biology than they have received in
the past. Many Biology and Microbiology graduates could benefit from training in
contemporary methodologies used in research or diagnostic settings. To satisfy
this need, the Division of Biology has developed three capstone laboratory
courses in Virology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics and has established a
modern, core facility for instruction of advanced juniors and seniors in these
molecular disciplines. The objectives of this program are to expand the range of
material covered in the laboratory curriculum and to increase the capacity of
the core facility. Cell transfer hoods and inverted and fluorescence microscopes
enable Virology and Immunology students to perform new exercises efficiently in
these laboratory courses. A scintillation counter permits students in the
laboratory to use radioisotopes in a safe and efficient manner. Finally, new
computers enable students in Molecular Genetics to perform analysis of DNA
sequences, taking this class beyond the confines of a techniques course.
