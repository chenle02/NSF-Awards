Deception and trust are deeply integrated into almost all facets of life, and
the current attention on truth and trust on the Internet and in new media
highlights the importance of these topics to our society. It is vital that
interdisciplinary groups work together to identify and understand (a) means of
deception (b) the potential consequences (c) how we may counteract deception and
(d) how to build and restore trust in social and technical systems. As the only
conference in the world dedicated to the study of deception and trust,
DeceptiCon 2017 offers a collaborative space where professionals and academics
can converge to discuss and debate the state of the art in their respective
fields related to truth, trust and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
supports Decepticon 2017 to be held at Stanford University in August 2017. The
program covers a variety of topics, such as cues to deceit, methods of deception
detection and the use of technology to detect deception,theoretical positions on
deception and its detection, and research on methods and factors that promote
trust and improve credibility analysis to support a trustworthy cyberspace.
