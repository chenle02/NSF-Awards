Predation hazard or intimidation plays an important role in the ecology of
freshwater communities by structuring habitat use by member species. Locally,
intimidation may suppress growth and reproduction, thereby directly affecting
the population dynamics of member species. While intimidation from predators is
known to produce local effects, no experimental work has addressed the important
question of how intimidation is expressed on larger scales; i.e. the scale of
whole streams or watersheds on Iotic systems. The goal of this proposal is to
explore that question in a tropical stream fish community. We will test the
hypothesis that predators, through intimidation and direct killing, can generate
observed patterns across a large (geographic) scale, and also a hypothesis that
competition is responsible for an observed pattern. We will test specific
predictions derived from the hypotheses in controlled experiments in an tropical
first- and second-order experimental stream system, and by conducting a large
scale survey of the Paria drainage in the Northern Range Mountains of Trinidad.
