This award provides partial funding to establish a multianvil rock deformation
facility for the Tectonophysics Laboratory in the Institute of Geophysics and
Planetary Physics at the University of California, Riverside. The University is
committed to providing the remaining funds necessary. The equipment will allow
deformation experiments on rock samples of Earth's mantle at pressures ranging
up to 25 GPa, equivalent to depths of 700 kilometers. The experiments will be
directed at understanding the mechanisms by which Earth's mantle rocks flow at
depth and how very deep-seated earthquakes originate.
