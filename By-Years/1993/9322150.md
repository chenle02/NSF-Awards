Hoffstein This award funds the work of Professor Jeffrey Hoffstein in the theory
of automorphic forms. Professor Hoffstein will study twists of forms. These
ideas promise a new approaches to several open problems in classical analytic
number theory. This research falls under the general heading of Number Theory.
Number Theory is the study of the properties of the whole numbers and is the
oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory have
furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in almost all parts
of the discipline. One of the philosophies of modern number theory is that many
facts about numbers can be studied using calculus. This approach is very evident
in the theory of automorphic forms. This kind of number theory is very technical
and deep, but it has had astonishing applications in areas like theoretical
computer science and coding theory. ***
