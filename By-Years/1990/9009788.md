This Research Initiation Award is for development of potential- field methods of
guiding a polygonal robot among unknown 3-D obstacles, where inputs are limited
to touch or to limited-range non-contact sensors. Using only local information,
the robot must reach a desired location or determine that it is impossible to do
so. Techniques from computational geometry will be combined with those of
potential-based motion planning, extending Dr. Cox's constraint-network approach
to handle additional degrees of freedom.
