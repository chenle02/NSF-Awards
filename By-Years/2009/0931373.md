This HBCU-RISE proposal will allow Norfolk State University to establish the
resources and research capabilities for the development of novel and functional
materials for renewable energy in the Center for Materials Research (CMR)and
Engineering department. The research components under this proposal are: (a)
Development and enhancement of capability of fabrication of thin multi-Junction
films for solar cells applications; (b) Development and enhancement of
capability of fabrication of low bandgap Polymers for solar cells applications;
and (c) Development of nanostructures for hybrid solar cells and nanobatteries.
The proposed project will provide the resources to develop the Center's
infrastructure by broadening its research capabilities, with the addition of
materials for renewable energy, their design and preparation, and increase the
Center's human resources capacity by the training the young faculty researchers
to become independent investigators and also increase the opportunities for
training in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) among underrepresented
minority groups
