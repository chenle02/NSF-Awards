9403730 Colgate This project deals with the haptic display of rigid body dynamic
systems. A haptic interface allows an operator to manipulate and feel computer-
generated environments in applications such as flight simulation, rapid
prototyping systems and physical therapy. During the project activity, rigid
body dynamic systems featuring unilateral and bilateral constraints are
investigated using a network method approach for real-time solution. Such
methods guarantee passivity and exploit a low-level of parallelism to achieve
real-time integration rates for stiff dynamic systems. Transputers are employed
as basic computational elements for laboratory implementation using a state-of-
the- art four degree of freedom haptic display device. ***
