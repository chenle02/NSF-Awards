This project is in the field of topology, which studies the fundamental nature
of high-dimensional shapes and the relationships between them. While formerly
one of the most abstract areas of mathematics, the usefulness of topology is
starting to be recognized in areas such as data analysis and neuroscience where
high-dimensional structures have been discovered in a variety of unexpected
places. This particular project concerns the ways that different shapes can be
related to one another, and applies some of the ideas and intuition of calculus
to the study of these connections. Calculus (as taught to undergraduates across
the country) is fundamentally about approximation. In this project the PI will
study how complicated shapes can be approximated in a useful way by those that
are simpler and easier to work with. A systematic understanding of these
approximations will help us describe the structure of some of the new shapes
that are appearing in modern applications of topology.

More technically, the focus of this project is the calculus of homotopy functors
developed by Goodwillie. The underlying idea is to approximate an object of
interest (say the value of some functor) using other simpler functors that
satisfy a polynomial condition. A major component of this project is to
understand, in various different situations, how the analogue of the Taylor
series (a "Taylor tower" in topology) can be assembled from its components. From
this general theory this project aims at several avenues of application. One is
to the calculation of the Taylor towers corresponding to various versions of
algebraic K-theory, viewed as functors from ring spectra to spectra. Another is
to chromatic homotopy theory, specifically to study of the Bousfield-Kuhn
functor, and to algebraic K-theory in a K(n)-local setting. This project will
also support the PI's efforts to promote mathematics and math education at
Amherst College. The PI is engaged with the training of preservice math teachers
and has jointly designed and taught a new course on inequality in K-12 math
education, expanding the College's support for education studies, and increasing
collaboration between mathematics and other academic departments at Amherst.
