9986613&lt;br/&gt;HALL-WALLACE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project, "The
Earth Puzzle," is a series of four (4) modules that focus on teaching core
concepts in Earth science for 9th grade students. The modules are based in case
studies of real problems using real data. The problems will involve global scale
investigations to provide a framework for understanding local case studies.
Topics addressed by students include weather and climate change, natural hazards
mitigation, and changing Earth systems. The materials will incorporate
geographic information systems (GIS) technology to facilitate data
visualization, manipulation and analysis. Special attention will be given to
integrating mathematics and geography into the curriculum. Assessment and
evaluation studies will focus in whether student knowledge and reasoning skills
are improved by the in-depth activities of the proposed materials.&lt;br/&gt;
