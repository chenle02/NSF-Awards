The project is supported by the Science, Technology, and Society program. The
PI has been awarded a professional development fellowship to enable him to
develop expertise in the philosophical foundations of quantum mechanics (the
physical theory of molecular, atomic, and sub-atomic systems). He will work
closely with Dr. Malcolm Forster, professor in the Department of Philosophy at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The PI has published a series of papers on
the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics in which he has put forth a
new geometrical approach to quantum mechanics so as to address fundamental
conceptual puzzles that have been debated since the inception of the theory in
the 1920s.

The new approach begins by treating space as a part of a larger quantum
mechanically defined space of states in a mathematically rigorous way. One of
the core ideas of the approach is that a physical system is in the classical
space (meaning the space of everyday experience) if and only if and only if
quantum mechanics predicts with certainty that it has a precise position, which
is usually expressed by saying that the state of the system is characterized by
a Dirac delta function associated with the physical quantity position. In all
other states, the particle is not in physical space. This approach provides a
new interpretation of the ontological meaning of superpositions (additive
combinations) of classical states; namely, that particles in superpositions are
not in space. This involves the rejection of a dogma that gripped our way of
thinking about reality throughout the ages: Everything that exists is located in
space. Rejection of this dogma has far-reaching implications for many widely
discussed issues in the foundations of quantum mechanics, such as particle-wave
duality, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument and the meaning of non-locality,
the nature of quantum measurement and the collapse of the wave packet.

With the fellowship support, the PI will develop, document, and debate the
implications indicated above from a philosophical standpoint in careful,
accessible, and clear manner that is well informed by the vast philosophical
literature on the subject. The project promises to improve our understanding of
what, if anything, quantum mechanics is telling us about the world behind the
observable phenomena. It address the most fundamental and challenging problems
in the philosophy of physics. The results of this research will be of interest
to philosophers and theoretical physicists alike, and to any members of the
general public who are interested in what contemporary physics may be telling us
about the world. The even broader impact of this could be in the teaching of
quantum mechanics to beginning students; especially those who want to understand
the theories in terms of a "picture" rather than merely to learn how to use them
to make calculations.
