This research considers computationally intensive methods in statistics that
involve the use of high speed workstations. One problem involves the combined
application of data-analytic methods of nonparametric regression and empirical
Bayes techniques to improved fitting and prediction for growth curve data.
Another problem involves mixed models incorporating both fixed and random
effects for binary data. In this problem the focus is on variance components
estimation in mixed models and the analogues of best linear unbiased prediction
of the observed values of the random effects. These will include models for the
repeated measures and longitudinal data settings.
