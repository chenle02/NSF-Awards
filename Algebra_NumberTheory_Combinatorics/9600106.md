9600106 Dade This grant supports the research of Professor E. Dade to work on
problems in the representation of the finite groups. In particular he wants to
work on a conjecture about the number of characters in a block of a finite
group. He will complete work on reducing this conjecture to the case of covering
groups of the finite simple groups. He will then try to directly verify cases of
this conjecture using this reduction. This is research in the field of group
theory. Group theory can be thought of as the study of symmetry in the abstract.
As such, this area has direct applications to many areas of physics and
chemistry. Moreover, within the last 30 years, many connections to problems in
data transmission have been solved using techniques from group theory. There are
also direct connections to the error correcting codes that are vital for modern
computing such as working with CD-ROM's.
