Angiosperm leaf megafossils from the southern Rocky Mountains will be surveyed
to determine patterns of generic and familial diversity in floral assemblages
bracketing the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (66 million years b.p.), one of the
five major extinction episodes in the history of life. Although species-level
analyses of pollen and leaf assemblages have elucidated many details of climatic
and ecological change at this time, many biological properties of plant
extinction cannot be determined accurately, because leaf megafossils must be
determined through detailed analysis of foliar venation and cuticular anatomy in
well-preserved remains and extensive comparisons with reference collections of
extant angiosperm leaves. This analysis will provide more reliable
determinations of systematic relationships than are currently available for
latest Cretaceous and earliest Tertiary paleofloras, in assemblages that have
tight stratigraphic age control. These systematic determinations will provide a
data base for future quantitative analysis of end-Cretaceous plant extinction,
which will be important for testing hypotheses on the nature of biotic
extinction.
