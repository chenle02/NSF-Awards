&lt;br/&gt;In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Fourkas will investigate nanoporous sol-gel
glasses to study the confinement effects on a distance scale that is within
approximately the order of a molecular dimension. At such distances there can be
significant effects on the structure and dynamics of liquids. The materials are
highly porous, of optical quality, and the average pore size and chemical nature
of the pore surfaces can be controlled readily. The experiments are based on the
use of ultrafast optical Kerr effect (OKE) techniques. The role of molecular
shapes on the dynamics of weakly wetting liquids at solid/liquid interfaces will
be investigated as function of temperature and pore
size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several ways in which this research will
make an impact. Confined liquids are found throughout nature and are also
important in many areas of technology. The knowledge gained from this work will
be of importance to many areas of science and technology, such as, for example,
how water behaves in biological contexts, while the work on the confined alkanes
will have direct bearing on lubrication and oil recovery. The university and
high school students, as well as high school teachers who will participate in
this project will be involved in a multidisciplinary undertaking that broadens
their outlook and understanding of how contemporary science is practiced.
