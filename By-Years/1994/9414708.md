Pham This project is a conference on the subject of the performability of
industrial computing systems that require hardware, software, and human
operators to run. Such systems include advanced manufacturing, high-speed
transportation systems, communication systems, and medical equipment to name
only a few. The objective of the conference is to bring together researchers in
industry and academia to share ideas and research results on the state-of-the-
practice on hardware/software/ human performability on industrial computing
systems. It is also the objective of the conference to discuss and identify
future research directions in this subject area. Identification of critical
research issues and the obstacles to be overcome in advancing the state of
research in the area will also be covered. It is hoped that such a conference
will spur collaborative effort between researchers in academia and industry. A
tangible output of the conference will be a bound proceeding containing the
papers presented and discussed at the meeting. The problem of effective and
reliable operation of hardware/software/human systems are ever present. Failure
of such systems or inabililty to control and manage them always carry with them
high negative consequences in terms of cost and safety. For these reasons, it is
extremely essential that control and planning methodologies to better understand
and operate such systems are developed. This is a critical research area whose
prominence and importance will continue to grow in the future. Better
understanding of such systems will be of significant benefits to the economy.
