Professor Constant is building on recent work in anthropology and philosophy of
science for his study of how science literally transforms society and how
society transforms science. The core of this study is an historical account of
the interaction between developing petroleum engineering science and the oil
fraternity in Texas. He is trying to capture the processes of negotiation and
renegotiation by which they jointly produced and reconstructed "social reality"
(their relationship to each other and to the rest of the Texas power structure)
and "physical reality" (the nature of the subsurface petroleum reserves). He is
doing this by studying in detail the ways that Texas oil men turned to
scientists to help determine the best way to exploit oil riches, how scientists
adjusted their work to meet the needs of the oil men, and how both cooperated to
establish a regulatory system in Texas to manage the oil industry. On the basis
of this detailed case study, Professor Constant hopes to develop a general model
of the interactions of science, technology and society. This study thus promises
insights not only into the history of oil industry in Texas, but a real
contribution to the entire field of studies in science, technology and society.
