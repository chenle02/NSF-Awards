We are surrounded by patterns that change their shape and structure with time --
particular examples include: chemical concentrations in materials, velocity
profiles in fluids, population densities in ecosystems, etc. With modern
information technologies it is relatively easy to collect enormous data on these
patterns either through experimentation or numerical simulation. One goal of
this project is to develop and employ computational topological techniques to
use the observed patterns to identify, quantify and classify the time-dependent
properties of the underlying systems.

Mathematical models for spatially dependent systems that evolve with time are
typically extremely difficult to analyze using traditional mathematical
techniques, and thus much of what we know about the detailed evolution of these
systems comes from numerical simulations. However, the process of performing
these numerical simulations introduces errors, which can potentially grow and
propagate. In principle, algebraic topological properties remain invariant under
small perturbations. With this in mind, another goal of this project is to
combine the newly developed computational topological tools with standard
numerical methods to verify that the solutions obtained through numerical
simulation are indeed valid results for the systems being studied.
