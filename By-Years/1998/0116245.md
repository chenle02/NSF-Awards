With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Southern Oregon University will acquire a 400 MHz NMR
Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a)
structural elucidation of new conotoxins; b) the identification of the
components of deer tarsal glands; and c) structural characterization of
synthetic intermediates. The instrument will also be used in a number of
advanced undergraduate courses. Students will be heavily involved in the
research projects at this primarily undergraduate institution.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas
including synthetic chemistry and biochemistry.
