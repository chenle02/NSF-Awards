Molecular markers (mitochondrial DNA sequences) are used to quantify population
genetic structure in geographically widespread species of Anolis lizards
(anoles) on each of four islands in the Greater Antilles. Caribbean anoles
provide an outstanding opportunity for testing the impact of ecological
specialization on genetic structures of otherwise similar species using
replicated observations. Similar kinds of habitat specialists have evolved
independently in anoles on each of the four islands in the Greater Antilles.
These specialists differ ecologically but are similar with regard to other
factors thought to affect population structure (i.e. life history, geographic
distribution, age of origin, reproductive behavior). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
species' genetic structure has important consequences for many aspects of its
biology, including its probability of giving rise to new species or going
extinct. The results of this study assess the importance of habitat
specialization for production and maintenance of biodiversity in ecological
communities, and the priority of habitat specialization as a consideration in
conservation practices.&lt;br/&gt;
