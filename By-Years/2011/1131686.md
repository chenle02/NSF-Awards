The proposed research investigates the hitherto unknown fundamental
characteristics of electrostatic DNA hybridization. Namely; the yield, kinetic
rates, ability to denature long DNA and to support a sufficient number of
hybridization cycles, in order to establish conditions for efficient PCR
amplification.

The specific aims are to:

1. Construct a fluorescent detector for hybridization and extension of electrode
tethered primers. An evanescent wave fluorescent real-time detector will be
built to measure the kinetics and yield of denaturation, annealing, and
extension stages in solid-phase PCR.

2. Prove-in-principle and optimize electrostatic isothermal PCR. Linear and
exponential amplification will be demonstrated in real-time PCR mode using
oligonucleotide templates. Efficient electrostatic pulse cycles and optimal
surface and solution conditions will be defined. Amplification protocols will be
developed.
