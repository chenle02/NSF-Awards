The first part of this research will involve the development of a strategy for
endo carbon-carbon bond formation that involves functional group manipulation at
the metal center of (cycloheptadienyl)M(halide), where M is Fe or Ru. Conversion
of the halide ligand to an appropriate organic group followed by reductive
elimination will complete the functionalization. The second goal of the research
will be to study the chemistry of carbanions stabilized by Fe(CO)3 and CpCo. The
organometallic anions described are mild nucleophiles that will allow carbon-
carbon bond formation with acyl and/or alkyl halides and BF3 activated carbonyl
compounds. %%% With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the
Synthetic Organic Program will support the research of Dr. Gregory M. Williams
of the Department of Chemistry at California State University, Fullerton. The
work is focused on two major areas, each of which will expand the utility of
transition metal polyolefin complexes as precursors to natural products. In
these areas, the attack of electron rich species on coordinated polyoefins and
the chemistry of transition metal stabilized carbanions will be used for
developing new ways to affect carbon-carbon bond formation.
