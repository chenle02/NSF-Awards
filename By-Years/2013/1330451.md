Mitochondria, the energy-generating organelles, form interconnected membrane-
bound tubular networks within the cell. These mitochondrial networks undergo
both fission and fusion dynamics as a result of which there may be many
individual mitochondria or a single large network in the cell. The network
dynamics are believed to contribute to maintaining mitochondrial function by
segregating out damaged sub-regions of the network for turnover. Innovative
image analysis methods will be used to accurately quantify the 3 dimensional
topology and dynamics of the entire mitochondrial network of yeast cells. These
data will be combined in an iterative process with computational modeling,
genetic manipulations, and functional assays to advance fundamental
understanding of how mitochondrial network topology, dynamics, and function are
integrated by the cell. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Undergraduate
students training to be STEM teachers will be integrated into the project and
will learn how to develop and implement research-based lesson plans for K12
students. Opportunities for cross-disciplinary training in computation and
biology will be provided by this project at undergraduate, graduate and
postdoctoral levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded jointly by the
Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences
Division and by the Mathematical Biology Program of the Division of Mathematical
Sciences.
