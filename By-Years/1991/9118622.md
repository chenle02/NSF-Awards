The overall objective of the proposed research is to delineate the mechanism of
opsonin-mediated cell recognition of nonself in insects. The hemolymph lectin of
the beet armyworm having characteristics similar to those reported for soluble
vertebrate lectins, has been demonstrated to e an effective opsonin of fungal
cells. Based on prior experiments we believe that when the S. exigua lectin
binds to the fungal wall, it undergoes a conformational change, exposing sites
which bind to receptors on the hemocyte membrane. Initial experiments will
examine the ability of 125I-labeled S. exigua lectin-substrate complexes to bind
to hemocyte monolayers. Secondly, S. exigua lectin affinity matrices will be
utilized to pluck the receptors from labeled hemocytes and identify the receptor
complex present in the hemocyte cell membrane. The data generated form these
experiments will provide novel information as to how humoral lectins operate as
opsonins or transport molecules in insects. This proposal addresses a
fundamental issue in insect immunology. The prevailing belief in the field is
that lectins, proteins which recognize and bind specific carbohydrate
structures, function as immune surveillance proteins in the primitive insect
circulatory system, much as immunoglobulin antibodies recognize and bind
specific haptenic structures in the vertebrate circulatory system. The
hypothesis being explored in this project is that, once bound, the lectin
"opsonizes" the pathogen much as antibodies opsonize bacteria, enabling
phagocytic cells of the immune system to recognize the antibody-antigen complex
and to engulf and degrade the invading microorganism. The results of this
research will expand our understanding of the role of lectins in invertebrate
immune responses.
