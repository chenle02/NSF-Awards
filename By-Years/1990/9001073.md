This award provides funds to the Department of Psychology at Trinity College to
establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduate Site. The program will
provide minority students with research opportunities in test construction and
validation. The project contains two components: (1) a short course on
psychological measurement that concentrates on personality test construction,
and (2) student-initiated research on the same topic. In addition to learning
the theory underlying the development and validation of personality tests,
students will learn methods for gathering information to test hypotheses and
will gain experience with scientific reasoning. Following the course, small
groups of students will develop and conduct research projects designed to test
the validity of an assessment instrument. Students will prepare written research
reports and will present their results orally to project participants and other
audiences. Successful projects will be presented at undergraduate and
professional conferences. Students recruited for this program primarily will be
African-American and Hispanic college students who formerly participated in a
college preparation program entitled "Career Beginnings."
