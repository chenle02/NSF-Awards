The goal of this project is to facilitate and enhance the match between user
needs and the capabilities and products of the emerging space weather service.
It is noted that it is necessary for the success of an applied program that the
requirements of the eventual users must be introduced into the planning of the
program at an early stage. To facilitate this, this program will involve
establishing a close working relationship between engineers and operators in the
user community and space scientists and forecasters. This will be accomplished
through workshops. Activities will focus on seeking areas where 1) a close match
between needs and capabilities already exist, 2) better understanding of the
capabilities and needs can generate more easily achievable matches, and 3)
finding new areas where space weather service can be usefully applied. The
output of this program will be suggestions of specific applications where either
near term implementation or more detailed feasibility studies should be
considered.
