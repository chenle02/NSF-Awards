iBiology is a web-based video collection for the life sciences community, which
provides a window into the process of scientific discovery. iBiology's mission
is to make recorded scientific talks by the world's leading biologists available
on-demand and free-of-charge. iBiology's primary audience ranges from
undergraduates to professional scientists, although iBiology's resources are
also being used by high school students. In this project, iBiology will expand
its offerings to produce 40 life sciences research talks per year, run a
competition for young scientists to receive training and record their own
iBiology talk, and produce a new series covering research techniques. A
"flipped" course for use by educators will be produced each year. iBiology
provides high schools, community colleges, and liberal arts colleges with access
to high-level biology learning resources, thereby helping their faculty both to
learn themselves and to teach their students. iBiology actively seeks to engage
diverse national and international communities in the exciting future of biology
through outreach and volunteer activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project
iBiology will produce the following resources: iBioSeminars (research talks
given by leading scientists); Discovery talks (short talks that cover famous
discoveries); a Technique Series; "Flipped Courses" (courses will be produced on
subjects where there is a need and the content is not found online or commonly
taught in universities) and other Education Resources (activities or materials
to accompany videos); and The Young Scientist Series (a competition highlighting
work from talented young graduate students and postdoctoral fellows).
