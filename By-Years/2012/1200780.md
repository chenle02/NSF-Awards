The proposed work will solve a fundamental manufacturing issue: the inability to
directly pattern metal with sub-100nm resolution. Addressing the nanopatterning
of silver, which finds application in photonics and electronics, it develops a
novel solid-liquid electrochemical process capable of large-area, low-cost and
high fidelity patterning. In addition to deriving a fundamental physical
understanding of transport of metallic ion species across multi-phase domains
such as ionic glass-liquid electrolyte systems, the proposed research will
exploit high speed, continuous, direct nanoscale patterning of metallic
substrates to generate high performance biosensors.

If successful, the proposed research will provide the manufacturing community
with a valuable new technology. The obtained knowledge of the physical,
chemical, and transport properties of silver-based solid electrolyte material
systems can be used in the design and industrial-scale manufacturing of optical
biosensors. In addition, the understanding developed in this research can be
translated to other similar systems, such as liquid junction photovoltaic
devices and lithium ion batteries with nanostructured anodes thus inspiring
similar systems to be studied and developed for a range of applications
including renewable energy conversion and new sensor designs.
