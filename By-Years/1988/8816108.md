This proposal requests funding to support a high-pressure experimental research
program designed to evaluate whether a plausible petrogenenetic link exists
between the voluminous high- alumina basalts (HAB) and the rare high-magnesia
basalts (HMB) found in most island arc settings. In this proposal, a two-
pronged experimental approach is described that will provide important new
insight into the relationship (if any) between HAB and HMB. The important
question to be answered from these experiments is whether HAB melt coexists with
olivine (+/- other phases) anywhere within the melting interval of the HMB. The
study will increase our understanding of the formation of the important island
arc (e.g. Japan, Aleutians, etc.) volcanics.
