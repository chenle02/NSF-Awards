This research is focused in the following areas: (1) Design and control
Automated Guided Vehicle systems used in a manufacturing setting. The objective
is to develop (approximate) analytical models to predict the number of vehicles
and system performance in a stochastic environment. (2) Extend earlier results
obtained for "part-to-person" order picking systems. The objective is to develop
analytical models to determine the number of pickers and system throughput
capacity for multi-aisle, multi-pick position systems. (3) Analyze work-in-
progress, storage/retrieval, and workstation configurations in computer
integrated material handling systems used in supporting manufacturing and
assembly operations.
