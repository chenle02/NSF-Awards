Partial support is requested for the 47th Annual Symposium of the Society for
Developmental Biology, which will be held at the University of Connecticut,
Storrs, Ct., June 12-15, 1988. The title of the Symposium is: The Assembly of
the Nervous System. The goal of the Symposium is to more clearly identify the
important problems in neural development that can benefit from application of
newer molecular techniques, and by bringing together active researchers working
on different levels of organization of the nervous system, to encourage new
insights and approaches to these problems. Speakers and attendees will be drawn
from divergent disciplines. The speakers, a mixture of established investigators
and younger investigators, were chosen first because they have made important
contributions to their own research specialty and second because they are
effective in presenting their work in a broader context. Progress is the areas
of the role of genes in specific developmental neural processes and on
understanding the cellular mechanisms of processes unique to the nervous system
have been substantial in the past few years and it is therefore valuable to hold
such a symposium to discuss and assess this progress.
