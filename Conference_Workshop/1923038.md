This project will support early-career US researchers participating in an
international mini-symposium titled "Mathematical Methods in Immunology and
Infectious Disease Modeling" to be held as part of the summer school during the
BIOMATH19 conference in Bedlewo, Poland in June 2019. The conference is an
annual international event devoted to recent research breakthroughs and new
mathematical challenges arising in life sciences. Early-career US researchers
will be exposed to a broad international research community in biology, ecology,
medicine, biotechnology, bioengineering, and environmental science. The proposed
mini-symposium will be a satellite event of BIOMATH19 designed to develop
expertise at the interface of complex dynamics, statistics, and computational
science. The mathematical techniques presented have relevance beyond immunology
and infectious diseases, with multiple applications in chemistry, neuroscience,
physics, sociology, psychology, biometrics, homeland security and national
defense. US mini-symposium attendees will establish valuable contacts with
international peers, including members of an interdisciplinary consortium
focusing on the prevention of vector borne diseases.

The mini-symposium will include several talks delivered by the PIs to 20-30
participants, as well as short presentations by US early-career researchers. The
objectives of the activity are to: 1) Present an up-to-date review of
mathematical and statistical tools and new developments in mathematical
epidemiology, and 2) Increase international participation by US-based
researchers, especially junior faculty and post-doctoral fellows interested in
mathematical biology. Fifteen early-career, US-based participants will be
supported. Applications will be solicited broadly across the mathematical
biology community; women and members of underrepresented groups will be
particularly encouraged to apply. The US attendees will also have an opportunity
to interact with an interdisciplinary consortium of European researchers
focusing on the Investigation & Mathematical Analysis of Avant-garde Disease
Control via Mosquito Nano-Tech-Repellents (IMAAC). BIOMATH19 conference details
