9352592 Dorfman We have acquired equipment to enhance and strengthen our
(required) Solid State Laboratory course (PHY 431L) and (required) Senior Thesis
program (PHY 461,462). We have purchased a high Tc SQUID (Superconducting
QUantum Interface Device) in order to introduce magnetism and superconductivity
into the laboratory course. This instrument is capable of advanced experiments
and so is also used by our Senior Thesis students to fulfill their Senior Thesis
requirement. The remaining equipment enhances three existing experiments,
replacing borrowed, worn out, or incompatible components. The computer equipment
is being used to automate two experiments and to provide our students with the
means to do advanced data analysis. ***
