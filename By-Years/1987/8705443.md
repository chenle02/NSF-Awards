The purpose of this 3-year project is to learn more about territoriality, using
a population of birds in which cooperative family units defend large territories
all year. The study is in part a continuation of a long-term study of population
biology in a very illuminating species of bird, in which social cooperation
characterizes the Florida race but is absent throughout the species'
distribution in Western North America. For 17 years the investigators have
monitored the details of births, movements, matings, territorial habits, and
deaths of hundreds of scrub jays. This grant will permit continued monitoring of
the population for three additional years. More important, it will allow a major
investigation into the factors that cause some groups to defend large
territories and others to be equally successful in small ones. The role of
territory quality as it affects reproductive success will also be investigated.
These objectives will be met by carefully measuring the habitat features and
food resources of each territory (or representative ones) over all seasons for
three years. The results will allow the investigators to estimate the relative
quality of territories already mapped during the preceding 17 years of the
study, because the habitat has remained essentially constant over that period.
The final results will provide unique insight into the dynamics and roles of
permanent territoriality within a non-migratory, socially cooperative animal
species. The implications of this study will extend generally to a wide group of
animal species that have evolved cooperative behavior as a means of coping with
chronically crowded environmental conditions.
