This award provides partial support of the 2009 Interdisciplinary Plant
Group&lt;br/&gt;Symposium on Root Biology. The symposium, to be held at the
University of Missouri-Columbia, is designed to facilitate the interdisciplinary
sharing of research on fundamental questions in the area of root biology. The
goal is to stimulate cross-disciplinary discussions and ideas that can lead to
increases in crop yield, novel adaptations to changing environments and
conditions, and new solutions to pest and disease control. Root development and
function are vitally important for plant adaptation to the environment.
Understanding of root biology remains limited however, and increased attention
to this critical area is needed to facilitate improvement of crop performance in
the face of environmental constraints. The broader impacts of this project
include exposure to interdisciplinary research in the plant sciences for
undergraduate students; networking opportunities for graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows; potential collaborative and interdisciplinary research
projects for faculty. The Symposium also includes a concerted effort to broaden
the participation of undergraduate students, particularly those from minority-
serving institutions.&lt;br/&gt;
