9528471 Plumb This project represents an ongoing collaboration between Drs.
Alan Plumb of MIT (under this award) and Dr. Lorenzo Polvani of Columbia
University (ATM-9527315) concerning the dynamics of nonlinear atmospheric waves
and vortices, with particular emphasis on applications to the stratosphere. In
this work, a number of tools have been employed. Initially, the techniques of
contour dynamics was used to study, at very high resolution, the characteristics
of Rossby wave breaking under a variety of circumstances. The principal
investigators then used a global, pseudospectral, shallow water model to look at
the two-dimensional dynamics of nonlinear waves in the presence of
nonconservative processes as well as a "contour advection" technique (a
Lagrangian, high resolution, contour-following approach to depict transport in
known flows. To extend these results, the PIs will examine the three-dimensional
aspects of the interaction between Rossby waves and the stratospheric polar
vortex using a multi-layer, pseudospectral, primitive equation model. They also
will investigate various aspects of the tropospheric circulation related to
Rossby wave dynamics - including atmospheric blocking and interactions between
the Hadley circulation and midlatitude planetary waves. ***
