9401668 Mankey This award is under the International Junior Investigator and
Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers to
conduct three to twelve months of research abroad at research centers of proven
excellence. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and
the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
conditions abroad. This award will support a four-month postdoctoral research
visit by Dr. Gary J. Mankey of Penn State University to work with Dr. Markus
Donath at Max-Planck Institute fur Plasmaphysic on spin polarized inverse
photoemission of atomically engineered magnetic structures. The goal of Dr.
Mankey's research is to develop a new instrument capable of studying newly
discovered phenomena for a wider range of magnetic materials and artificially
layered structures. The collaborators intend to measure the changes in the
electronic structure of solids as one goes from the bulk to thin films,
superlattices, and ultimately to a single atomic layer. The work will develop
collaboration between two leading groups in inverse photoemission spectroscopy:
a university research group at Penn State, an industrial research group at IBM
Yorktown in the U.S. and a university research group at MPI in Germany. ***
