Silene alba, a flowering plant found along roadsides, can become infected with
a parasitic disease, caused by a fungus. In addition to rendering the plants
sterile, this disease causes both male and female plants to produce flowers with
anther sacs filled with spores of the fungus. The insects which pollinate
healthy Silene alba also visit diseased flowers, thus acting as vectors of this
disease. This study attempts to show how the behavior of the insect
pollinator/vector influences the plant-pathogen interaction between Silene alba
and the fungus by using an approach which combines field observations,
experimentation, and mathematical modeling. No studies of plant-vector-pathogen
interactions have included the behavioral component of the vector in modeling
the dynamics of the system. This study in which the disease vector is also the
pollinator of the plant is an ideal place to begin an investigation of how
vector behavior affects a plant-pathogen interaction. The voluminous literature
on the effect of pollinator behavior on plant population dynamics can be drawn
upon to develop models in this plant-pollinator/vector-pathogen interaction. The
results of this study will be of interest to epidemioligists working in plant-
vector-pathogen systems as well as to evolutionary ecologists working on the
effects of individual behavior on population and community dynamics.
