This study makes use of SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory/Large Angle and
Spectrometric Coronagraph (SOHO/LASCO) and Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope
(EIT) data to identify coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) soft X-ray data to determine any
associated flares. The major objectives are: (1) to study the initiation and
acceleration of the CMEs focusing on those that are well-observed in the inner
C1 coronagraph, (2) to investigate the temporal relationship between CMEs and
flares, (3) to test the validity of a proposed three-type classification scheme
for CMEs based on their time-height velocity profiles, and (4) to test CME
models based on a matrix of observable parameters developed at the 2000/2001
SHINE workshops. This observational study will reveal properties of CMEs and
related flares, especially their origins and near-Sun evolution, and should
better enable one to identify coronal environments that are propitious for their
occurrence.
