With a decline in Americans pursuing advanced education in STEM fields (more
than 67% of engineers receiving Ph.Ds in the U.S. are not U.S. citizens and only
18% of engineers are female, it became apparent that priming the pipeline with
diverse, qualified, and prepared students is mission critical. Understanding,
actively engaging, and retaining a diverse population of inquisitive students
prepared with critical thinking skills is paramount. Recent studies have shown
that active learning, which engages children in activities and involves
interactions with peers, as opposed to passive listening, emphasizes higher-
order thinking and results in significantly better comprehension and
performance. To address this national problem, this team has developed the "A
Hundred Tiny Hands" that focuses on teaching modern science concepts in a
playful and cooperative way, through a combination of physical Inventor?s
Toolboxes and an online social media platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Hundred
Tiny Hands proposes 3 avenues for adoption: direct to consumers; working with
after school / outreach and children's organizations (including Girl Scouts and
Big Brothers Big Sisters); and adoption from private, charter schools and
eventually public school districts. The typical user for the (initial)
Inventor's Toolboxes is a child (especially girls) between the ages of 6-10. The
buyers for the 3 different scenarios, however, are very different. For the
direct to consumer approach, the buyers would be the parents, typically highly
educated, tech oriented professionals with disposable income who understands the
importance of STEM literacy. In order to reach a broader demographic and
children who otherwise would not have access to such toys, the team has forged
relationships with various children?s programs, outreach/low income programs,
and after school/ summer camps. Finally, the team is working with key decision
makers of school districts and charter schools to gain adoption into the STEM
curriculum.
