9520800 Terborgh Interspecific competition plays an important role in
structuring many communities, but similar patterns may also be produced by
specialization. In avian communities many species nest in tree cavities, a
chronically limiting substrate. Some tropical forest birds may avoid competition
for tree cavities by nesting in the termitaria in active colonies of arboreal
termites. This dissertation research will test two alternative hypotheses: (1)
termitarium nesting birds specialize on termitaria and prefer to use them
independent of the availability of tree cavities, and (2) termitaria currently
provide a refuge from competition for limited tree cavities. These hypotheses
will be addressed by using nest box experiments and determining the natural
occupancy rates of termitaria and tree cavities. Behavioral data will be used to
determine if birds receive advantages by nesting in termitaria instead of tree
cavities. This research will provide insight into how the presence of a
substrate used for a single, specialized life history stage (nesting) influences
community structure and provides a framework for understanding how termitaria
affect avian structure and species coexistence.
