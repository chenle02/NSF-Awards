Abstract 9616338 Piccirillo The relict thermal cosmic microwave background
radiation left over from the big bang carries the only information that is
available on the distribution of matter in the very early universe. This award
is for the US portion of a larger international (France, Italy and the US)
collaboration which will measure the anisotropy of the CMBR from the new
French/Italian station on Dome C in Antarctica (Concordia Station). This is one
of the highest and coldest sites presently occupied in Antarctica. Because of
the extreme cold there is very little water vapor in the atmosphere, and that
means that it is likely to be a superb place from which to make CMBA anisotropy
measurements. Evaluation of the site for future use is also a major goal of this
project. ***
