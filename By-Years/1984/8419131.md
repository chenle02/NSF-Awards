The basic research will explore experimentally the relation between the theory
of chaotic behavior in mechanical systems and turbulence, but for open flows.
These flows have so far been neglected by the chaotic community. The relevance
of chaos is not all clear for them, and they are of greater engineering
importance than the closed flows investigated so far from this point of view.
