The objective of this research is to develop a conceptual foundation for the
automated solution of tolerancing problems in computer-aided design. The
research will be organized under three topics: (1) To provide a basis for this
work, a mathematical representation will be developed in which tolerances are
expressed as constraints on a normed vector space of model variations (an
M-space). (2) To prove its utility, it will be shown that the M-space
representation establishes a foundation for the formulation of mathematical
models for the tolerance analysis and tolerance synthesis problems. It will be
shown that the most general three-dimensional problems can be solved on either a
worst-case or statistical basis, and that both dimensional and geometric
tolerances can be used. (3) To demonstrate the existence of an efficient
computational framework for the automated solution of these mathematical models,
solid modeling technology will be extended to provide effective methods for
modeling part and assembly semantics.
