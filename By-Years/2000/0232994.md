This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is focused on improving
the material properties of spray formed titanium shapes using the Cold Spray
process. Development of new, low-cost methods for direct fabrication of spray
formed titanium shapes is critical for many industries and in particular, for
manufacturing parts of expensive metals and alloys such as titanium. Direct
fabrication technologies would have tremendous commercial potential for many
industries such as the aerospace and automotive because these technologies hold
out the potential to quickly manufacture, and provide fast prototyping of
complicated parts and to fabricate them with minimal material waste. Current
methods of spray forming typically involve melting and solidification, which can
cause high residual stresses, undesirable phases, poor microstructures, rough
surface finishes, warpage, and other problems. This proposal presents a new
technology that is under development that appears promising for directly
fabricating solid, near-full-density, free-form shapes of many metals, at or
near room temperature without melting and solidification. The objective of this
Phase I study is to develop a low cost technology for spray forming titanium and
Ti- 6Al-4V alloy and to perform post-test processing on thick-sprayed billets to
improve the bulk material properties to near that of the wrought material.
