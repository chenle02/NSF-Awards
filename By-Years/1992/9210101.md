This project investigates the construction and asymptotic theory of
semiparametric estimators using moment conditions or minimization problems based
upon a pairwise differencing approach. This research should make valuable
contributions both to applied statistics and econometrics. The data-differencing
approach taken in the project permits the development of semiparametric
estimators for important economic models that have not previously been
considered in the nonparametric literature. The approach taken exploits the fact
that the difference of independent and identically-distributed random variables
will be symmetrically distributed around zero; by choosing transformations of
pairs of observations which satisfy this condition, moment conditions can be
constructed to estimate the parameters of interest. The research on this subject
proceeds along four lines: (1) Existing results on minimizers of U-processes
will be extended to permit the kernel of the U-statistic to depend on the sample
size, as required for "smoothed" variants of pairwise difference estimators.
Also, these theoretical results will be applied to a number of potential
semiparametric estimators, based on pairwise differences for semilinear,
selection, and index models, and efficient construction of pairwise difference
estimators will also be considered. (2) For the "smoothed" pairwise difference
estimators, the form of the optimal bandwiths will be derived, and "plug in"
estimators of these optimal bandwidths will be proposed. (3) A large-sample
theory for pairwise difference estimators which rely on preliminary
nonparametric estimators of regression functions will be developed. (4) The
proposed estimators will be evaluated using an empirically-based simulation
study.
