The Department of Mathematics at the engineering institution Rose-Hulman
Institute of Technology will establish for all freshman and sophomores a
laboratory for symbolic, numerical and graphical computations. SUN work stations
and the computer algebra system MACSYMA will be the basis radical change in the
mode and methodology of the calculus and differential calculus sequences. The
emphasis is to impact the engineering curriculum by stressing "mathematical
experimentation" by use of powerful research tools used in industry. The grantee
is providing an equal sum obtained fron non-Federal sources.
