Application of the laser is so widespread in industry and research that today's
undergraduates, especially those considering a scientific career need an
exposure to lasers and modern optics at the undergraduate level. This project
expands the two-semester sophomore Optics Laboratory course at Manhattan College
to include experiments using lasers and modern instrumentation. The optics
laboratory is envisioned as the place where students gain experimental facility
in the use of this equipment in order to prepare them for future independent
research. The final six weeks of the course are dedicated to independent but
guided project work which interested students could pursue in their junior and
senior years with a view toward completion of the project in their Senior Thesis
course. In order to carry out this program, equipment is being acquired which
serves the following purposes:a) provides students with a wide range of options
in their selection of a project, b) enables students to gain some facility in
the operation of the up-to-date optical equipment and instrumentation, and c)is
sophisticated enough to allow students to continue development of their projects
through their junior and senior years. NSF grant funds are being matched with
funds from non-federal sources.
