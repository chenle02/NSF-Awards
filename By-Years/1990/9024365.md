Continuous-fiber reinforced plastics are superior mechanically to short-fiber
reinforced plastics. However, components fabricated from continuously reinforced
plastics are labor-intensive, time consuming and expensive. In phase I and in
response to industrial demand, an innovative system to mold quality,
discontinuous long- fiber, reinforced plastic products to net dimension was
developed. Results of the American Society of Testing Materials test specimens
molded from either virgin or virgin/recycled materials and scanning electron
microscope and ashing data, substantiate the advantageous mechanical/physical
performance of such composite components. The mechanical advantages were
achieved without sacrificing the design and processing flexibilities or
economical advantages of using short-fiber composites. The use of recycled feed-
stock also has favorable environmental implications. In phase II the pioneer
equipment will be developed into a prototype system for its commercialization
and that of its products. The use of other virgin and recycled feed-stock
materials will be evaluated and process optimization for molding various
materials into industrial products will be conducted.
