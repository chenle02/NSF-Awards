*** 9724265 Murnane The Center for Ultrafast Optical Science at the University
of Michigan will develop a new state-of-the-art high power short pulse
(femtosecond) laser, in cooperation with industrial partners. The development of
this new laser will follow from recent advances made at CUOS in ultrafast
intense pulse generation. The facility will be used by scientists both from
within and outside of the University of Michigan in such diverse fields as
electrical engineering, physics, chemistry, materials science, and radiology.
This action is supported by the NSF Major Research Instrumentation Program. ***
