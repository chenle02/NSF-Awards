Abstract

CTS-0138499 Miller, Clarence A William Marsh Rice University

The purpose of this grant is to hold a two-day workshop to be held at Rice
University in Houston, Texas, on October 22 - 23, 2001, to identify fundamental
research opportunities that exist in connection with the use of surfactants to
increase recovery of petroleum from underground reservoirs. This technology was
investigated extensively by the oil industry and university groups between
approximately 1960 and 1986, when most work was discontinued owing to a decrease
in oil prices to less than $10 per barrel. Now the prices seem unlikely to drop
below $20-$25 per barrel, it is desirable to reconsider technology, especially
in view of developments since 1986, including application of surfactants for
remediation of ground water aquifers, which indicate that both costs and
uncertainty in process performance can be reduced. Approximately 30 people from
universities, NSF, DOE, major oil companies, and smaller companies, which
operate many of the fields in the U.S. where the technology would be most
attractive, are invited to the workshop. A final report will be prepared and
submitted to the National Science Foundation.
