9221403 Anderson This support will enable the University of Michigan herbarium
to purchase and install a compactor system and new cabinets to relieve severe
crowding and to accommodate collection growth. This installation will occur in
concert with the University's half million dollar renovation program for the
herbarium, part of which involves the installation a climate control system,
which is essential to protect the collection against infestation. The herbarium
at Michigan houses one of the most important plant collections for systematic
and biodiversity studies, is very active and is one of the best curated in the
nation. Because of its level of activity, collection crowding has become
critical; the cost-share solution of herbarium renovation and installation of a
compactor storage system is creative, opportunistic and cost-effective. This
collection improvement will help conserve the valuable plant collection, and
provide much greater access to the collection for researchers and students. %%%
The University of Michigan Herbarium houses one of the most important research
plant collections in the nation in terms of its international scope and
historical depth. It is a vital research and educational resource to
professionals and students in many disciplines of biodiversity. The support from
this award will enable the herbarium to conserve its holdings, relieve severe
collection crowding, and provide much better access to the collection for the
user community by installing a compactor system for the herbarium cabinets. This
installation will occur in combination with the University's refurbishment of
the herbarium area and installation of climate control facilities. ***
