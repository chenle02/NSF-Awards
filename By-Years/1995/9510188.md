9510188 Williams This SGER award will support research on the recent eruptive
activities of Rabaul Caldera of Papua New Guinea. The goals are to collect real-
time data on SO2 emissions and obtain samples of the eruptive products for
studies of volatiles contained in the magma body. The need to understand large-
scale 9510188caldera forming eruptions and, specifically, the premonitory
activity is very fundamental. The gases are not preserved as a rock record and,
therefore, one must make the analysis in real-time. Volcanic gas flux is very
important in understanding the causes of global change, and there are major
uncertainties about the flux of different gases released by caldera-forming
eruptions.
