The main research objective of this 5-year CAREER project is to provide new
constraints on solar dynamo models, so that a better understanding of the Sun
and solar-cycle dynamics becomes possible. Over the course of the project, the
PI will focus his research on achieving the stated science objective by
completing tasks such as: (i) measuring the meridional and zonal flows at the
surface and in the solar convection zone as functions of depth and latitude;
(ii) quantifying the time variations of these flows over almost two solar
cycles; and, (iii) understanding and correcting the systematics in helioseismic
data sets, in part by using numerical simulations. A diverse cohort of graduate
and undergraduate students will carry out this research, which will ultimately:
(i) produce two PhD graduates in helioseismology; (ii) provide ten minority
undergraduates the opportunity to engage in meaningful research experiences;
and, (iii) stimulate relevant 6th-grade learning activities about the Sun and
high-level content-based professional development training for K-12 instructors.
The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the
AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.
