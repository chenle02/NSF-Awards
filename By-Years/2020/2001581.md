Number theory is a thriving area of mathematics research with deep connections
to both computer science and digital security. The principal goal of this
project is to deepen our understanding of certain ubiquitous number-theoretic
objects (such as elliptic curves, power residues modulo prime numbers, and
classical arithmetic functions such as Euler's phi-function), by studying them
through a quantitative lens. One novel feature of this work is an approach to
these problems that takes advantage of our understanding of the "anatomy of
integers" describing the typical way a number breaks down into component parts
(prime factors).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three main topics of investigation will be
pursued: (1) A detailed study of the value-distribution of arithmetic functions,
one particular problem being to pin down precise conditions under which a number
has many factorizations. Here "factorizations" may be ordered or unordered, and
we may wish to impose certain additional conditions on the parts. (2) The
distribution of power residues. (3) The statistical distribution of torsion
structures of elliptic curves. For (1) and (3), results from the "anatomy
integers" will play a critical role. For (2), the PI plans to supplement the
existing approaches to such problems - which have been mostly analytic,
involving character sums - with algebraic approaches that make use of higher
reciprocity laws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
