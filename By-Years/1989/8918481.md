One feature of arc and back-arc basin volcanic systems isthe close
juxtoaposition of lavas of radically different compositions that are derived
from apparently different mantle sources. One of the problems in understanding
these systems is defining the types and proportions of different sources
contributing to that diversity of magmas. This project will sysematically sample
the active back-arc spreading center and the extinct arc to obstain a better
representation of the temporal and spatial distribution of this source beneath
the Marianas Islands arc. Fundmental questions to addressed are: what are the
principal components contributing to magmas in island arcs and back-arcs, how do
these sources mix and interact spatially and temporally, and what can be deduced
about the geometry of the sources from that mixing?
