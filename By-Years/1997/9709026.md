This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
(CRIF) and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will help the
Department of Chemistry at Northwestern University acquire an X-ray
diffractometer equipped with a CCD detector. The equipment will enhance research
in a number of on-going projects involving electron transfer in inorganic
systems, solid state catalysts and other material, structural inorganic
chemistry, organometallic chemistry, metal cluster formation, and bioinorganic
chemistry and metalloproteins. The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate
and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule.
The information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond distances and
bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information about the
spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
