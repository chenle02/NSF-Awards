This study will result in rigorous inferences of phylogeny for the marine diatom
genus Skeletonema using molecular and morphometric methods in a cladistic
framework. It is proposed that this genus can serve as a model system for
exploring methods and controversies in the phylogeny reconstruction of primarily
asexual organisms at lower phylogenetic levels. The following issues will be
explored: 1. Levels of divergence among populations and species measured using
chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), nuclear rDNA, and a single copy gene nucDNA gene; 2.
Relationships of gene trees and species trees at lower phylogenetic levels; 3.
Concordance of molecular and morphological data analyzed using phylogenetic
systematic methods. It is hypothesized that the most primitive members of the
genus are heavily silicified forms endemic to high-light, oligotrophic warm
marine environments and that the most derived members are lightly silicified
forms inhabiting turbid, eutrophic temperate freshwater and brackish water
environments. The ecological importance and the wealth of background data
available for Skeletonema make it an ideal system in which to test hypotheses of
adaptation in an historical context.
