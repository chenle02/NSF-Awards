Statistical methodology provides important quantitative tools in numerous areas
of research including meeting national goals for improved quality and
productivity, the evaluation of environmental hazards and technological progress
coming from research in chemistry and chemical engineering. This conference will
involve leading statisticians, chemists and chemical engineers from industry,
government and universities to examine the ways in which the most meaningful
data can be obtained and transformed into useful information for research and
new developments in chemistry and chemical engineering. Important problems of
high priority in these areas will be presented to research statisticians; and in
their turn, applied chemists and statisticians can learn firsthand about new
statistical research results to apply in their work. Together these groups may
formulate priorities for future statistical research directions in this
interface.
