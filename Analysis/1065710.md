Gravitational collapse is a central problem in General Relativity intimately
tied, mathematically, to the issue of the long time behavior of general
solutions to the Einstein field equations. The problem can be neatly captured in
the so called final state conjecture (FSC): generic asymptotically flat initial
data sets have maximal future developments, namely solutions of the Einstein
vacuum equations, which look, asymptotically, in any finite region of space, as
a Kerr black hole solution. The focused research effort described in this
proposal identifies four related problems whose solution will greatly advance
our understanding of the FSC. The first three, 1) Uniqueness and 2) Stability of
the Kerr solutions and 3) Formation of black holes, are at the heart of the
theory of black holes. The last one, 4) Bounded L2 curvature conjecture and
break-down criterions (the problem of evolution for very rough initial
conditions and optimal sufficient conditions which insure regularity of the
space-time), is a topic loosely connected with the celebrated cosmic censorship
conjecture, which is itself a necessary ingredient, and a formidable
intellectual obstacle, for resolving the FSC.

Each of the four related problems identified above are, in themselves, very
difficult and deep challenges in general relativity which have witnessed a lot
of progress in recent years based on new analytical and geometric ideas.
Furthermore, recent advances in numerical relativity have allowed new classes of
solutions to the field equations to be obtained in highly non-trivial
situations. Advances toward solving the FSC will require continued development
within individual methodologies, though we plan to accelerate progress via a
closer interaction amongst the different approaches. Cooperation between
mathematical and numerical relativity can substantially help the former by
endowing it with a powerful experimental tool and also help the latter to
formulate key questions connected with the development of new numerical codes.
To be successful, this will require training a new class of researcher,
proficient in both the relevant formal mathematics and high performance
scientific computing. We will engage graduate students and postdoctoral scholars
in this effort, giving them the skills necessary to have a strong impact in
their future careers, whether in academia or the broader work force. The
research carried out will strengthen the foundations of general relativity and
our understanding of black holes, which is of significant import to the broader
nascent scientific field of gravitational wave astronomy.
