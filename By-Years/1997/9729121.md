Abstract 9729121 Lange The angular intensity distribution on the sky of the
cosmic microwave background radiation carries a wealth of information about the
early Universe since this radiation started on its journey to us just a few
hundred thousand years after the Big Bang. The details of the distribution on
angular scales from a few degrees to a few minutes can cleanly discriminate
between competing models of the dark matter which makes up most of the
gravitationally attracting mass of the Universe. This balloon borne microwave
telescope - called BOOMERANG - will measure variations on a scale from 12minutes
to 3.6 degrees. BOOMERANG has already been flown for a short flight in the US
and will be flown on a long-duration balloon from McMurdo Antarctica in December
of 1998 with an expectation of getting up to two weeks of continuous data. The
funds necessary to build the balloon payload have been provided by NASA, NSF's
Division of Astronomical Sciences and Italy. This award will provide some funds
for the Antarctic flight and some of the data analysis. The balloon will be
provided and launched by NASA while logistical support an payload recovery will
be supplied by NSF. ***
