EAR-9505217 Lithgow-Bertelloni The Fellow proposes to calculate the global
intraplate stress field for the last 65 My of EarthOs history based on simple
models of mantle flow and detailed plate tectonic reconstructions. The approach
is to test first the hypothesis that global scale mantle circulation can explain
relatively large-scale (>500 km) intraplate variations in stress regimes and
geology, by carefully comparing a large variety of existing geological and
geophysical data sets (e.g., intraplate stress data, paleostress indicators,
seismic, gravity, and heat flow profiles, etc.). The results will serve as a
baseline for assessing the importance of smaller scale dynamic features, such as
localized upwellings, and of regional scale crustal heterogeneities. A regional
study using detailed seismic tomography models will be carried out for Western
North America, to understand the influence of global dynamic processes on the
development of the three types of stress regimes represented by the Rocky
Mountains compressional region, the Basin and Range extension and the strike-
slip deformation in California. This work has the potential to reach far beyond
parochial applications in deciphering the mechanics of enigmatic intraplate
tectonic features; evolution of the stress field is one missing key to
understanding mantle convection.
