The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) project is to enable a novel heating and hot water system that
reduces energy use and emissions without compromising comfort. The replacement
of gas/oil-fueled heating and hot water systems by efficient electric
alternatives is critical to reduce (GHG) emissions from the building sector that
accounts for nearly one-third of emissions worldwide. These reductions are
achieved through electrification enhanced by “load shifting,” the practice of
consuming energy from the grid at times when it is cheapest and cleanest, and
storing that energy for use in the home all day (including peak usage times).
The project goals are to improve the reliability, security, and scalable
manufacturability of this system, making it affordable to install for most
households. Residential-scale load shifting will help the housing industry move
from fossil fuel-based heating to meet emissions reduction requirements in a
cost-effective way. The load shifting capability using readily available hot
water storage allows utilities to balance the energy grid and increase the
deployment of renewable energy sources with reduced infrastructure costs, as
well as reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR
Phase II project proposes to address the technical risks facing large scale
deployment of heating and hot water load shifting to enable rapid deployment of
high-efficiency heat pump systems for residential applications in the United
States. The project will systematically build knowledge of system-level
performance, reliability, and failure modes. Cost drivers in system integration
and storage density will be addressed and improved. Secure cloud computing
architecture and machine learning will address technical barriers to wide-spread
optimization of loads. Taken together, the program supports the capability to
deploy reliable, secure, tested hardware and software as a
solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
