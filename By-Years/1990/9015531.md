The primary objective of this US-Bulgaria research project between Dr. Koji
Nakanishi of Columbia University and Dr. Nina Berova of The Bulgarian Institute
of Organic Chemistry is to examine biopolymers using exciton chirality methods.
Pectins will be featured for overall classification and determination of
glycosidic linkages. In their work, the researchers intend to develop and employ
a new set of cyanine dyes that react with amino groups for absolute
configuration of alkaloids and amino sugars. (These dyes are chosen for unique
spectroscopic properties, requiring only nanogram sample quantities.) Results
are expected to extend the methodology for determining microstructure of
complex, irregular polysaccharides such as pectin and would allow for the
determination of absolute configurations of small amounts of rare sugars and the
frequency and points of branching in glycosidic linkages. This project in
organic chemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the United States and Eastern
Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of
strong mutual interest and competence.
