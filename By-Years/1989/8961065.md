This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of trace surface
analysis. The thrust of this activity is the construction and testing of an
imaging neutron activation analysis detector capable of discerning element
concentrations on a point by point basis. Neutron activation analysis is an
extremely powerful method for measuring major, minor, and trace element
concentrations in a wide variety of samples. In this method, analyte elements
absorb a neutron to form a radionuclide which usually decays by emitting a B
particle and a gamma ray. The gamma ray energies are characteristic of the
analyte element and they are normally measured with a germanium detector.
Secondary electrons produced at a sample surface as a B-particle passes out of a
thin sample can be accelerated and imaged. When gamma rays and B-particles are
detected in coincidence, the gamma ray energy answers the question "what" and
the secondary electron position answers the question "where" for an individual
radionuclide disintegration. This information will be organized into element
maps and local area gamma ray spectra. Successful pursuit of this research
should facilitate the application of imaging neutron activation analysis to the
characterization of heterogeneous solids. Following a coupled successful Phase
II effort, widespread applications in fields such as geology, biology, materials
science, and particle analysis can be anticipated.
