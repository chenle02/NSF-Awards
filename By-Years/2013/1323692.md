The project is addressing the critical need for more Native American
geoscientists by creating a innovative Baccalaureate degree program in Hydrology
at Salish Kootenai College, a tribal college which serves the Salish, Kootenai,
and Pend d'Oreille people, as well as American Indians from throughout the U.S.
The curriculum, which includes undergraduate research on tribal lands, is
informed by a unique combination of culturally relevant instruction, industry-
recognized standards, input from an external advisory board comprising
scientists, educators, administrators, industry professionals, tribal leaders
and resource managers, and competencies required for geoscientists working in
Native American watersheds, such as water-law and sovereignty issues. Curriculum
development is supplemented by co-curricular retention strategies, and project
assessment addresses the impact of both the culturally relevant curriculum and
co-curricular efforts to increase the rate of Native American geoscience
graduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in
its creative and comprehensive approach to curriculum design and retention in
the first geoscience-centered baccalaureate program at a Tribal College or
University. The broader impacts include a sustainable program that graduates
additional Native American hydrologists, who contribute valuable perspectives to
the science and support resource management in watersheds undergoing change from
natural and human causes.
