Abstract ATM-9401953 Mayewski, Paul A. University of New Hampshire Title: An
Asian Paleoclimate Workshop, Nepal, April 1995 Climate Change is one of the
great intellectual challenges faced by science and one of the great unknowns for
civilization. Due to the extreme socio-economic ramifications of the
environmental changes produced as a consequence of climate change, the
international scientific community is currently attempting to understand this
phenomena. This award provides for the partial support for an international
workshop entitled: "Himlayan/Tibetan Plateau Paleoclimate Workshop." The
workshop is scheduled to be held in Nepal during early April 1995. This meeting
will be held also under the auspices of IGBP/PAGES and builds on the
recommendations of the PAGES meeting on "High Resolution Record of Past Climate
from Monsoon Asia," (Taiwan, 1993). The Nepal workshop will focus on
interpreting and developing paleoclimate records from central Asia, a key region
for completing the spatial framework of the global paleo-dataset required for
understanding global climate and environmental change. Researchers from Asia,
the United States, Europe, and Canada will synthesize, organize, and stimulate a
rigorous paleoclimate program for Asia. Workshop participants will produce a
substantive summary and interpretation of existing paleoclimate records,
followed by a Science and Implementation Plan with recommendations for the
future course of paleoclimate research in this region.
