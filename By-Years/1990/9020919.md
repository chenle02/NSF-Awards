The development of the accretionary wedge offshore Oregon involves the
consolidation and fluid loss of the sediments that compose the wedge. This
project will use a combined petrographic and isotopic study of carbonate cements
from the accretionary wedge sediments to constrain fluid sources for different
generations of cement.
