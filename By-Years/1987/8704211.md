The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was established
to provide support to strengthen the research environments and capabilities of
predominantly minority institutions or institutions that have substantial
minority student populations. Eligible institutions must also have graduate
programs in science or program in engineering. Funding is provided for faculty
research in fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and
for the acquisition of research instrumentation. Sul Ross State University will
use RIMI support to study insect-resistant range grasses of the Chihuahuan
Desert Region (CDR). Certain compounds are known to have a protective function
against various herbivores and researchers at Sul Ross propose to select grasses
that are resistant to grasshoppers, a major pest of rangeland forage grasses.
This project will entail a genecological survey of CDR range grasses in order to
assess genetic and environmental variability of these rangeland resources. The
principal investigator is well trained in chemical systematics and has published
in refereed journals. The Foundation has supported this project because it will
provide minorities in the southwest with greater opportunities to participate in
meritorious research.
