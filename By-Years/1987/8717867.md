Bohm and his associate Raga have obtained spectroscopic and imaging observations
of Herbig-Haro objects. They have shown that these observations fit reasonably
to a model of a bowshock around a spherical moving obstacle. They plan
additional, carefully chosen observations and continued study of the data and
corresponding theoretical models. Soon after interstellar gases collect to form
new stars, these stars re-eject some of the gases. Among the results are some
tiny but sometimes spectacularly shaped nebulae, named Herbig-Haro objects after
their discoverers. Bohm and Raga have shown that the objects are really the
radiating gases in a bowshock in front of the stellar object, which moves like a
bullet through the surrounding gases. This award supports new observations and a
significant increase in the ability to model and interpret the data.
