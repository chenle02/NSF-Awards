This project addresses a key modeling issue faced by many data analysts working
with genomic data. For a set of individuals or observations, many different
types of high throughput experimental datasets are generated, and the question
then becomes how to model these data. In many problems, the goal is to
prioritize which parts of the genome one wishes to study. While it is commonly
assumed that the different data types are linearly correlated in either an
unconditional or conditional sense, in many settings the nature of the
correlation is unknown. This research focuses on multivariate methods of
analysis with high-dimensional genomic data that relax the linearity assumption.
Two classes of problems will be studied during the course of the project. The
first is Hidden Markov Models and the second is multiple testing procedures,
whose use have become commonplace with genomic datasets. This project proposes
novel multivariate extensions of both types of method with a goal of being
characterized by sound theoretical statistical principles while simultaneously
being computationally feasible on big datasets. The methodology will be
evaluated using several real datasets as well as through simulation
studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will involve an interplay between
statisticians and biologists. The broader use of this work will be to prioritize
molecules for follow-up studies in any biological setting. It will be useful for
biologists and scientists studying disease processes who wish to find new
therapeutic targets or further advance basic etiological understanding. The
educational goals of the project include new course components for graduate
students at Penn State and training of graduate students in Statistics.
