This award supports a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative research project between
Professors John Wefel and Michael Cherry, Department of Physics and Astronomy,
Louisiana State University, and Professor Takeshi Ogata, Institute for Cosmic
Ray Research, University of Tokyo. It is part of the Japanese-American
Cooperative Emulsion Experiment (JACEE), which began in 1978 to investigate the
physics of high energy nucleus-nucleus interactions at energies above those
available at accelerators and for studying the nuclear composion of primary
cosmic rays extending up to the extensive air shower (EAS) region. The JACEE
Collaboration involves four institutions in the United States and eight in
Japan. Japan produces the world's highest quality nuclear emulsion and Japanese
researchers pioneered the use of emulsion chambers. Scientists in the United
States have developed the technology for high altitude balloon flights,
including the newest Long Duration Ballooning (LDB) capability. Laboratories in
both countries are well equipped to carry out detailed microscope measurements
involved in analyzing particle events in emulsion chambers. This grant will
permit the U.S. investigators to travel to collaborating institutions in Japan.
Contributing to this grant is the NSF Division of Physics, which will support
shipping costs and the costs of travel of the investigators to the site of
balloon flights in Australia.
