This Software Capitalization Grant will support the free distribution of
important image analysis software to all interested universities, colleges, and
industrial sites. The research software, developed with support from a 1983
Center for Engineering Research award, includes routines for superquadric
volumetric modeling, wavelet decomposition of signals, image segmentation, and
tactile camera visualization. Polishing of the user interface (including
documentation) and porting of the suite as necessary to Sun, Microvax, and IBM
platforms will be a done by a team of undergraduate students, providing valuable
research experience and career training. An effort will also be made to identify
serious users and compile information useful for evaluating the success of this
experimental program.
