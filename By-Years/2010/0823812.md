This award will support the participation of US-based mathematicians, especially
women, graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty, in the "International
Workshop in Fourier Analysis and Partial Differential Equations" that will be
held at Beijing Normal University (Beijing, China) from December 15-17, 2008.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop is being conducted in conjunction with the
joint meeting of the American Mathematical Society and the Shanghai Mathematical
Society that will be hosted by Fudan University (Shanghai, China) from December
17-21, 2008. Thus many of the workshop speakers will also speak in the special
session on harmonic analysis and partial differential equations at the Shanghai
meeting. The confluence of the two meetings ensures that an unusually rich and
broad collection of speakers will participate in the workshop. The range of
topics is also very impressive, covering such active areas as multi-parameter
Fourier analysis, Hardy spaces, Littlewood-Paley-Stein theory, multi-linear
singular integrals, subelliptic PDE, dispersive PDE, infinity Laplace equations,
and Monge-Ampere equations. The format of the workshop provides ample
opportunity for young mathematicians to speak.&lt;br/&gt;
