This grant provides partial support for the acquisition of automated headspace
equilibration device for stable isotopic analysis of H and O in natural water
samples. The device would be mated to an existing stable isotope mass
spectrometer (Finnigan MAT 252) in the Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences
at Washington University - St Louis (Wash-SL). The upgrade of this facility will
support NSF/EAR funded research that relies on stable isotopic data to study the
residence time and base flow of economically important major rivers in the
central U.S. from storm to drought conditions (e.g., the Mississippi and the
Missouri) and study of the flow dynamics of karst systems in response to storm
events. The upgraded SIRMS facility will also support student training in
methods of stable isotopic analysis in the hydrologic as well as petrologic
sciences. ***
