This Chemistry Division award provides support for a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in the Chemistry Department, University of
Connecticut, directed by Dr. Amy R. Howell. Ten students will participate each
year over the next three years in a 10-week summer program. The program will
focus on women students from the nearby geographic region who have limited
opportunities for independent research. The students will be exposed to a
variety of research topics across all the fields of chemistry, and through a
series of seminars they will be introduced to safety practices, effective
communication of research results, computational methods in chemistry, careers
in chemistry, and ethical issues in science. Students will be encouraged to
report research results at conferences such as regional meetings of the American
Chemical Society.
