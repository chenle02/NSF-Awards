A test data collection facility at the Microelectronic Engineering Department of
the Rochester Institute of Technology allows their semiconductor process
engineering students to evaluate the quality of their designs and processing,
manage yield improvements, and thoroughly analyze devices and processes from a
statistical point of view. The students, who fabricate thousands of devices and
circuits in their undergraduate years, have now a semi-automatic wafer level
probing capability to collect, analyze, and correlate orders of magnitude more
test data in the same amount of test time previously devoted to manual test
procedures. Tedious re- connections to various test instruments for test
changeovers are being replaced by a flexible matrix switching system. The
quality of the design and fabrication processes can be determined only if
appropriate metrics are obtained. The results of automatic testing for defects
in density structures, devices, and circuits are considered in this laboratory
and throughout the microelectronics curriculum.
