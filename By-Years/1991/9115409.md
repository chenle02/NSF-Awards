Dr. Dennis Powers is the Director of Stanford University's Hopkins Marine
Station, located in Monterey, California. The Station has a long and
distinguished record of research support in marine biology by Stanford faculty
members and by visiting investigators. Dr. Powers proposes construction of an
addition onto the Station's current open-air tank seawater system. The addition
would be an enclosed environmentally buffered building dedicated to culturing
and experimental studies of marine organisms. The proposed facility would
increase the quality and impact of research projects currently underway at the
Station, and would attract new investigators and their students to the facility.
Marine labs such as the Hopkins Marine Station will have increasing impact on
research in fields such as biomedical science, ecology, evolutionary theory,
oceanography, and global climate change. Providing these institutions with
adequate facilities and instrumentation is essential for the U.S. research
community.
