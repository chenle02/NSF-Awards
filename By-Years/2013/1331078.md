This study examines the important role that biological understanding of the
tropics has played in the development of US multinational firms seeking to
promote economic growth and the free movement of commodities and commerce with
Latin America and West Africa. Using the case of rubber and coffee plantations,
this historical study documents the close relationship between American business
and the development of American scientific research and understanding in
tropical biology and medicine. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The findings will be
widely distributed using an interactive website
