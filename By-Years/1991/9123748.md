Mothers of almost all nonaquatic, nonhuman mammalian species ingest amniotic
fluid and placenta during delivery. Dr. Kristal has demonstrated that the
increased contact, associated with this ingestion from the surface of the young,
causes an accelerated onset of maternal behavior toward those young. Moreover,
he has shown that this enigmatic behavior helps to relieve the mother's pain and
discomfort during delivery. A substance contained in the afterbirth materials,
which he has named the Placental Opioid-Enhancing Factor or POEF, seems to
potentiate any ongoing opioid-mediated analgesia but does not by itself produce
analgesia. The importance of this factor is that during labor and delivery,
pregnancy-mediated analgesia can be maximized without so massive a release of
endogenous opiates. Thus, it is possible to relieve pain with only a minimum
brain opioid level. This is very important since too high a level of natural
occurring opioids during and immediately after birth can detrimentally interfere
with maternal behavior. A major problem that has prevented a thorough
understanding of this fundamental behavior is the inability to prevent
delivering mothers from ingesting any placenta or amniotic fluid without
stressing the mother, disrupting delivery, or blocking the mother's natural
behaviors. Dr. Kristal has overcome this obstacle by a clever series of
experiments in which activated charcoal administration is used to block the
utilization of subsequently ingested POEF. He can now determine its effects on
pain threshold, maternal and other behaviors, as well as natural characteristics
of delivery and fertility. These findings will enhance our knowledge of the
physiological mechanisms of birth and postpartum behavior. Moreover, the
research has importance for a broader range of mammalian taxa, since it could
point the way toward the development of a new class of non-narcotic analgesics
and shed new light on fundamental processes involved in pain and the body's
reaction to it.
