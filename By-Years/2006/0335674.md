The focus of this project is to develop training procedures for knowledge and
skill that will survive primary task or background changes and, thereby, produce
flexible, as well as efficient and durable, performance in emergency situations
both in civilian life and in the military. The proposed experiments examine
performance in dynamic and changing task environments. A complex set of
concurrent tasks will be created analogous to those encountered by digitally
proficient operators who have available fully computerized control and
communication systems. Two experiments will be conducted within this paradigm.
One of them will focus on a concurrent duration estimation task, specifically
the different forgetting functions for declarative and procedural information in
this task. In the second experiment, a proposed memory constriction principle
will be tested, according to which the time span from which knowledge can most
easily be retrieved and used in a given context shrinks as stress level
increases. The broader impacts of the proposed experiments are in the effective
utilization of training skills for emergency response and reaction that persist
over time. This is especially important for everyone involved in homeland
security since training is likely to be sporadic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
