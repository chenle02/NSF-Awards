We propose to investigate how the virulent satellite RNA C intensifies the
symptoms of its helper virus, Turnip Crinkle Virus (TCV). RNA C differs from the
TCV avirulent satellites RNA D and RNA F primarily by the presence of a 3'TCV-
homologous domain. We will analyze whether this 3' domain is responsible for
satellite symptom production by infecting turnip with chimeric transcripts
composed of the avirulent satellites linked to the 3' domain of RNA C, and
assaying for infectivity and symptoms. We will also create a comprehensive set
of site- specific mutations throughout RNA C in order to further specify the
region(s) of the satellite involved in symptom production. By determining the
secondary structure of RNA C, we will correlate disruption of secondary
structure with satellite replication and plant disease morphology. We will test
two models for RNA C's mode of action: l) RNA C binds to cellular factor(s)
thereby acting to titrate out these factors necessary for basic cellular
metabolism or, 2) RNA C aneals to putative plant U7 RNA and thereby interfers
with histone mRNA processing leading to plants with a diseased morphology. This
second model is based on the observation that RNA C is complementary to 83% of
sea urchin U7 RNA. This study will lay the groundwork for establishing the
molecular basis of disease production in plants by small non-protein coding
RNAs.
