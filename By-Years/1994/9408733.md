9408733 Eberly The current work focuses on three areas; sub-Casimir effects and
related vacuum fluctuation phenomena in dynamically distorted cavities, analytic
eigen-solutions for a unique two-channel model in a multi-mode theory and a
recent discovery of dressed fields and a new class of solitons for three level
media. The research is likely to have significant impact on our understanding of
the fundamental nature of laser-matter interactions. ***
