Studies of the energetics of complex materials will focus on three areas (a)
high pressure phases, (b) order-disorder and solid solutions, and (c) oxides
with transition metals in high oxidation states, including phases related to
oxide superconductors. In each case, high temperature calorimetry (with an
increasing emphasis on in situ studies above 800oC) will be combined with
structural and spectroscopic studies and with theoretical modelling to
understand the microscopic basis for macroscopic properties. High pressure
synthesis will provide new materials. Emphasis will be on perovskite, spinel,
ilmenite, K2NiF4, and related structures.
