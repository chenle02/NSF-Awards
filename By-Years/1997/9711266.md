9711266 Davidovits The Atmospheric Chemistry Colloquium for Emerging Senior
Scientists (ACCESS) was established as an institution aimed at recent or
expectant Ph.D. recipients on the threshold of independent research careers in
atmospheric chemistry. This will be the fourth in a series of Colloquia designed
to introduce these young scientists and their thesis and/or post doctoral
research to one another and to representatives of the major funding agencies
involved in atmospheric chemistry and closely related topics. ACCESS IV will be
held at Boston College June 12-14, 1997, immediately prior to the 1997 Gordon
Research Conference on Atmospheric Chemistry in Newport, RI. The colloquium
attendants will participate in the Gordon conference.
