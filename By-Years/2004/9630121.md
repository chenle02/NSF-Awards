A group member who is especially salient in the group because of a distinctive
characteristic is referred to as a solo. Women and minorities who occupy senior
positions within organizations often do so as solos. Researchers have suggested
a number of ways in which solo status may have important long term consequences
for the ultimate success or failure of the solo individual in an organization.
For example, solos often attract increased attention from observers, and they
are often evaluated negatively and on the basis of stereotypes rather than
actual performance. The proposed research will examine two basic issues. First,
whether solo status increases the likelihood for solos to emerge as leaders in
task groups. Second, whether observed solo effects vary as a function of the
perceived salience of the solo. The proposed research will contribute to a
deeper understanding of the psychological processes that characterize solo
arrangements in group settings. Results of the proposed research should also
clarify how such effects occur in race contexts.
