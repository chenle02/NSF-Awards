The wireless revolution in communication and computing has imbued electrical
engineers with a steadily deepening appreciation for the importance of energy-
efficient design. On the other hand, energy efficiency has for eons been a
paramount consideration of living systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistical
thermodynamics says that kTln2 is a lower bound for how many joules of energy
must be expended in order either to encode/transmit/decode or to
write/read/erase one bit of information in an environment at T degrees Kelvin, k
being Boltzmann's constant. Biological encoding and decoding that performs close
to the thermodynamic limit uses continuous time differential pulse position
modulation (CTDPPM), arguably the most energy-efficient way to encode and
transmit information. The co-PIs are applying their interdisciplinary expertise
in neuroscience and information theory to address research topics such as: (i)
Performance trade-offs in their bits/joule maximizing exact solution of a 1915
model by Schrodinger now known to be applicable to thresholding neurons, (ii)
Extension of the Schrodinger-style optimization to short term dynamics of
bits/joule maximizing CTDPPM systems; the present solution provides
statistically optimum behavior only in the long term, (iii) Steps toward
extension to networks containing multi-compartment elements, emphasizing
hierarchical architectures with feedback governing short-term distribution of
energy resources, and (iv) Intriguing connections with the burgeoning research
discipline of network coding.
