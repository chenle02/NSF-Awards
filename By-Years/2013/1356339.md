The goal of the Marie Curie Scholars program at the College of Saint Mary (CSM),
an all-female undergraduate institution with a high proportion of minority
students who are underrepresented in science, is to increase the number of women
who not only attain their undergraduate degrees in science, but who go on to
pursue careers in science. To achieve this goal, the undergraduate science
curriculum immerses the students in active learning environments - including
service learning, outreach and research - so that they understand the role of
science in the world and their role in science. The program at CSM is uniquely
positioned to observe, analyze and document trends and effects of STEM promotion
with women and female minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program builds on
best practices from the STEM education research community. CSM is committed to
the explicit education of key scientific skills and abilities such as the
scientific method, research design and proposal writing, scientific literacy and
scientific writing. CSM will build a cohort mentality in S-STEM students through
early team-building and ongoing mentoring programming within the S-STEM cohort.
A high quality academic program for the scholars will be provided that includes
a learning community structure to ensure peer-to-peer communication through both
formal and informal interactions. The project will be assessed using formative,
reflective essays from the S-STEM scholars that will deepen their understanding
of the goals of the project as well as provide feedback to the management team.
