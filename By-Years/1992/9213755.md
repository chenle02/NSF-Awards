Electronic structure calculations grounded in the Hohenberg-Kohn- Sham density
functional theory predict what atoms, molecules, and solids can exist, and with
what properties. The accuracy of these predictions depends on the accuracy of
the functionals or rules used to construct the energy from the electron density.
Goals of this theoretical research are: (1) to develop, from first principles,
more accurate exchange correlation and kinetic energy functionals of the local
spin density and generalized gradient types; (2) to apply generalized gradient
approximations in calculations of measurable proerties such as the electron spin
density at the nucleus of an atom or the energy of a metallic surface; (3) to
understand the capabilities and limitations of these approximations in light of
radical nonlocality of the exact exchange correlation potential; (4) to refine
and test fully nonlocal functionals such as the self-interaction correction or
the weighted density approximation; (5) to construct local pseudopotentials
describing effective interactions between valence electrons and ionic cores in
metals using only the equilibrium density, the valence, and a "smoothness"
condition; (6) to study size effects in metals. %%% Theoretical research will be
conducted on the foundations of one of the major techniques currently used to
determine the properties of atoms, molecules and solids. The results of this
work will reinforce the fundamentals of density functional theory and provide
guidance for new directions for its computational implementation.
