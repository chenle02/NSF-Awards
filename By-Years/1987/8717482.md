This research is aimed at determining the consequences of a physical refuge
upon the dynamics of a predator-prey system. Red scale is pest of citrus that is
controlled by the parasitoid Aphytis in southern California. A refuge population
of scale exists, to an extent that varies among cultivars, in the interior of
the citrus tree. Citrus cultivars also vary in the scale load they carry on
exterior foliage and fruit. The hypothesis to be tested is that a key to the
stability of scale density on the foliage is the extent to which the refuge
population is developed. An extensive survey of citrus groves will be conducted
to test this hypotheses in which both the refuge and exterior populations will
be sampled. A series of experiments aimed at providing a mechanistic explanation
for between-cultivar variation in terms of mortality due to natural enemies and
crawler migration rates will be done. Using this information, a model that
predicts the influence of refuge populations on exterior populations will be
developed. Red scale-Aphytis interaction is considered a model system for
studying the effect of a physical refuge on population dynamics. The impact of
the refuge in terms of effect on population size will be assessed and the
factors determining the contribution of the refuge to total recruitment will be
quantified.
