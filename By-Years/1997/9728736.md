The somatic sensory system carries information on touch, temperature and pain
to the brain. Nerve cells innervating the skin called 'first-order' neurons send
signals to the spinal cord segments, where they make functional connections
called synapses to neurons that carry information up and down the spinal column.
Biochemical compounds called neurotransmitters are released by the first-order
cells to activate or inhibit these target 'second- order' cells, and an
important class of these signaling molecules is known as peptides. This project
addresses the role of the peptides enkephalin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and
calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) in this neurotransmission. Particular
genes or anti-sense constructs will be delivered by a novel methodology
utilizing modified viruses, to increase or decrease the production of these
peptides in the first-order sensory neurons. Molecular analysis of gene
expression, a behavioral assay for sensation, and pharmacological manipulation
will determine how the peptides act, and what receptor molecules on the cell
surface membranes are responsible for their action. Results are expected to
clarify how enkephalins and NPY inhibit sensory transmission, while CGRP
facilitates it. This project will have impact beyond simply somatosensory
transmission, because it will clarify mechanisms of action for particular
neurotransmitters used in other parts of the brain, and the gene-delivery
methods to be perfected here will provide a powerful tool to study the roles of
other molecular components in neuronal function.
