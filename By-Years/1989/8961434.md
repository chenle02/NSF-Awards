Operations such as edge and motion detection tax current and future conventional
digital electronic image processing systems. This project is building a novel
integrated device capable of performing these functions in real time. The device
is based on the silicon retina of Carver Mead, but adds optical outputs,
allowing processed images to be fed directly to other optical processing stages.
This technology will allow output of the retina at frame rates up to 10 kHz,
independent of the size of the retina.
