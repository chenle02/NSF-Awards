Risk Sensitive Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control is a modification of the
classical LQG control technique that incorporates noise- induced large
deviations of the system state into the design specifications. The goal of the
research is to obtain definite results for Risk Sensitive LQG control for
systems defined on an infinite time interval and to establish the relationship
between the resulting design and existing designs for linear systems. The main
themes of the research include an analysis of the large deviations properties of
the Risk Sensitive LQG cost functional, design of optimal stationary Risk
Sensitive LQG controllers for completely and partially observed systems,
analytical evaluation of the relationship between Risk Sensitive LQG control and
H-infinity control and the application of stationary Risk Sensitive LQG control
to important physical control problems such as telescope pointing, robot arm
pointing and airplane landing. The research is expected to result in a new
design methodology for linear stationary stochastic systems that has improved
noise rejection capabilities as compared to the standard LQG design. An
additional potential benefit is a new viewpoint from which the important
H-infinity design methodology can be evaluated.
