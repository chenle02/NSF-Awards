The precise nature of controls on species distributions and abundances is the
central question in ecology. Our understanding of these controls is essential
for managing natural and artificial systems for both diversity and yield, and
for predicting and ameliorating the consequences of human impacts, including
global climate changes. Biological diversity has traditionally been understood
as the expression of ecological differentiation between species. More recent
interest in the adaptive flexibility, or "plasticity", of many important species
characteristics has raised a fundamental problem; the more plastic a character
is, the less it is likely to control species distributions. As a result, a major
task for ecologists is to understand the relative plasticity of species
characteristics. Previous work suggested that morphology (root--shoot
allocation) might be a key inflexible character in understanding the structure
and dynamics of vegetation, but a crucial experiment failed to confirm this for
a well-studied old-field successional system. This study will test a new
hypothesis that physiology (tissue nitrogen concentration) is relatively less
plastic than morphology and may then be a key characteristic controlling plant
distributions and interactions in this system, and will determine the range of
applicability of this hypothesis.
