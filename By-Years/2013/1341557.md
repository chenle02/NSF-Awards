In our layered atmosphere, gravity (or internal) waves are quasi-periodic
disturbances most familiar as the wave-like cloud patterns, such as observed in
the lee of mountain ranges. This project seeks to experimentally investigate the
role of the atmospheric gravity waves in ionosphere-troposphere coupling. In
particular, the dynamics of plasma density irregularities in the ionospheric F
region, and the connection of these irregularities with atmospheric gravity
waves will be investigated. The investigation is to take place in Antarctica as:
1) Large numbers of gravity waves may be observed there, and 2) The
electromagnetic background there is quiet, important for detection of radio
signals to be observed in this study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To detect the
density irregularities a HF receiver and transmitter will be placed at two
different locations in Antarctica, probing the ionosphere along the passage
between these two points. Numerical modelling will be used to describe
parameters of the troposphere below the ionospheric path of the HF signal. The
HF signal will give information about density irregularities, and the numerical
model will give information about gravity waves in the troposphere. By comparing
information of numerical model and from HF observations the investigators will
be able to make conclusions about simultaneous occurrences of irregularities in
the ionospheric plasma and gravity waves.
