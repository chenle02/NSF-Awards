The academic community is addressing science questions as described, for
example, in the 1996 Future of Marine Geology and Geophysics (FUMAGES) report,
that require short- and long-term deployments of large numbers of ocean-bottom
seismometers and/or ocean-bottom hydrophones. In addition to supporting research
funded through the NSF Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) Marine Geology &amp;
Geophysics Core Program, there is increasing use of ocean bottom seismometers by
the EarthScope, Continental Dynamics, Ocean Drilling Program, and GeoPRISMS
Programs. To provide the large number of instruments needed to support these
programs, maintain the necessary technical capability, and provide access to
Ocean-Bottom Seismic Instruments for a broad user community, the Ocean-Bottom
Seismic Instrument Pools (OBSIP) were established in 1999. In light of the
continuing demand for ocean bottom seismometers, the Marine Geology and
Geophysics Program of OCE invited proposals to establish a Management Office for
OBSIP (OMO). The OMO will provide essential improvements in oversight and
management for OBSIP. Broader impacts of the OMO include its inherent
contribution to the U.S. science infrastructure, support for the broad
scientific objectives of the Marine Geology &amp; Geophysics Program, and its
specific contribution to scientific objectives that have particularly high
societal relevance, such as earthquake hazards in the Cascadia region
Washington, Oregon and Northern California.
