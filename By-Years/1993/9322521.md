We propose research on Bayesian representation and inference methods in AI,
focused especially on decision-making in dynamic environments. Dynamic
environments provide both an opportunity and a challenge to intelligent systems
research: the flexibility required to perform well in such environments will
most likely demand AI methods, but AI research traditionally has focused on more
static environments. The proposed research builds on our current research on
inference in Bayes nets, and focuses on real- time inference and dynamic
representation construction. The results will contribute to our understanding of
the problems of and potential for decision-theoretic techniques in dynamic
environments, and will provide a decision-theoretic foundation for complex real-
time monitoring, assessment, and control applications.
