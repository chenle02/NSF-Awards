This award will support a study of brightness variations in cataclysmic
variables (CVs) seen in data from the Kepler satellite. Cataclysmic variables
are binary stars in which material is flowing from an evolved companion onto a
white dwarf; the flow contributes to the maintenance of an accretion disk around
the white dwarf. The Kepler data has unprecedented time sampling and span, which
should reveal brightness variations on many different time scales. The major
components of the project are (1) to convert a public domain general purpose
hydrodynamical code to an accretion disk simulation code, which will be
distributed to the astronomical community; (2) to model the complexity of
brightness variations as indicators of the nature of the plasma flow; and (3) to
accurately model the radiation hydrodynamics and emergent spectral energy
distribution of CV accretion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is expected to
improve the understanding of gaseous flow around compact objects, which in turn
will she light on many astrophysical phenomena including the production of
supernovae. The public release of numerical codes will aid future research in
CVs and other areas of study.
