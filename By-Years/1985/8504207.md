In this research project, a reliable and efficient motion program (manipulation
theory) will be developed for general robots with and without redundant
freedoms. Good kinematic structure and good arm movement programs are both
essential for a versatile manipulator. Classical search techniques to optimize
the kinematic configuration of the arm are extremely exhaustive and therefore
not feasible. Using the aforementioned general purpose manipulation theory,
efficient search techniques will be developed to improve the configuration of
the robotic arms.
