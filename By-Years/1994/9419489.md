9419489 Randall A major point of interaction between photosynthesis,
photorespiration and mitochondrial respiration is at the pyruvate dehydrogenase
complex (PDC). This multi-enzyme complex is the primary entry point for carbon
into the Krebs cycle for energy production and the generation of biosynthetic
intermediates. PDC also provides the precursor for fatty acid biosynthesis,
branch chain amino acids, isoprenoid compounds and some growth regulators.
Objectives of this research are: to characterize the expression of PDC component
enzymes, their mitochondrial import, processing and assembly in the complex; to
characterize events, mechanisms and modulators of PDC activity during
development and photosynthesis in C3, C4, and CAM plants; to extend biochemical
characterization of PDC and establish in vitro and in organello regulatory
mechanisms; and, to examine the long-term regulation/expression of PDC. Pea and
Arabidopsis are the primary experimental systems used. This project will
facilitate evaluation of the following concepts: that import and assembly of the
mitochondrial matrix multi-enzyme cmplex, PDC, requires chaperones; that
reversible phosphorylation of PDC is a primary control mechanism for carbon
entry into the Krebs cycle; that PDC regulatory mechanisms differ during
development and between C3, C4 and CAM plants.
