This action is to help support a Gordon Research Conference on neuronal
plasticity. The nervous system undergoes many changes of various types from
anatomical to chemical. These changes occur throughout the life of the system,
from embryo to death. It is therefore important to continue studying these
plastic changes to determine which ones are critical and which ones allow a
behaving animal to remain normal even in the case of nervous system damage.
Scientists from various scientific disciplines will meet in an informal
conference setting to discuss new discoveries regarding the nervous system and
its plastic changes. The subject involved is quite important regarding such
areas as spinal cord injury, neuromuscular disorders, and neuropsychological
disorders.
