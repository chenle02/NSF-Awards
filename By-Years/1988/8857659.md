The central theme of this research is understanding and predicting the
properties of materials from chemical structure. Methods are being developed for
exploring the microscopic mechanisms underlying macroscopic behavior, and for
establishing quantitative links between structure and properties, through
detailed modeling and simulation of materials at the molecular level. The
availability of powerful and cost effective computational facilities is crucial
to the success of these efforts. Among the projects are: (1) atomistic
simulation of the structure and properties of polymer surfaces and polymer/solid
interfaces; (2) exploration of the interfacial thermodynamics of polymer and
copolymer melts via lattice-based and continuum mean-field approaches; (3)
prediction of sorption equilibria and diffusion coefficients of hydrocarbon
molecules in zeolites; (4) microscopic investigation of sorption and transport
of small molecular-weight penetrants in polymer glasses; (5) prediction of the
mechanical properties of glassy polymers. This research is being conducted under
a Presidential Young Investigator Award.
