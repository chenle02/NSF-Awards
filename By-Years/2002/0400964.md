Professor Kimberly Schrum of Whittier College is supported by the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry Program with a RUI grant focused on electroosmotic flow (EOF).
The goals are to improve the understanding of EOF in fused silica capillaries,
evaluate and characterize new coating materials, and study the relationship
between surface morphology and EOF for polyelectrolyte multilayers.
Photobleaching zone migration (PBZM) will be used to reach the objectives. An
instrument for PBZM measurements will be improved by developing a 'palette' of
neutral marker dyes for flow measurements. The second phase of the activity will
enable predictions of changes in EOF as solvent/solute changes take place. The
group will also study rapid assessment of coating processes and examine the
relationship between surface morphology and EOF in polyelectrolyte multilayer
systems.

The proposed activity represents a fundamental contribution to the fields of
separation science, nanotechnology and materials science and also provides
undergraduate students with a unique interdisciplinary opportunity. EOF is
relied on in many of the emerging miniaturization technologies. In addition, the
results of the activity will be of use to the biomedical research community.
