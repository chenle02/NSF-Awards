This award will support a seminar, "Reproduction and Early Life History in the
Scorpaenid Genus Sebastes," organized jointly by Prof. George W. Boehlert of the
University of Hawaii and Prof. Juro Yamada of Hokkaido University, Japan.
Participants will meet in Honolulu, Hawaii June 26-30, 1989 to summarize current
knowledge and to exchange recent research results concerning this fish genus.
The genus Sebastes, which includes rockfish, occurs worldwide in temperate and
subarctic seas and has supported important fishery resources in the U.S., Japan,
and other countries. However, these fishery resources are in decline, and
studies of the dynamics of reproduction, embryogenesis, and larval growth have
been undertaken in both the U.S. and Japan in an effort to determine causes for
this decline. Recent results on these studies will be discussed at this seminar.
Further, differences in various aspects of reproduction between North American
and Japanese Sebastes can give researchers an opportunity for expanding their
knowledge, and this seminar will also enable workers in this field to take
advantage of this opportunity.
