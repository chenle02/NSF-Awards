Halbert White SBR-9511253 The P.I. proposes to use the bootstrap to determine
the sampling distribution of model specification error tests. The bootstrap has
been increasing rapidly in statistics and specification tests, where critical
values based on asymptotic distributions appear to often lead to over-rejection
of correct specifications, are a natural place to apply this powerful method.
Examples of tests that will be studied are: information matrix tests, tests
based on nonparametric estimators and neural net estimators, and test of whether
a particular subset of variables belong in a regression. The P.I. also proposes
to develop high breakdown estimators that are insensitive to significant amounts
of data contamination. The P.I. also intends to apply the methods developed to a
number of empirical applications.
