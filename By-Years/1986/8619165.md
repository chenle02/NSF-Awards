Most computer-aided design systems define surfaces as doubly infinite families
of points. Using point geometry allows only two geometric constructs: curves and
surfaces. Using lines as the basic building block of space is more flexible for
shape generation and design since line geometry allows the definition of three
types of geometric constructions. This research focuses on the development of
the mathematical foundation for computer-aided design of products based online
geometry. The fundamental idea is to use lines, rather thanpoints, as the
fundamental building block of geometric shapes. The three geometric constructs
defined in a line geometry are ruled surfaces, line congruences, and line
complexes which are one, two, and three parameter families of lines
respectively. This research will study the computational geometry of these three
geometric constructs and,in addition, develop a general framework for computer-
aided design based on line geometry.
