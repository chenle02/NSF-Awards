9633500 Herrero-Bervera This grant provides $60,000 as one-half support of the
costs of acquiring a 2-G superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) equipped with
DC SQUIDS for the paleomagnetics laboratory at the University of Hawaii. The
acquisition of a state-of-the-art SRM at the University of Hawaii will provide
for high sensitivity measurements of the relative paleointensity recorded in
weakly magnetized marine sediments for research on the behavior of the Earth's
geomagnetic field. Furthermore, its reduced operating costs relative to
continued operation of their antiquated ScT SRM, due to the high boil off rate
of liquid nitrogen and helium associated with its operation, will be
economically beneficial in the long run for the health of the paleomagnetic
research program at Hawaii. This acquisition provides a valuable institutional
and regional resource for paleomagnetic studies which will include studies of
geomagnetic field behavior, marine and lacustrine magnetostratigraphy and
polarity transitions observed in igneous rocks. ***
