A codimension-one foliation F in a hyperbolic 3-manifold lifts to a foliation
F' in the universal cover, which is hyperbolic 3- space. The investigator will
study the asymptotic behavior of leaves of F' and how fast they approach their
limit sets. He will also analyze to what extent the topological structure of F
determines the geometry of the manifold. Finally, a non-singular flow is Anosov
if it induces hyperbolic behavior transversally to the flow direction, so that
in dimension 3 it determines two transverse codimension-one foliations. The
investigator plans to examine the structure of the induced foliations in the
universal cover. This is strongly related to homotopic properties of closed
orbits of the flow. He also plans to study metric properties of flow lines, for
example, whether all flow lines can be quasigeodesic. A foliation of a manifold
is a way of filling the manifold with lower dimensional pieces. In the case of a
codimension-one foliation, these pieces are of dimension one less than that of
the given manifold. Think of an onion or an artichoke. The topology of a
manifold is strongly related to the kind of foliation which it will support, and
in skillful hands this relation has been forged into a powerful tool for
investigating the topology of manifolds. Foliations are also intimately related
to the types of flows possible on a manifold. Particularly in low dimensions,
where the standard algebraic techniques of topology work less well, using
foliations to investigate manifolds and the possible flows on them is a very
welcome addition to the arsenal.
