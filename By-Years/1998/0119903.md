0119903&lt;br/&gt;Parlange&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is
to focus on the measurement of the emission and transport of biological aerosols
(focusing on pollens) in the atmosphere. Several instruments that cover the size
range of microns for the particles themselves to particulate dispersal over many
kilometers will be developed. The behavior of individual pollen particles and
the emission of pollen from the plant will be observed and modeled. At the
larger scales, particulate dispersal will be studied in a wind tunnel and in
field studies, and the experimental results will be used to refine large eddy
simulation models. The field studies will be carried out at four sites in the
Chesapeake Bay region. Pollen transport is of interest because of species cross-
fertilization and genetic diversity concerns that have arisen due to human
disruption of the natural landscape, as well as concerns about transport
distances of genetically altered pollens. &lt;br/&gt;
