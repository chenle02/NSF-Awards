The National Research Council (NRC), through its Commission on Engineering and
Technical Systems and its Board on Telecommunications and Computer Applications
(BOTCAP), will provide core supporting services to the National Science
Foundations (NSF). These services will address issues in telecommunications and
information technologies that are relevant to the policies and programs of the
NSF. The initiating activity of the assessment will be a review of the existing
and planned NSF programs. A panel will be convened to assess both technical and
technical management aspects for the purpose of suggesting any program changes
that it believes are appropriate. A letter report to NSF will result from this
meeting.
