This project continues the study on particle transformation in mesopelagic
slope waters off Monterey Bay where particles (marine snow) from the surface
waters of the epipelagic zone undergo rapid regeneration. New instrumentation,
developed by project engineers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute
(MBARI), and a Remote Operating Vehicle (ROV) will be used to recognize and
separate slow sinking class of marine snow from more colonized, reactive and
rapidly sinking class for community analyses. Dr. Silver and colleagues will
examine the role of biological processes that lead to carbon remineralization of
marine snow, and other losses that appeared closely linked to events that have
been difficult to study by more traditional approaches.
