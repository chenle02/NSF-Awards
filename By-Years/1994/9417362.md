9417362 Moreno The Mathematics (and Computer Science) Department of the
University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras has an excellent record of research
accomplishments in the areas of computational and computer science, while the
ECE Department at Mayaguez has been producing highly qualified students in the
areas of computer engineering. It is expected that the collaboration of these
two departments through faculty and student encounters will provide a research
environment to substantially increase the number and quality of students. The
major goal of this project is thus develop the research environment needed to
start a Ph.D. program in Computer Science and to increase minority participation
in graduate school and research. To maintain an excellent research environment
and to accomplish the CISE II-MI program's goal of increasing minority
participation the following activities are planned. * to create a proposal,
during the first two years, to establish a Ph.D. program in collaboration with
the Mathematics and ECE Departments of the Mayaguez Campus; * establish a plan
to retain and increase minority participation; conduct research and establish a
productivity plan for researchers; * establish a plan for faculty development; *
acquire new research equipment; and * establish and strengthen a Computer
Science program. ***
