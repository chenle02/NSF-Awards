In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry
Division, R.S. Berry will study Penning detachment, a process in which a free,
gaseous negative ion releases an electron as a result of a collision with an
electronically excited neutral atom or molecule. The project is a collaboration
of two institutions, The University of Chicago and the Heyrovsky Institute for
Physical Chemistry in the Czech Republic. The Chicago experiments will be done
with laser excitation of neutrals, while the Prague experiments will use
electron impact excitation and subsequent electron energy analysis. Initially
atomic ion and neutral collisions will establish the proof of principal. Later
experiments will move to simple molecules as donors and targets. %%% The Penning
detachment process, which is analogous to Penning ionization, is little studied
but represents a new type of interaction between gas phase species which may
play an important role in chemical vapor deposition or other plasma processes,
such as take place in the upper atmosphere. As such, it has wide-ranging
implications, from possibly improved manufacturing processes to a better
understanding of ionospheric phenomena.
