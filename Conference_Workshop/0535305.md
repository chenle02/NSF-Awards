Abstract

Award: DMS-0535305 Principal Investigator: Elisabeth Werner

This award supports travel of US participants to a "Workshop on Asymptotic
Analysis and Applications" in July 2006 at the Institut Henri Poincare in Paris,
France. The workshop is a component of the special trimester research program
there on "Phenomena in Large Dimensions" and concerns properties of families of
finite-dimensional objects as the dimension grows without bound. Particular
topics that fit this agenda are measure transport techniques, concentration of
measure, quantitative measures of convex bodies, isoperimetric inequalities, and
large deviation inequalities. Some of the important features emerging in these
studies are threshold or phase transition effects, similar to those seen in
statistical physics or asymptotic combinatorics, and this work also seems to
have connections to problems in computational complexity.

A mathematical description of a scientific or engineering question often
requires lots of independent numbers, leading to a geometric space of high
dimension. For example, if you want to specify the location of one gas molecule
in a room then you need to report the front/back, side-to-side, and up/down
locations of the molecule, using three numbers. The direction and speed of the
molecule's motion takes another three numbers, and so to describe enough of the
molecule's current state to allow us to predict its future motion from position
and velocity we would need six separate numbers in all. If you want to track 100
distinct molecules of the air in the room then you will need 600 independent
numerical coordinates to collect all of the relevant measurements. As these
dimensions increase then the difficulty of sampling and computation go up
rapidly, a phenomenon scientists and mathematicians sometimes call "the curse of
dimensionality." However, there are also patterns that emerge as dimension
increases, and this grant for support of US travel to the international workshop
described above will study some of these patterns that are recent discoveries.
