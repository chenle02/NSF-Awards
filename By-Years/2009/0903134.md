This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently there has been a lot of
progress studying string theory using a web of duality symmetries relating non-
perturbative effects to perturbative ones. This project involves studies in
string theory with emphasis on the supergravity limit of the theory. Some of the
goals of the research include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) The classification of
supersymmetric (SUSY) solutions in various dimensions. Here the approach is the
classification of SUSY solutions using Killing symmetries, represented as
bispinors.&lt;br/&gt;2) The study of the Anti-de Sitter / Conformal Field Theory
(AdS/CFT)correspondence, specifically incorporating higher derivative
corrections into the classical solutions on the Supergravity side of the
correspondence to see their implications for Conformal Field
Theory.&lt;br/&gt;3) Development of the non-perturbative theory underlying
string theory&lt;br/&gt;4) Phenomenological implications of string theory,
specifically in cosmology using cosmological solutions to Supergravity.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the broader implications follow from the PI being
the director of the Center for Advanced Mathematical Sciences (CAMS) at the
American University in Beirut (AUB). This center has a significant potential for
impact on science in Lebanon and in the region. This connection has the
potential for "broad impact" in a much more substantial sense than is customary
for an individual investigator grant. The Center has a significant impact on the
training of students, hosting various scientific workshops, summer schools and
international conferences.
