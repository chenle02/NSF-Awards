Rice University has a dynamic geometry group, with senior faculty in low-
dimensional topology; quasi-crystals, spectral theory, and mathematical physics;
geometric measure theory; algebraic and complex geometry; and Teichmueller
theory and minimal surfaces. This project will support a Research Training Group
led by these faculty, involving undergraduate students, graduate students, and
postdoctoral fellows. Our main objective is to increase the number of students
and postdocs pursuing independent research in geometry, as well as related areas
of topology and analysis.

Geometric problems stimulate progress across almost every subfield of
mathematics. The study of conic sections initiated by the ancient Greeks spurred
the development of coordinate systems and polynomial algebra in the 17th
century, leading to the modern field of algebraic geometry. The desire to find
curves and surfaces minimizing the energy of physical systems motivated the
development of calculus. More recently, geometric questions about knots and
links have led to numerous advances in modern algebra. Thus geometric examples
offer common ground where specialists in different areas can exchange ideas and
techniques. The Geometry Group at Rice builds on this common ground to train
students and postdoctoral fellows in the methods of mathematical research.
