Professor Hinds will continue his studies on time reversal invariance by using
a molecular beam of thallium fluoride (TIF) and observing the nuclear spin
resonance of this molecule. He will also study the unusual physics of atoms
confined to micron- sized cavities. Among the experiments planned is the first
precise measurement of the Casimir force between an atom and a cavity.
