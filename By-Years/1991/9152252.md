The Chemical Engineering Department is expanding its curriculum so that it
exposes students to practical and theoretical applications in the area of Waste
Management by developing a Waste Management Technologies Laboratory. Students
apply principles discussed in current technical electives in the area of waste
technologies through the hands on operation of a bioremediation system, a
particulate characterization and removal system and an incineration system. A
workstation is used for sophisticated modeling, simulation and graphics ability.
Experiments and examples illustrating principles of these emerging technologies
are also incorporated into existing core courses.
