A series of experiments involving the most basic three-body ion-atom collision
systems is underway. A proton-photon coincidence experiment involving an atomic
hydrogen target will be completed to extend the study of basic three-body ion
atom collision systems to the measurement of differential cross sections for
excitation, elastic scattering, charge transfer, and ionization of an atomic
hydrogen by alpha particles. This set of experiments will culminate in alpha
particle-photon coincidence experiment involving an atomic hydrogen target. Data
obtained from the coincidence experiments will provide detailed information on
the magnitude and relative phase of the scattering amplitude as a function of
the projectile scattering angle and energy. The proposed experiments use the
capabilities of the unique facility located at the University of Missouri-Rolla.
They will provide the most detailed information possible on these fundamental
systems.
