The Louisiana State University Marine Consortium (LUMCON) proposes to supply
technician support for NSF-funded research projects on the R/V Pelican, a 105
foot vessel that is owned by the University. Operation will be primarily in the
Gulf of Mexico. Marine technicians are responsible for the operation of all
shipboard instrumentation and data acquisition equipment during research
cruises. They are also responsible for the maintenance of shipboard
instrumentation and data systems. Funding for each year of this proposal will be
negotiated separately and will depend on ship schedules.
