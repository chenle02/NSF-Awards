EIA-0219310&lt;br/&gt;Peter McCartney&lt;br/&gt;Arizona State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Networking Urban Ecological Models
Through Distributed Services&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Urbanization is a central
force in altering core ecological processes such as biogeochemical cycling,
decreased biodivesity and changing land use and land cover. Understanding and
managing these processes is crucial to sustaining natural resources and
maintaining quality of life. The goal for this project is to develop and deploy
a distributed information infrastructure so that diverse members of the urban
ecological research community in central Arizona can benefit from integrated
ecological models and data. Government agencies involved will include the
Maricopa Association of Governments and the Arizona Dept. of Water
Resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
