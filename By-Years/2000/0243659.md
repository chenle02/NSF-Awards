Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CHE-0243659 Date:
1-15-2003&lt;br/&gt;PI: Broadbelt Institution: U of Texas
Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site at the University of Texas,
Austin will expose students to environmental science. Twelve faculty from four
departments (chemistry, geological sciences, integrative biology, pharmacy) will
be the research mentors. All faculty are members of the Environmental Science
Institute. The research projects will develop expertise in a traditional area of
science while uniting with other disciplines to attack complex problems. Eight
to nine students will be involved in 10 weeks of research and associated
activities. The recruiting emphasis will focus on students from undergraduate
institutions mainly from Texas that have a high proportion of students from
historically underrepresented backgrounds,. A secondary theme of the site is
"science communication". Students will interact with a technical writer. They
will prepare articles for a "discovery" type magazine and a poster for a poster
session at the end of the summer. The students will also engage in three "field
study" scientific excursions to introduce them to non-laboratory based
scientific endeavors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
