The primary concern of Random Matrix Theory is the distributions and asymptotic
distributions of eigenvalues of different kinds of random matrices. Random
matrices are a very active area of research by scientists of various
disciplines, including mathematicians, statisticians, and physicists. In this
proposal, several open problems on Toeplitz, Hankel and Markov matrices will be
studied. In addition to advancing mathematical knowledge on the subject, Random
Matrix Theory has natural applications in Quantum Physics and Statistics, and
recently, new applications in the financial market have also been found.
Integrated with the research in this project are educational activities. They
include development of new courses to help students understand theories with
aids of computer software, building an international co-operation on teaching
and research, and outreach activities to K-12 students to help increase their
appreciation of mathematics from an early age.

The research and educational activities of this project will help find
connections among different disciplines of the science, including, among others,
mathematics, physics and statistics. Some new theories may be possibly created.
Undergraduate and graduate students learn theories with easier efforts through
proposed plan of education. Some K-12 students and their teachers will get
better understanding of mathematics and science. International academic
exchanges will be established.
