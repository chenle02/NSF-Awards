Most vertebrate brains suffer irreversible damage when deprived of oxygen for
more than a few minutes. As a result little is known of brain anaerobic and
hypoxic processes. Some reptilian brains are unique in their ability to survive
under totally anaerobic conditions for many hours. Previous studies in Dr.
Lutz's laboratory have shown that the anaerobic brain greatly reduces its energy
expenditure to match a corresponding reduction in energy availability. The
mechanisms by which this down regulation in brain energy requirements are
achieved is of considerable interest and will be investigated in the present
study. Dr. Lutz's hypothesis is that adenosine release plays a key role in
mediating the crucial transition between the normal aerobic state and the
metabolically depressed anoxic state. These studies are proposed to test this
hypothesis which will include investigating the
physiological/electrophysiological effects of the pharmacological manipulation
of adenosine receptors. The knowledge gained will provide insights not only into
an extraordinary neuronal adaptation to but also into the processes underlying
the harmful changes that occur during oxygen lack in vertebrate brain in
general, including that of the mammal, particularly those associated with anoxic
damage.***//
