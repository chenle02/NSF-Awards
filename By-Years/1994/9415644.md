9415644 Clarke This project consists of an analysis of hydrographic data and
winds to study the long-term variability and dynamics of eastern boundary
oceanic regions using a linear model. The study focuses on three major
components: (1) an estimation of dynamic height along the eastern boundary of
the Atlantic back to the early part of this century and relate the resulting
variability to heating/global warming and changes in the strength of the
equatorial and coastal winds; (2) use the linear model to analyze the coastal
ENSO flow; and, (3) using the same linear model, develop an understanding of the
intraseasonal flows when bottom friction and slope bottom topography are taken
into account. ***
