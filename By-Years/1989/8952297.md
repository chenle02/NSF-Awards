This award provide funds to develop a hypermedia based learning environment for
a course in the economics of industry in the Department of Economics at Miami
University. Hypermedia/hypertext materials will be developed for use by junior
and senior undergraduate students that supplement the standard textbook and
lecture materials. The hypertext materials will derive from general and
professional literature on the issues not normally accessible to students.
Students explore the hypermedia materials at a computerized workstation within
an integrated software environment. Explorations by students arise from both
assigned analyses and student motivated review of topics. The integrated
software environment allows the student to undertake assignments from start to
finish, at the workstation. The computer equipment consists of one network
server, ten student workstations, and two network printers. The network server
functions as the repository for the hypermedia data and software. A student
workstation provides the access to the hypermedia material while two network
printers are for output of students assignments. The project provides a
framework for accessing and analyzing large amounts of diverse information in
hypermedia format by the students. The hypermedia environment will be able to
change and grow as understanding of the topic material improves. The university
will provide 50% matching funds from non-Federal sources.
