This project is an analysis of trace gases in the arctic atmosphere with the
goal of defining the sources of the anthropogenic components in atmospheric
pollution episodes that have become known as Arctic Haze, and to determine the
nature and sources of precursors of arctic haze. Air samples, taken from a NOAA
WP-3 aircraft operating over the Arctic Ocean in the Spring of 1989, will be
analyzed for the concentrations of about 30 trace gases. These will include
chlorofluorocarbons, bromine- containing gases, light hydrocarbons, nitrous
oxide, and carbon monoxide and dioxide. When supplemented with meteorological
measurements and supporting data obtained in the major field experiment of which
this project is a part, source regions and tajectories can be identified, and
when compared to similar observations on previous field experiments, it will be
possible to assess the interannual variability in the anthropogenic sources that
influence the atmospheric chemistry of the high arctic.
