An In situ investigation of the relationship between sediment trap collection
efficiency and trap hydrodynamics will be conducted for sediment trap designs,
cone shaped and cylindrical, which are integral to the Global Ocean Flux
initiative in the Atlantic Ocean. The studies will include a careful assessment
of moored versus drifting sediment trap collection systems at the Bermuda site
where long term observations are in progress. The independent variable in this
investigation is sediment trap geometry, while the dependent variables are trap
hydrodynamics and collection efficiency. In situ hydrodynamic observations will
be obtained using laboratory-calibrated self-contained instrument packages (HDS)
which record both flow and well shearing stress in a non-obstrusive way at
critical locations inside and outside the traps. One of the principal products
of the work will be a simple, easy-to-use, flow-field sensor package which can
be applied to Global Ocean Flux investigations. By linking particle accumulation
rates with In situ hydrodynamic observations in and around sediment traps, it is
expected that fluid-dynamic bias can be removed and flux rates inferred which
are functionally equivalent to those provided by an ideal, non- obtrusive
collection device.
