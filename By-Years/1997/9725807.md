9725807 Molnar Normal faulting and horizontal crustal extension, not just
erosion, ultimately destroy most major mountain belts. Because most such belts
have been built by crustal shortening and thickening, some change in the
regional geodynamics must occur to cause such a change from horizontal
compression to extension. One possibility is that the lower part of the mantle
lithosphere, thickened during the phase of compression, becomes unstable and
sinks into the mantle beneath the range. When this happens, the range rises,
giving it potential energy to drive normal faulting. To test such an idea
requires that paleo-altitudes are measured before and after the normal faulting
begins. The P.I.s plan to make such measurements using fossil leaf morphology,
which has been calibrated to modern climates (and hence altitudes) with an
extensive collection of such leaf morphology from modern forests. The Pacific
Northwest is an ideal locality for such analysis because the region underwent
crustal shortening in Mesozoic time and crustal extension in Cenozoic time and
because there are numerous fossil leaf localities, both near sea level and
inland where a high mountain belt once lay. ***
