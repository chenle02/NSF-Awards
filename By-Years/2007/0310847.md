Byrd&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiprocessor Performance
Optimization using Slipstream Execution
Mode&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slipstream execution
mode for multiprocessors involves running redundant copies of a parallel task on
each processor in a dual-core chip multiprocessor (CMP). One copy of the task is
shortened by removing synchronization events and stores to shared memory. This
speeds up the execution of the other task through prefetching and other
coherence optimizations enabled by a future view of shared memory
references.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first objective of this project is to
implement slipstream execution mode on actual CMP-based hardware. Given a
multiprocessor built from dual-core CMP's, each with shared L2 cache, slipstream
mode can be implemented with no changes to hardware. This implementation will
validate the utility and scalability of sliptream-mode prefetching on full-sized
applications. The second objective is to automate and optimize the mechanism for
local synchronization between the redundant tasks, known as A-R synchronization.
The choice of mode, ranging from tightly coupled to loosely coupled, can
significantly affect the performance of an application. The project will develop
run-time and compile-time mechanisms to select the best A-R synchronization mode
for an application or region of execution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slipstream
execution mode is a new alternative for shared-memory parallel computation. As
more systems are built from CMPs and multithreaded processors, it is imperative
that we investigate efficient ways to exploit parallelism at all levels.
Slipstream mode offers a performance boost for applications that cannot
otherwise take advantage of additional thread-level parallelism. This work will
impact important scientific applications, such as quantum mechanics and
computational biology that use shared-memory multiprocessing to address large-
scale problems.&lt;br/&gt;
