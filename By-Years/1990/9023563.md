The condition of the housing stock long has been one of the most important
indices of material well-being within communities. Geographers and other social
scientists have devoted considerable attention to analyses of the state of
housing in the United States in the 20th century, especially in the period since
World War II. Much of the nation's housing was built prior to this century,
however, and investigations of the quality of this older housing should examine
not only its current status but also the form and character of that housing
during earlier historic periods. This project consists of a detailed empirical
investigation of the condition of American housing in the years immediately
around 1800. Data from the 1798 federal tax on dwellings will be related to data
from the 1800 population census to provide an overview at the township level of
the number, nature, and quality of housing units in those early days of the
nation. Analyses of these data will test hypotheses about the impacts of the
frontier, traditional regional structures, climate, and proximity to major
roads, rivers, and urban centers on the housing stock. Special emphasis at a
larger scale will be given to housing in wards and townships of the Philadelphia
area in order to determine the role of intrametropolitan location on the
geography of early 19th century housing values. This project will link two
valuable historical databases using a geographic information system, thereby
greatly enhancing their utility for further inquiries by this investigative team
and by other scholars. Analyses of these data will significantly enhance
statistically based understandings of relationships between many external
factors and the quality of housing in the early years of the nation, and it will
shed light on the historic causes of substandard housing within the U.S. The
employment of undergraduate students as members of the research team to assist
in data entry and analysis will provide valuable experience for promising
undergraduates.
