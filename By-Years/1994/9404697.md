9404697 Tobisch Very large granitic bodies are a common feature in the
development of magmatic arcs and convergent continental margins, however despite
considerable study the mechanisms of ascent, assembly and emplacement of
granitic magma within mid-to-upper crustal levels are still controversial. This
project will test a possible solution involving whether elongate, large-volume
Early- Late Cretaceous plutons typical of the Sierra Nevada, California,
represent dike-fed magma chambers rather than diapirs. the work will involve
establishing the geometry and kinematics of magma flow in the pluton and model
the assembly and emplacement, while constraining the ascent mechanism from the
flow dynamic and observed wall rock structures the main tools will be anisotropy
of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) image analysis of magmatic fabrics and field
observation. Results are expected to provide sufficient documentation to help
resolve the magma room problem and help develop a tectonic model of the Sierra
Nevada that more accurately treats the magmatic activity.
