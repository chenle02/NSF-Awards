This project will provide partial travel support to enable young U.S.
scientists to attend the forthcoming Congress of the International Association
of Mathematical Physics in Swansea, Great Britain in July of 1988. It is
anticipated that partial support for fifteen young investigators will be
provided under this project. The research sessions at the Congress will include
general relativity, probabilistic methods and stochastic mechanics, the
mathematics of string theory, conformally invariant field theories, classical
mechanics, classical field theory, operator algebras, mathematical problems in
condensed matter physics, dynamical systems and chaos, the general theory of
quantum mechanics, and other topics in mathematical physics. The travel grant
will be administered through the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences
located at New York University
