The Partnership consisting of nine Silicon Valley school districts and San Jose
State University's (SJSU) Colleges of Engineering and Education is taking a
regional approach to improving science education by building institutional
capacity, instructional quality, and student achievement in a major urban
region. Sustainable institutional changes are created to support high quality
science education. Science teaching and learning, grades K-8, is improved
through a continuum of university preservice preparation, new teacher induction,
on-going inservice and leadership development for over 1300 preservice students
and inservice teachers. Establishing a career spanning professional development
model, which includes rich content and methodology workshops, provided by
regional leaders for professional development, retains a pool of well-prepared
K-8 science teachers. Elementary and middle school students experience exemplary
inquiry and laboratory-based lessons linked appropriately to math, literacy, and
technology resulting in higher achievement. Engineering faculty devote time as
consultants in middle schools. While they contribute scholarship and content
background they also learn by viewing the variety of teaching strategies that
serve diverse student needs. Undergraduate engineering education is improved
through close collaboration between engineers and teachers. Preservice
instruction at San Jose State University is improved with the development of a
new MA degree in Elementary Education with a focus on science, which should be
readily transportable.
