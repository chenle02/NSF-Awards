The principal objective of this project is to define regional variations of
upper mantle composition in the Atlantic and explain them in terms of P-T
conditions of equilibration, partial melting and initial heterogeneity. The
research program involves both whole rock analyses using emission plasma
spectrometry, XRF, and neutron activation as well as mineral analyses using
electron and ion probe analyses for major and trace elements. The analytical
work on peridotite samples recently acquired from the north Atlantic will refine
correlations of geoid height and crustal depth with North Atlantic peridotite
chemistry. %%% Understanding of upper mantle geochemical variations is
fundamental to a complete understanding of petrogenesis of the midocean ridge
basalts which are derived from the peridotites. The PI is recognized as a leader
in the study of oceanic peridotite geochemistry, and this project will be a
valuable contribution to our understanding of the chemical variation in the
source rocks from which oceanic crust is derived.
