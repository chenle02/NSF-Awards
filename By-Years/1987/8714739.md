Reconstruction of three-dimensional flow fields from multidirectional
holographic interferograms has potential as a powerful diagnostic tool in the
thermal sciences. The main objective of this research is to develop efficient
computational reconstruction methods which incorporate the features that are
specific to interferometric data. The methods employ a nonuniform grid or
higher-order local basis functions. They will allow accurate reconstruction even
under ill-posed conditions and undersampling. The proposed research will
eventually lead to the design of a prototype system and commercialization. This
system will enable fast laboratory or on-site non-invasive diagnostics of
finite-size flow fields.
