9408071 Wakeley This award supports a 12-month Japan Society for the Promotion
of Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. John Wakeley, Department of
Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, at the Department of
Population Genetics, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan. Dr. Wakeley
will work with Dr. Fumio Tajima on a research project entitled "Models of
Nucleotide Substitution and the Demographic History of Natural Populations." Dr.
Wakeley will pursue two main areas of research in Japan. The first involves
inferences about the pattern of DNA sequence evolution. The investigators will
develop a computer-based method of quantifying variation in the rate of
nucleotide substitution among sites in DNA sequences. The method involves the
random placement of hypothetical nucleotide substitutions on a genealogy
relating the sequences. The second area involves developing statistical
approaches to making inferences about the demographic history of populations.
Having recently derived the variance of the average number of nucleotide
differences among pairs of sequences in a sample from two populations that
exchange migrants, and comparing this variance to previously published results
for two populations that have been completely isolated from each other for some
length of time, Dr. Wakeley found that the variance is greater under migration
than under isolation. Thus, he plans to develop a test to distinguish these two
biologically interesting cases. ***
