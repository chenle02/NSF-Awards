Light scattering experiments are planned for supercooled water and aqueous
solutions to elucidate the structural mechanisms responsible for thermodynamic
anomalies in supercooled water. Raman data obtained from this work will have
direct structural information for supercooled water. The OH stretch modes will
yield nearest neighbor information including hydrogen bond probability, and mean
O-O separation and distribution. The low frequency intermolecular modes will
yield information regarding the second neighbor shell wherein the most dramatic
structural changes relevant to the supercooled anomalies are thought to occur.
The photon correlation spectroscopy measurements will be used to extract
effective density correlation lengths due to cooperative behavior between many
water molecules. Water's importance on the face of the earth cannot be
overstated. This importance stems from two sources: its abundance, and its
unique physical and chemical properties. In the past decade it has been found
that liquid water is even more unusual in the supercooled regime below zero
degrees Centigrade. Here it displays anomalies in its thermodynamic and
transport properties which may be approaching a singularity. The key to water is
in its hydrogen bonded structure. Raman spectroscopy can give microscopic
information regarding structure and dynamics. It can determine the extent of
hydrogen bonding, make decisions regarding ice-like or clathrate structures, and
give information on both the first neighbor shell and molecular clustering.
