9414269 Thompson Abstract A Practice-Oriented Computational Simulation Masters
Degree Program in Design and Manufacturing Working with its industrial partners,
particularly the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, Silicon Graphics Computer
Systems, and IBM, the Engineering Research Center (ERC) for Computational Field
Simulation at the Mississippi State University proposes to establish a Practice-
Oriented MS Degree Program for Computational Simulation in Design and
Manufacturing designed to incorporated director industrial input and
applications into the graduate program. With the Industrial Advisory Board
serving as the overseer, the program targets graduate students in engineering
and computer science departments, with participation from mathematics. Using
state-of-the-art computer facilities, it emphasizes cross-disciplinary
development of computer simulation skills and requires summer residency by the
students hosted by industrial partners. It also interacts with regional
institutions to recruit women and underrepresented minorities into the program.
