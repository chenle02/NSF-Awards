Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award, joint-funded by
the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program and the Biological Instrumentation
Program, will help the Chemistry Department of the University of Minnesota to
acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. The areas of research that will be
enhanced by the acquisition include: 1) Study of bonding and reaction mechanisms
in Organic chemistry 2) Complete structural characterization of complex
carbohydrates by the reductive cleavage method 3) Natural product synthesis and
NMR 4) Biosynthesis of natural products 5) Mechanisms of biosynthetic formation
of deoxy sugars 6) Structure and mechanism of non-heme iron containing proteins
using NMR spectroscopy.
