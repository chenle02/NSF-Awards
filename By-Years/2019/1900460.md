The goal of this project is developing new theoretical tools for understanding
the power and limits of efficient computation. Underlying every computer
application, (and indeed computer industry, from networks to security to
optimization to storage and so on) available today are ingenious algorithms that
utilize the various important resources (time, space, communication) in an
efficient manner. However, for not-yet-existing applications (or industries), is
their unavailability due to the lack of efficient algorithms that may yet be
discovered, or are the underlying problems really intractable, and thus
impossible to solve efficiently? This project seeks both new efficient
algorithms, as well as new methods for proving intractability. The ideas to be
explored by the project use tools and connections to problems from several areas
in mathematics, physics and information theory, and promise progress on some of
the deepest problems in computational complexity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the
algorithmic side, the project will focus on a wide variety of optimization
problems in which the search space has some symmetry. The project will explore
algebraic and geometric techniques to analyze both alternating-minimization and
geodesic algorithms to solve new problems for which efficient solutions do not
yet exist: these include classes of non-convex problems and exponentially large
linear programs. On the intractability side, this research will focus on
extending a new method of "lifting" hardness results for complex computational
models, such as Boolean circuits, proof systems, communication networks and
semi-definite programming, from hardness results for much simpler models such as
decision trees and polynomials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
