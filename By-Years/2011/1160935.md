This award supports graduate student travel to the 13th Workshop on the Physics
of Dusty Plasmas to be held at Baylor University, Waco, Texas, in May 2012. The
objectives of this workshop are to review recent developments, to define
outstanding issues and challenges, and to foster collaborations among the
relevant disciplines. The interaction between dust and plasmas in laboratory,
industrial, atmospheric, solar system, and astrophysical settings have yielded a
new and rich phenomenology with potential applications.
