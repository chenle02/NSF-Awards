This research uses three-dimensional numerical simulations of plasma
instabilities in the polar cap to investigate mesoscale irregularities
associated with patches of plasma that exist there. The first goal is to develop
a parameterization of the spectra of mesoscale structuring as a function of
drift velocity, and to using the results to calculate a scintillation index for
ultimate verification by Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver response.
While previous work used the gradient drift as the primary mechanism followed by
secondary and tertiary instabilities, this approach doesn't adequately describe
observed regions of strong shear flow. Thus, a second research goal incorporates
gradient drift and Kelvin- Helmholtz instabilities to model strong shear
conditions. Previous patch modeling involved two types of simulations, large-
scale ionospheric models to explain the larger scale patch features, and
instability simulations to study the irregularities imbedded in and around the
patches. As a third task, this research studies the interface between these two
views by asking what role the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and the collisional
Rayleigh-Taylor instability plays in the formation of large scale (300-400 km)
patch structure. The final task investigates the role of instabilities in
atmospheric heating in the polar cap. The role of simulated irregularities in
both Ohmic and viscous heating is quantified by integration of micro scale
irregularity physics into the mesoscale heat budget. These studies should
synergistically stimulate observations of heating within patches and help
clarify the role of the ionosphere in magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling within
the polar cap.
