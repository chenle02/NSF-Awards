This grant provides travel support for U.S. scientists to attend a workshop on
antarctic airborne geophysical studies convened by the Division of Polar
Programs in Buenos Aires. This international workshop has several purposes. It
will afford an opportunity primarily to present the results of the just
completed three year aerogeophysics project staged from Chile and Argentina, but
also to formulate key questions concerning antarctic geophysical processes,
enumerate other available support facilities, and consider future
internationally cooperative experiments to help gain greater insight into
antarctic marine geophysical processes. The aerogeophysics project was directed
by scientists from Columbia University, with aircraft support provided by the
Naval Research Laboratory. Scientific expertise and local support was provided
by the Instituto Antartico Argentino, the Servicio de Hidrografia Naval
Argentina, The Servicio Nacional de Geologia y Mineria de Chile, and INACH, the
Chilean Antarctic Institute. The workshop will produce a synthesis of ideas that
could form the basis for future multidisciplinary studies on an international
level, and produce significant advances in our conceptual view of tectonic plate
evolution in the Antarctic.
