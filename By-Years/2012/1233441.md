This award provides funding for the development of solution methods for
repetitive stochastic combinatorial optimization problems with parameter
uncertainties that can only be resolved through active learning. The focus will
be on a class of combinatorial stochastic semi-bandit problems (CSSP) where
several instances of a given combinatorial formulation must be solved
sequentially through time, with the objective of minimizing cumulative cost,
when there is initial uncertainty about the instances. From a methodological
point of view, CSSPs introduce new questions to the well-known exploration vs.
exploitation paradigm: in addition to answering the usual non-trivial question
of when to explore/exploit, in CSSP the questions of what to explore/exploit and
how to do so are also non-trivial. Solution techniques will combine elements
from statistical learning and combinatorial optimization under uncertainty. A
significant portion of the project will be devoted to study an interesting new
class of optimization problems that provide answers to some of the fundamental
questions in this research. Complexity of such optimization problems, as well as
its practical solvability, will be addressed and practical solution methods will
be embedded in proposed algorithms for CSSPs. The resulting algorithms, which
will be tested extensively, should integrate the various results to design
efficient and implementable policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the
results of this research will provide an attractive approach to addressing data
and parameter uncertainty in OR practice. The focus on computationally
implementable policies will likely result in practical approaches for a varied
range of applications in areas such as delivery of humanitarian aid, weapon
target assignment, network reliability and online advertisement. The proposed
policies will likely lead to the development of new questions and methods in
both combinatorial optimization and learning theory.&lt;br/&gt;
