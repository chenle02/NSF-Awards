Proposal:

ASSESSING BELOWGROUND CONTROLS ON CARBON STORAGE IN THE ARCTIC COASTAL PLAIN

P.I.:

Jenny Kao-Kniffin

Proposal # 0852036

This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

Jenny Kao-Kniffin has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Polar Science to
study carbon cycling in Arctic soils. She will conduct her research under the
mentorship of Dr. Bockheim and Dr. Handelsman at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison. Dr. Kao-Kniffin?s research will improve our understanding of the role
microorganisms play in the storage and release of soil carbon. The potential
release of large amounts of carbon from thawing Arctic soils to the atmosphere
has tremendous implications for further climate warming. Using innovative
techniques involving 13C chemistry, Dr. Kao-Kniffin will collect data on the
biological controls of carbon cycling that will enhance global climate models.
The fellowship will recruit a capable young scientist to polar research and
further her career development
