Berry 9316806 Photomorphogenesis, the phenomenon of growth and development in
response to light, provides a valuable experimental system to study the control
of gene expression by environmental stimuli. In Amaranth seedlings, light
coordinately regulates the expression of genes encoding the large subunit (LSU)
and small subunit (SSU) of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPCase), a
principle enzyme in photosynthetic carbon fixation. While long-term changes in
RuBPCase gene expression are regulated by light at the level of mRNA
accumulation, very rapid changes in RuBPCase gene expression are induced at two
translational levels. RuBPCase synthesis is rapidly induced at the level of
translation initiation when dark- grown seedlings are transferred to light
(light-shift), and is rapidly blocked at the level of translation elongation
when light- grown seedlings are transferred to darkness. We propose to
investigate the regulation of chloroplast-encoded LSU and nuclear- encoded SSU
at these two translation steps. Regulation of translation initiation will be
investigated in light-grown, dark- grown, and light-shifted seedlings by
analysis of polysome- associated proteins, analysis of proteins that associate
with RuBPCase mRNAs, and by in vivo and in vitro analysis of RNA sequences and
associated factors. Regulation of translation elongation will be studied in
light-grown and dark-shifted seedlings by analysis of ribosome distribution and
sites of ribosome pausing, analysis of the elongation block in homologous
translation runoff extracts, and analysis of polysome-associated proteins. The
investigations proposed will provide new insights into coordinate regulation of
expression of nuclear- and plastid- encoded genes at the translational level.
%%% In plants, light serves as an environmental signal that regulates
development. Investigations into light-regulated responses in plants are
important in determining how factors that control plant development respo nd to
environmental stimuli, such as light. To begin to understand how this occurs, we
will study light-control of plant genes responsible for forming the carbon
dioxide fixation enzyme in Amaranth, a grain plant. Experiments will be
performed to observe how light exposure can control rapid changes in the amounts
of the enzyme in the plant. This appears to happen at the level of messenger
RNA, which is produced from DNA and afterwards is translated into the plant
carbon dioxide fixation protein. Results of this research will provide unique
perspectives about light on the genetic control in photosynthesis. In addition,
our basic research with Amaranth will contribute to the development of the plant
as an important agricultural crop for food production and for industry. ***
