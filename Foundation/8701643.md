Three important properties of universal algebras will be studied: the
amalgamation property, deductiveness, and congruence modular varieties. The
research on the amalgamation property centers on two problems. 1. Determination
if the amalgamation property plus residual smallness implies the congruence
extension property. 2. Characterization of the amalgamation bases of the
variety. The plans for deductiveness are less specific. The general issue is to
attempt to classify those varieties that are deductive. A third avenue to be
pursued is the representation problem for the commutator in congruence modular
varieties. All of these topics concern the foundations of algebra and are likely
to be applied outside of algebra only to the extent that they condition a mode
of thought about algebraic questions.
