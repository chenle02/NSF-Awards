9505813 Fischer The ovule is a fundamental unit of plant reproduction that
generates the female gametophyte, mediates fertilization processes, and support
the development of the embryo. The long term goal of this proposal is to
understand the genetic circuits that control the early development of the ovule
by analyzing two Arabidopsis genes, BELL1 (BEL1) and OVULE MUTATION2 (OVM2),
that were cloned in Dr. Fischer's laboratory. The BEL1 gene product plays a role
in the specification of ovule identity. bel1 mutant ovules are often transformed
into carpel like structures, isolation and sequencing of the BEL1 gene indicates
that it encodes a homeodomain transcription factor. It is thought that the BEL1
gene prevents the carpel developmental program from over-riding ovule
development by negatively regulating expression of the floral homeotic gene,
AGAMOUS(AG). The OVM2 gene product is needed at distinct threshold levels to
control ovule and female gametophyte development, respectively. With no active
OVM2 protein, both ovule and female gametophyte development are dramatically
suppressed, whereas a low level of OVM2 protein results in nonfunctional ovules
that specifically lack a female gametophyte. Isolation and sequencing of the
OVM2 gene indicates that it is related to the floral homeotic gene APETALA2
(AP2). Thus, BEL1 and OVM2 genes are important regulators of ovule and female
gametophyte development, with mutations resultilg in homeotic conversions and
deletions of organs. To understand their mechanism of action, the critical steps
that control early ovule development, and the relationship between ovule and
floral developmental programs, experiments will be carried out to: 1) Determine
the temporal and spatial localization of BEL1 and OVM2 activity, 2) Determine
the genetic relationships between ovule and floral regulatory genes, 3) Carry
out a molecular analysis of BEL1 and OVM2 function, and 4) Carry out a genetic
screen to identify new genes that control megagametogenesis. ***
