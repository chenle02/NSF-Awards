The Department of Mathematics at Polytechnic University of New York will
purchase workstations with the necessary accessories, which will be dedicated to
the support of research in the mathematical sciences. The following projects are
planned: 1. Computations in topology, 2. Numeric solutions for problems in
mathematical physics, 3. Symbolic and numeric computations in Riemannian
geometry, 4. Intersection bodies, 5. Numeric solutions of Yang-Mills-Higgs
fields,
