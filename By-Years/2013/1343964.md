This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish
the feasibility of translating novel visual tests of cognitive dysfunction to
clinical practice. There is a strong need for tests that are both effective
enough and efficient enough to be used as screening/monitoring tools. The
proposed visual tests are designed to meet this need by uniquely combining
advanced techniques from psychometrics &amp; neuroscience. The Phase I plan is
to perform real and simulated case-control studies in order to quantify the
tradeoff between test effectiveness and efficiency. The proposed innovation is
expected to substantially improve test efficiency with no loss or even gain in
effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of
this project is to significantly improve outcomes for individuals with cognitive
dysfunction while reducing healthcare costs. Cognitive dysfunction is a hallmark
of common behavioral disorders, leading to substantial human suffering and
societal costs. The proposed technology platform will enable safe, effective and
efficient testing of cognitive dysfunction. Other applications include cognitive
training for both clinical and healthy populations, such as athletes, drivers,
and baggage screeners. The proposed tests could also help elucidate the causal
links between brain abnormalities, cognitive dysfunction, and behavioral
disruptions.
