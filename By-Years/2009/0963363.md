This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This award supports renovation of laboratory space in Monsanto Hall on the
campus of Saint Louis University. Under the present conditions, the laboratories
have large temperature fluctuations, poor humidity control, excessive dust and
leakage of air and water from windows, and condensation dripping from pipes in
the ceiling. Funding from this award will enable the Department to complete
renovation of aging labs, improve the environmental quality of the space and
accuracy of experimental results, and increase the amount of available research
space by renovating old, laboratories currently used for research. The research
areas that will be directly affected include biochemistry, the synthesis and
application of nanomaterials, the synthesis and characterization of
metallacarborane complexes, the effects of self-organization (such as
oscillations and pattern formation) on the reactive properties of complex
electrochemical systems, studies of rotational diffusion, non-covalent
interactions of aromatic compounds, the use of microchip-based analytical
systems to study various biological systems, molecular biology,
bioelectrocatalysis, and the thermodynamics and structural features of RNA
motifs.

In addition to graduate and undergraduate students, the Chemistry Department
involves high school students from across the St. Louis area in research. The
location of the University within the urban core of St. Louis enables natural
participation from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in science and
technology. The laboratory improvements will allow training of more
undergraduate, graduate, and high school students.
