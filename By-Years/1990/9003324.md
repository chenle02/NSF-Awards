The principal investigators will be working on topics in statistics and
probability. The first investigator, Dr. Bhattacharya, will continue his work on
asymptotic expansions and on large time stability in certain important classes
of nonlinear stochastic systems. Asymptotic expansions is a field central to
statistics, and the investigator will consider refinements of the Gaussian
approximation in central limit theorem motivated by applications, e.g. in
analyzing bootstrap methodology. The second topic lies between dynamical systems
at one end and nonsingular or irreducible Markov processes at the other. The
second investigator, Dr. Chan, will work on problems related to statistical
inference for nonstationary time series with infinite variance. This study is
motivated by economics, finance, and communications engineering.
