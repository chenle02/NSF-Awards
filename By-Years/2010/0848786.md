"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;Professors James D. Batteas of Texas A&amp;M and
Charles M. Drain of Hunter College of CUNY are supported by the Analytical and
Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to systematically design
and synthesize a series of porphyrin and alkyl based molecular assemblies and
orient them on metal surfaces. Molecular connectivity and local environment will
be varied in order to rationally manipulate the electron transport properties of
the molecules. The aim is to develop a global view of interfacial electron
transport between optoelectronic molecules and substrates. The work encompasses
molecular design, synthesis, and characterization by an array of spectroscopic
techniques and theoretical methods. The ultimate goal is to develop a
comprehensive understanding of charge transfer and conductance in these
assemblies in order to facilitate the development of nanoscale electronics.
Students participating in this collaborative project will gain broad education
and training in multidisciplinary research areas critical to the continued
development of molecular electronics. The results of the proposed research will
be incorporated in undergraduate courses, and in demonstrations at K-12 schools.
