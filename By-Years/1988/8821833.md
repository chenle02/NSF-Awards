This award supports an international workshop in computational methods and
function theory to be held in Valparaiso, Chile at the Universidad Tecnica
Federico Santa Maria from March 13 - 18, 1989. The U.S. organizer is Edward Saff
of the University of South Florida and there are two Chilean organizers, S.
Ruscheweyh and L. Salinas from the University in Valparaiso. The participants
consist of 16 from the U.S., 5 from Chile, 14 from South American countries
other than Chile and 7 from Europe. The principals from the U.S., Chile and
Europe are very distinguished in the research area of the workshop, one which is
developing quickly and is important to mathematics and its applications. The
workshop will provide an opportunity for the exchange of ideas and knowledge as
well a chance for researchers in a common field to explore new discoveries and,
important to the goals of the Science in Developing Countries Program, new
common interests and future collaborations. The timing is particularly good for
this conference; there are many new developments to report and the inclusion of
participants from a number of countries will enhance the dissemination of that
information and increase the benefits of the workshop.
