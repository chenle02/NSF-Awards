9602172 Songer The Appeals Court Data Base Project created an extensive data set
to facilitate the empirical analysis of the votes of the judges and the
decisions of the United States Courts of Appeals. Data on a broad range of
variables of theoretical significance to law and social science researchers were
coded. A major goal in the construction of the data base was to provide data
over a sufficiently long period of time to encourage significant longitudinal
studies of the Courts of Appeals. Thus, the data base was designed to code a
random sample of cases for the period 1925 - 1988. The Appeals Court Data Base
Project, as originally conceived, is nearing completion. The present proposal
seeks to fund extension of the appeals court data base to bring it as close to
the present as possible. Such an extension would greatly enhance the utility of
the data base for research and teaching by those who study the judiciary. %%%%
