This award is concerned with a broad range of research in gravitational physics.
The specific research topics that will be investigated include the development
of an axiomatic framework for quantum field theory in curved spacetime, the
investigation of convergence issues in perturbative &lt;br/&gt;quantum field
theory, the development of a gauge independent formulation of the effects of
gravitational radiation reaction on point particles, the investigation of
multiple lensing encounters and other issues in gravitational lensing, the
investigation of fundamental issues related to &lt;br/&gt;inflation and dark
energy, and the analysis of the viability of models with extra dimensions and
theories that involve modifications to Einstein's equation. Although this
research includes a wide range of topics in a number of different areas, there
is a common theme to the main goals of the research: To obtain a deeper
understanding of the mathematical and physical properties of classical general
relativity and of quantum phenomena occurring in strong gravitational
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Progress on the topics relating to quantum field
theory in curved spacetime should have a significant impact on research in
quantum gravity. The development of a gauge independent formulation of
gravitational radiation reaction should signficantly aid the calculation of
effects that &lt;br/&gt;may be observed by LIGO and LISA. Progress on
gravitational lensing, issues related to inflation and dark energy, and models
with extra dimensions should have a significant impact on research in cosmology.
The general areas of research associated with this award are of considerable
&lt;br/&gt;interest to the public. This award will heavily involve the direct
participation of graduate students in all aspects of the research.
