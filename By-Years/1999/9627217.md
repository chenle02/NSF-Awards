9627217 Zahniser This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will
construct and demonstrate an instrument for the detection of nitrogen dioxide
(NO2), one of the most important components of nitrogen oxide species (NOy) in
the troposphere. Direct measurements of NO2 are crucial for understanding the
chemical processes that determine natural levels of tropospheric ozone and for
assessing potential effects of human-influenced emissions. The difficulties
associated with direct measurements of NO2 in the unpolluted troposphere arise
from low (&lt; 100 pptv) concentrations and the potential for interferences from
other more abundant nitrogen compounds. This proposal would demonstrate a direct
spectroscopic method using infrared absorption with a tunable diode laser light
source which would directly detect absolute levels of NO2 in the clean
troposphere. A key component of the proposed research plan is the construction
of a long path length, low volume absorption cell which would have sufficient
length (~500 m) to provide adequate sensitivity and yet have a minimal volume
(&lt; 10 liters) to enable rapid sampling and a minimal instrument response
time. Modulation of the trace species at the cell inlet using a pulsed W laser
will allow real-time background subtraction to further increase the sensitivity.
Automated signal processing using curve fitting to known spectral line
parameters will provide absolute concentration levels without using calibration
gases. The resulting instrument will have an NO2 detection limit of 4 ppt with a
signal averaging time of 100 s. The instrumentation resulting from this program
will be useful for researchers in atmospheric chemistry for measuring
concentrations of other trace gases in addition to NO2. The long path absorption
cell would be marketable separately for incorporation into laser absorption
systems for monitoring industrial pollutants, toxic wastes, and combustion
emissions. ***
