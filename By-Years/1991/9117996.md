It has been suggested that the Pacific margins of the East Antarctic and North
American Precambrian cratons were formerly juxtaposed, and that they drifted
apart to initiate the Pacific Ocean during the fragmentation of a Neoproterozoic
supercontinent. The most critical and immediate testable evidence put forward in
support of this hypothesis is the apparent continuation of the northwestern
boundary of the Grenville orogen of the North American craton, the Grenville
front, into East Antarctica at the head of the Weddell Sea between the
Shackleton Range and Coasts Land, an area seldom visited and never studied in
detail by American geologists. This award supports an initial test of the
hypothesis, a geologic, geochemical, geochronometric, and paleomagnetic study of
the Antarctic rocks in question, in order to compare them with those adjacent to
the Grenville front in the southwestern United States. The work will include
detailed stratigraphic study of the only undisturbed Neoproterozoic sedimentary
sequence in the Antarctic continent.
