ABSTRACT The ultimate aim of the research is to produce a definitive lexicon of
Wiyot, a native American language whose last living speaker died in 1962. During
the two years covered by the present proposal, the project will produce a
comprehensive lexicological index (glossary) to Teeter's The Wiyot Language
(1964) and a concordance to the texts published therein. By the end of the two
year period, a computer database will have been compiled to include all of the
materials in Teeter's corpus. The final stage of the project will add all other
known materials on the language (principally from Gladys A. Reichard and Alfred
L. Kroeber) to the computer database and complete the Wiyot Lexicon.
