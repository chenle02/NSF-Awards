Traditional security authorization decisions are black and white: a user either
satisfies a particular access policy or does not. This rigidity is a handicap in
our complex and unpredictable world. As a result, even security-conscious
organizations typically grossly overprovision principals with access rights
and/or underconstrain access policies to ensure that principals can always carry
out the organization's mission effectively and respond to unexpected
opportunities and challenges. This project focuses on developing dynamic and
risk-aware approaches to access control that allow organizations to make
security-critical decisions in the face of incomplete information and unexpected
circumstances. This is accomplished by combining proof-theoretic access controls
with economic models of risk. In the event that the expected proof of
authorization for an action cannot be generated, the systems developed in this
project carry out an efficient search for similar proofs of authorization that
minimize the overall risk incurred by deviating from the expected. This approach
allows policies to adapt dynamically to the changing context of the systems in
which they are deployed. This research will have several benefits, including
increased system availability during disasters or other uncommon cases not
explicitly modeled by policies; reduced instances of permission creep, as
overprovisioning users is no longer required to ensure that an organization's
business needs are met; a quantifiable means of assessing how policies are
actually used and how they might be changed to better reflect the evolution of
organizations; and the development of metrics for assessing access control
risks.
