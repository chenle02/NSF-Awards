Phylogenetic trees can be estimated from many types of data, including DNA
sequences sampled from the organisms of interest. One way to infer phylogeny is
to use Bayesian statistics, where inferences are based on the probabilities
(posterior probabilities) of phylogenetic trees. Because of the complexity of
the problem, the posterior probability distribution of trees is numerically
approximated, often using Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches. MrBayes is a
widely used program that estimates phylogeny using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte
Carlo approach. This grant supports the further development of that program to
allow biologists to explore numerous biological problems related to phylogenetic
analysis, such as variability in the nucleotide substitution process across a
genome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project are
significant. The MrBayes program is used by thousands of biologists and has been
cited in over 7,500 publications. The new version of the program will extend the
program's capabilities in significant ways that will benefit biologists: the
number of phylogenetic models available to the biologist will expand; the speed
of the program will be increased and the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms
improved to better explore parameter space; and the program will obtain a
graphical user interface that should make using the program easier.
