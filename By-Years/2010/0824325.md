The School for Advanced Research (SAR), an advanced research center for
anthropology and allied disciplines located in Santa Fe, NM, will undertake a
program of Research Team Seminars. They will bring together scientists who are
independently working on a particular anthropological topic and need the time,
space, and seclusion that SAR provides in order to discuss, synthesize, and
analyze the results of their collaborative research and develop future plans for
successful completion of their projects. Eligible research teams will be those
in which the primary focus is on a question of anthropological importance, but
the teams may be interdisciplinary and international in scope. This award
provides three years of funding to support at least two Research Team Seminars
each year.

This award supports a recent trend in the scientific community towards increased
collaborative, interdisciplinary, and international research, which has been
found to produce products of increased quality and importance. Studies on the
practice of collaborative science demonstrate that, while digital communication
is an important component of team research, sustained face-to-face interaction
is also needed to successfully advance the research.
