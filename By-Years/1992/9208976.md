Computer model assessments of the atmospheric chemistry and air quality of the
past, present, and future rely in part on inventories of emissions constructed
on appropriate spatial and temporal scales and with appropriate chemical
species. The production of such global inventories is the task of the Global
Emissions Inventories Activity (GEIA) of the International Global Atmospheric
Chemistry Project (IGAC). In support of this activity, the GEIA Management
Committee proposes funding for the following: a two-year postdoctoral position
for the organization and coordination of between five and ten project committees
developing specific inventories, part-time supervision and support for the GEIA
data management effort to make these inventories internally consistent widely
available, and travel funds for US and developing world participants to attend
three workshops at which the emissions inventories will be produced and
discussed.
