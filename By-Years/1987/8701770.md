The proposed research on Bayesian statistical theory and methods falls into
five categories: (1) The development of appropriate statistical models and
methodology for the analysis of selected data and other types of non-random
samples often encountered. Particular emphasis will be placed on comparing the
information in a selection sample with that in an unrestricted random sample.
(2) Problems of combining expert opinions, including a formal study of how the
opinions that experts report might differ from their true opinions, and the
development of conditions for determing whether a given rule of combination is
an admissible one. (3) Problems of optimal inspection and control in which it is
necessary to schedule a sequence of costly inspections of a stochastic process
in order to detect as quickly as possible the event that the process has gone
out of control or has entered some desirable target area. (4) Problems of
optimal stopping in which each member of a team of decision makers receives only
partial information about the observations in a sequential sample, they connot
communicate directly with each other, and they must develop an optimal strategy
for jointly stopping the process. (5) The development of appropriate Bayesian
statistical methods for use in various legal settings. This research is in the
general area of Bayesian statistics, an approach to statistical decision making
that incorporates the pertinent knowledge that exists prior to the collection of
new data bearing on the issue. The general theory behind this approach is not
new, but has been of little practical use to date. This is because the
mathematical equations that need to be solved to use even a little bit of prior
information require large amounts of computational horsepower and clever
algorithms, and, until recently, such computational resources have not been
generally available. With the required resources becoming more commonly
available, the potential impact of this research grows. As pathbreaking Bayesian
methods for specific practical examples are developed, as is proposed here, this
approach is expected to spread and to revolutionize the way data is used to make
decisions.
