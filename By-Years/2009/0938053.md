This grant supports student travel to a Doctoral Symposium taking place in
conjunction with the International Conference on Software Reuse. The funds will
give participants an opportunity to present their current work and get
constructive feedback from a panel of faculty volunteers. The forum helps form a
community for the next generation of researchers/educators and gives a forum for
improving their research results with faculty mentorship beyond their own
institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sol J.
