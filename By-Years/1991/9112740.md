This research program is for the fabrication and study of the electronic
properties of high-quality electron systems in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures
which are laterally confined with atomic precision. We will make use of a new
and promising fabrication technique, namely regrowth by molecular beam epitaxy
(MBE) on the edge of an in-situ-cleaved wafer which contains thin-film layers
previously grown by MBE. The precision of the lateral structures (on the cleaved
surface) in this technique is limited by the initial MBE growth and, therefore,
is about the atomic size. This is by far better than what is presently
achievable by conventional lithography techniques. We propose to fabricate novel
systems such as lateral resonant tunneling structures and lateral superlattices,
and study their electronic properties through quantum transport measurements.
