This partnership encompasses three large urban commuting schools, two community
colleges (City Colleges of Chicago Kennedy-King College and Olive-Harvey
College) and the Chicago State University (CSU). It is fostering an increase in
the number of students persisting in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) courses and majors by focusing directly on the quality of
student learning and engaging students in research projects early in their
academic careers. The program: 1. enables students at community colleges to
matriculate directly into the CSU baccalaureate STEM programs; 2. gives students
support through programs that include facilitated learning, on-line tutoring,
career counseling, seminars, development workshops, and faculty and peer
mentoring programs; 3. puts early emphasis on developing student skills in
mathematics and writing; and 4. uses CSU's local prairie garden for ecological
and environmental field research as a base to expand opportunities for student
research opportunities early in their undergraduate years.

Intellectual Merit: Contributing to the intellectual merit of this project are:
the strong emphasis on academic excellence through strengthening student skills
in mathematics and writing; affording early research experiences on something
that students can see is a part of their world; and the close attention to
support through cohort class participation, faculty and peer workshops, group
study, seminars, and hands-on instruction in mathematics and science.

Broader impacts: These institutions have long successful records of increasing
diversity throughout their academic programs and have worked diligently with the
public schools, community colleges and public institutions to do so. The goals
are to increase undergraduate research by 20% and transfer rates from community
college to baccalaureate institutions by 25%. The results of the program are
being widely disseminated.
