The exotic nitrogen-fixing tree Myrica faya invades young volcanic sites in
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Growth of native plants in these sites is
strongly limited by low nitrogen availability, and it has been demonstrated that
invasion by Myrica substantially alters both nitrogen inputs and nitrogen
availability in areas where it is abundant. It is believed that this invasion
will alter population dynamics, community structure, and ecosystem-level
nutrient cycling in native ecosystems of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The
reproductive biology of Myrica makes it a successful invader, and its unique (to
that area) physiology changes system-level productivity and nutrient cycling.
Analyses of biological invasions such as this one offer the opportunity to
determine how individual species can regulate ecosystem dynamics, and integrate
the approaches of physiological, population, community, and ecosystem-level
ecology in an ecosystem study. The research team for this project has an
excellent track record for collaborative work and productivity. Facilities for
the work at both Stanford and the University of Hawaii are quite good in
cooperation by the National Park Service and by NASA are first rate.
