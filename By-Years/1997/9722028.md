One of the highest priority areas in elementary particle physics is experiments
that test the standard model through the symmetry between particles and anti-
particles known as CP symmetry. BaBar is a new experiment designed to perform
such tests. It is important that students attend workshops that study the
potential of such experiments, especially as the life of this experiment is of
order a decade.
