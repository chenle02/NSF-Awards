Southeastern Arkansas experienced a so-called 100-year flood in spring of 2008.
The historic origin and frequency of such flooding in this region is poorly
understood. Floodplain lake sediments extending back to pre-human times may hold
clues for understanding the role of humans versus natural climatic variability
in flooding. The 2008 flood provides a unique opportunity to study a modern
flood sediment layer. Scientists in this project will sample a transect of
surface sediment cores of oxbow lakes in the White River Wildlife Refuge in
order to determine size distribution of sediment grains. The cores will be dated
using an isotope of lead. In addition, the investigators will be able to
determine changes in water chemistry and diatom assemblages over time from the
cores. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will enable identification and dating of
flood layersand from them reconstruction of a long term flood history for the
lower Mississippi valley. Historically, flooding was a natural disaster that
disproportionately impacted low income families. A better understanding of long
term flood dynamics may be useful in improving urban planning and reducing flood
damage in the future. The fieldwork will provide experience for two female
graduate students from India and the U.S.
