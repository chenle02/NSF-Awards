A collection of digital K-12 materials and resources built around the theme of
"Water in the Earth System (WES)" is being created to enhance the ability of
K-12 teachers, students, and parents to easily find, access, and use high-
quality, standards-based water resources in their classrooms, at home, and in
informal learning environments. The collection of approximately 500 exemplary
K-12 water resources (scientific, economic, and policy) is being used to
investigate and learn about important water concepts, processes, and issues. The
resource materials and associated tools and services are identified, reviewed,
and cataloged by K - 12 teachers in collaboration with university scientists and
educators. These individuals are working closely with a number of other
organizations including: federal and state government agencies, professional
scientific and education societies, academic institutions and centers, and
several other National SMETE Digital Library projects.

Important co-funding of this project is being provided by the Division of Earth
Sciences in NSF's Geosciences Directorate.
