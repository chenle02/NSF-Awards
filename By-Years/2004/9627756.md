9627756 Wang Qiudong Wang received his doctoral degree from the University of
Cincinnati and will pursue research under the guidance of Lai-Sang Young at the
University of California at Los Angeles. The research is in dynamical systems
with emphasis on the study of Hamiltonian systems and the N-body problem. %%%
The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships are awards to recent
recipients of doctoral degrees in the mathematical sciences. These awards are a
means of contributing to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the
nation. As researchers in the mathematical sciences expand their interactions
with other disciplines, and as the interplay increases between the various areas
of mathematics itself, opportunities for postdoctoral research and training are
becoming increasingly important. The Fellowships are designed to permit awardees
to choose research environments that will have maximal impact on their future
scientific development. The fellowship is designed to provide 24 months of
support divided into 18 academic-year months and three periods of two summer
months. The recipient may choose (1) the Research Fellowship option which allows
for full time support for any 18 academic year months in a three year period, in
intervals not shorter than 3 consecutive months or (2) the Research
Instructorship option which allows the 18 months of academic year support to be
taken as nine months of full time support and 18 months of half time support.
Not more than two months of summer support from this Fellowship may be received
in any calendar year. ***
