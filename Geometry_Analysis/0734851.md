Abstract

Award: DMS-0734851 Principal Investigator: Benson Farb

The conference "Geometry, Rigidity, and Group Actions" will bring together
researchers in a cluster of fields related to actions of lattices in semisimple
Lie groups. The subject's roots concern linear representations of lattices, but
developments in the past two decades have established strong connections with a
variety of other topics, including ergodic theory, dynamics of group actions on
compact manifolds, differential geometry, spaces of non-positive curvature,
geometric group theory, symplectic geometry, algebraic groups, unitary
representation theory, operator algebras, and group cohomology. Our lectures
will include contributions from all of these areas. We are holding the
conference on the occasion of Robert J. Zimmer's 60th birthday, in recognition
of his work's dramatic impact on the growth of this area.

The speaker list of this conference cuts across a variety of closely related
areas of mathematics, and will present participants with the opportunity to
learn about recent developments, important open questions, and the wide variety
of successful techniques that are being applied. New developments are emerging
rapidly and involve ideas from disparate areas of mathematics, so conferences of
this type are necessary to keep established researchers up to date, and are even
more valuable for young researchers who are entering this fast-paced,
interdisciplinary research area. A Sunday-afternoon workshop will provide
younger scholars with an opportunity to present their work and discuss it with
other conference participants. Additional information is available from the
