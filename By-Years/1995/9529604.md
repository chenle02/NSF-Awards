9529604 Jaffe This project addresses the formation of tropospheric ozone and the
abundance and origin of ozone precursors. Observations of surface and free
tropospheric ozone in the northern hemisphere show a spring maximum. Previous
measurements in Alaska and model simulations indicate that some of this peak can
be explained by photochemical production from winter accumulated, anthropogenic,
ozone precursors. In this regard, the most important ozone precursor is
peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN). Measurements also show an important role for
vertical transport in warming of air masses and causing thermal decomposition of
PAN in the boundary layer. This anthropogenically caused ozone production may
contribute to the long-term increases in ozone which have been observed at
several northern hemispheric locations during spring and summer. In this
project, ground-based measurements of ozone, nitrogen oxides, total reactive
nitrogen, PAN, carbon monoxide, radiation, radon, and reactive radical species,
as well as aerosol properties, ultraviolet radiation, and meteorological
parameters will be measured by the PI in collaboration with other researchers at
the Cheeka Peak research site in Washington. In addition, aircraft-borne
measurements of the abundance of ozone, nitric oxide, PAN, and carbon monoxide
will be performed in the spring of 1997 in conjunction with the ground-based
measurements. 0- and 1-dimensional models will be employed. The data will
provide answers to questions including: (1) What is the ozone budget in this
region; (2) What are the conditions that give rise to air mass warming and PAN
composition, leading to enhanced ozone formation; (3) What is the influence of
Asian emissions on air masses which arrive at the West Coast of the US; and (4)
What is the influence of cloud types and heights on the ozone/nitrogen oxide
photochemistry.
