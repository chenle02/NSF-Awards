9619843 This research project lies in the area of developing expressive type
systems for programming languages. Expressive type disciplines enable more
programs to typecheck, and thus support more diverse styles of programming.
Constrained types are a new type form that is particularly rich, but many
research challenges must be solved before they will be practical. Constrained
types are studied with the aim to increase type expressiveness, as well as to
apply constrained types to program analysis: these types have recently been
shown to be isomorphic to well-known flow analysis algorithms performed by
compilers. The project will explore this flow-types duality to (1) Systematize
and add rigor to flow algorithm descriptions; (2) Improve the precision of type
systems; (3) Develop and implement improved type inference algorithms; (4)
Improve the quality of flow analysis algorithms; and (5) Improve the usefulness
of typed intermediate languages in compilation. Successful completion of the
research will contribute to the quality of (1) Programming languages, by
developing richer type systems; (2) Compilers, by enhancing the quality of
optimizations possible via better program analyses; (3) CASE tools, by
developing both richer algorithms for type inference and a rich suite of flow-
based tools to elucidate program function. ***
