Goldston 9626903 The distribution of primes in various sequences of integers is
of critical importance in Number Theory. The study of this distribution uses
both multiplicative and additive number theory. Some of the tools utilized
include the circle method, exponential sums, sieves, and the zeta function
methods. This project will continue earlier work on obtaining lower bounds for
pairs of primes in various sequences. The method uses short divisor sums and has
connections with all of the aforementioned tools. The investigator will further
develop and generalize this method. He will also examine applications to primes
in arithmetic progressions and multiple correlations of primes. A related topic
is to obtain asymptotic results when averaging is available. In addition, the
investigator will study certain problems involving the power sum method; these
problems are well suited to an undergraduate institution. This research falls
into the general mathematical field of Number Theory. Number theory has its
historical roots in the study of the whole numbers, addressing such questions as
those dealing with the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among
the oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely
aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century it has become an
indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas such as data transmission
and processing, and communication systems.
