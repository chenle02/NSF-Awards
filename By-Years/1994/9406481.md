This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. The research addresses
the continuation of exploration of the use of deictic models and pointing
strategies for constructing goal- directed sensory-motor behaviors that are far
more succinct than classical methods, and exploration of trial-and-error
learning of these behaviors. The investigation involves deictic modeling of
visual routines, in which realistic fixation routines are developed that can
work with grayscale images, leading to visual behaviors that have the
flexibility to take advantage of task context; deictic modeling of short-term
memory that allows routines to use local memory; modeling of modular task
scheduling that supports the production of complex visual behaviors involving
multiple goals from simpler behavioral routines; and a deictic model of hand-eye
control via teleassistance, in which humans are able to assist a robot in
performing some of the more difficult control functions in a complex task.
