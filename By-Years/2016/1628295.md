NSF has made an award in support of a "BMES-NSF Special Session on Research in
BME and Grant Writing" outside the regular program of the Annual Meeting of the
Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) being held in Minneapolis, MN, October
5-8, 2016. The funding will be used to promote, convene and record the session
and offset travel costs and registration fees for NSF awardees (5) and reviewers
(2) who will serve as presenters, panelists, and potential mentors/collaborators
for novice and emerging investigators participating in the session. The 3 hour
session, featuring presentations showcasing NSF funded research and researchers
(2 CAREER awardees and 1 non-CAREER awardee), a Networking Reception, a Tutorial
on Essential Elements to Develop a Successful NSF BME Grant, and an Interactive
Grant Writing and Submission Panel Discussion, will be held on October 7, 2016.
The recorded session will be posted on the BMES website for on demand viewing.
These special sessions, which began in 2013, contribute to a comprehensive
approach by BMES, whose annual meeting serves as the premier conference for the
Biomedical Engineering community, in partnership with NSF to ensure development
of a diverse, well educated, and technically competent biomedical engineering
workforce.
