The 2003 ACM SIGMOBILE First International Conference on Embedded Networked
Sensor Systems (SenSys 2003), will be held in Los Angeles, California, in
November 2003. SenSys 2003 introduces a high caliber forum for research on
systems issues in the emerging area of embedded, networked sensors.

This proposal requests funding to support the participation of United States-
based graduate students in this meeting. Participation in conferences such as
SenSys is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience. It
provides students with the unique opportunity to interact with researchers that
are more senior, and be exposed to leading edge work in the field

The support requested in this proposal will enable the participation of students
who would otherwise be unable to attend SenSys 2003.
