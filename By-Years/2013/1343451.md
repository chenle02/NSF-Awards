This project explores the extent to which personality traits predict privacy and
security behaviors. Over the past decade, computer privacy and security have
improved by leaps and bounds by considering human factors in the design process.
However, previous work to improve the usability of privacy and security systems
has only examined the behaviors of "average users," which is believed to only
yield local maxima because no individual perfectly fits this profile. Therefore,
this project is examining the extent to which additional improvements can be
made by catering system designs to individual differences (e.g., in personality
traits). Through a series of surveys and controlled experiments, researchers are
discovering how these personality traits are predictive of certain privacy
decisions, as well as interactions with various security mitigations. For
instance, knowledge of a user's personality traits may result in more
appropriate default privacy settings on a social networking website or web
browser security warnings that are more salient to that user. The researchers'
goal is to ultimately design systems that infer personality traits and then
adjust privacy and security mechanisms so as to yield outcomes that are
optimally aligned with a particular user's preferences.
