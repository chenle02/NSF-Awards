Many information needs can be more easily expressed using longer, sentence-
length queries, but the inadequacies of current search engines force people to
try to think up the right combination of keywords to find relevant documents.
This can be very difficult and often leads to search failures. On the other
hand, long queries are handled poorly by current search engines. The focus of
this project is on developing retrieval algorithms and query processing
techniques that will significantly improve the effectiveness of long queries. A
specific emphasis is on techniques for transforming long queries into
semantically equivalent queries that produce better search results. In contrast
to purely linguistic approaches to paraphrasing, query transformation is done in
the context of, and guided by, retrieval models. Query transformation steps such
as stemming, segmentation, and expansion have been studied for many years, and
we are both extending and integrating this work in a common framework. The new
query processing techniques for long queries are being developed and distributed
using the NSF-funded Lemur toolkit from UMass/CMU, and are being evaluated using
a variety of document and query collections from sources such as the web, social
media sites such as forums, and TREC, with an involvement of graduate and
undergraduate students. The project Web site
(http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/research/longqueries) will be used to further
disseminate results.

Given that search is one of the two most common activities on the web and that
new modalities for search, such as voice interfaces and collaborative question
answering, are increasing the importance of long queries, this research could
have a very broad impact, both in the home and the office.
