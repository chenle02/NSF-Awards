A new upper-level course in observational astronomy using an existing Celestron
14-inch telescope is being developed. The observations cover a wide range of
topics in modern astronomy. A CCD camera is used to obtain images of star
clusters, HII regions, and galaxies as the basis for instruction in image
processing. Multicolor CCD photometry is done on an open cluster in order to
plot the cluster's Hertzsprung Russell diagram. CCD photometry is also done on
short period variables to determine their light curves. Classification
spectroscopy of stars is performed using a grating spectrograph with a low
dispersion grating and film or the CCD camera. High velocity spectroscopic
binary stars are observed with a high dispersion grating and the CCD camera on
the spectrograph to determine their orbital velocities. The observations are
possible with the inexpensive telescope because they are primarily based on
bright objects, and because the telescope is automatically guided by a second
CCD camera, already on the telescope. Students can pursue independent research
projects on fainter objects with the same equipment. Data obtained with the
equipment is also used in the introductory astronomy course.
