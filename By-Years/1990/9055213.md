Northeast Louisiana University will initiate a three-week, residential Young
Scholars project in Computer Science for 30 students entering grades 8,9.
Participants will be introduced to the fundamental concepts of computer science
and will have hands-on experience with topics such as graphics, robotics, expert
systems, telecommunications, and databases. Students will be divided into groups
to conduct research projects. The program will include field trips to local
industries to learn about possible careers in science and mathematics and
evening events will include invited speakers to further discuss such potential
careers. Follow-up will continue throughout the academic year and students will
return for two days the following summer to complete these activities.
