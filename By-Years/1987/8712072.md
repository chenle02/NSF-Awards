A program to improve the performance of existing and contemplated
interferometer-based, gravitational wave detectors is planned. The program
concentrates on an investigation of suspension systems, inertial references, and
servo designs which would extend the useful range of ground-based gravitational
wave detectors to lower frequencies through better seismic isolation. The
current state of gravitational wave detection, especially methods of seismic
isolation, is examined. An isolation system for test masses consisting of
inertial reference pendulum, suspension pendulum, and interlocking servo systems
is to be developed. This isolation system requires development of novel pendulum
technology, inertial reference designs, and servo schemes. When put into
operation, it is expected that signals of frequency l Hz or greater will be
detectable above the background seismic noise.
