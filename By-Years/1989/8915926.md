Inverted Echo Sounders (IES) have been deployed in the western equatorial
Atlantic for over four years, concurrent with an unmanned meteorological station
at Sts. Peter & Paul Rocks, located at 1deg N, 29 deg W. In this project, the
data, along with other TOGA data sets, will be used to investigate thermocline
variability near the point at which the North Equatorial Counter Current
reverses. Both local and remote forcing will be considered. Low mode baroclinic
waves as functions of currents, wind stress, and bottom topography, will also be
studied. Results will be compared with output from general circulation models.
