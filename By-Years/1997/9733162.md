PI proposes creating structural configurations that eliminate the field weld
from the critical sections, thus allowing other more ductile areas to serve as
capacity limits for the structure. This design approach is difficult to
accomplish using the typical rolled configurations and connecting procedures of
today. Therefore, the research hinges on the development and implementation of a
specially configured modular node. A cast steel configuration specifically
designed to mitigate the weld stresses is envisioned. A by-product of the
modular node implementation is ease of erection, fine tuning capabilities at the
panel zone, and the facilitation of passive structural control. The objective of
the proposed research is to provide improved panel zone response and more
reliable ductility within joints of moment resistant frames.
