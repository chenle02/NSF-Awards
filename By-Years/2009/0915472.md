This project will employ a cyclical two-step process to develop a computational
model that embeds dynamic expression and socially engaging non-verbal gestures
into talking avatars, and experimentally tests its usability within digital
virtual environments involving human-digital agent interaction. Specifically,
the research objectives of this project include: (1) synthesis of expressive
talking faces and modeling of dynamic facial expressions, (2) synthesis of
socially engaging non-verbal facial gestures, and (3) in-depth usability studies
on resultant avatars.

Digital immersive virtual environment technology has enormous implications for
human-computer interaction. Many qualities of digital human representations,
particularly those of human-appearing agents, are important for social
engagement and social influence. In particular, non-verbal behaviors play a
critical role. Among such behaviors, arguably the most important are facial
expressions of emotion, which are critical for meaningful renderings of digital
agents. To date, computational models that would permit such renderings are less
than optimal. Indeed, an applicable and systematic computational model for
rendering spontaneous, on-the-fly non-verbal facial gestures and integrating
them with speech has not been created.

The success of this proposed project will remove a major barrier to the
widespread application of useful digital human representation technology for all
applications in which computer-mediated communication can play a role, including
commerce, education, health, engineering, and entertainment applications. In
addition, it will have far-reaching scientific implications, providing a
computationally tractable mechanism for embedding human qualities into computer-
controlled entities that are used in other scientific and engineering fields.
