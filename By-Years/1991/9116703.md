The development of precambrian shields includes the assembly of fundamentally
different blocks or terranes. Wopmay Orogen, in the Northwest Territories of
Canada is a well-studied example of juxtaposition of different terranes, with
Archean crust now adjacent to juvenile 2.0-2.4 Ga crust. This research will
investigate the geologic and isotopic consequences of collisional interaction
between these terranes, thought to have occurred at 1.885 Ga. The work will
involve timing the deformation along Wopmay Fault Zone, and the sources and
timing of magmatism along this fundamental crustal lithospheric boundary, and
will be accomplished in collaboration with workers at the Geological Survey of
Canada.
