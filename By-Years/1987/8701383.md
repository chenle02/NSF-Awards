This internship program will continue to provide opportunities for high school
science teachers to become familiar with the cutting-edge basic research being
undertaken by earth scientists at U.S. universities and research institutions;
to learn about the new technology that is being used in and, in some cases, is
driving such research; to gain experience in the planning and management of
basic earth sciences research through either a summer or academic semester of
work with the National Science Foundation ocean sciences programs and at
academic research laboratories or facilities, as appropriate. This effort will
involve two interns each for the spring, summer, and fall of l987 who will be
assigned to appropriate programs within the Ocean Sciences Division. They will
work with the programs to which they are assigned, consistent with the WORK PLAN
outline. The interns will be selected by the AGI, as outlined in the proposal
and amplified in discussions between AGI and NSF officials. The experience
gained by the teachers who participate in this internship program should enable
them in turn to update and to improve the quality and scope of high school
science programs reaching many students who will in turn enter U.S. university
science programs.
