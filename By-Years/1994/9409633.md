9409633 Imamoglu The quantum control of photon generation processes in
semiconductor stuctures is of substantial interest both from a fundamental and a
practical point of view. The goal of the proposed work is to investigate the
fundamental limits to quantum control and noise suppression in light emitting
mesoscopic semiconductor heterojunctions. This proposed research will emphasize
the generation of heralded single-photon states, which represent the ultimate
limit in the quantum control of light generation. Using a semi-classical
analysis, the principal investigator has already predicted that strict
regulation of the photon emission times can be achieved by utilizing the Coulomb
blockade of electron and hole injection in mesoscopic semiconductors.
Theoretically, the emphasis of the proposed work would be on the newly developed
quantum Monte Carlo wave-function approach to dissipative electron dynamics in
semiconductors and its application to the quantum analysis of heralded single-
photon state generation. The experimental work aimed at the regulation of the
photon generation process in mesoscoptic P - I - i - I - N quantum well
structures will also be pursued concurrently. It is anticipated that the novel
features of heralded single-photon states will find many applications, which
include reliable information encoding at the single-photon level and noise-free
amplification. ***
