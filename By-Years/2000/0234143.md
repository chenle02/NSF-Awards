This grant provides support for the formation of the Environmental Signaling
Network (Enviro Signal Net), an interactive network of scientists in the new,
interdisciplinary field of environmental endocrine science, the integrated study
of the interactions of endocrine signaling systems found in our natural and
synthetic environment across many phyla including microbes, plants, invertebrate
and vertebrate (amphibians, birds, fish, reptiles, and mammals) animals. This
project will probe the mechanisms for environmental signal communication from
the molecular to the population levels. The Enviro Signal Net will operate via
interconnected fellowship, workshop, symposia, laboratory, and web-based
activities to develop an environmental signaling knowledge base. A priority for
the Net is to foster diversity in ethnicity, age, gender, and scientific
discipline among all the investigators as well as to provide effective mentoring
for young investigators. State of the art techniques in web based communication
and collaboration will facilitate the global reach of the project. The resulting
"laboratory without walls" will be an interactive forum in which new
investigators are recruited and trained; collaborative research is fostered; a
web-based workbook on environmental signaling is generated; and an
interdisciplinary field is advanced.
