We propose an experimental study of the mechanical properties of elemental (Cu
and W) specimens with nanoscale dimensions. We will use a new family of
nanostructures grown by the oblique angle deposition technique that have been
specially designed as test specimens. The nanostructures are in the form of
isolated nanorods, nanobeams and nanosprings that are fixed at one end to a
rigid substrate. They will be tested with the tip of an atomic force microscope
(AFM) or a nanoindenter. The samples are designed to reproduce standard
macroscopic tests in which a well-defined volume of material is loaded with a
known stress state. We will investigate: the scaling of material properties
(moduli, yield stress) and behavior (e.g. hardening) with the specimen size,
whether solid solution hardening may be used to tailor mechanical properties in
nanostructures, and the fatigue behavior. The proposal has a well-structured
educational component and will have a broader impact in the field of MEMS and
NEMS.
