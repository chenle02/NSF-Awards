Over the last two years, there has been increasing interest in the application
of logic programming technology to problems in biology. A number of institutions
worldwide have formed interdisciplinary research groups to explore this
application. The group at Argonne National Laboratory, with participation of
scientists from Washington University, have begun active research in applying
logic programming to molecular biology. The fifth Generation project at Japan's
ICOT has also created a working group to explore such applications. The purpose
of this project is to provide travel funds for an American Scientist (as a
member of a team) to attend a meeting in Japan for the purpose of developing
joint research in this area between the two countries.
