Much of today's economic activity and resource allocation takes place on systems
with many strategic actors. Examples include auctions and exchanges for
advertising space, matching markets for labor and capital, and congestion-aware
GPS navigation systems. These systems have grown larger than ever before in
today's networked world, and their behavior is necessarily a confluence of the
preferences, beliefs, and strategic behaviors of many, rather than a system
designer's intent. Nevertheless, there are two main "knobs" that a designer of
such a system can turn in order to influence the equilibrium behavior of its
participants: the incentives provided to players in the game, and the
information available to them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal adopts the
perspective of a designer looking to influence equilibrium outcomes in such
systems. The proposed work will separately consider both modes of intervention,
namely structuring the incentives provided and carefully revealing information.
In each case, the PI will examine the associated algorithmic question: Given the
designer's objective, can a near-optimal intervention be computed efficiently?
On the incentives front, the focus will be on refining existing theoretical
models and algorithmic techniques with the goal of broadening their impact, in
particular to settings where heuristic mechanisms and auctions have seen success
in practice. On the information front, the proposed work will lay the
foundations of an algorithmic theory of information in games, and begin a
systematic examination of the computational complexity of intervention through
information revelation.
