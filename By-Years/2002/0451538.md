The Extensible Terascale Facility (ETF), or TeraGrid involves nine resource
providers operating high-performance computing, information, and visualization
facilities, interconnected with a dedicated high bandwidth optical network and
integrated with a set of common software that presents the user community with a
cohesive set of distributed resources and services. On October 1, 2004, the ETF
will conclude a three-year construction effort and will transition into an
operational state. This proposal outlines services to be provided at NCSA as
part of early operation of the TeraGrid system. NCSA brings a tremendous wealth
of experience in production HPC environments to the ETF partnership. Not only
will NCSA be providing the largest scale high-end systems to TeraGrid, but also
experienced personnel who will provide the users with support throughout the
life of their projects. NCSA staff process initial allocations requests, route
and respond to questions and problem reports, assist scientists with their
computational and data needs, tune the TeraGrid environment for optimal
performance, and promote science success stories. Additionally, through the ETF
construction project, NCSA has provided considerable contributions to ETF in the
areas of file system and system scaling, file transfer performance
characterization, as well as contributed to building the core TeraGrid security
team NCSA will be providing an aggregate 16 TFlops of peak computing power and
over half a petabyte of online storage for ETF. NCSA will initially provide a
10TFlop IBM/Intel Itanium 2 compute resource connected to one parallel file
system on a 120TB Storage Area Network (SAN) system, and a second parallel file
system across the entire cluster attached to servers with 60TB of direct-
connected online storage. A second production computing resource, a shared-
memory, symmetric multi-processor (SMP) SGI Altix system, will come online in
March 2005. This system will consist of 1,024 Intel Itanium 2 processors running
the Linux operating system, 3 terabytes of globally accessible memory, and 370
terabytes of SGI Infinite Storage, with a peak performance of more than 6
teraflops.
