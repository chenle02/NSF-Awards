9626220 Shiota The Sound to Mountains exhibit showcases contemporary and
emerging watershed issues which affect the Pacific Northwest region. This
exhibit addresses the need to focus awareness on non-point pollution for the
general public and among Washington State teachers and school children (K-12).
This represents one of the major pollution problems affecting the greater Puget
Sound region. A school curriculum and visitation program will be developed,
along with a Watershed Wonders kit. The components of the Sound to Mountains
exhibit include: a freshwater self-discovery laboratory; a lowland waters
replication; a life-like conservation trail; an upland mountain stream habitat;
and a carved and painted mural depicting the First People story of salmon.
