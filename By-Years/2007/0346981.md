ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;DBI-BDI: 0346981 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Schwartz&lt;br/&gt;CAREER
Award&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carnegie Mellon University has been awarded a grant
to develop computational methods for biological modeling and simulation in small
to medium size cellular systems. The project will develop methods for simulating
self-assembly systems on small to medium scales. Self-assembly systems,
collections of molecular subunits that spontaneously assemble into larger
structures under appropriate conditions, are crucial to many cellular processes.
Accurate models of their behavior on small scales are therefore essential to
modeling cell function and reliably predicting cellular responses to various
interventions. The project will accomplish this research goal primarily by
developing algorithms and theory for small-system discrete-event models to
complement prevailing large-system differential equation models. As an integral
part of the project methodologies for teaching computional biology will be
developed and used in the curriculum at CMU and in teaching computional biology
to general biologists. The project is aimed at advancing the field of
computional biology through the full integration of innovative and advanced
research with the education of a diverse array of students. &lt;br/&gt;
