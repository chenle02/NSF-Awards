ABSTRACT Birnbaum, Michael H. California State University at Fullerton
SBR-9410572 In collaboration with Ward Edwards (SBR-9409698) the PI proposes to
study risk attitudes. The PI will investigate the behavior and attitudes of
people who participate in "The Big Spin," which is the California State
Lottery's TV show. The PI will be given access to the participants before,
during, and after their participation in the televised portion of the lottery.
The risk attitudes of these persons will be compared at various time periods,
and their responses will also be compared to the responses of a control group of
non-participants. A one-year follow-up of all participants is included in the
design.
