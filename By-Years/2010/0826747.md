This proposal seeks funding to refocus the former Radio Ice Cherenkov Experiment
(RICE) mission into a Neutrino Array Radiofrequency Calibration platform, which
will serve as a testbed for future development of an eventual large-scale
neutrino radio-detection array. RICE has historically been calibrated using in-
ice radio transmitters; however, these transmitters suffer additional drawbacks
of having signal geometry distinctly different from the neutrino-induced air
showers produced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere.
These extensive air showers (EAS) currently observable both via their particle
flux at the South Pole surface with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory IceTop
detectors, and also the flux of penetrating muons reaching IceCube 2-km below.
Such air showers will also produce two radio wave signals ? one at long-
wavelengths in-air due to the EAS charged particle flux undergoing geomagnetic
separation, and the other in-ice produced when that particle flux impacts the
surface, resulting in a Cherenkov signal identical to that expected for in-ice
neutrinos. It is proposed to redirect the former RICE trigger scheme for both
'in-air' and 'in-ice' EAS, taking advantage of the existing air-shower detection
capabilities offered by the combination of the IceCube and IceTop detectors.
Coincident detection with the next-generation in-ice digital radio module
hardware will allow complete tracking of air shower signals from several hundred
meters above the ice surface to hundreds of meters below. This would establish
the constant calibration beam upon which future in-ice radio detection devices
can be further developed, and which must be quantified for proposed surface
neutrino-detection arrays with no up-down discrimination, leaving them
susceptible to fake signals from air showers. Continued reliance on students
provides a broader impact to this proposed research and firmly grounds this
effort in its educational mission.
