This project will develop a second-year course for engineers that stresses
"teaming" , written and oral communications, creative and crtitical thinking and
responsible design strategies. The course is a sequel to a first-year design
course that is presently in place. The project will permit formal training of
the faculty in methods of instruction suitable for courses which will be based
on the team concept. The faculty will participate in seminars conducted by
Boeing Aircraft Company which are used for in-house training. Materials
developed under the aegis of the project will be tested in current courses and
complete materials will be created to permit the teaching of the course in its
entirety in Fall 1993. The project faculty will be assisted in the planning and
evaluation by distinguished outside consultants.
