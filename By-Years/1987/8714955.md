The proposed research is designed to determine whether genetic correlations
between morphology and behavior reflect the sorces of selection in natural
populations. Several populations of the Northwest Garter Snake, Thamnophis
ordinoides, will be examined for genetic correlations between color pattern and
antipredator behavior. Field studies of selection will then be conducted using
mark-recapture and field enclosure techniques to determine whether particular
combinations of color pattern and behavior have relative survival advantages.
The existence of genetic correlations between morphology and behavior means that
the traits in question undergo non- independent evolution. An empirical
demonstration of selection for a combination of traits will emphasize the need
for multivariate approaches to selection. If genetic correlations between
morphology and behavior reflect such selection, it will represent the first
empirical evidence that selection acts to maintain genetic correlations in
natural populations.
