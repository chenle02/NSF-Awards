An award is made to Washington and Lee University to acquire an isotope ratio
mass spectrometer and to share it through a variety of collaborations with
neighboring Virginia Military Institute. The spectrometer will enable faculty
members and students at the two primarily undergraduate institutions to examine
samples for research and training across academic disciplines. The research will
focus on environmental issues related to understanding and maintaining local,
regional and global systems, notably the impact of human disturbance. The
analysis of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen stable isotope ratios will
range across time scales (days to millennia), disciplines (Archaeology, Geology
and Biology), and biological levels of organization (bacteria to
ecosystems).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This powerful and sophisticated instrument
will enhance teaching, transform training, make the sciences relevant and
appealing to more applicants and students (including underrepresented
minorities), and increase outreach and service to the community and region in
efforts to protect the environment. The spectrometer is an important addition to
Washington and Lee's scientific instrumentation, complementing an expanding
array in labs and the new Integrative and Quantitative Science Center supported
by grants from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to emphasize computation and
visualization and from NSF. One of the university's goals is to engage more
students in science, whatever their majors or career goals. The spectrometer and
its many uses also will strengthen the intensive, personal teacher-scholar
approach to learning and research that characterizes Washington and Lee and VMI,
where students and faculty work together on research projects, sharing credit
for publications and formal presentations. That close interaction prepares and
encourages students to pursue science careers.
