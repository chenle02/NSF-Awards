Liquid phase processing of ceramics, glass, semiconductors, and oxide
superconductors provides a route to producing useful forms of these materials
which is often blocked by reaction with containers. This research explores a
novel containerless processing method for these materials. Heterogeneous
nucleation at container surfaces would be eliminated to enable synthesis of
amorphous materials and improve control of single crystal growth. The
containerless processing method uses relatively large aerodynamic forces and
smaller acoustic positioning forces to achieve stable levitation of radiantly
heated liquids. Stable acoustic levitation of low density liquids such as water,
as well as aerodynamic levitation of dense solids, are well developed methods.
Application of the proposed hybrid technique to dense solid materials has also
been demonstrated in preliminary experiments under conditions for which
aerodynamic levitation is not, by itself, stable. The proposed Phase I research
develops to maintain levitation stability during melting, demonstrates operation
with selected ceramic materials (e.g., aluminum oxide, oxide superconductors,
fluoride glasses), and determines the designs and operating procedures for Phase
II processing and materials property research.***//
