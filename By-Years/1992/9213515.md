Dissertation student, Sara Tjossem; topic: "Defying Boundaries: Rachel Carson
and Ecological Environmentalism." The development of American ecology involved
defining the scope of its influence on fields such as botany and zoology by
studying biological processes like the development, adaptation and distribution
of organisms. Throughout the development of the field of ecology, the Ecological
Society of America promoted its status as a scientific discipline through its
journals and scientific meetings. There were difficulties in focus, however, for
a society that attracted scientists with such disparate training. Questions
arose about the proper direction and scope of ecological questions, such as the
place of environmental concerns in research. This drawing of disciplinary
boundaries drew distinctions between pure and applied research. Rachel Carson
highlighted the problems of defining boundaries by usurping the authority of the
scientific field of ecology with her book Silent Spring. Carson popularized
ecological concepts and urged the inclusion of ethics in science. She was
instrumental in awakening the public to the dangers of excessive pesticide use,
yet her reception by ecologists was mixed. Carson was never part of mainstream
American ecology and yet she affected its definition by drawing public attention
to its practice. Ms. Tjossem is examining the process by which Carson affected
the whole course of the science of ecology.
