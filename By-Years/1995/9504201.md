ABSTRACT: 9504201 Serreze Research supported by this grant is under the auspices
of the Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and is
jointly sponsored by the Division of Ocean Sciences and the Office of Polar
Programs. Work to be performed represents prelim- inary steps towards a major
5-year research project named SHEBA, which is envisioned to study the heat
budget of the Arctic Ocean and its impact on global change. The primary goals of
SHEBA are: (1) to develop, test and implement models of arctic ocean-
atmosphere-ice processes that demonstrably improve simulations of the present
day arctic climate, including its variability, using General Circulation Models
(GCMs), and (2) to improve the interpre- tation of satellite remote sensing data
in the Arctic for analysis of the arctic climate system and provide reliable
data for model input, model validation and climate monitoring. In order to place
the field experiment phase of SHEBA at the best location, the climatological
regime of the proposed site must be analyzed. Researchers at the University of
Colorado will compile existing data on sea ice and atmospheric conditions in the
region and publish the results on CD ROM about one year before final planning of
the site location. Other researchers in the SHEBA project are expected to use
the data to plan individual experiments on heat budget measurements. ??
