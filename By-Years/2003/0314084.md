0314084&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An international
conference will be held on mathematical control theory for systems governed by
partial differential equations. This is an area of applied mathematics that has
recently been sparked by new questions and new modeling challenges. These new
questions have given rise to new mathematical and computational methods that
will be discussed at this conference to be held at Georgetown University from
May 31 to June 2, 2003.&lt;br/&gt;
