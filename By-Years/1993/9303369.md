The investigator proposes to work on several problems in the area of dynamical
systems involving the existence of attractors carrying Sinai-Bowen-Ruelle
measures. Investigations of ergodic properties of these measures are proposed
along with the generalization to multi-dimensional attractors with unstable
manifolds. Applications to a variety of physical models and several computer
experiments are also intended.
