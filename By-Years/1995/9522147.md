9522147 Berger This is an award to start a consortium between four universities
to study seven stress analysis type problems of interest to the industrial
community. The idea is to develop a library of Green's functions which will
greatly expedite the solution of complicated but real world problem stress
analysis problems. These Green's functions will then be used in the boundary
element procedure for efficient computational codes. These monies will be used
to support graduate students involved in these problems. ***
