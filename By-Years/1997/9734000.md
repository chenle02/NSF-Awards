This CAREER award supports research and educational activities that will enhance
the application of geophysics in characterization of geotechnical sites. This
will be accomplished through three activities: * informing, teaching, and
training future and present engineers about the utility, methods, advantages,
and drawbacks of geophysics in engineering; * developing an engineering
geophysics test site appropriate for an urban area in the arid West, for
purposes of both teaching and research; and, * enhancing a geophysical technique
involving seismic surface waves to address lateral variability in geotechnical
systems. No geotechnical site is truly homogeneous, yet current the models
currently applied to interpret results are based on this assumption. The
Principal Investigator will work alongside students and collaborators in
academics and private industry to perform experimental and analytical research
to determine the extent to which this assumption is valid. In the process,
methods will be developed to characterize the variability of a site through
interpretation of the surface wave data, including development of a modified
Spectral-Analysis-of-Surface-Wave (SASW) method that incorporates areal
coverage. Applications for this technique in practice include establishment of
lateral and vertical extent of hard inclusions of calcrete and cemented deposits
in desert alluvium, and detection and delineation of buried inclusions such as
man-made tunnels and natural cavities. The educational component of this project
includes introducing middle-school girls to the concept of geophysics;
developing coursework in engineering geophysics for both undergraduate and
graduate students; and laying the groundwork to develop a continuing education
course in engineering geophysics for practicing engineers.
