Since 1980, and especially within the last three years, there has been rapid
growth in the area of microbiology in this department. This is reflected in a
49% increase in the number of students enrolled in the basic microbiology course
and the subsequent increase in demand for upper division courses. In response to
this demand, a new faculty member, with expertise in immunology, was hired by
the department in 1986, providing the department with the opportunity to expand
its offerings in microbiology and to provide a core of courses approved by the
American Society for Microbiology. The equipment procured through this prospect
is enhancing the laboratory experiences offered, and making it possible to offer
additional courses in the near future. A teaching microscope, compatible with a
video display system, provides both an opportunity to improve instruction in
microscopy and to use techniques in fluorescence microscopy. The equipping of a
tissue culture laboratory permits the experimental manipulation of mammalian
cells. Students also are gaining experience in immunoelectrophoresis, ELISA and
other microtechniques, and in the manipulation and visualization of nucleic
acids. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum
obtained from non-Federal sources.
