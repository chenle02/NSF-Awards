This award provides funds for a research starter grant to assist a recipient of
an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology in establishing an
independent research program after obtaining a tenure-traack position at an
eligible institution in the United States. Funds are being used to provide
supplies and equipment for research on fundamental and molecular aspects of
microbial diversity and symbiosis. Specifically, the mechanism and impact of the
microbial degradation of bacterial signaling compounds in vitro and in soils
will be examined, as will the form, function, and phylogeny of microbes
associated with termite hindguts.
