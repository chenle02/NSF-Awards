10Be is preferentially removed from the ocean at an ocean- margin site in the
eastern equatorial Pacific at a rate 4-7 times greater than at 3 open-ocean
sites. This study at other areas of the Pacific Ocean will determine whether or
not other margins act as boundary sinks for 10Be. Scavenging of 10Be and 231Pa
in open-ocean and in ocean-margin regions will cover a range of total
particulate matter fluxes and a diversity of particle compositions and determine
the relative importance of several factors which influence scavenging intensity.
Sediments deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum will also be studied to
determine whether or not the intensity of boundary scavenging changed
significantly between the extreme range of climatic conditions represented by
LGM and Holocene times. Completing the proposed work will achieve more than just
a better understanding of the marine geochemical cycling of radiotracers such as
Th isotopes, 10Be and 231Pa. Identifying: 1) the relative importance of
different factors which regulate the scavening rates of particle-reactive
elements in the ocean, 2) the degree to which different types of ocean margins
act as important boundary sinks for particle- reactive elements, and 3) the
extent to which boundary scavenging intensity has changed with time, will lead
to a much better general understanding of the transport and fate of trace
elements in the ocean.
