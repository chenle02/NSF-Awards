Funding is provided to help characterize patterns of Holocene drought using new
cave records from the Southwestern U.S. to better understand mechanisms of
hydro-climatic variability in this arid region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research is centered on the following science hypotheses: i) the North American
monsoon intensified during the mid-Holocene due to higher local solar
insolation; ii) regional hydro-climate undergoes substantial variability on
multi-decadal to century time scales that are unrecognized in instrumental data
and perhaps underrepresented by the comparatively shorter tree-ring
reconstructions; iii) the past millennium experienced abrupt transitions among
decadal/multi-decadal dry intervals; and iv) southwest drought can be linked to
large-scale ocean-atmosphere forcing from both the Pacific and Atlantic
Oceans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve supporting students and
providing data of potential use for regional water
management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;
