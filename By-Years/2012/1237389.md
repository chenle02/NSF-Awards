This award provides travel support to nine U.S.-based researchers and eleven
Ph.D. students at U.S. universities to participate in the Fifteenth Latin
American Symposium on Mathematical Logic, to be held June 4?8, 2012 at
Universidad de los Andes in Bogota, Colombia, a major center of logic in Latin
America. Most of those for whom funds ares ought have either very limited or no
other means of travel support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biannual Latin American
Symposium on Mathematical Logic, first held in Santiago, Chile in 1970, has
played a central role in the growth and vitality of mathematical logic in Latin
America. While the level of research activity and the number of specialized
conferences of international prestige that are held in the region continues to
increase, the Latin American Symposium on Mathematical Logic remains the largest
Pan-American logic meeting. The program includes areas of great current
interest, and speakers include leading world experts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
event provides an important platform for extensive interaction between U.S. and
Latin American researchers and students beyond already well-established research
contacts. Increasing the visibility and presence of logic outside North America
and Europe, particularly in Latin America and Asia, is one of the Association
for Symbolic Logic?s highest long-term strategic priorities.
