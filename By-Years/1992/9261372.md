This project is aimed at new coding methods for lower cost satellite
communications. The project investigates the use of difference sets in finite
fields, and develops algorithms to clarify the feasibility of ideas. The PI is
programing two algorithms and analyzing their performance. The resulting new
sequences are then applied to design of new efficient, low cost CDMA/RMA/FH
(Code Division Multiple Access/Random Multiple Access/Frequency Hopping) system.
