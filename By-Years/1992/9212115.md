This equipment is to be used for investigations of the (bio)catalytic synthesis
of polymers in supercritical fluids. Specifically, the identification of enzymes
for the synthesis of poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(ethylene glutamate), and
peptide synthesis is to be carried out. In addition, the use of supercritical
fluids as solvents for traditional polymerization is to done. Previous work on
the (bio)catalytic transesterification of acrylates has produced a set of
general guidelines for the optimization of enzymatic processes in supercritical
environments. Using these guidelines, this project is to establish the
feasibility of the (bio)catalytic synthesis of aromatic and aliphatic
polyesters.
