New methods hold the promise for providing answers to previously intractable
problems in microbial ecology. This project will develop new technologies needed
to determine where nitrification occurs in acidic forest soils: (a) polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) to quantify nitrifier populations in small soil samples
using primers based on the ammonium monooxygenase chromosomal gene and regions
of 16S ribosomal DNA specific to ammonia- oxidizing strains and (b)
microelectrodes to measure pH gradients in the soil. Autotrophic nitrification
may occur in alkaline microenvironments within an acid forest soil developed
under red alder (Alnus rubra). Microgradients of pH and populations of
nitrifiers (by PCR) will be determined. Methods developed will be applicable to
improvements in forestry and agricultural practices as well as to the
fundamental study of nutrient dynamics in soils.
