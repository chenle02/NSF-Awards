Current uncertainty in measurements made inside incinerators leads to overly
conservative safety factors. These in turn preclude economic performance and
discourage the introduction of innovative solutions. This study will establish
the accuracy levels necessary for future diagnostics devices, if they are to be
useful in the determination of reasonable regulations and efficient incinerator
design. The impact of such a goal for the diagnostics community would serve as a
focus for the design of better instruments, susceptible of accuracy and
longevity in the very adverse environment of incinerators. The resulting
knowledge would lead to improved, economically viable designs and to a better
acceptance of these necessary pollution control devices by the surrounding
communities.
