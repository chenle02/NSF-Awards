This proposal is to train 60 high school teachers from the state of Missouri in
molecular biology. The program aims to (1) provide a theoretical and practical
background in molecular biology through month-long summer programs, (2) develop
a teaching module in molecular biology suitable for incorporation into the
secondary school curriculum, and (3) to establish and maintain a molecular
biology communications network among science teaches and university faculty.
Upon completion of the program, the teachers will have (1) acquired a basic
understanding of the principles of molecular biology, (2) gained experience in
associated laboratory procedures, (3) developed a teaching module in molecular
biology which will be incorporated into and evaluated within the high school
classroom. The program is a cooperative effort between the Biomedical Sciences
Department of Southwest Missouri State University and the Springfield R-12
school district.
