Travel Support for International Conference on Parallel Processing
(ICPP-2014)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is to request National Science
Foundation to provide $10K for travel support for graduate students to attend
the 43rd Conference on Parallel Processing to be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota
from September 9th to 12th. The 43rd ICPP conference, which is a premier
conference in parallel and distributed systems. A committee for elect travel
awardees will be setup. The first priority will give to students who are from
under-represented minority and female. The second priority will be given to
those who normally could not attend the conference. Besides technical paper
presentations, the venue offers a wide range of technical activities including
panels, industry presentations, posters, demos, and keynote talks. Attending
such high-caliber technical venues is extremely valuable for future researchers.
This award enables the supported attendees to be exposed to the state-of-the-art
research in the field, to have the opportunity to interact with peer graduate
students, researchers and experts from all over the world, to further gain
knowledge that is likely to shape the future of the field (e.g., in terms of
technology, standards, etc).&lt;br/&gt;
