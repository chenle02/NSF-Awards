In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program, Simons will study a novel
class of stable closed-shell cation core molecules (e.g., hydronium, amonium,
HFH+) with two "active" electrons orbiting in diffuse Rydberg-like orbitals
about this core. These species are believed to display unusual electronic
structures: the two outer electrons undergo highly correlated motion to reduce
mutual coulombic repulsions, and certain of their states are likely to be
metastable resonance states which autoionize because they lie higher in
electronic energy than underlying neutral-molecule states. The work involves ab
initio structure calculations on highly correlated species, the treatment of
non-adiabatic coupling, of an ejected electron, and the development of a new
analytical model to interpret and predict the energy level patterns observed
(computationally and experimentally) for these species. Because the electron
binding energies of these anions are likely to be small (i.e., a few tenths of
an eV), they may also possess states which are electronically bound but which
autoionize via energy flow from the rotation/vibration degrees of freedom of the
underlying core to the outer electrons (i.e., which decay through non-adiabatic
coupling). The first member of this class of anions is certain to be of interest
to experimentalists and the study will be carried out in close communication
with them.
