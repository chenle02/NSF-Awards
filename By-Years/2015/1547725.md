This award is being jointly funded by the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and
Materials Research (DMR) and provides support for a sustainable chemistry
symposium at Pacifichem 2015. Sustainability and its implementation are
increasingly important in the marketplace, in our society, and throughout
everyday activities. Future advances in sustainability require that we build
upon chemical and biological advances, such as the toxicological sciences that
describe how chemicals, by-products, and degradation products exert adverse
effects upon biological organisms and the ecosystem, and determine the fitness
for purpose, the social license to operate and ultimately the economic
sustainability of the manufacturer within the specific industry
sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this symposium is to provide attendees
with the opportunity to see where these interdisciplinary concepts contribute to
chemical design, synthesis, process and use. Specific topics within the
symposium include: a) Sustainable Molecular Design;&lt;br/&gt;b) Design for the
environment and fitness-of-purpose in the 21st century; c) Life Cycle
Assessment/ Impact Assessment; d) Sustainability Metrics; and e)
Interdisciplinary Case studies.
