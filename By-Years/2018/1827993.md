This is a project in the history and philosophy of biology that has very
substantial ramifications for data-intensive science. The PI will investigate
how the history of taxonomy can shed new light on the value of ambiguity for
science in the domain of data-intensive science. The project focuses on
detecting trade-offs in the value of ambiguity for scientific language as a
function of changing social contexts. Accurate disambiguation relies on a shared
background of knowledge and abilities, which may prove inadequate as concepts
spread into new contexts or a community grows larger and more heterogeneous. The
project will fund graduate and undergraduate research assistants to analyze a
text corpus drawn from two centuries of history in biological taxonomy. It will
also support public events and the creation of educational materials addressing
the theme of productive ambiguity in naming and
classification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will implement an integrative
conceptual framework enabling empirical investigation of ambiguity in linguistic
settings. It will use an information-theoretic framework from cognitive
pragmatics to quantify ambiguity in a way that is open-ended enough to
accommodate a wide range of phenomena shaping human language and communication
while also reflecting the specific constraints required by computers. It will
provide novel tools for tracking changes in language at the level of populations
rather than individuals while remaining sensitive to underlying social
institutions and individual differences. Results from this project will open new
perspectives on the history of types and subspecies in systematics, and it will
inform contemporary debates about the virtues of maximal determinacy in the
computational representation of human language and
meaning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
