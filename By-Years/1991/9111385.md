This grant will enable the principal investigator to conduct preliminary
studies towards the design of an algorithm visualization system. The end product
will be an NSF proposal. Algorithm visualization is viewed as a learning
framework for the design and analysis of algorithms. Its purpose is to study
and/or monitor algorithm behaviour, considering the algorithm as a black box.
The feasibility of such an exploration environment will be investigated from the
point of view of the novice designer. The aim of such a system will be to allow
a novice designer to understand certain key computational limitations and
constraints of an algorithm via the use of interactive tools. Preliminary
studies will include a thorough research of the literature, experimentation with
a set of graphical simulation techniques, and review of different rip up and
reroute layout heuristics. Cooperation with a senior faculty is being sought.
