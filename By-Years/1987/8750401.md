As part of a major institutional effort to enhance the Biology program for
science majors, prospective science teachers, and non-science students, this
project is providing two types of laboratory equipment: a physiograph system for
detecting, recording, and quantifying basic physiological functions, and
stereoscopic microscopes for examining and identifying small organisms. The
equipment is being used by a variety of students, from first-year Biology majors
and Science Education students to advanced students conducting independent
research. About one-half of the students belong to an underrepresented minority
-- Hispanic, Native American, or Black. A substantial number also are non-
traditional, older students acquiring advanced education in order to enhance
their ability to work in science- or technology-related employment. Most are
women.
