This National Science Foundation grant will provide support for the purchase of
a United Testing Systems, Inc., UNITED SFM-20. "Smart 1" Computer-Interfaced
Universal Testing Machine. This system will be used in several undergraduate
laboratory courses in Metallurgy/Materials Engineering in experiments providing
meaningful data generation and acquisition of the mechanical properties of
metals, polymers and ceramics. These data will be structurally dependent and
will show students the importance of structure-property relations in all
materials.
