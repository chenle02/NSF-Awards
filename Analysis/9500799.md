Wheeden DMS-9500799 The research will investigate the role of weighted norm
inequalities in harmonic analysis and differential equations. The emphasis is to
study questions that arise naturally in these subjects, and to obtain conditions
on the weights or measures which are as sharp and simple to verify as possible,
and which reflect the particular nature of the situation being studied. The
problems are related to finding weighted norm estimates between a function and
various transforms of the function. Mathematical research in harmonic analysis
seeks to study the fine structure of mathematical functions and their underlying
domains of definition. The tools developed by this work bring out hidden
relationships not ordinarily detected by more classical methods.
