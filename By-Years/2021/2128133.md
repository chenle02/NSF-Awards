This research focuses on the role of marine phytoplankton in the generation of
ice-nucleating particles in atmospheric aerosols and seeks to establish a link
between fast phytoplankton growth rates and increased particle activity. Ice
nucleating particles (INP) play a key role in forming ice crystals in clouds and
can affect cloud lifetimes and optical properties and the formation of
precipitation. They can also play an important role in the global radiative
budget and therefore affect climate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of
this research are to: (1) Identify sources of INP produced by phytoplankton and
characterize their ice nucleation properties; and (2) Identify how phytoplankton
physiology (particularly growth rate) affects the production of INP. These
objectives are being achieved through a series of laboratory experiments using
representative globally important phytoplankton grown under highly controlled
conditions, primarily using continuous cultures. These experiments will be used
to develop a mechanistic understanding of the factors that affect INP production
by phytoplankton. The hypothesis is that nucleic acids and proteins help to
catalyze ice nucleation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
