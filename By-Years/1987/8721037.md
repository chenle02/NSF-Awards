The goal of this study is to quantify geochemical evolution of high grade
crustal rocks during continental collision recorded in uplifted metamorphic
complexes from Norway. Redistribution of heat-producing elements (U, K, Th) and
of Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopes will be investigated in upper and lower crustal
sections. In addition the petrologic and tectonic evolution of mantle-derived
mafic and ultramafic rocks will be investigated through Sm-Nd geochronology and
isotopic tracer studies. These studies are designed to evaluate metamorphic
overprinting on the apparent chronology and to investigate chemical and isotopic
evolution of Proterozoic mantle beneath the Baltic Shield.
