9725360 Iverson This award supports a program to conduct experiments with a
ring-shear device that deforms a large water-saturated till specimen to high
strains, for studies of till comminution, rheology, and fabric development.
Despite the widespread realization that subglacial sediment affects the dynamics
of ice sheets, the factors that control the sediment mass balance remain
obscure. Direct measurements beneath a handful of glaciers seem to indicate a
wide range of behavior, varying from pervasive deformation of the bed to motion
that is focused at the glacier sole. The interpretation of these measurements
and the accurate modeling of basal sediment transport requires laboratory
studies aimed at revealing the fundamental factors that control the distribution
of motion at the glacier bed.
