The object of this project is to solve a number of related problems concerning
convergence of sequences, which have arisen during the past twenty years. The
methods to be employed include techniques from topology, set theory and
mathematical logic. The main problem asks: Is every product of sequentially
compact spaces countably compact? It is one of the few remaining, long-standing,
unsolved problems concerning ultrafilters on the natural numbers. This simple-
sounding problem remains unsolved after more than 20 years of work. A related
problem, just as old, asks: Is the product of two countably compact topological
groups always countably compact? Other problems concerning sequences will also
be considered. For example, does there exist a first countable, countably
compact separable, non-normal Hausdorff space? The main problem and others to be
considered have formulations in both set theory and topology, and solutions to
these problems would advance areas of mathematics where convergence of sequences
is relevant. While it is unlikely that applied mathematics will benefit
immediately, clarification of basic issues is always welcome, and a clearer view
of the real world and its various mathematical models may result.
