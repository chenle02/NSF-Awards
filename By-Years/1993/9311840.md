9311840 Heilig Development of a complex nervous system requires the
establishment of an extraordinary number of connections between nerve cells. The
complexity of the pattern of interconnections is remarkable, as is the fidelity
with which they are made. The mechanisms by which the connections of the nervous
system are formed is poorly understood. This project will employ a genetic
approach to answer the question of how nerves recognize their appropriate target
cells with which to form connections. The aim of the project is to identify
specific mutations that cause the proper pattern of neuronal connections between
the eye and the brain not to develop. The genes and gene products affected by
these mutations will be identified. Biochemical and cellular studies of these
gene products will contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms responsible
for development of the normal nervous system. *** M 9311840 Heilig Development
