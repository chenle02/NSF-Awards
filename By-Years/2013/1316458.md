This project will provide support for graduate students, postdoctoral
researchers and early career investigators to attend the Eighth International
Symposium on Inorganic Carbon Acquisition by Aquatic Photosynthetic Organisms.
This meeting, better known by its acronym, CCM8, will take place on the Loyola
University campus in New Orleans, Louisiana from May 27 - June 1, 2013. The
interdisciplinary topic of this meeting is the study of how various algae,
aquatic plants and photosynthetic bacteria acquire CO2 for photosynthesis using
carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs). Speakers will address topics ranging
from how algae will respond to global climate changes to how CCM components
might be used to improve photosynthesis in crop plants. Funds will be used to
defray costs for meeting attendance. Women and underrepresented groups will be
especially encouraged to apply for this assistance. The goal of this funding is
to make it easier for young scientists to attend the meeting and to encourage
young researchers to continue working in the exciting, growing field of carbon
concentrating mechanisms.
