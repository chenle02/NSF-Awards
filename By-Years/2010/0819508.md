Two primary goals underlie the research proposed in this application. One is to
learn more about the origins and early development of children's interest in and
learning about the biological domain, a topic that has received remarkably
little attention. The second, which will be pursued concurrently, is to directly
examine whether young children's general STEM learning and memory is facilitated
by situating it in the realm of biology. In pursuit of these goals, one set of
studies will examine very young children's spontaneous reactions to animals,
including live animals, as well as films and pictures of animals, compared to
various inanimate stimuli. A second set will directly compare preschool
children's performance on tasks employing animal and non-animal stimuli.
Questions include: Do infants and very young children pay more attention to and
show stronger emotional reactions to live animals than to inanimate comparison
objects? Do infants find films of animate movement more interesting than the
movement of inanimate objects? Can young children learn new information better
when the to-be-learned material is situated in the biological domain; that is,
can children's attraction to animals be leveraged to support the learning of
other, non-biological information? If so, what formats are most effective for
presenting the information? This research has the potential to make two types of
contributions. First, it will advance our understanding of early conceptual
development about the natural world. Second, gaining a better understanding of
young children's attunement to the natural world will inform the design and
assessment of educational materials for young children.
