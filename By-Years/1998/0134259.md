The investigator and his colleagues will address a number of fundamental
problems about the geometry and arithmetic of moduli spaces: What is the
canonical model of the moduli space of curves of genus g? Can one construct
natural spaces that interpolate between the canonical model and the moduli space
of stable curves? Can these be interpretted as moduli spaces in their own right?
Can one count the number of rational points of moduli spaces of curves, bounded
with respect to various heights? What are the natural functions (effective
divisors) one might use to specify these heights? What are the naturally defined
strata in the deformation space of a plane curve singularity? How can one
interpret blow-ups along such strata?

Algebraic geometry is the study of the solutions to systems of polynomial
equations. Geometric aspects of the solution sets translate into algebraic
properties of the equations, and vice versa. This approach has the advantage
that computers can manipulate equations very efficiently. Promising hypotheses
can thus be checked on explicit examples. Increasingly, computational approaches
to geometry are transforming the education of undergraduate and graduate
students, both in pure mathematics and in related fields where mathematics is
applied. This emphasis on concrete examples and explicit computation creates new
research opportunities for young people, especially those who have only just
started to learn the technical intricacies of the subject.
