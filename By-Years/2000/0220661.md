This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a
clinical predictive algorithm for hypertension medication response based upon
patient genetic and medical information. The development of effective treatment
for hypertension is critical to controlling costs of this disease which has the
largest negative impact on the U.S. economy in loss of productive years. Anti-
hypertensive drugs have a large window of therapeutic options, including
significant variation in dosages, medications, and combinations of therapies
used. The objective of the Phase II project is to continue development of the
software platform, GeneRx, which incorporates pharmacogenetics and nonlinear
adaptive algorithms toward optimizing anti-hypertension therapy on a patient
specific basis. Genetic data for each patient will be acquired by genotyping DNA
from the blood samples, and scored as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
present or absent in key hypertension-related genes. GeneRx will take a
patient's individual genetic, demographic, and environmental variables and
predict lickely efficacy of a hypertension medication. In Phase I, the basic
feasibility of a predictive algorithm for predicting patient response for the
ACE inhibitor class of hypertension drugs was established. The Phase II project
will use patient information and blood samples from both archival and ongoing
hypertension studies to predict the effectiveness of other classes of
hypertension medications, including calcium channel blockers, dieuretics, and
beta blockers. The commercial application of this project is in the area of
hypertension therapy.
