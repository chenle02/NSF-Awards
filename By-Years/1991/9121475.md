This award is for the purchase of 64 TMS320C40 chips in order to build an
asynchronous six-dimensional hypercube- based system to serve as a high-speed
low-cost simulator of large neural networks. The system will be used to
investigate neural network architectures and learning laws in applications where
a great number of interconnection weights is necessary. Such applications
include computer network congestion management, flow control and adaptive
routing, and pattern recognition. New Jersey Institute of Technology is
proposing a high-speed, low-cost solution to the tasks of designing and
evaluating neural network architectures and learning protocols. They will be
building an asynchronous six-dimensional hypercube- based system that supports
efficiently both local and global communications, has a modest number of high-
power processors, but is of low overall system cost.//
