Olfactory communication by scent marking: from functions to neural mechanisms

Robert E. Johnston

Although much is known about communication by visual and acoustic signals,
little is known about communication by odors, yet this form of communication is
of primary importance for the social behavior many animal species. The time is
ripe for increased investigation of olfactory communication. Scent marking is
one of the primary means by which animals communicate by odors. This research
investigates the hypothesis that some forms of scent marking a form of
competition through which individuals advertise their relative vigor and genetic
quality by scent over-marking. Evidence suggests that other individuals evaluate
these over-marks and use this information for mate choice decisions or during
aggressive encounters. Studies to test these hypotheses will be carried out in
the laboratory and in nature. Other laboratory experiments will be carried out
on the perceptual mechanisms involved in interpreting scent marks and in the
areas of the brain responsible for marking behavior and for evaluating scent
marks. In summary, a multi-faceted approach will be taken to understand
communication by scent marking and odor signals. This work will increase our
understanding of the sense of smell, communication by odors, social behavior in
animals, and the neural mechanisms underlying social and emotional behavior.
