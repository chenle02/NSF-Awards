This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar 2015" that will be held on October 10 and
11, 2015, on the campus of the University of California-San
Diego.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is the twenty-third installment of
the West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar (WCOAS), a series that annually brings
together a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research interests are
in the theory of operator algebras. Some of the foci of the 2015 event are the
following: the Elliott classification program for C*-algebras; rigidity for
ergodic actions and von Neumann algebras; subfactors and their invariants; graph
C*-algebras; free probability and its applications; quantum groups. The
conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs,
and other young scientists to present their work.
