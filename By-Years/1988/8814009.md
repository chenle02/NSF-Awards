Mathematicians of Dartmouth College will integrate computers into and plan the
restructuring of the calculus curriculum. Their approach will emphasize
elementary functions and use the computer for graphical displays and computation
of tables of function values. Student written programs will be used to
investigate these functions. Differentiation and integration will be taught by
means of the difference calculus, making heavy use of the computer. These
concepts will be used to solve "real- world" problems. It is expected that
students will gain a deeper understanding of calculus concepts from the
combination of theory, applications and computer investigations. During the four
course calculus sequence, students will develop the capabilities of doing their
own numerical and graphical investigations independently. Dartmouth will develop
text and computer materials, demonstration programs and problems. Plans for the
testing and evaluation of this new curriculum will be made during the planning
grant. Dartmouth is financing one-third of the project.
