Thermal movements of bridges is becoming an important design and construction
consideration because some bridge expansion joints have been locked into place
thus causing unknown internal stresses in the structure. This project will
investigate the overall thermal movement of a bridge structure taking into
account such factors as; placement, stiffness, restraint, and frictional
resistance of the bearing and expansion joint systems, in addition to the
continuity and geometry of the bridge system. The results will be very useful to
the bridge engineering community.
