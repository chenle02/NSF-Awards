This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
the implementation of a virtual computer environment that leverages the
bandwidth and connectivity of the Internet and computer resources available from
multiple geographically dispersed computer systems. This solution will be
applied to one of the most compute intensive commercial industries: the 2
billion dollar worldwide seismic imaging market for energy exploration and
development. This is a powerful and compelling demonstration of the abilities of
the Internet and grid computing to enhance the real time value chain for the end
consumer, and will usher in a new business approach for the energy exploration
industry, and for other compute intensive markets such as: fluid flow modeling,
aeronautics, genetic simulation, computational chemistry, astrophysics, nuclear
simulation, and computational physics.

The particular demonstration of the Grid technology will be in the seismic
computing market ($2 billion per year). This market has been expanding because
of the dwindling supply of known reserves and the increased worldwide
competition for new sources of oil and gas. The capability to accurately image
and evaluate reservoirs before drilling is fundamentally important to
exploration companies because of the high cost of drilling wells.
