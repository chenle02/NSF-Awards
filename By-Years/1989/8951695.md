This modest award provides funds to the Department of Animal Science at Southern
Illinois University-Carbondale to purchase a modern diagnostic ultrasound
machine with a video printer and computerized spectrophotometric equipment. An
educational program aimed at in-depth training of students in the various
techniques available for assessing reproductive fitness in livestock, including
diagnostic ultrasonography and semen evaluation, could have a direct impact on
the efficiency of the industry and upon the placement of these graduates.
Implementation of such an educational program is already underway at Southern
Illinois University at Carbondale. In order to maximize the laboratory
experience of students, however, the department requires an upgrade in equipment
from that which is currently available. The grantee is matching this award with
non-Federal sources.
