This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Peter A. Wehinger of
Arizona State University, Tempe, and Dr. Bruce A. Peterson of the Mt. Stromlo
and Siding Spring Observatories of the Australian National University, Canberra.
The investigators intend to uncover new information about interstellar matter by
determining the carbon isotopic abundance ratio in a sample of bright comets,
and comparing that ratio to that in comet Halley; and to determine the abundance
ratio in the local interstellar medium by observing absorption lines of
molecules and molecular ions in the lines-of-sight of bright O- and B-type
stars. Cometary abundance ratios are characteristic of the interstellar matter
millions of years ago, and the two measurements will be compared, in order to
illuminate the nature of the evolution of the interstellar matter. The project
combines the expertise of the two investigators, both of whom are experts in the
determination of spectra from astronomical measurements, and who have worked
together to study the isotopic abundance ratio of Halley itself, at the Mt.
Stromlo Observatory in Australia. In addition to giving providing new
information about the composition of interstellar matter, advances in techniques
for interpreting isotopic spectra may be expected from this research.
