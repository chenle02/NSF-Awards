In the design of a VLSI architecture, there are several choices of performance
parameters for each sub-system available to a designer. The choice of design
parameters is so complex that very seldom is the whole design space explored. To
explore alternative designs, the only recourse a designer has is to redesign the
target parts completely. Dr. Tyagi is investigating automation of this process.
He is exploring a general set of design transforms that, when applied to a given
design with a set of performance parameters (in terms of area, energy, and
time), can produce a design with the desired performance. The principal
investigator's initial research indicates that such a set of transforms can be
identified and implemented. He is applying the transforms to designing functions
such as shifting, multiplication and sorting, and finding techniques to compose
these functions into an architecture with given performance characteristics.
