This award will provide partial support for two years of operations and
maintenance of the University of New Mexico/Sandia National Laboratory ion
microprobe facility. A used, but relatively modern, ion microprobe instrument
has recently been moved from Sandia to the Department of Earth and Planetary
Sciences at the University of New Mexico. It is to be operated jointly by
University and Sandia staff, and the available machine analytical time will be
split evenly between the two collaborating organizations. The analytical
capabilities of the instrument include in situ measurements of trace elements
and isotopic compositions with spatial resolution on the order of ten microns,
and it will be used in a broad variety of geochemical research projects by
investigators from the University of New Mexico as well as off-campus users.
