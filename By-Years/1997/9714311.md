9714311 Webster The objective of the research is to develop theoretical tools
for the feasibility study and the design of a floating runway for commercial air
traffic in protected waters. There are three technical issues which govern the
feasibility of a floating runway: structure, dynamic response and mooring. Since
the light structures of shallow depth like floating runway are typically very
flexible, the dynamic response of these runways to a variety of loads including
waves, earthquakes, and the landing and taking off of aircraft needs to be small
enough to avoid the structural failure and not to affect the airplane
operations. Finally, mooring system must resist loads resulting from the action
of wind, waves, currents and tides without failing. In the proposed research the
runway will be modeled as orthotropic plate which we can use to analyze and
optimize the horizontal distribution of the stiffness. The motion of the plate
will be dynamically coupled with hydrodynamic loading from the free-surface
motion of the surrounding fluid and with the mooring system. For determination
of the hydrodynamic loads, the fluid region under the runway and outside the
runway will be modeled by Green-Naghdi theory. The research will provide
designers of these new platforms the tools necessary to analyze critical
problems associated with these new platforms: motions and structural
optimization, effects of earthquakes and tsunamis, mooring loads and localized
slamming loads. All of these problems must be addressed before a design can be
considered feasible and at the present time are no comprehensive tools available
to perform this analysis. ***
