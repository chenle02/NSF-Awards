This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project plans to refine
and test prototype facilities for commercialization of on-farm algae production
and harvesting. Algae will be utilized initially for livestock feed and in
future for bio-fuel. The project targets an emerging global market for
construction of on-farm algae infrastructure. At the consumer level, the market
is driven by favorable consumer response to Omega-3 health benefits in meat,
milk, cheese and eggs.

The broader impacts of this research are: to increase scientific and technical
knowledge of algae production for animal feed; to grow, harvest and utilize
algae strains that might otherwise be overlooked; to improve consumer health,
especially cardio-vascular health, and reduce obesity; to meet the demand for
algae in livestock feed; and to construct algae facilities which will be able to
expand into bio-fuel production when oil extraction technologies mature. On-farm
algae production conserves energy and protects the environment by using less
water, fuel, and fertilizer than land-based farming.
