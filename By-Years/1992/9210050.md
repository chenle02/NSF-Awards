ABSTRACT This research adapt and develop measures and to construct a research
paradigm that will allow researchers to investigate how children perceive
marital conflict between their parents. The long-term goal is to determine how
children learn to balance their own goals with those of others by observing and
participating in conflicts that occur in the course of enduring relationships.
Specifically, the researcher will extend her own methodological expertise to
expand inquiry in the area of social conflict and child development. The PI will
learn an established methodology for observing, coding, and analyzing marital
conflict working with Dr. John Gottman at the University of Washington, and
adapt it, as necessary, to operationalize the construct of "balancing own and
others' goals". She will pilot an interview protocol for obtaining young
children's perceptions of marital conflict and develop criteria for coding those
perceptions. When the piloting process for the child perception measure is
complete, the PI will collect and compare child perceptions with the same events
as recorded by a trained observer, as well as with coding affect and behavior
observed when children viewed the marital conflict.
