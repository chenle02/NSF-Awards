With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Matthew J. Traxler will conduct
three years of linguistic research examining how readers access and use stored
grammatical knowledge while comprehending sentences. The project will use a
highly accurate eye-tracker to monitor readers' eye movements as they process
sentences of various grammatical types. The experiments will assess the degree
to which processing of one sentence facilitates the processing of a following
sentence with a similar syntactic structure or overlapping lexical (word-
related) information. Because eye-movements are highly sensitive to small
changes in processing demands, the readers' patterns of eye-movements will
indicate whether reading one sentence speeds the processing of a subsequent
sentence. The goals of this research are to (a) determine whether building a
"context-free" syntactic structure for one sentence can speed processing of a
following sentence, (b) determine whether argument-structure information that is
tied to specific words that appear in two consecutive sentences provides the
only means to speed processing of the second sentence, and (c) to determine
whether facilitated processing occurs across a range of sentence types or is
limited to only those sentences that normally cause substantial processing
difficulty. The results of this research will be important for understanding how
grammatical knowledge is stored and used to determine how words in sentences are
related to one another. Further, the results will inform ongoing discussion of
the extent to which readers discover the syntactic structure of a sentence by
using an autonomous parsing module versus accessing and applying a wide range of
probabilistic cues, including lexically stored frequencies. A fully articulated
model of normative language processing, particularly those processes used to
parse sentences, may be useful to practitioners working with aphasic populations
and computer scientists developing computer-based language understanding
systems.
