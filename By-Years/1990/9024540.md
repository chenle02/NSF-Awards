The theory of graph labellings and their applications is an important
mathematical subject. It interacts with graph theory, combinatorics, group
theory and non-associative algebras. The study of graceful directed graphs leads
to the construction of a non-associative algebraic structure called a neofield.
Graph labellings has applications to other branches of mathematics, computer
science, engineering, operations research and social sciences. This grant will
partially support a conference on graph labellings and their applications to be
held at Northeastern University in March 1991. The conference will feature hour
talks by three experts in the field and will bring together additional leading
researchers who will present shorter talks. There will be strong emphasis on
applications and possible interactions with industry. The informal structure of
the conference will provide an excellent opportunity for young researchers and
graduate students to become involved in this rapidly growing area.
