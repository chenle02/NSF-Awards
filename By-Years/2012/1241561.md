This award supports participation of US-based graduate student researchers in
the 2012 Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS 2012) to be held July 19-21,
2012 in Niagara Falls, Canada, just prior to the Twenty-Sixth Conference on
Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-12) to be held July 22-26 in Toronto. The funds
will help defray the travel, lodging, and registration costs for 13 graduate
students as well as two invited speakers. SoCS 2012 will bring together
researchers in all aspects of heuristic search and combinatorial optimization
and its use in a broad range of areas in AI including core topics of Robust
Intelligence like robotics, planning, constraint programming, and in other areas
of interest across IIS like bioinformatics. One of the oldest subareas of
research in AI, search continues to grow. Its advances include real-time search,
parallel search, search using external memory, methods for using inconsistent
heuristics, etc. Today it is central to solving problems in areas as diverse as
optimal alignment of DNA sequences and real-time navigation. A special focus of
SoCS 2012 is path-planning, which is important in robotics and computational
biology. SoCS 2012 will include a new grid-based path planning competition.
