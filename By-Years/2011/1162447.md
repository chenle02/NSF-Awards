Smartphones are increasingly ubiquitous. Many users are forced to carry multiple
smartphones for work, personal, and geographic mobility needs. This research is
developing Cells, a lightweight virtualization architecture for enabling
multiple virtual smartphones to run simultaneously on the same physical device
in a securely isolated manner. Cells introduces a new device namespace mechanism
and novel device proxies that multiplex phone hardware devices efficiently and
securely across multiple virtual phones while providing native hardware device
performance to all applications. Virtual phone features include fully
accelerated graphics for gaming, complete power management features, easy-to-use
security and safety mechanisms that can control the availability of phone
features transparently and dynamically, and full telephony functionality with
separately assignable telephone numbers and caller ID support. Cells is
implemented in Android, the most widely used smartphone platform, to
transparently support multiple Android virtual phones on the same phone
hardware. While the primary focus of this research is smartphone devices, the
development of these ideas is also explored in the context of tablet devices.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research provide a foundation for
future innovations in smartphone computing, enabling new uses and applications
and transforming the way the devices can be used. This research promises to
improve not just system security, but also user safety; especially for young
people. Integrating this research with the CS curriculum provides students with
hands-on learning through programming projects on smartphone devices, enabling
them to become contributors to the workforce as smartphones become an
increasingly dominant computing platform.
