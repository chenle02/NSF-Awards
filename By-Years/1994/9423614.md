Will democracy survive and flourish in Russia? Perhaps no question in
contemporary politics is as important as the fate of Russian democracy. To the
extent that democracy is consolidated in Russia, world politics is likely to be
more peaceful, more humane, and less costly. In addition to the strategic
importance of this question, the transformation of Russia raises important
scientific questions. What factors contribute to the consolidation of democratic
transformations, and how are these likely to change in the near future? What
role do ordinary people (in contrast to elites) play in the processes of change?
To what degree do Russian citizens support democratic institutions and
processes; to what degree are they willing to trade freedom and liberty for
security and economic prosperity? What factors contribute to the development of
political tolerance--a crucial ingredient of democracy--and how might tolerance
be fostered? To what extent does the existence of distinctive subcultures within
a society make the development of democratic institutions and processes more
difficult? Change in Russia produces a veritable laboratory for the analysis of
democratization processes. This project seeks answers to these questions. In
particular, the project extends existing research on the political culture of
Russia through a new survey on the opinions of ordinary citizens. In conjunction
with earlier surveys, analysis of changes in Russian culture will be conducted.
On the basis of both longitudinal and cross-sectional analysis, the project will
attempt to predict the likelihood of a democratic consolidation in Russia.
Ultimately, the project seeks to contribute to theories of democratization by
focusing on the all-important case of Russia.
