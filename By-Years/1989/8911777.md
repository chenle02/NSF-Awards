The proposed work focusses on photo-nuclear physics and a study of the
photodisintegration of the deuteron at SLAC, where earlier work showed that at
about 1.4 GeV a quark description becomes possible. The study will be continued
to higher energies. A recoil detection technique which is ideally suited for use
with internal targets has been perfected and will be used to measure radiative
capture at intermediate energies. Several pion production studies have already
been made. The technique can be used to full advantage at the Indiana Cooler
Ring and at GSI and radiative capture experiments are planned at both places. At
low energies, a study of radiative proton capture on Aluminum showed that direct
capture is the dominant nonresonant mode below 2 MeV. An electron induced proton
knockout experiment at Bates found an anomalously long mean free path for 180
MeV protons in nuclei and it is expected that these measurements will be
extended to higher energies.
