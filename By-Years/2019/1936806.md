This grant provides support for graduate students to participate in the IEEE
International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering in Vancouver,
Canada, in August 2019. Students from the operations engineering community will
be able to present papers and participate in many sessions highly relevant to
their research areas, including data science, fault detection, diagnosis and
prognostics, modeling and simulation of automated systems, smart factories,
logistics and supply chains. Attending this conference will give students the
chance to present their work and interact with other scholars to strengthen the
academic community and industrial base in addressing critical needs in
automation science. By providing travel and subsistence funds, this award will
help remove barriers to attendance and broaden participation among
underrepresented communities in engineering, thus developing a diverse set of
future researchers.

The IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering is the
premier international conference for academics and practitioners who are
addressing challenges and opportunities in the field of automation science and
engineering. The conference attracts many academic engineering researchers,
especially those addressing critical societal needs in data science to support
automated manufacturing and logistics systems.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
