This project combines a novel approach to geometric modeling with modern
software engineering techniques. It paints the picture of a geometric computing
environment that unifies surface- and volume-based models to a compact internal
representation of geometry. The Spartan internal structure covers a broad range
of applications and needs through the multiple appearances paradigm, which
includes shapes and skeleta, triangle and tetrahedron meshes, smooth surfaces,
and multi-scale representations. The approach is backed by an extensive
mathematical theory of shape and space. It provides local and global control and
supports geometric deformations in unprecedented quality and generality. The
complementary mathematical and algorithmic theories have recently matured to a
point that warrants an intense effort in developing a software prototype of the
envisioned system. The goal is to make the new technology available to a broad
user-base of geometric modeling and design tools.
