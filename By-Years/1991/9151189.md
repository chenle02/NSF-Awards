This project is providing equipment (Carbon/Hydrogen/Nitrogen analyzer and an
autoanalyzer) necessary to complete a modern instrumental analysis laboratory
for undergraduate studies of plants and soils, ecosystem dynamics, and
environmental problems in the Department of Environmental Science at Allegheny
College. This program was begun in 1985 with modernization of a course in Water
Quality Analysis and with development of a Water Quality laboratory. The program
has been furthered recently by creation of a new faculty position to provide
expertise in ecosystem biogeochemistry and analytical analysis, and by
introduction of two new courses, Soils and the Environment, and Biogeochemistry.
Both courses involve field trips for investigation of ecological processes and
sample collection, and laboratory exercises for sample preparation and
instrumental analysis. An additional and extremely important component of this
program is availability of instruments for use by students during senior
comprehensive research projects, required of all students. Completion of this
laboratory through acquisition of a CHN analyzer and an autoanalyzer is
providing direct experience in the use of modern techniques and analytical
instrumentation to perform process-level analyses of ecosystem and environmental
dynamics. The grantee is matching this award from non-Federal sources.
