Theory of Interacting Fermi Systems - The objective of the project is to acquire
a deeper understanding of electron-electron interactions and their
manifestations in solids. One approach toward this goal will be the study of
physical properties which have been found to exhibit unexpected anomalous
behavior, e.g., phenomena which can be attributed to broken symmetries caused by
electron-electron interactions. Specific topics proposed for study include the
longitudinal Hall effect in K at very low temperatures, ultraviolet optical
anomalies in alkali metals, two magnon exchange in antiferromagnetic
superconductors, phonon anomalies (possibly related to spin density waves) in
zinc, cadmium, and technetium, fractional crystallization in 'optical molasses',
and perpendicular-field cyclotron-resonance transmission in simple metals. %%%
The best-established model descriptions for the behavior of electrons in solids
are based on a picture where electrons are nearly independent of each other.
Although such a viewpoint is quite successful, there are nevertheless a large
number of important phenomena which cannot be explained properly by this
approach. When electron-electron interactions become important, new theoretical
descriptions must be developed. This project is aimed at developing such
descriptions for a range of phenomena which appear experimentally and appear to
depend explicitly on electron-electron interactions.
