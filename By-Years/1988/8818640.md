This project is for the study of chaotic dynamics in partial differential
equations which are close to being integrable. It is anticipated that the
qualitative behavior of the solutions to the partial differential equations can
be captured by the behavior of solutions to systems of ordinary differnetial
equations which are much easier to analyze. This has relevance to wave
phenomena.
