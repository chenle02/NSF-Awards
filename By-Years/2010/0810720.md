This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for the technology
development of a novel near-field scanning microscope (NSOM) probe with much
higher power throughput utilizing an innovative high-refractive-index nanoscale
waveguide (nanoWG) as the probing tip. The proposed nanoWG probe can achieve
small spot size and yet with tip power 100 to 10,000 times higher than a fiber
probe, making it highly attractive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The enhanced
performance of the nanoscale waveguide tip will enable many new applications in
nanotechnology and nanoscience.
