Drill core samples from ODP Leg 115 demonstrate that aragonite cycles on the
Maldives platform mimic changes in oxygen isotope values, and as found
elsewhere, probably result from changes in dissolution and detrital input.
Furthermore, reconnaisance surveys have revealed that, in contrast to their
asymmetry in the Bahamas, prograding clinoforms in the Maldive lagoons respond
to the bi-directional, seasonal Asian monsoon. Dr. Droxler has been awarded
funds to participate on an international expedition to this area aboard the
French vessel Marion Dufresne. Giant piston cores (up to 40 m long), water
samples and high resolution echosounding and seismic profiles will be collected.
Back in Texas, Dr. Droxler and assistants will conduct preliminary studies
including: 1) sedimentologic and isotopic analyses of selected core samples; 2)
chemical analyses of hydrocast samples; and 3) processing and interpretation of
1200-1500 km of SCS data. These latter data will be integrated with multichannel
seismic reflection data collected in the 1970's by Elf Aquataine and made
available to Dr. Droxler by his French colleagues. His research goals are to: 1)
match carbonate mineralogy to observed water chemistry; 2) map thicknesses of
Holocene sediments to guage offbank transport; 3) measure Pleistocene aragonite
cycles and match them to known patterns of platform diagenesis; and 4) determine
the response to Pleistocene sea-level changes.
