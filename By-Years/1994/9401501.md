MacPherson This award supports the work of Prof. Robert MacPherson by funding a
post-doctoral researcher, Dr. Kai Behrend. Dr. Behrend will continue his
successful development of an l-adic theory of stacks. He is interested in
developing trace formula and finding further applications for those that have
already been established. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry,
one of the richest parts of modern mathematics. Algebraic geometry has had a
revolutionary flowering in the past quarter century. Originally this type of
geometry dealt with figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest
equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field studies the most complicated
kinds of mathematical object and makes use of methods not only from algebra, but
from analysis and topology. Perhaps because of this extreme generality, it is
finding application in many fields as diverse as in physics, theoretical
computer science, and robotics. ***
