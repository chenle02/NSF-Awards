Enhancing Undergraduate Psychology: A Program for Faculty from Two-Year and
Small Four-Year Colleges Prince George's Community College, Largo, MD (PGCC)
will develop and conduct a four-day workshop for 24 psychology faculty from two-
year and small four-year colleges in the mid- Atlantic states during summer

implementation of technology in psychology courses and its effect on student
performance, and the integration of multiculturalism into the curriculum.

workshop topics and a one-day return workshop at PGCC during spring 1998. Some

faculty in developing their teaching modules include: Thomas V. McGovem, Arizona
