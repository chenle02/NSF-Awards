Compressional and extensional stages accompanying continental margin tectonics
are commonly sequential and may be linked by underlying processes. Recent field
and laboratory studies indicate that the high-grade metamorphism in the Darwin
complex of the Andes of Terra del Fuego accompanied crustal thickening that
resulted from the inversion of the Rocas Verdes marginal basin by obduction of
the basin floor onto the South American continent. The uplift resulted from
tectonic denudation of the overthickened crust in the latest Cretaceous or
earliest Cenozoic. This project will involve a test of this hypothesis by
assembly of a structural transect across Cordillera Darwin and development of a
model for the evolution of the southernmost Andes in relation to their plate
tectonic setting.
