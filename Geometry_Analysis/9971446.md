Abstract

Award: DMS-9971446 Principal Investigator: Yong-Geun Oh

Lagrangian submanifolds are the most important geometric objects in symplectic
geometry. Lagrangian intersection theory is the core of symplectic geometry, and
on the cotangent bundle it is the symplectification of Morse theory of the base.
Recent results by Oh, Chekanov, Seidel and Polterovich demonstrate that Floer
homology, when defined, is a powerful tool to investigate topology and geometry
of Lagrangian submanifolds. On cotangent bundles, Lagrangian intersection theory
also provides an interpretation of Morse theory, and when combined with the
Floer homology theory, it encodes symplectic rigidity in a canonical way.
Outside cotangent bundles there are obstructions to defining a Floer theory that
come from the quantum geometry of Lagrangian submanifolds. Oh proposes to
further develop functorial constructions in the Floer theory and to apply them
to problems related to symplectic topology and mirror symmetry. Other research
concerns the variational problem of minimizing volume of Lagrangian submanifolds
on Kaehler manifolds, which is closely related to Harvey and Lawson's theory of
special Lagrangian submanifolds. Special Lagrangian submanifolds are a key to
the geometry of holomorphic volume preserving maps, in the way that Gromov's
theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves played such a role in the study of geometry
of symplectic maps. Oh proposes to study various analogies between the geometry
of holomorphic volume preserving maps to that of symplectic maps in complex
Euclidean spaces (e.g. a version of non-squeezing theorem).

The process of constructing a quantum formulation of a system from a knowledge
of a classical approximation is called ``quantization'' in physics. The lesson
learned from history is that it is hard to quantize mechanics or geometry, and
when a mechnical system is quantizable, it reveals a very particular physical
and geometrical nature. However, quantum formulations of 3 and 4 dimensional
topology have been essential ingredients in recent breakthroughs in low
dimensional topology and it was essential to quantize classical (differential)
topology to derive the most delicate non-trivial differential invariants.
Lagrangian submanifolds are the most important geometric objects in symplectic
geometry and play a key role in the geometric quantization and in the recent
development of mirror symmetry and string theory in physics. This research will
aim at, on the one hand, carrying out this quantization program of differential
topology and, on the other hand, understanding the inter-relation between
symplectic, Riemannian and complex geometries.
