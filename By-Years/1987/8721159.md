Debris entrainment at glacier beds is a fundamental geomorphic process because
it provides the tools for erosional processes such as abrasion and quarrying.
Nonetheless, processes of basal debris entrainment remain incompletely
understood. This investigation, which focuses on these mechanisms, combines
experimental studies in laboratory and field with theoretical analysis of
thermal and hydrologic controls on debris entrainment. The widely accepted
"Weertman-Boulton" freeze-on hypothesis of debris entrainment will be reexamined
by finite-element hydrologic flow modelling. Debris entrainment by ice lensing
(secondary heave) at the soles of cold glaciers may also be a very important
process. The basic physics of this process will be investigated in the context
of field data supporting the existence of this phenomenon. Theoretical work
involving numerical simulations, to elucidate debris-entrainment rates and
controls on this mechanism will be described.
