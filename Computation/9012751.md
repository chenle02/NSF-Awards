This project will focus on mathematical research into analysis-based algorithms
for the compression and rapid manipulation of numerical data. The work continues
efforts to improve compression of acoustical and video data, to pattern and
structure detection and in the design of numerical algorithms for the solution
of differential and integral equations. Applications to the study of turbulent
phenomena as well as forward and inverse scattering problems are also expected.
The primary tool of this work is the fast wavelet and wave packet
transformations. Wavelet analysis has opened the way to the design of classes of
fast numerical algorithms similar in usage to the Fast Fourier Transform, but
more versatile. Its strength lies in its applicability to problems which do not
have translational invariance and for certain classes of nonlinear computations.
Recent progress in these areas has pointed to the need for designing special
purpose orthonormal bases. In particular, it has become clear that the analysis
of locally modulated signals, as well as the study of oscillatory integral
operators requires the introduction of bases capable of more precise frequency
analysis and good space localization. Various classes of bases have been
designed to achieve both numerical efficacy and specific features. Present plans
include development of large-scale calculations which can be implemented in two-
dimensional structures (such as modeling radar scattering by a whole aircraft
including the multizone dielectrics and layered surface effects). Work will also
be done developing new computational tools for the analysis of turbulence data
in which multiscale, multifrequencey and localization analysis will be provided
by wavelet and wavepacket correlations aimed at identifying turbulence
mechanisms. Further work will also be carried out in developing modulated wave
form libraries of orthonormal waveforms which permit high compression rates for
voice transmission and analysis.
