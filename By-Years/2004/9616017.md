OCE 96-16017 Young The project will consist of theoretical work in two general
areas: Investigation of the mixed layer temperature-salinity (T-S) relationship
and development of a description of near- inertial wave propagation. The mixed
layer T-S study will concentrate on clarifying how two competing mechanisms for
the diffusive flux of T and S act on different horizontal length scales. The
theory developed in this part of the study will be tested through the evaluation
of field data to be collected as part of another recently funded NSF project.
The near inertial wave propagation study will benefit from a new approach with
several distinct advantages over existing theories.
