9505384 Fornari The objective of this work is to develop a quantitative model of
submarine lave flow emplacement based on flow morphology using methods developed
for the study of extraterrestrial lava flows. The model will include the effect
of underlying slope, microtopography and variable effusion rate. It will place
the often spatially limited views of submarine lava flows available from current
data-collection techniques in the broad context of an entire flow, allowing
effusion rates for a whole flow to be extrapolated from these narrow views. ***
