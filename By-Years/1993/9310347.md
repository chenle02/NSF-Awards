9310347 Daniel Friedman This research examines how people learn in
nondeterministic tasks (such as medical diagnosis). Learning is difficult such
tasks because occasionally a decision maker can be right for the wrong reason or
(like an expert doctor with an inconclusive chart) wrong for the right reason.
In experimental settings we will vary the complexity of the task, the type of
decision required, and the learning environment in order to see when people are
able learn effectively and when they do not. An example of the type of task
would be medical decision making. A doctor examining a medical chart mentally
combines the information from each separate symptom and makes a diagnosis.
Doctors' diagnostic abilities increase over time as they learn more about the
informativeness of each symptom and how best to combine the information. Often
the chart information is inconclusive, so even the best doctor sometimes makes
an incorrect diagnosis. This kind of task appears frequently in other decision
domains. Economists and some other social scientists use equilibrium models that
in effect assume instantaneous learning, and results of this study should be
useful in showing where these models are likely to be accurate or inaccurate.
The results also should be directly useful to cognitive scientists and decision
makers (including medical diagnosticians) who wish to improve the learning
process in nondeterministic tasks. ***
