This project will consider regularity of solutions to degenerate elliptic
equations, controlled diffusion processes, and Ito's stochastic equations. A
variety of techniques from partial differential equations and probability will
be utilized. These include barriers, study of boundary operators, and
quasiderivatives. The results of this project, in addition to furthering our
understanding of the nature of solutions to partial differential equations, will
have applications to areas such as finance, population genetics, and control of
chemical systems.
