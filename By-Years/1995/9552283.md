GA 30602 ILI - Leadership in Laboratory Development: Interdisciplinary Title:
Building Environmental Literacy Through Participation in GIS and Multimedia
Assisted Field Research We will develop, evaluate, and implement three related
laboratory exercises to support the undergraduate environmental literacy
initiative at the University of Georgia. This collaborative effort involves four
University units: Departments of Geography and Instructional Technology,
Institute of Ecology, and The State Botanical Garden. Students will become
active participants in long-term ecological studies that require them to test
formal hypotheses based on data they collect in the field. They will be assisted
by a computerized geographic information system (GIS) as they analyze and
interpret results. An interactive multimedia program, which incorporates a
performance support system, will guide them through the field research and data
analysis. The following goals are addressed by the project: instruct students
from a broad diversity of backgrounds and interests in fundamental scientific
concepts including the design and testing of hypotheses; demonstrate the
importance of spatial and temporal variation in the study and understanding of
natural systems; strengthen geography skills and familiarize students with the
purpose and use of computerized geographic information systems; create interest
in scientific research and science education as career opportunities. Our
immediate audience is the undergraduate student population of the University of
Georgia, where completion of an environmental literacy course is a requirement
for graduation. The project will be disseminated as a model that can be adapted
for use at other institutions to increase environmental literacy and expose
undergraduates, including future teachers, to new technologies that enhance the
study and teaching of science.
