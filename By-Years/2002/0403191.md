0403191&lt;br/&gt;Taylor&lt;br/&gt;This award to University Hawaii at Manoa
provides support for the acquisition of a digital nutrient analyzer for
determining concentration levels of ammonium, nitrate, silicate, nitrite and
phosphate in seawater samples. It also supports the acquisition of a deep-water
'moving vessel profiler,' suitable for underway profiling of temperature,
salinity and other water properties during survey operations at full vessel
speed. This instrument is expected to be used on R/V Kilo Moana, a research
vessel operated by University of Hawaii as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System fleet. The nutrient analyzer is expected to be
used on Kilo Moana and other UNOLS research vessels, as well as in a laboratory
on the University of Hawaii campus when not at sea. These acquisitions should
provide a substantial advantage to marine scientists in their research during
2004 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
