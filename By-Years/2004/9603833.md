This project studies the effects of exercise on bones, focusing on the two most
important processes by which bones respond to loading: (1) growth (modeling) in
which a bone increases its size, and (2) repair (Haversian remodeling) in which
bones replace old, damaged tissue. Preliminary data indicate that the relative
percentage of growth versus repair tends to vary within individuals inversely
down the limbs, with more growth occurring near the body's center and more
remodeling occurring distally. It is proposed that growth preferentially occurs
where there is a low cost to additional mass increase, but that repair is
favored in regions such as the ends of the limb where mass increases impose an
exponentially higher energetic cost and which, therefore, tend to be thinner and
weaker. Modulation of growth versus repair responses to loading suggest that
different regions of the skeleton are adapted to tolerate different strains
levels. This proposal has significance for anthropological, palaeontological and
other osteologcial research on humans and other vertebrates. Of special interest
is testing the hypothesis that recent, industrial-era humans tend to have
overall thinner bones than hunter-gatherers and early farmers because of
generally low levels of mechanical loading, particularly during childhood.
