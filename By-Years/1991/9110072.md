Developing valid predictions of the likely impacts of human response to global
warming requires a realistic set of assumptions about the process by which
humans react to global warming. These assumptions must incorporate knowledge
about human limitations in information processing and learning. This project
aims to develop a theoretical framework that can serve as the basis for such a
set of assumptions by focussing on agricultural decisions. Specifically the
project examines the relationship between individual(farm-level) decisions about
production and management versus perceptions about weather and climate,
especially perceptions about changes in climate(i.e., global warming.) These
studies will also investigate the set of conditions that provide for optimal
learning, i.e., best usage of climate (and climate change) information, and thus
also have prescriptive implications.
