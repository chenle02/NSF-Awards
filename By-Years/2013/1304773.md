The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that the transition from ombrotrophic
bogs to minerotrophic fens increases methylation rates and alters methylation
pathways from those associated with microbial syntrophy and fermentation to
those driven by anaerobic respiration, e.g., sulfate and iron reduction, in
minerotrophic fens. This hypothesis is based on PIs? observations of (1) altered
anaerobic decomposition pathways with the transition from bogs to fens in
Alaskan wetlands, (2) dominance of syntrophic bacteria in an ombrotrophic bog,
and (3) enhanced methylation by syntrophic microbial interactions. The
hypothesis will be tested using a combination of field surveys and laboratory
incubations that encompass chemical, biogeochemical and molecular analyses of
wetlands representing trophic gradients in Alaska. The educational and outreach
activities include: (1) production and dissemination of videos about the project
and climate change; (2) the mentoring of students and a postdoctoral fellow; (3)
hands-on field and laboratory experiences for high school students and teachers
near PIs? institutions, and (4) high quality education of undergraduate and
graduate students at both institutions through hands-on research and integration
into classroom curricula, including student research funded by this project.
