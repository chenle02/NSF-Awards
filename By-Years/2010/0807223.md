The READ: Recognizing Excellence And Diversity in Engineering Scholarships
program builds upon the previous CSEMS programs at UC Berkeley. READ follows a
cohort of freshman and continuing students for four years, awards thirty-five
renewable scholarships, and targets underrepresented engineering students.
Scholars are recruited from the academic programs offered by the UC Berkeley
Coalition for Excellence and Diversity in Mathematics, Science and Engineering.
READ incorporates demonstrated successful practices with ongoing measures of
academic achievement. The Coalition Directors, program counselors, teaching
staff, tutors, graduate students and READ Faculty Mentors provide a rich
tapestry of support and advising. Scholars participate in retention activities
tied to the existing student support infrastructure of The Minority Engineering
Program (MEP), the Coalition, and other partner activities. Programs include
academic workshops, tutoring, advising, industry internships and undergraduate
research. Student academic communities are sustained and strengthened by
continuing students, who frequently recruit, mentor, tutor and lead study
groups.
