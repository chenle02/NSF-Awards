Seasonal cycles of reproduction are regulated by environmental cues of light
levels, called photic cues. The eyes are not the only detectors of light; many
animals also have light sensitivity in the pineal glad within the head. However,
in many vertebrates other than mammals, the receptors for these regulatory cues
are actually light-sensitive cells within the brain itself. These "deep brain
photoreceptors" are known to exist, but they have not yet been positively
localized and identified. This work will use biochemical, electrophysiological
and anatomical approaches to localize and identify these cells in the brains of
birds that show cyclic seasonal breeding. Specific antibody-binding tests can
label cells that contain compounds resembling the protein opsin, part of a known
photopigment. Electrophysiological recording determines the responses of these
identified cells to light stimuli. Electron microscopy shows the detailed
connections from these cells to nerve cells in the hypothalamus controlling
hormone secretions. Results from this study will have impact beyond sensory
neuroscience, to issues of circadian regulation of behavior and the ecological
relationship of breeding cycles to environmental cues.
