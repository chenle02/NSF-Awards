This project is aiding in the development of undergraduate research at community
colleges by developing and delivering workshops for community college
administrators and faculty considering starting research programs. The
workshops, specific to the needs of community colleges, are accompanied by
supplementary web materials on funding undergraduate research and building a
mentoring network of community college faculty. Over the three-year project
period three workshops are being held in each of the north, east, south and west
regions of the Country for a total of twelve workshops. The workshops are
distributed over urban, suburban and rural districts. Three faculty members
accompanied by an administrator represent each of the eight community colleges
admitted to each workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interactions between two- and
four-year institutions are being enhanced to the benefit of both. The community
colleges gain access to instrumentation, library resources, and the opportunity
for joint work with faculty at the four-year institutions. The four-year schools
enjoy increased transfer rates and increased student interest and abilities in
research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
