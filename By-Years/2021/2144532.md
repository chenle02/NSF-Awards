Despite their numerous societal benefits, modern machine learning algorithms
pose real threats to personal privacy. Differential privacy is a mathematical
framework that enables designing learning algorithms with provable privacy
guarantees for their input datasets. Despite the recent progress in
differentially private (DP) machine learning, our current understanding of the
fundamental characteristics of DP learning algorithms is very limited. This
career project offers a multifaceted research plan that tackles a broad range of
fundamental questions in two important areas of DP machine learning: (i)
stochastic optimization and (ii) federated learning. The first is one of the
most fundamental tasks in machine learning and the second is one of the most
promising applications of modern machine learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project aims at: 1) understanding the computational and statistical limits of DP
stochastic optimization algorithms, 2) building a comprehensive theory for DP
stochastic non-convex optimization, which provides a firm basis for developing
new DP algorithms for modern machine learning, and 3) developing new, efficient
algorithmic paradigms for DP federated learning that offer meaningful and
provable utility guarantees, while taking into account the evolving nature of
usersâ€™ data and their incentives to participate in collaborative learning. The
outcomes of this research are expected to yield the next-generation privacy-
preserving learning algorithms that can be implemented for widespread practical
use. This career project includes educational and outreach activities such as
developing new graduate courses on optimization and differential privacy, and
organizing workshops to understand the threats to data privacy in modern machine
learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
