This action funds an NSF - Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Molecular Evolution. Tradition holds that protein phosphorylation,
a universal mechanism for cellular regulation, evolved independently in
eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The existence of protein serine/threonine
phosphatase in the prokaryotic archeon Sulfolobus solfataricus challenges this
notion. This proposal seeks to characterize the phosphorylation network of S.
Solfalarieus by identifying and characterizing its phosphoproteins.
