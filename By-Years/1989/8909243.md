In this project, the hardware issues - error detection and recovery - of
rollback recovery technique are studied. The main objectives of this research
are (1) to design a concurrent error detection scheme to facilitate recovery in
multitasking and multiprocessor systems, and (2) to develop a scheme for
recovery data protection and study its impact on the rollback strategy.
Detection of errors with low error latency is vital for successful recovery in
real-time systems. In most systems, however, the hardware to detect errors is
subsumed. A watchdog processor is used to detect errors and initiate recovery.
The technique of control flow checking is used for the on-line detection of
errors. The concept of cyclomatic complexity is used in order to obtain a
controllable error latency. In order to protect the recovery data in rollback, a
recovery cache is employed. A new model for rollback is formulated to take into
effect the use of a recovery cache for recovery data protection. The impact of
the cache on rollback is investigated by deriving an optimization model.
Analysis and experimental studies with real programs will be conducted to
validate the model and the methods used for rollback.
