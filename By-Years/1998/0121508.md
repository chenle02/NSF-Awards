This conference grant will conduct and document a conference that brings
together teams from the eight NSF funded Implementation and Dissemination
Centers and key leaders from curriculum development projects, to share "lessons
learned" as they have made efforts to increase the use of research-based
curricula across the country. These are relatively new projects and there is
great interest in them as possible vehicles for assistance to states and school
districts. The conference, to be held in July 2001, is therefore extremely
timely.

A white paper will be produced that captures successful approaches and
strategies. This paper will be helpful to the field in providing documentation
about successful and promising approaches to implementing curriculum reform.
