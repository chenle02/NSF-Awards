Conventional epitaxial techniques require single-crystal, lattice-matching
substrates. This represents a significant constraint on the development of
higher levels of integration in electronic and electrooptic systems.
Graphoepitaxy, in which an artificial, submicron-period surface pattern provides
a template for film orientation, offers a possibility of circumventing the
constraint of conventional epitaxy. The research has the scientific objectives
of: providing basic knowledge about interfacial interactions between films and
substrates and the kinetics of grain growth in ultrathin films; providing
knowledge of how artificial patterning on a submicrometer scale affects
interfacial energetics and kinetics; and providing knowledge of how film
orientation is affected by such patterning. The researchers are working with
model materials, such as gold and other metallic systems, with an emphasis on
basic studies and providing guidelines for the application of graphoepitaxy to
technologically important material configurations. The long-range impact of this
basic research will be to provide a technology for achieving low-defect-density,
single-crystal films of technologically important materials on amorphous
substrates.
