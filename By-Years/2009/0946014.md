0946014&lt;br/&gt;Raja&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this award is
to support U.S. students and researchers to participate in the 2009 Gaseous
Electronic Conference (GEC), which will be held Oct. 20 - Oct. 23, 2009 in
Saratoga Springs, New York. Support is limited to students enrolled in a Ph.D.
program offered by a U.S. university and researchers who are in need of
financial support for attending the conference. Awards will be restricted to
participants who will be presenting a paper at the
conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GEC is an annual topical meeting of the
American Physical Society, combining aspects of atomic, molecular, and optical
physics with electric gas discharge physics and chemistry, as well as various
applications related to these themes. A detailed description of the GEC 2009 can
be found at &lt;http://sites.google.com/site/2009gec/home-page&gt;. Fundamental
physics themes include atomic and molecular cross section data, plasma
diagnostics, measurement of ion and electron distribution functions, as well as
kinetic, PIC and fluid plasma modeling. Applications include plasma processing
of materials, plasma interaction with surfaces, gas-discharge lasers, and
lighting. The GEC plays a key role in advancing research in these areas in a
variety of ways. In particular, the GEC is the only US conference that brings
together members of the atomic, molecular, and optical physics communities with
researchers interested in applications of gas discharges and
plasmas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is intended to aid a range of
technological advances, as described above. Educationally, the GEC has a strong
tradition of encouraging student participation. For example, a student
competition is held each year based on oral contributions given by students at
the conference and the winner of the GEC Student Award for Excellence is given
$500. The GEC also encourages student participation by providing partial support
for students attending the meeting and presenting either an oral paper or
poster.
