This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on a novel
carbide-bonded graphene coating technology to modify the surface of silicon
wafer based molds through vacuum-assisted thermal exfoliation of functional
graphene nanopaper. The graphene coating exhibits a unique combination of
unprecedented properties such as lower surface friction coefficient and superior
surface smoothness, higher hardness and wear resistance, better chemical
resistance and anti-abrasion, lower thermal expansion coefficient and higher
thermal conductivity comparing to silicon wafers and other coating materials.
Using this new technology, the graphene coated silicon molds are able to produce
high quality and high precision microlens and microlens array in advanced glass
molding. Such products are difficult to produce in the current glass
industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this
project is that carbide-bonded graphene coating exhibits a unique combination of
desired properties including excellent mechanical and bonding strength, high
hardness, good electrical and thermal surface conductivities, low surface
friction and excellent surface smoothness, strong chemical corrosion resistance
and anti-abrasion, good cytocompatibility, easy micropatterning by cleanroom
fabrication techniques, and attractive semiconductive and optoelectronic
characteristics, thus opens up a new avenue toward engineering applications of
graphenes. Microoptics have enormous applications in numerous fields, such as
consumer electronics, sensors, optical communications, medical applications,
light shaping, and energy. Currently, most low-cost microoptics products are
based on plastic materials, which are commonly used in low-cost consumer
electronics. However, plastic microoptics have many drawbacks, such as low
reflective index, low light permeability, unstable to environmental changes, low
hardness, etc. The replacement of plastic microoptics with low-cost precision
glass microoptics is indispensable.
