Filament channels are the common denominator for the origin of coronal mass
ejections, erupting filaments and associated flares. These events do not occur
until the filament has reached a critical stage of development. This proposal
consists of five observational projects and one theoretical project all aimed at
the single goal of understanding the origin and evolution of filament channels
as a physical basis to elements of space weather.
