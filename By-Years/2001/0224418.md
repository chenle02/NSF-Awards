With the help of the Electron Spin Resonance Spectrometer (ESR) instrument
acquired previously, the principal investigators have been able to establish
techniques for probing polymer and surfactant layers at solid-liquid interfaces.
Results of these studies have already provided some new information on the
nature of the adsorbed microstructures. ESR spectroscopy, in conjunction with
other techniques, has proved to be a powerful tool for studying molecular
mechanisms of adsorption. The purchase of the Bruker EMX 6/1 HX ESR will enable
them to analyze directly in-situ the nanostructue conformation and orientation
of polymers and surfactants at solid-liquid interfaces and, importantly, changes
in them as a function of system parameters and to develop guidelines for optimum
conditions and reagents for efficient interfacial processes.

The broader impact of this grant would be that an onsite ESR facility would aid
in the endeavor of tailoring certain graduate courses to include practical
training in spectroscopic methods. Also, it would produce professional
scientists and engineers in the area of interfacial science.
