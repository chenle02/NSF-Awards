Funds are requested to support Sm-Nd investigations of Adirondack metamorphic
rocks that have been dated by U-Pb zircon methods. Attention is focused
primarily on ~1300 Ma tonalites (Highlands) and alaskitic-tonalitic gneiss
(Lowlands). Preliminary results suggest that the Highland gneisses have
relatively young Nd-model ages (~1300-1450 Ma) indicating that they represent
infusions of new crustal material into the Adirondack region at this time. The
same data indicate that this is also true of ~1250 Ma tonaltiic rocks (Elzevir
plutons) in the Central Metasedimentary Belt of Ontario. The chemistry of all
these rocks suggests that they are arc-derived, and their presence suggests that
the Adirondack-Central Metasedimentary Belt region was dominated by arc
magmatism at ~1300 Ma. The present study is designed to provide a thorough Sm-Nd
analysis of the Adirondack Highland tonalites and related gneisses whose age is
known. In addition, ~1250 Ma Lowland granitoids will be investigated to
determine whether they exhibit Nd-model ages similar to, or differing from,
those of the Highlands. These results should help to clarify whether, or not,
the Adirondack Highlands and Lowlands represent distinct terranes sutured
together along the Carthage-Colton Mylonite Zone. In addition, the Nd-Model ages
will help to ascertain whether the Lowland granitoids represent juvenile crustal
additions. Data will also be collected for metasediments and gneisses related to
the anorthosites in order to constrain their sources and evolution. All of these
results have significant implications for the evolutionary history of the
Grenville Province.
