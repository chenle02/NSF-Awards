Buchanan 95-54236 The project objective is to demonstrate that a well planned
scaleable shared municipal network infrastructure can serve an extremely broad
constituency and provide mathematics, science, engineering and technology
education and thus empowerment to a broad range of Memphis citizens with
educational backgrounds ranging from low literacy to postgraduate. We will
continue to encourage and facilitate the direct delivery of information to
populations which are very diverse, choosing particularly those whose needs are
carefully matched to resources available to us. In addition, a new emphasis will
be placed on training teachers, subject matter experts and community leaders in
the efficient use of network resources as tools for empowerment. We will train
these various constituencies to be both providers and consumers of network
information. We will convert our virtual network consisting of bandwidth
obtained from each MECCA member's Internet connection to a true Municipal Area
Network based on a single mode fiber ring which is accessible to essentially all
parts of the city. We will use switched Ethernet technology as a precursor to
Asynchronous Transder Mode and Broadband ISDN technology. Educational activities
highlighting mathematics, science and technology will take place to and from
various points on the network. Specific projects include (1) Network
infrastructure support of a two university graduate biomedical engineering joint
instructional and research effort (2) Network assisted disease prevention/health
and wellness education, (3) A training and resource center available to various
entities in the city but emphasizing teachers and senior citizens, (4) Senior
citizens connectivity and cross-generational activities involving seniors and
K-12 students, (5) Seminars, workshops and conferences which highlight client-
server and other network based activities and (6) Joint biological science
efforts between the University of Tennessee, Memphis and LeMoyne-Owen College.
Oth er partners have already been funded or will seek their own resources to
utilized this shared municipal network infrastructure. These include the LeMoyne
Gardens Housing Project and the One Room Drop-In School for educational
activities, the Mid South Community Network, proposed by members of the United
Way of the Mid South as a way to provide citizen access to social service
agencies, the Memphis Public Library and Information Center and several
potential projects involving the portion of the network serving the Medical
Center community.
