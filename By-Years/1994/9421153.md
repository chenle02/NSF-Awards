9421153 Tomsovic This project is aimed at extending new, more powerful
semiclassical methods: i) to mesoscopic and atomic problems - the emphasis is on
quantum coherence and wave-function localization problems, ii) to simplifying
the difficulties arising in connection with chaotic motion, iii) to
investigating the leading corrections and higher degrees of freedom, and iv) to
adapting the methods to stationary quantum mechanics. Finally, expertise
garnered from previous investigations will be brought into the classroom, such
as the animation of real time wave equation solutions. The overall subject
matter of this proposal is highly interdisciplinary and has consequences in many
domains. Analogous phenomena can be found in acoustic, atomic, mesoscopic,
molecular and optical systems. It has the further interest of involving the
Correspondence Principle and ultimately the interpretation of quantum mechanics.
Experience reveals a strong student interest in the combination of mesoscopic
physics, nonlinear dynamics and wave asymptotics. Conversant students have a
broad base and are well equipped for research careers in a number of
disciplines. ***
