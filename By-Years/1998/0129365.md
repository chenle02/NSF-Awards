&lt;br/&gt;In the terms of this cooperative agreement, the National Opinion
Research Center (NORC) will establish a Technical Center that will enhance the
IERI program at the level of individual projects and at the meta level of theory
building around the scaling up of effective educational interventions. The
Center will be organized around three functions: (1) technical assistance,
training, and ongoing needs analysis in service of IERI grantees, (2) community
building, and (3) research and theory building related to core IERI priorities.
All Center activities will contribute to a larger purpose that is consistent
with the mission of IERI: To bring demonstrably effective interventions to scale
in order to enhance student learning, and to more fully understand the nature of
the scaling-up process. The activities of the Technical Center will be carried
out in close and ongoing consultation with the cognizant NSF program officer and
with the larger IERI Working Group. All strategic decisions of the Center will
be joint decisions between the Technical Center, NSF, and the larger program
leadership of IERI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
