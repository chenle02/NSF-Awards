This proposal intends to build upon the research program on conventional
concrete and continue forward to study high-Strength concrete. By testing
concrete materials of strengths ranging from 3,000 psi to 12,000 psi, the effect
of increasing concrete strength on the softening of concrete can be evaluated,
and the new material laws can be derived. The proposed study will concentrate on
concrete material of 12,000 psi. By comparing the shear panel behavior of high-
strength and conventional concrete, it will be possible to identify the physical
factors that account for differences in their behavior. One of the factors to be
studied is the aggregate interlock. Particular attention will be given to the
effect of the orientation of reinforcement on the energy dissipating capacity of
reinforced high-strength concrete.
