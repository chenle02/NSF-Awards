The distribution and chemical form of iron (Fe) has a profound impact on marine
life. In approximately 20% of the world's ocean, primary productivity is limited
because phytoplankton cannot obtain enough Fe to satisfy their physiological
needs. Therefore, small changes in seawater Fe concentrations can impact the
growth of phytoplankton and affect the productivity of ecosystems, as well as
the sequestration of carbon in the ocean. Despite the importance of Fe, many
questions remain about the marine Fe cycle. For this reason, scientists from
California Institute of Technology would determine the Fe isotopic fractionation
in dissolved and particulate samples from San Pedro Basin and the Atlantic Ocean
to provide new insights into the biogeochemical cycle of this metal.
Specifically, the researchers plan to address the following questions: (1) What
is the source of dissolved Fe in the world's oceans?; (2) Via what processes
does marine particulate Fe become bioavailable?; and (3) Is dissolved del56Fe a
tracer of biological cycling of Fe?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In regard to
educational impact, funding from this research would support a graduate student
and a postdoctoral researcher.
