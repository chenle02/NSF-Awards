A new chemistry curriculum designed around FT-infrared and UV-visible
spectroscopy instrumentation is allowing students to approach the subject in a
variety of non-traditional ways. The majority of our graduates enter technician-
level positions and need to be familiar with chemical principles as well as the
operation of various instruments. They are often responsible for calibration and
maintenance. Spectroscopy applications intrigue students in many technology
fields, and allow interest in computers or instrument design to drive their
understanding of chemistry principles. Since all of our chemistry classes use
the same laboratory, it is possible to give students access to instruments
beginning with their first chemistry course. With this facility, spectroscopy is
being used as a means to introduce chemical principles and to acquaint students
with instrument operation and maintenance. The use of current spectroscopy
instrumentation also is enhancing discovery-based laboratories used to
individualize student understanding of chemical principles and to help apply
those principles to specific examples in the student's field of study.
Augmenting the chemistry portfolios, prepared for each class, with examples of
this sort makes the portfolio assessment tool more powerful for students
throughout their careers. *
