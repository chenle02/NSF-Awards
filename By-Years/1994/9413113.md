9413113 Char The purpose of this meeting, held at Drexel University,
Philadelphia, PA on May 14, 1994, is to stimulate interest in and enhance
understanding of the technical aspects of computer algebra. The meeting will
encourage those in the region who are active or interested in becoming more
active in computer algebra to meet with each other in an inexpensive and easily
accessible way. Participation by the region's graduate students will be
particularly encouraged through special invitation to contribute to the poster
sessions, and through travel support. The meeting has been endorsed by the ACM's
SIGSAM (Special Interest Group on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation). ***
