This conference is on the interface between convex geometry and harmonic
analysis. The principle lecturer is A. Koldobsky of the University of Missouri,
Columbia, who will deliver ten lectures on a number of topics of common interest
to both harmonic analysts and geometers.

Particular attention will be given to applications of Fourier analysis to convex
geometry (questions involving sections and projections of convex bodies, duality
problems), functional analysis and probability. The talks will be generally
accessible to analysts and geometers, including graduate and undergraduate
students. Particular mention will be made of unsolved problems of general
interest. There will be two hour-length talks each day (morning and afternoon,
Saturday through Wednesday), as well as special seminars, problem and help
sessions for students. In addition, there will be time slots for informal
discussions, and open problem sessions to encourage collaboration between the
more advanced participants.

Convex geometry is similar to number theory in that problem statements may
easily be understood with a minimum of prerequisites, yet a wide array of tools
may be brought to bear on the questions. The subject is very old, but is of
current interest because of the recent introduction of Fourier transform methods
and close ties to the geometry of finite dimensional Banach spaces, functional
analysis, harmonic analysis and probability theory.
