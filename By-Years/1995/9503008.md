9503008 Suki The research proposed in this application is concerned with
exploring fundamental phenomena in physiological tree structures that are known
to exist in many different guises in physiological systems. Closing and opening
phenomena are abundant in physiological tree structures, with examples including
the respiratory tree or different parts of the circulatory system. This project
proposes to: 1) develop experimental techniques to measure spatial correlations
on the lung surface during opening, 2) monitor the opening process in response
to various stimuli, 3) develop new models of how avalanches propagate in tree
structures, 4) introduce novel statistical approaches to reveal power law
distributions and long-range correlations and apply them to measured and
simulated data, 5) provide, through intensive simulations, substantial new
insight into a variety of physiological phenomena encountered in the respiratory
and circulatory trees. A long term goal is to understand how the high level of
organization implied by the power law distributions and long-range correlations
govern the statistical and physiological behavior of closing and opening process
in tree structures that are fundamental to their natural function. The work
carried out as described is expected to produce fundamental knowledge in the
field of physiological modeling, and lead to new discoveries. ***
