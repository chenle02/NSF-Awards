9415689 Rothschild This project will provide U.S. contribution to the
Secretariat of the International Global Ocean Ecosystems Program (GLOBEC) which
is an international climate change research program focused on understanding the
impact of global change on ocean ecosystems. This office will provide daily
management of the GLOBEC program including program coordination, meeting
coordination and development, and communication of GLOBEC. INTernational
activities. During the period of this proposal GLOBEC. INTernational will be
undertaking a series of crucial steps toward fulfilling its mission: To
understand the effects of physical processes on predator-prey interactions and
population dynamics of zooplankton, and their relation to ocean ecosystems and
application to fisheries in the context of the global climate system and
anthropogenic change. GLOBEC. INT will be preparing its Science Plan and
presenting it to the larger scientific community in July 1994 for approval. With
the completed and adopted Science Plan, GLOBEC will petition IGBP for inclusion
in Fall 1994. GLOBEC will then be preparing its Implementation Plan for full-
scale program implementation. The GLOBEC. INTernational Secretariat will be
responsible for the successful execution of each of these steps.
