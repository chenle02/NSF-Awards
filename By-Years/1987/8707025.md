The group at the University of Chicago, under Professor T. Oka, has pioneered
the study of molecular ions. They have used the latest spectroscopic techniques
to study the details of reactive fragments that can play key roles in reactions,
both in the laboratory and in the regions between stars. This work has yielded
much information on the properties of a variety of important ions, and in turn
has led to the detection of these same ions in interstellar space. This group
will continue these important and definitive studies, and will develop new
techniques of ion formation and spectroscopy.
