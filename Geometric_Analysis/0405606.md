Millson and his collaborators will continue to explore the connections between
the problems of constructing triangles in symmetric spaces and Euclidean
buildings and problems in algebra of interest to representation theorists. They
are especially interested in the relations between the structure constants of
the spherical Hecke ring of a split p-adic group G and those of the
representation ring of the Langlands dual group. The two rings are isomorphic
and have natural bases parametrized by the same semigroup S (the set of dominant
coweights of G). However the isomorphism between the two rings (the Satake
transform) does not carry one natural basis to the other. The change of basis
matrix is triangular and was computed by Lusztig. Thus it is a natural problem
to compare the structure constants for the same parameter values in S. One of
the main theorems obtained by Kapovich, Leeb and Millson is that if a structure
constant for the representation ring of the Langlands' dual group does not
vanish then the corresponding (ie for the same parameter values) structure
constant of the Hecke ring does not vanish. The converse is true for GL(n) (by
classical work of Hall, Green and Klein) but is false for other groups. One of
the main problems Millson intends to work on is the converse problem for general
G i.e if the structure constant for the Hecke ring is nonzero what can be said
about the corresponding structure constant (or related structure constants) for
the representation ring.

Millson's work began with one of the first theorems of high-school geometry -
the theorem that three positive real numbers a,b,c are the side-lengths of a
triangle in the plane if and only if they satisfy the "triangle inequalities",
that is, each of a,b,c is less than or equal the sum of the other two. It is a
natural problem to try to give conditions on three isometry classes of geodesic
segments in any homogeneous geometry that are necessary and sufficient in order
that one can assemble them into a triangle. In the case of Euclidean and
hyperbolic geometries a geodesic segment is determined up to isometry by its
length and three geodesic segments can be assembled into a triangle if and only
if the three lengths satisfy the above triangle inequalities. However for many
examples (e.g the noncompact symmetric spaces of rank r larger than 1) geodesic
segments are parametrized up to isometry by elements in a simplicial cone of
dimension r. One should think of a point in this cone as a "vector-valued
length". It is a remarkable fact that there is a system of homogeneous linear
inequalities in a triple of such length vectors that give necessary and
sufficient conditions for assembling three segments with these lengths into a
triangle. Millson and his collaborators call these inequalities the "generalized
triangle inequalities". It is even more remarkable that the generalized triangle
inequalities give conditions that are necessary in order that certain
fundamental algebra problems in the theory of algebraic groups can be solved.
These conditions are almost sufficient as will be made clear in future work of
Millson and his collaborators.
