The principal investigators will study the high-pressure metamorphic rocks of
the Oman continental margin, utilizing field, petrologic, stable isotopic, and
fluid inclusion methods. They will attempt to determine fluid fluxes, chemical
composition, and provenance of the fluid, as well as pressure-temperature
conditions that attended different stages of the metamorphism. The study will
also provide data critical to the interpretation of the tectonic history of the
region.
