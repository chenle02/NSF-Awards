This Distributed Arrays of Small Instruments (DASI) project will support the
development of a network of Personal Space Weather Stations (PSWS). The PSWS is
a ground-based, modular, multi-instrument system capable of remote sensing the
geospace system. This project is to develop a protoype of an integrated PSWSS
which will initially consist of a radio receiver instrument, a ground
magnetometer, and a central computer. The modular nature of the system will
allow for the later addition of new instruments. This prototype is being
developed in collaboration between multiple universities and the ham radio
community through the Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation (HamSCI)
collective and the TAPR amateur radio engineering organization, who would
eventually host instruments at their local sites. A primary goal of the PSWS
project is to make it affordable to individuals. In this way, the PSWS network
of instruments is easily expandable and can grow organically by engaging the
general public. At the same time, stations can also be sited and managed by
professional institutions, guaranteeing required coverage.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the PSWS is to collect data on variety of
phenomena - Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances and ionospheric absorption
events, geomagnetic storms and substorms, magnetospheric ultra low frequency
(ULF) pulsations, and geomagnetically-induced currents (GICs). TIDs exist over
such large spatial scales that it is currently impossible to track them from
source to dissipation. There is a significant lack of data on local effects of
geomagnetic storms as well. The PSWS addresses this through the development of
instrumentation that can easily be deployed
internationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
