This dissertation will investigate trends in occupational sex segregation and
sex inequality in the United States between 1940 and 1980 and across U.S.
metropolitan areas in 1960, 1970, and 1980. In addition, the study will assess
segregation across work-experience cohorts between 1971 and 1977. Data are from
the U.S. Census Public Use Micro Data Sets. Results of this study will
contribute to our understanding of involuntary occupational sex segregation and
as a consequence contribute to solutions of current social problems resulting
from these, such as low income families with single-earner female heads.
