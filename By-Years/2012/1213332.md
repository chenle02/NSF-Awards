Millard Alexander is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and
Computational Methods program in the chemistry division to use quantum mechanics
to investigate how chemical reactions involving molecular free radicals occur on
multiple potential energy surfaces (PES's), with a particular focus on
elementary reactions of wide experimental interest. The unique methodology
developed by Alexander and coworkers is crucial for interpreting and challenging
ongoing experimental investigations. These methods provide one of the most
advantageous ways to carry out highly accurate state-to-state calculations on
the dynamics of chemical reactions involving multiple PES's. Alexander is
extending this approach to simulate the dynamics of more complex open-shell
systems and also developing novel quantum mechanical finite-element based
approaches to treat the collision dynamics and visualize the results, portraying
the spatial behavior of the wavefunctions for reactive collisions and the
spatial evolution of the quantum analogue of how a chemical reaction "flows"
over a potential energy surface. Another research project focuses on how
temporary trapping of collision partners manifests itself in quantum
?resonances?, which can be probed by novel experiments involving collisions of
cold atoms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecular free radicals play a key
role in many chemical environments, including combustion, propulsion, materials
processing, plasmas, and remediation chemistry. Alexander's research provides a
foundation for understanding the results of recent experiments, as well as
important chemical processes in the atmosphere, interstellar gas clouds and cold
chemistry. The Alexander group freely distributes computer codes and advanced
instructional modules in collision dynamics and quantum chemistry.
