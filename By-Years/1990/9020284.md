Acid-base status strongly effects many key physiological functions, including
enzyme catalysis, ionic balance, membrane transport, and hormone-receptor
binding. Our understanding of this critical aspect of physiology is extremely
limited. The objective of this study is to develop a model for extracellular
(blood) acid-base regulation in an insect, using the locust. The role of the
ventilatory and renal system in blood pH regulation will be examined be Dr.
Harrison; these two systems dominate exchange of acid-base relevant compounds
with the environment. He will assess the role of the renal system using natural
(starvation) and artificial acid stresses. Then he will determine the location
of acid-base regulatory sites by cannulating individual renal segments. These
experiments will be based on micro-electrode, titration, biochemical, and gas
sampling techniques. This study will generate the first integrated model of
acid-base regulation in an insect, and will provide general insight into the
mechanisms used by animals to compensate for physiological stresses.
