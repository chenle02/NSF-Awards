Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a collaborative effort among
the Gemini Observatory, the U.S. Air Force Starfire Optical Range, and the Keck
Observatory to develop reliable sodium wavelength lasers for use as adaptive
optics guide stars. Used to excite the sodium D lines in the sodium layer of the
Earth's atmosphere, the laser creates an "artificial guide star" that can be
used as a point source to measure the aberrations in the incoming stellar
wavefront caused by the atmosphere. The technique, originally developed by the
Department of Defense, has been proven. The purpose of this program is to
advance the state-of-the-art in available laser power and to provide a design
for a reliable, low-cost laser that could be operated at many observatories
without the necessity for specialized and expensive technical support. The
development program will be carried out by industrial firms under the guidance
of the collaborating institutions and an expert advisory committee.&lt;br/&gt;
