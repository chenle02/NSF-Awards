Privacy is increasingly a major concern that prevents the exploitation of the
Internet's full potential. Consumers are concerned about the trustworthiness of
the websites to which they entrust their sensitive information. Although
significant industry efforts are seeking to better protect sensitive information
online, existing solutions are still fragmented and far from satisfactory.
Specifically, existing languages for specifying privacy policies lack a formal
and unambiguous semantics, are limited in expressive power and lack enforcement
as well as auditing support. Moreover, existing privacy management tools aimed
at increasing end-users' control over their privacy are limited in capability or
difficult to use.&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to provide a comprehensive
framework for protecting online privacy, covering the entire privacy policy life
cycle. This cycle includes enterprise policy creation, enforcement, analysis and
auditing, as well as end user agent presentation and privacy policy processing.
The project integrates privacy-relevant human, legal and economic perspectives
in the proposed framework. This project will develop an expressive, semantics-
based formal language for specifying privacy policies, an access control and
auditing language for enforcing privacy policies in applications, as well as
theory and tools for verifying privacy policies. Additionally, experiments and
surveys will be conducted to better understand the axes of users' privacy
concerns and protection objectives. Results from this empirical work will be
used to develop an effective paradigm for specifying privacy preferences and
methods to present privacy policies to end users in an accurate and accessible
way. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
