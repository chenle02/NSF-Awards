9526238 Ardell Several new aspects of the coarsening of gamma prime type
precipitates (Ni3X, X = Al, Ga, Ge or Si) in binary Ni-X alloys are pursued
during the course of this research. These include: (1) further studies of
anomalous coarsening kinetics at small volume fractions, fv; (2) quantitative
characterization of the evolution of the concave cuboidal morphology that gamma
prime precipitates attain when fv is small, and characterization of the spatial
correlations that eventually lead to rafting in nickel-base gamma/gamma prime
alloys; (3) investigations of gamma prime coarsening at lower temperatures (T <
550 C) using magnetic analysis to measure quantitatively the influence of
coherency strains and fv on the equilibrium coherent solubility limits in Ni-X
alloys, including Ni-Ti alloys. It is also proposed to initiate a new project on
the coarsening kinetics of Al3Sc precipitates in binary Al-Sc alloys. The
principal methods of analysis are dark-field transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), image-analyzing software applied to scanned TEM negatives, magnetic
analysis to measure the variation of the solute concentration of the matrix
during gamma prime coarsening in Ni-base alloys, and electrical resistivity to
make comparable measurements in Al-Sc alloys. %%% This research has relevance to
microstructural formation and stability in high temperature metallic alloys. The
emphasis is on binary nickel-base alloys, the principal base for superalloy
development. ***
