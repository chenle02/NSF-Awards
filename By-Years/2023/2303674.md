Topology is the study of spaces up to continuous deformation. Spaces of
dimensions one, two and three are well understood, as are spaces in dimension
five and greater. In dimension four however, much remains unknown. The PI plans
to use techniques that have been successful in high dimensional topology to
improve the understanding of four-dimensional spaces. In addition to the
research aspects of the project, the PI will organize conferences, write lecture
notes for his classes, maintain a conference listing website, write research-
level surveys and mentor junior researchers.

The project focuses on topological 4-dimensional manifolds and lies at the
intersection between low dimensional topology and high dimensional surgery
theory. Topology in dimension 4 has two distinct flavors according to the
category involved: smooth or topological. While smooth 4-manifolds remain very
mysterious, the topological category is amenable to broad classifications. The
PIâ€™s goals are to classify topological 4-manifolds with a fixed boundary and
good fundamental group as well as to classify locally flat surfaces in
4-manifolds with a fixed knot group. In particular, the PI plans to prove the
non-orientable unknotting conjecture: if a non-orientable locally flat surface
in the 4-sphere has knot group of order two, then it is topologically unknotted.
