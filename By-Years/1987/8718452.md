Much of the research at Lowell Observatory is based on two-dimensional, digital
images obtained at the Observatory, the National Facilities, and from
spacecraft. This includes thirteen distinct research projects currently being
pursued by Lowell research staff and collaborators. At present, the Observatory
supports two Lowell-owned, Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera systems and a PDS
microdensitometer. Additionally, five visitor CCD instruments, including three
imaging cameras, a speckle interferometer, and a spectrophotometer, are normally
resident in Flagstaff. Last year the Observatory allocated endowment funds for
the purchase of a VAX-11/750 Central Processing Unit (CPU) and several
peripherals. The National Science Foundation is now providing a grant for a
major improvement of these facilities to allow efficient image-processing.
