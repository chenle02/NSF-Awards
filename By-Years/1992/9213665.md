This Minority Research Initiation Career Advancement Award is to support
theoretical and computational research to expand the capabilities of Howard
University's program on electronic structure theory. Resources will be used to
expand the present program by modifying existing computer codes to include
studies of artificially structured materials in reduced dimensions such as
quantum wells, semiconductor superlattices, quantum dots and quantum wires. %%%
