This Inter-American Materials Collaboration project launches an exchange program
between the University of Chicago Materials Research Science and Engineering
Center (MRSEC) and a group of Chilean researchers at the University of Chile,
University of Santiago, and University of Los Andes, Chile. The collaborative
research addresses nonlinear physics problems of common interest to the
researchers involved. One such problem is the study of singularities in thin
elastic sheets. A second is the onset of mobility in granular materials. A third
is the formation of instabilities and singularities at a fluid interface. The
collaborative program incorporates visits in both directions by senior
researchers, graduate students and undergraduates. It also develops improved
Internet communication between the institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
interaction strengthens and informs the Chicago research as well as the
Chileans'. The exchange enlivens the research environment of the Chicago Center
and the Chilean centers by bringing bright, well-informed and like-minded new
colleagues from the other center. Finally, the exchange capitalizes on the
Chicago Center's success at developing young scientists at several levels via
their research. This award is supported by the Division of Materials Research,
the Office of International Science and Engineering, and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
