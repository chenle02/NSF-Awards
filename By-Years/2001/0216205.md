This project seeks to develop a high-average power, femtosecond laser system
with&lt;br/&gt;capabilities well-beyond what exists anywhere in the world at
present.It will generate pulses&lt;br/&gt;with energies of 1-4mJ,with a pulse
duration of under 20fs,and at a repetition rate of 10 - 40&lt;br/&gt;kHz.It will
also be capable of generating shaped light pulses for experiments in quantum
control&lt;br/&gt;of matter,optimizing EUV generation,novel high-resolution
microscopies,and micro-&lt;br/&gt;machining.This laser will be used for a wide
variety of application experiments which will be&lt;br/&gt;done by the JILA
group,and also involving collaborators from the University of
Colorado,MIT,&lt;br/&gt;SUNY Stony Brook,UC Berkeley,Colorado State
University,Princeton University,and Wayne&lt;br/&gt;State University.Thus,a
new,high-performance laser system will be heavily used for a
wide&lt;br/&gt;range of optical science and engineering projects.Furthermore,the
laser designs will be made&lt;br/&gt;available to the ultrafast laser community
through publications,web pages,and technology&lt;br/&gt;transfer to industry.The
JILA group has a very strong track record of technology
transfer,both&lt;br/&gt;to the scientific and engineering communities and to
industry.Most importantly,this project will&lt;br/&gt;also provide an excellent
training ground for students in high technology areas such as laser
and&lt;br/&gt;optical design,fast electronics,EUV generation,novel pulse shaping
technologies,and&lt;br/&gt;mechanical design.
