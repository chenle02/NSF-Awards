Understanding the coupling between atmospheric, ionospheric and magnetospheric
electric fields and current systems is one of the basic goals of solar-
terrestrial physics. Many radar techniques are used to study the high altitude
thermosphere electric fields and their variations. New studies have shown the
linkage between low altitude tropospheric and stratospheric electric fields and
currents, with variations in the thermosphere. Development of techniques and
acquisition of these low altitude data have been very controversial. This
cooperative NSF and NASA project builds upon past operational programs and data
analyses in the design of a multi-balloon long duration ( 3 months ) flight
program to measure many of the needed parameters. The ELBBO ( Extended Life
Balloon Borne Observations ) program plans to launch a total of ten balloons.
Two prototype flights from Brazil and 8 others from either Brazil, New Zealand
or the Antarctic depending somewhat on the outcome of the initial flights. The
basic objectives are to measure the vector electric field, conductivity, current
density, magnetic field,VLF and ULF electric and magnetic waves, nightglow
variations and atmospheric x-rays. These data will then be used to test and
improve existing models of the global electric circuit.
