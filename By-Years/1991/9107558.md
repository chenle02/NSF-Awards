The objective of this award is to test the feasibility of the use of scintillant
coupled to biotinylated antibodies, radioactive macromolecular precursors and
conventional electron microscope autoradiography for the detection of newly-
synthesized macromolecules. The method, if developed, will allow researchers to
follow the dynamics of specific molecules from their site of synthesis to their
destination within the cell. The feasibility test will be carried out on: (1)
localization of rubisco in chloroplasts of Lemna, (2) localization of catalase
in peroxisomes, and (3) localization and tracking of vacuolar ATPase in plant
root tips.
