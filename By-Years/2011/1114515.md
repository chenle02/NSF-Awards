LOOP is a new multiplatform, environmental project designed to help young
children, ages 6-8, explore ecosystems and understand the science and systems of
the natural world. Built upon a curriculum that moves beyond the 3Rs (reduce,
reuse, recycle), the goal is to help lay the foundation for a lifelong interest
in the science of sustainability. Deliverables include: a 20-episode television
series with animated stories and live-action segments which feature families and
children; an online game to immerse players in the same ecosystems seen on
television; Loop Live Missions (outdoor science activities); and an
afterschool/camp curriculum designed to get children and families outside to
explore natural systems. Promotion of LOOP's educational resources will be
undertaken through a partner network including the U.S. Forest Service, Children
&amp; Nature Network, National Recreation and Park Association, American Camp
Association, National Summer Learning Association, Girl Scouts of the USA, and
the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LOOP is produced by
WGBH in Boston and intended for national distribution on PBS. The project design
creates an "interactive learning loop" which cycles between the television
series, the Website, and outdoor science activities. The intended impacts are
to: (1) deliver educational media to the target audience that increases their
understanding of science and sustainability issues; (2) model and teach science
concepts and scientific habits of mind; and (3) connect children and their
families to the natural world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concord Evaluation Group
will be responsible for conducting formative and summative evaluation of the
project. The summative evaluation is designed to measure project impacts with
respect to change in behavior and attitudes, as well as science learning. The
results of the evaluation will inform the curriculum for the current and future
seasons of LOOP and contribute to the growing knowledge base of how media can
effectively promote and teach substantive science to the young.
