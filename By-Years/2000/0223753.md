Gordon Conferences have a long history of informal science exchange. This
meeting seeks to bring together experimentalists in genomics with various kinds
of computational and theoretical individuals to pose new problems and
communicate recent advances. The focus of the conference is exploring venues of
integration of structural information on genes and proteins with population
genetics and evolutionary biology. The need and character of computational tools
that will be developed will be part of the overall discussion. Encouraging the
information exchange between two separate groups is a key part of the plan.
