This proposal deals with problems related to oscillatory integrals, several
complex variables, singular integral operators, mathematical physics, boundary-
value problems, Hardy space theory, and the interrelation of these topics. The
proposal involves also intense collaboration with a group of mathematicians at
Princeton and at other institutions, including the mentoring of doctoral
students and postdoctoral associates. In particular, Professor Stein will
continue his work on singular Radon transforms and oscillatory integrals, multi-
parameter harmonic analysis, Fourier integral operators, and Hardy spaces and
boundary-value problems for the Laplace operator. Professor Fefferman will
continue working on asymptotic formulas for the ground-state energy of a large
atom, nodal sets and eigenfunctions for the Laplace operator, conformal
invariants, and delta-bar problems in several complex variables.
