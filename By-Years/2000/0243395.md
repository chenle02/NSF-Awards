This is a numerical modeling study that will address two issues. It has been
proposed that phase separation leads to the formation of a two layer double
diffusive system. This work will develop a numerical model to determine the
allowable structure, if any, of brine layers that have reached an equilibrium
configuration. Geochemical data from the Endeavour segment reveals a strong
organic signal that suggests that a significant component of recharge occurs in
heavily sedimented regions located either off-ridge to the east, or on-ridge to
the north. This work will try to understand what permeability structures and
basal configurations are compatible with the high-aspect ratio circulation cells
required by these explanations.
