This project aims to give the students a well-grounded education in the rapidly-
changing field of neurobiology. By carrying out laboratory exercises that
illustrate techniques involved in measurement of electrical potentials from
excitable cells the ideas learned in lecture can be reinforced and developed
further. Hands- on experience makes understanding of the difficult biophysical
concepts and principles underlying neural function more accessible. Each of the
6 set-ups that are being purchased consists of a MacIntosh SE computer with
ancillary MacLab hardware (allowing the computer to be used as an oscilloscope
or chart recorder), a voltage follower, preamplifier, two micromanipulators, and
a stereomicroscope on a boom stand. In addition, highly interactive saftware
reproducing intracellular recordings of voltage and current are used to
challenge students' understanding of action potentials. The project expands and
strengthens the curriculum, and prepares the students for further study of
neurobiology. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
