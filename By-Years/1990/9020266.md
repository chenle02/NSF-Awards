The last several years have seen a great expansion and diversification of
research directions and approaches in machine learning, and a simultaneous
interest in developing systems that integrate various learning strategies. Such
a situation creates a need for analyzing and clarifying the relationships among
different strategies and approaches, and building a theoretical basis for the
implementation of multistrategy learning systems. This research attempts to
develop a theoretical framework for describing diverse learning processes, based
on a general notion of inference (hence, inference-based theory). According to
this theory, a system learns from input information by trying to understand it
i.e., to relate it to its background knowledge (BK). Based on this theory the
researcher plans to develop a multistrategy task-adaptive learning (MTL) system,
that synergistically integrates different learning strategies. Given an input
and a goal of learning, an MTL learner applies the strategies) that are most
appropriate according to the relationship between the input and learner's BK in
the context of the learner's goal. The MTL methodology is intended to integrate
ultimately such learning strategies as empirical learning, constructive
induction, explanation-based learning, abduction, learning by analogy and
abstraction.
