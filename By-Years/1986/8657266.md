This grant provides support to Prof. John Cioffi under the Foundation's
Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) program. This research concerns the
digital signal processing implementation of communication systems. Specifically
much of the work concerns algorithms for adaptive filtering for data
transmission. Such adaptive filtering is quite useful for obtaining the highest
data rates on the largely unknown but slowly varying environment which is the
typical communications line. The adaptive filters slowly track this variation
and then alter the transmitted signals so as to maintain maximum thruput. The
PYI Awards program provides research support to the Nation's most outstanding
and promising young science and engineering faculty. The awards are intended to
improve the capability of U. S. academic institutions to respond to the demand
for highly qualified science and engineering personnel for academic and
industrial research and engineering. This PYI has made significant contributions
to his field of engineering and has potential to become a leader in academic
research and education. The diary note describes the rigorous selection
procedure. A grant award is highly recommended. Dr. Cioffi has obtained the
maximum matching funds, so an award of $62500 is recommended.
