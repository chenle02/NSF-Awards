This continuing research project seeks to develop a more efficient internal
combustion engine which can operate under fuel-lean conditions. The basic idea
is to eliminate chemical species which inhibit combustion. The first phase of
the research program demonstrated the validity of the general concept. In the
present work, data will be obtained to advance the concept toward
commercialization.
