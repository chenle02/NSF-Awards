Laboratory experiments will be used to measure the entrainment and mixing
characteristics of thermals and plumes in a stratified environment, including
the influence of simulated evaporative cooling. The experiments will be
performed in a large tank, using fluorescent and regular ph indicators and acid-
base reactions to optically determine mixing location and amount.
Characterization of the detrained fluid and the mixing near an inversion will
also be focal points of the research. Earlier work has established both the
techniques and the mixing behavior in the absence of stratification. This work
would help to address important questions in cloud physics by providing a strong
foundation of fundamental results for the simplest, idealized cases.//
