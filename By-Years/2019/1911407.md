This award will partially support the participation of approximately 40
participants in the "Superconductivity: Today and Tomorrow" symposium to be held
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, on March 29th and 30th, 2019.
Preference will be given to supporting students and postdoc participants. The
symposium will feature invited talks from 20 leading scientists. The aim of the
symposium will be to discuss recent progress in superconductivity, discuss new
ideas, determine future research directions, and enable future collaborations
among the participants. As a product of the symposium, the organizers will
produce a report on the current status and future prospects for the field,
summarizing key points of the presentations and the relation to NSF big ideas,
such as Harnessing the Data Revolution and Quantum
Leap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
