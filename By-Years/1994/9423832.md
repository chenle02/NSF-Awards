9423832 Zhou This proposal proposes to investigate a novel scanning method for
dc Plasma Display Panel (DCPDP). The idea is based on the use of two or more
electronic beam guns to address and scan it. This novel idea will drastically
reduce the complexity of the scanning circuitry associated with the PDP. This
complexity reduction will also alleviate the complexity of display panel design
and manufacture. When large size panel's manufacture presents a formidable
challenge to the traditional PDP structure and scanning method, implementing our
proposed method will be able to simplify the panel structure by eliminating all
built-in resistors from each display cell. The project is of high risk since
none has done such work on using electronic beams to address and scan plasma
panels. It can produce a significant impact on the large-size flat panel display
industry if this project can succeed in verifying the correctness and
feasibility of our original concepts. Such success will open many R&D issues
related to DCPDP design and manufacture. ***
