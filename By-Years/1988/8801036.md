This project builds upon previous work funded by the National Science Foundation
(NSF) and conducted by the Bureau of the Census. The objectives are i) to update
to 1985 and expand to more than 1000 companies the linked NSF/Census R&D
company-level data base and the Census Longitudinal Establishment Data (LED)
file which contains information on the output and inputs of manufacturing
plants, and ii) to conduct an economic study on the effect of R&D investment on
manufacturing produc- tivity using the linked R&D/LED data and various other
industry- level data files. Among the topics studied will be the relation- ship
between R&D activity and size of company, R&D activity and changes in plant
ownership (e.g., as a result of mergers and acquisitions), the effect of total
R&D versus basic research on productivity, and the measurement of returns to
company-funded versus Federally-funded R&D. The project will provide statistical
data and the linking mechanism that can be used in analyzing the relationship
between R&D funding and other economic variables. The results should provide
further understanding of the role of industrial R&D activities in promoting
national economic growth and competitive- ness, and thereby contribute to the
Foundation's responsibility to provide a source of information for policy
formulation in the area of science and technology.
