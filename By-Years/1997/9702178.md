Because sperm greatly outnumber eggs, evolutionary biologists have long thought
that sperm competition is the selective mechanism driving the evolution of
gender differences; males are limited by and compete for mating opportunities,
while females are not limited by mates and exhibit mate choice. The evidence
supporting these ideas come from species with internal fertilization or in
situation where sperm are deposited on eggs. However, the ancestral, and still
widespread, reproductive strategy is to release eggs and sperm into the
environment where the chance of fertilization is much reduced compared to
internal fertilization. Under these conditions, low densities of males and sperm
can limit female reproductive success. This proposal will investigate how sperm
and egg traits influence fertilization rates in the laboratory and ocean, how
common sperm limitation and sperm competition are in natural invertebrate
populations and how gamete competition can influence the evolution of gender
differences in free spawning marine invertebrates. The work will involve
laboratory and field experiments, at times using molecular techniques to better
understand the evolution of mating systems.
