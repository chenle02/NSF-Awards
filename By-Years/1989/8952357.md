This project provides the hardware for a curriculum in a technical major in
telecommunications technology within Cuyahoga Community College's
Electrical/Electronic Engineering degree program. This laboratory teaching
system employs the "top-down" methodology, a diagnostic approach used by today's
telecommunication technicians. The equipment selected supports the analysis-
based instruction and optimizes the development of a broad base of diagnostic
laboratory skills. This award is being matched by an equal amount from the
principal investigator's institution.//
