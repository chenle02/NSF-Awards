The 23rd Midwest Probability Colloquium will be held at the University of
Chicago, on October 19-20, 2001. This is a regional meeting with a limited
number of talks and plenty of opportunity for interaction among the researchers.
It has a strong tradition of encouraging graduate students and other young
investigators to attend and interact with specialists.
