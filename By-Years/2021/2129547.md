This research will investigate how brain cells called neurons use both
electrical and chemical signals to communicate. Specifically, one component in
neurons, called the voltage sensing phosphatase or VSP, uses an electrical
charge to directly change the chemistry inside the neuron. However, how VSP then
changes neuron communication is still unknown and a greater understanding of
this process may clarify how brains process information such as vision, hearing
and touch, by communication between neurons. The results from this research may
also be applicable to other tissues apart from the brain that are known to use
electrical signals to regulate cellular function. Graduate and undergraduate
students involved in this project will be trained on how to think critically,
solve problems and conduct experiments. Aspects of the project will be shared
with the public through hands-on experiences for children and adults. To reach a
broader audience within the rural communities of Montana, video conferencing
will also be used to share the project and the underlying science behind
it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Membrane potential and phosphatidylinositol phosphates
(PIPs) are critical signals in neurons, regulating synaptic transmission, ion
channels, growth and migration. VSP is the only known protein to directly link
both signals, using a voltage sensing domain to activate a phosphatase domain
that then dephosphorylates PIPs in a voltage dependent manner. VSP could
significantly influence neuronal signaling because it is activated on a faster
time scale than other phosphatases. However, the impact of VSP on neuronal
function is still unknown. This research aims to determine whether VSP
dimerization serves as a regulatory mechanism for VSP activity and specificity.
First, the dimer will be disrupted to determine the impact of VSP dimers versus
monomers on function. Second, the consequences of VSP heterodimerization on
catalysis will be determined. Methods will include electrophysiology,
fluorescence, imaging, biochemical techniques, and molecular biology. This
research is critical for understanding the molecular mechanism behind VSP,
increasing the fieldâ€™s understanding of voltage sensing proteins and serving as
a basis for engineering new voltage-gated tools such as sensors and
enzymes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
