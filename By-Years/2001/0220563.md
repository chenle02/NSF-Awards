0220563 Clarke&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data analysis and modeling will be used to
understand the interannual variability of coastal flows, particularly those
associated with El Nino - Southern Oscillation phenomena, along the west coast
of the Americas and the South Australian Bight. The data sets for characterizing
this variability include many decades of coastal water level data, a decade of
altimetry, the California Coastal Fisheries Investigation data set, and the
Canadian line-P data set. The models to be used will include an improved version
of the existing Clarke and Van Gorder model, including expected dependence on
background velocity and sloping stratification, and a statistical model.
Existing theory predicts transmission of an equatorial signal along the coast,
but not propagation of the signal, as observed. This discrepancy between theory
and observation will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;
