0129182&lt;br/&gt;Arge&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Lars Arge and graduate
students from Duke University in a collaboration with Jan Vahrenhold of the
Department of Computer Science at the University of Muenster. The project will
focus on bridging the gap between theory and practice of spatial database
algorithms research, where there still exists a large gap between theory and
practice in algorithms for massive spatial databases. Often, theoretically
efficient algorithms are too complicated to be of practical use, while
theoretically inefficient algorithms often perform well on most real-life data
sets. Theoretical developments, however, have also led to tremendous runtime
improvements. Because spatial databases, especially geographic information
systems, have emerged as extremely powerful management and analysis tools in
science and engineering, this work is likely to lead to new algorithms that will
benefit scientists, engineers, and other spatial database users. The
collaboration supported here will bring together experimentalists and theorists
in a way that will significantly advance the field of nuclear
fission.&lt;br/&gt;
