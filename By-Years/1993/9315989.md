9315989 Grove The focus of the research is the use of intramolecular trapping of
cobalt-stabilized propargyl cations to construct key cis-
ethynyloctahydrophenanthrene intermediates. The D-ring will then be appended
using an iminyl radical cyclization. The resultant advanced intermediate has the
potential of providing a wide variety of N-substituted morphinans. The route is
amenable to the preparation of optically active compounds and the methodology
should provide information as to the scope and limitations of the intramolecular
Nicholas reaction. %%% With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions award,
the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. David D. Grove
of the Department of Chemistry at Eckard College. Professor Grove will focus his
work on the development of new syntheses of important compounds, the morphinans,
which are related to the widely used analgesic, morphine. His research will be
carried out with the aid of undergraduate colleagues. ***
