The PI shall prove rigorous results about the relations between classical and
quantum mechanics. Schrodinger introduced quantum mechanics in 1927 to solve the
puzzle of how an electron can be moving and stationary at the same time. His
answer was that a quantum particle with a definite energy can only exist in a
stationary state, the physics word for an eigenfunction of the Schrodinger
operator governing the physics. The problem is that eigenfunctions are very hard
to visualize and understand. Global Harmonic Analysis is about making rigorous
relations between these eigenfunctions and the classical mechanics underlying
the physical system. The projects in the proposal address two opposite kinds of
questions: (i) how large can the eigenfunction be, and how are the points where
it is large distributed? These are the points where it is most probable to find
the particle. (ii) How are the points where the eigenfunction is zero
distributed? These are the points where it is least likely to find the particle.

Global Harmonic Analysis is the use of the long-time dynamics of the geodesic
flow of a Riemannian manifold to understand the high-frequency asymptotics of
eigenfunctions. Two of the most important problems are (1) to analyze Lp norms
of eigenfunctions and (2) to analyze nodal sets and critical point sets. For
large p, Sogge and the PI have shown that the universal Lp bounds are only
obtained if there exists a self-focal point x where a positive measure of
geodesics from x loop back to x. In recent work, The PI showed that if the
metric is real analytic, then all geodesics loop back and the first return map
preserves a finite measure on the unit tangent space at x in the class of
Lebesgue measure. In two dimensions, it follows that all geodesics through x are
smoothly closed. One project is to generalize the last result to higher
dimensions and smooth metrics. It is also very interesting to study low Lp norms
and we are working with the Kakeya-Nikodym maximal function to do that.
Regarding nodal and critical point sets, J. Jung and the PI have recently shown
that the number of nodal domains of Neumann or Dirichlet eigenfunctions on non-
positively curved surfaces with non-empty concave boundary must tend to infinity
with the eigenvalue. It was also showed that the eigenfunctions have many
critical points. In future work, the PI shall prove a more quantitative result
and to study the higher dimensional case. The PI is also using holomorphic
extensions of eigenfunction in the real analytic case to gain more control over
nodal and critical point sets.
