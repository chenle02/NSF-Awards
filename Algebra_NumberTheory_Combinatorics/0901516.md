In broad terms the principle investigator proposes to study fields which support
division algebras in their Brauer groups that are seen as exotic. As an example,
in one part of the project the PI proposes to study the existence of non-crossed
product division algebras as well as indecomposable division algebras over the
function field of a p-adic curve. The general technique that the PI proposes is
to study the division algebras that exist over completions of the function field
and use a splitting map from the Brauer group of the completed function field to
the Brauer group of the function field to lift the division algebras. In another
part of the project the PI proposes to continue to study the connection between
degeneracy of a matrix defining an abelian crossed product and decomposability
of the abelian crossed product. The PI will follow up on an observation which
she made which shows a not yet fully understood connection between degeneracy of
the matrix, decomposability of the abelian crossed product and torsion in the
2nd Chow group of the associated Severi-Brauer variety. Lastly, the PI proposes
to study fields for which division algebras of small degree over that field can
be distinguished by their splitting fields. In particular, the PI will consider
this question over function fields of K3 surfaces.

The origins of division algebras can be traced back to Hamilton's discovery of
the quaternions in 1843. Hamilton constructed his quaternion algebra to
generalize the complex numbers and apply it to mechanics in three dimensional
space. Since this discovery, quaternion algebras have been generalized to finite
dimensional division algebras over a field, Azumaya algebras over a ring, and
even sheaves of Azumaya algebras over a scheme. In each case the isomorphism
classes of the objects are in 1-1 correspondence with a group, the Brauer group.
Along the way the study of these algebras has involved many mathematical tools
including Galois cohomology, valuation theory, number theory and algebraic
geometry, just to name a few. The types of division algebras that exist over a
given field can be seen as a measure of complexity or robustness of the field.
In this project the PI proposes to study this complexity by considering the
types of division algebras that exist over particular fields.
