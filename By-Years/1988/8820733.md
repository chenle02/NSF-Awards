The objective of this research is to develop a broad conceptual framework for
the automated solution of tolerancing problems in computer-aided design. The
mathematical basis for this framework will be a tolerance representation in
which tolerances are expressed as constraints on a normed vector space of model
variations. The results of this research will show that this vector space
formulation provides a basis for the development of tractable mathematical
models of the tolerance analysis and synthesis problems. An efficient
computational framework will be developed for the automated solution of these
mathematical models, based on solid modeling technology. This work is innovative
because no prior research has developed a conceptual framework for the automated
solution of tolerancing problems. Since the establishment of such a framework
has implications for industrial competitiveness across a broad spectrum of
manufacturing enterprises, it is important that this work proceed as soon as
possible.
