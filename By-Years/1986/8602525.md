Niobium and some of its alloys exhibit superconductivity. They are of great
interest for power generation, propulsion devices, fusion research and
electronic devices. Other potential applications include ultrasensitive magnetic
sensors, high field magnets for fusion energy, medical equipment, magnetically
levitated vehicles, and high-speed computers. Due to increasing use, the demand
for ultra high purity niobium is expected to grow significantly in the near
future. This research addresses the viability of electromagnetic levitation for
producing ultra pure niobium economically and of the purity required.
