This award supports travel and expenses for participants in the tenth Latin
American Congress on Probability and Statistics, to be held in Lima, Peru in
March 2007. The main objectives of the conference are: . To contribute to the
development of probability and statistics in Latin America. . To facilitate the
interaction between scientists from the U.S. and Europe and their colleagues in
Latin America. . To provide a valuable experience for talented scientists who
have few opportunities to attend conferences outside their region.

Eight distinguished U.S. based researchers will participate in the conference as
invited speakers. The award will also provide travel support fourteen young
researchers; eight from the U.S. and six from Latin America. Peru has offered to
host this year's conference as a means of encouraging its young researchers to
increase the level of research activity and education in the mathematical
sciences. The National Science Foundation has supported this conference series
since 1990, when the congress was held in Mexico.
