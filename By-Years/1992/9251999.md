This project adds optical systems and optical communication to the electro-
optics curriculum laboratory in the Electronic Engineering Technology program at
Portland Community College to meet the demands of a growing electro-optics
industry. The equipment consists of low-power helium neon and diode lasers,
optical work benches with precision translation stages, photometers,
monochrometers and related optics, fiber optics and mounting hardware for twelve
experimental stations and one optical time domain reflectometer. This addition
allows students to acquire many of the skills an electronics technician needs to
function effectively in a modern electro- optic environment that uses lasers and
fiber optics. The improved curriculum is designed so that through the
measurement of laser and fiber characteristics, the student verifies fundamental
optical principles and obtains the practical optical skills required.
