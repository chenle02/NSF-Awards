This award supports the participation of graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers in the 24th Shanks Conference on Mathematical Modeling in the
Medical Sciences, held in conjunction with the Atlantic Coast Symposium on the
Mathematical Sciences in Biology and Biomedicine (ACSMSBB) during May 18?21,
2009. The conference brings together leading researchers devoted to advancing
interdisciplinary efforts at the interface of the quantitative, biological, and
biomedical sciences to address key challenges in biology and medicine. This
conference emphasizes work in:

* Models of Cancer Growth * Models of Epidemics & Infection * Models of
Physiologic Systems and Clinical Practice * Medical Imaging

The meeting encourages and supports participation of young researchers and
members of groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.
