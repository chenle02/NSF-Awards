This award provides one-half the funding needed to acquire and install a modern
cryogenic rock magnetometer in the Department of Marine Geology and Geophysics
at the Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Sciences of the University
of Miami. The remaining funds necessary will be provided by the University of
Miami, which is committed to establishing a paleomagnetism research laboratory.
The new instrument will be used primarily to investigate the origin of
magnetization of organic matter in sediments and its application to
magnetostratigraphy (precise dating of sediment layers by their location in a
calibrated sequence of magnetization cycles).
