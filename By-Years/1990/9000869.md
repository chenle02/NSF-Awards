Professor Leonard W. Fine and other members of the Chemistry Department of
Columbia University are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1990-92, ten (10)
undergraduate students will spend ten (10) weeks each summer actively engaged in
a variety of research projects. Projects range from synthesis of natural
products and pulsed laser investigation of reaction intermediates to study of
surface reactions in catalysis. Interaction between these student participants
and high school seniors participating in the Columbia University Summer Science
Program are encouraged.
