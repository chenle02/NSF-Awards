The Georgia Topology Conference is an annual conference that has been organized
by several generations of topologists at the University of Georgia for well over
forty years. The conference has focused on many areas of topology including
hyperbolic geometry, laminations, foliations, 4-manifolds, 3-manifold
invariants, symplectic topology and contact topology. The conference features
emerging areas of research in topology. Typically our conferences feature a
several senior researchers and a large group of young researchers, mostly recent
Ph.D.'s and some graduate students. This format, with its attention to emerging
areas of research, helps this conference play a significant role in both
disseminating the newest research and preparing graduate students and postdocs
for a successful research career in mathematics. We encourage and fund
participation by members of underrepresented groups. Our participants and
organizers have included many women.

Topology can be viewed as the study of the structure and shape of the space we
live in. As such there are deep relationships between topology, geometry, and
physics. It is this diversity of approaches to central problems that has always
energized research in topology. More information can be found on the conference
