Proposed research is motivated from the discrimination task with high dimension,
low sample size data. The investigator studies the intrinsic difficulties of the
discrimination problem by exploring asymptotic geometric structure of such data.
Three main activities are proposed: a) the asymptotic inconsistency of leave-
one-out cross-validation. The study is expected to explain why it shall fail
when the number of variables greatly exceeds the number of observations; b) the
effect of the relationship between the dimensionality and the sample size on the
difficulty of discrimination task; c) a discriminant direction vector that only
exists for the data with high dimension, low sample size. The data points
collapse on this direction vector and also are most separated by group labels.
The investigator explores its various theoretical and empirical properties such
as its optimality, uniqueness, and asymptotic performances.

Even though these topics are loosely related one another in their technical
aspects, their goals are essentially the same: exploring the nontraditional and
unique challenges in high dimension, low sample size discrimination. While it
has been an actively researched area over recent years, however, understanding
fundamental challenges of high dimension, low sample size problems is yet
satisfactory. This research approaches this problem in a way that may be
regarded atypical in a traditional sense, but is more relevant to the problem
itself. The applications of proposed research include text document
classification such as Spam email filter, medical imaging such as functional
magnetic resonance imaging, and bioinformatics such as microarray gene
expression and proteomics.
