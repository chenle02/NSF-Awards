9311806 Shafit-Zagardo A neuron has numerous processes, axons and dendrites,
which allows each neuron to communicate with other neurons. The cytoskeleton of
a neuron is essential for maintaining these processes. Microtubule-associated
proteins are a highly specialized family of cytoskeletal proteins found in the
processes of neurons. The major microtubule-associated protein found in
dendrites is MAP-2. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter molecule that functions in
signaling between neurons. Receptors for glutamate are present in the dendrites
of many neurons and when activated, they trigger a series of changes within the
neuron such as increases in calcium and modulation of certain intracellular
messengers. These changes can result in changes in the architecture of the
dendrites. This project will test the hypothesis that activation of the
glutamate receptor results in changes in MAP-2, which ultimately results in
changes in the form of the neuron. The results from this study will supply
insights into the mechanisms responsible for development of specific patterns of
connections between cells in the nervous system. *** te with ot ! ! F v v 8
