This award is for the purchase of computer equipment to enhance the existing
UNIDATA program within the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia
Institute of Technology. Specifically existing workstations will be upgraded and
the a PC for classroom presentation will be acquired. This upgrade will provide
UNIDATA capabilities to faculty and students throughout the university through
the campus LAN. The UNIDATA system will be used for research and teaching in
about equal proportions. Examples of research studies that will use the UNIDATA
software are: the generation and propagation of tropospheric gravity waves and
Atmospheric Boundary Layer Experiment Ozone and Trace-Gas Field Program. Also,
this equipment award will better enable the PIs to educate graduate students in
the meteorological sciences and attract and retain undergraduates to a career in
the sciences.
