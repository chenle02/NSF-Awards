9528953 Palffy-Muhoray Support for this conference on Dynamica and Defects in
Liquid Crystals will make possible the full participation of young researchers
and established scientists working in the field of liquid crystals. The
conference aims to establish the current state-of-understanding of dynamics and
defects in liquid crystals by relating recent theoretical developments and
experimental results. The relevance of the results for the new generation of
liquid crystal displays will be determined, and key outstanding problems and
future research directions will be emphasized. %%% This conference will bring
together scientists working in an area of considerable national importance.
Materials areas related to liquid crystals for displays is of high priority, and
this group will address interdisciplinary problems that range from fundamental
science to manufacturing issues. ***
