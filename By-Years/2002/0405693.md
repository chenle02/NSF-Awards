McClure proposes to build on prior work with Jeff Smith which allows several
important operads and their actions to be investigated combinatorially
(specifically, cosimplicially). One direction, which is already partially
completed, is to relate our work to that of Chas and Sullivan. Expected results
in this direction are: the Chas-Sullivan operations are induced by a chain-level
action of the framed little 2-disks operad (this is an analogue of Deligne's
Hochschild cohomology conjecture) and the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence
converging to the homology of the free loop space of a compact oriented PL
manifold is a spectral sequence of Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras. Another problem
which may be accessible by these methods is Kontsevich's ``higher Deligne
conjecture.'' A longer-term goal is to combine Mandell's theorem that E-infinity
chain algebras model topological spaces with our combinatorial E-infinity chain
operads to obtain explicit results.

An interesting development in theoretical physics during the last twenty years
has been the increasing significance of homotopy theory. It seems to be useful
to create chain-complex models for quantum field theories, both as a preliminary
step toward the full development of such theories and as a permanent
computational device. Operads have played an important role as an organizational
tool for this kind of work. Recently Chas and Sullivan have shown that the
unbased loop space of any compact oriented PL manifold is a quantum field theory
at the level of homology; this raises the question of whether their work can be
lifted to the chain-complex level and whether it is related to an operad action
(specifically, to an action of the framed little disks operad). Techniques
developed by McClure and Smith are well-adapted to this question, and this is
one of the directions that McClure intends to pursue.
