This proposal is to provide funding for the three annual meetings on Geometric
Group Theory on the Gulf Coast (abbreviated G^3). The next conference will be
held in Panama City, FL on March 24-27th of 2011. Last decade have seen intense
interactions and cross-fertilization of geometric group theory with other parts
of mathematics such as asymptotic and coarse geometry, operator algebras and
Novikov type conjectures, analysis and dynamics on group boundaries, discrete
groups and nonpositively curved spaces. These are separate fields yet they
increasingly borrow techniques, examples, and insights from each other, and
their richness and interplay feeds back to the geometric group theory, and
provides strong motivation for its development. The intellectual goal of the
conference is to assemble researchers from these neighboring fields, so they can
share ideas and expertise while interacting with students and junior
mathematicians.

The G^3 conference focuses on interactions of geometric group theory with other
parts of mathematics. G^3 has been held annually since 1998 at various places on
the Gulf Coast, and it has become an established and popular international
meeting. Over the years a great many different people attended G^3, and it has
become well-known for a unique friendly atmosphere which helped foster
interactions of established and junior mathematicians, jump-start careers and
collaborations, and build the sense of community in geometric group theory. More
