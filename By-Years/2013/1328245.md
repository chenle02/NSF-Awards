Drs Craig Hadley (Emory University) and Edward Stevenson (University College
London) will undertake research to advance understanding of the effects of local
ecology on human well-being. Their research focuses on communities which are
undergoing resettlement and a transition from agro-pastoralism to more intensive
agriculture as part of a regional development scheme. This scheme will alter
local ecology by enabling irrigation through newly built canals, but will
constrain access to grazing land and alter seasonal population movements. Using
surveys, interviews, and ethnographic methods, the study will lay the groundwork
for later follow-up to answer three questions: (1) How do changes in local
ecology affect food security, water security, and mental health? (2) Is later
well-being better predicted by prior social status (e.g. gender and education)
or economic status (household wealth)? (3) Do investments in education and
medical services compensate for the stresses of relocation and greater
population density, in terms of improving community health?

This study will bring together researchers from public health and anthropology.
It contributes to establishing a longitudinal research project that will assess
food security and community health during momentous ecological and social
changes. The effects of such changes on mental health are particularly important
to document.

The project stands to contribute to policy regarding resettlement, especially
with regard to populations reliant on livestock herding. Pastoralist communities
occupy approximately 50% of the land area of East Africa, but constitute only
10% of the population; state economic development initiatives are increasingly
targeting such land for alternative uses, with important implications for local
livelihoods. Longitudinal research on food security and community health should
help to inform best practice in resettlement programs.
