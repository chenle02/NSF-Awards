Greenberg 9312929 Spirochetes are a phylogenetically ancient group of bacteria.
These organisms have a unique overall cell surface structure and mode of
motility, but their special cellular properties have not previously been studied
extensively because of difficulties encountered in growing cells under
laboratory conditions. However, because of recent advances in our understanding
of the molecular and genetic properties of the cells brought about by modern
technological advances, an ongoing conference to bring investigators together to
exchange information is of major importance. This is the first Gordon Research
Conference on the biology of the spirochetes. The conference is anticipated to
have 110-135 attendees and will take place January 2-7, 1994 in Ventura,
California. ***
