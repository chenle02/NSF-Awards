This project addresses two major needs. First, while the university's computing
power is high and maintained by an excellent Academic Computing staff, use of
computers for mathematics instruction has been limited to calculus and the
Computers in Elementary/Middle School Mathematics course. Second, a Concepts of
Calculus course for prospective middle school teachers has not been taught at
the university since 1985. This project addresses these needs with the purchase
of 24 IBM notebook computers, a wheeled rack to store and transport the
computers, and appropriate software. This computer-lab-on-wheels can be wheeled
to any classroom in the building. An `Access Point` mounted on the rack allows
the notebook computers to communicate, by wireless connection, with the campus
network (LAN), as the Access Point is plugged into a LAN hookup in the wall. The
computer lab on wheels serves two purposes: to create widespread (but not
necessarily intensive) use of computer technology for classroom instruction and
to be used extensively in the Concepts of Calculus course. Furthermore, to
provide `bench lab/hands-on` experiences in the Concepts of Calculus course,
this project involves purchase of Lego dacta Technology Building Sets and
Control Labs. This equipment enables students to build working models with
wheels, gears, and motors that can be controlled by the computer. Data
acquisition devices on the models send information to the computer for analysis.
The rack of computers is being housed in the department's Mathematics Education
Resource Office, where faculty members may check it out for classroom use and
students may check out computers for use in the office when the rack is not
being used elsewhere. The paradigm of a shared computer lab on wheels may be an
attractive solution for many other universities and public schools.
