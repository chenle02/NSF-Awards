Plasma discharges are widely used in the semiconductor industry for etching and
deposition processes; moreover, their use has become critical for very large
scale integrated circuit (VLSI) production. Inductively coupled plasma sources
and other high density plasma sources will play in increasing role in processing
as feature sizes shrink. U.S. equipment manufacturers are playing a leading role
in developing inductive discharges, with the first commercial product released
in summer, 1992. This work is for research on inductive r.f. discharges and
their application to thin film materials processing. The program involves (a)
the development of self-consistent analytical models and measurements for low
pressure, high-density inductively coupled plasma sources; and (b) the
development of analytical models and measurements for determining the uniformity
properties of inductively driven r.f. source plasmas injected into materials
processing reactor chambers. Etching (dry pattern transfer) of surface imaged
photoresists using oxygen plasma discharges will be applied to characterize the
materials processing capabilities of the inductive source.
