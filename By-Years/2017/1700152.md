Los Angeles Mission College (LAMC) will prepare community college and high
school students for jobs in biotechnology. The new programs developed will
explicitly address skill development and offer students counseling, tutoring,
industry field trips, external speakers, and internship opportunities. Combined
with excellent instruction in the classroom, these activities will prepare
students for entry-level, middle-skill technician positions. LAMC serves a large
underrepresented student body and will provide these students with employment
opportunities in a high growth sector that needs a skilled workforce. Project
evaluation will focus on measuring student progression, success, retention, and
degree attainment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LAMC will develop new academic pathways
and curricula in biotechnology leading to stackable certificates and an
Associate of Science degree. Stackable credentials will prepare students to
enter the workforce in a short period of time while retaining the opportunity to
pursue higher degrees at a later date. It will also allow for flexibility that
will contribute to student retention and success. The project will provide high
school students an opportunity to earn college credit and credentials that will
ultimately assist them in obtaining employment.
