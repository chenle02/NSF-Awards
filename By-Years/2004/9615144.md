This grant, to an Ohio University faculty member, supports her work at TRIUMF in
an ongoing precision measurement of charge symmetry breaking in neutron-proton
inelastic scattering. It will also enable her to begin a collaboration at
Brookhaven National Laboratory to carry out sum rule measurements of the spin-
dependent Compton amplitude through measurements of the photodisintegration of
the proton and neutron from pion threshold to 470 MeV.
