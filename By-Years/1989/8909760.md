This research addresses the issue of computer integrated manufacturing system
control by investigating the basic needs associated with developing and
implementing real-time scheduling and control decision making tools for the
environment. The objective is to study the integration of real-time
manufacturing system status data with a computer simulation model of the system
to develop an effective and efficient tool to evaluate real-time system
scheduling and control decision alternatives. The emphasis is upon creating a
"look-ahead" capability to aid in assessing the long-term system performance
impact resulting from decisions made in real-time. The investigation includes
implementation issues that are essential for successfully making the physical
link between an actual operating system and a real- time simulation to be used
for intelligent real-time system control. This research will also provide basic
insight into the system control problems in computer integrated manufacturing
systems, and it will impact a key industrial concern for intelligent real-time
control decisions. This is an important link for achieving truly integrated
systems.
