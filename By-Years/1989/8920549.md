The evaluation component of the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
Program requires the evaluation to write a historical profile for each center
each year. Because of the many different formats and structures used by the
evaluators in writing the historical documents, a rigorous cross-site analysis
of the historical profile protocol and structure was designed. This study
addresses a cross-site analysis of the first wave of data collected from this
revised historical profiles. The study will; 1) assess the ease of use, time
requirements, comprehensiveness, local utility and other implementation issues
of the revised historical profiles, 2) summarize the major themes and findings
in each of the historical profiles sections to assess the ability to do cross-
site analysis and 3) use the database to answer specific questions about Center
operations and outcomes. The Principal Investigator and other researchers are
recognized experts in evaluation theories and protocol. The Program Manger
recommends that Dr. Craig Blakely be awarded $14,440 for one (1) year for this
project.
