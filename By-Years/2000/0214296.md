The military is the single largest employer of young men in the United States,
and military recruitment is an often hotly debated topic centering on issues
such as access, equality of representation by race and gender, and
transferability of training to the civilian labor market. This project examines
the determinants and consequences of military service by studying varied
interrelationships between military service and numerous life-course outcomes.
The PIs will investigate several possible explanations for observed effects of
military services. First, men who serve in the military may be a select group
who would otherwise be expected to vary in their life-course transitions.
Second, military service alters the roles and responsibilities of young men for
extended periods of time, often subjecting them to stressful and unfamiliar
environments. Such may lead to lasting differences in life-course patterns.
Third, military service ma have an impact on subsequent life-course events by
interrupting other events in the life course.

Three nationally representative databases: The National Longitudinal Study of
Mature Men, The National Longitudinal Study of Young Men, and the National
Longitudinal Study of Youth, will be analyzed. These will allow the
investigators to identify differential characteristics of young men, who enter
the military, to untangle and model the life course processes by which military
service affects subsequent life-course evens, and to determine how these
processes might have changed from World War II through the Vietnam era and AVF.
The project will contribute to our understanding of the processes by which
military service affects the fluid, and often disorderly, life-course
experiences of young men.
