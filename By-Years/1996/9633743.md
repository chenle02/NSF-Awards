This project engages the study of the dynamics of political preferences through
the vehicle of a large multi-investigator cooperative survey. Thirteen research
teams and twenty investigators are drawn together under the umbrella of this
"group" project to conduct a series of experiments within a single national
probability survey. Experiments focus on uncertainty and ambivalence as sources
of response variability; the role of issue salience in immunizing individuals
against persuasive messages; judgments about the fairness of racial
representation as a function of group conflict and racial attributions; the
connection between preferences for policies to help disadvantaged groups and
perceptions of the social conditions of those groups; the role of political
institutions in shaping the dynamics of persuasion; the group specific character
of political tolerance; the framing of issues by elites; the impact of public
mood and emotional awareness of policy judgments; the dynamics of candidate
credibility and persuasion in campaigns; the interplay of issue framing and
deliberation; the connection between situational threats and tolerance; the
interaction of social conditions, value priorities, and issue salience in
conditioning egalitarian commitments; and the disentangling of opinion, non-
opinion, and guessing. Each component study is independently conceived and
executed. But the component studies all make contributions to the cumulative
impact of the overall study. The multi-investigator survey provides a means for
the cost-efficient implementation of a large number of research projects within
the scope of a common survey instrument and serves as a model for collaboration
among scholars.
