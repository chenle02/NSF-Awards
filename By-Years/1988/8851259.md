This award to the University of Connecticut's Department of Geology and
Geophysics is made in response to a proposal submitted to the National Science
Foundation's Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program. The award will
provide one-half of the funds needed to acquire energy-dispersive detection and
analysis systems for use with an electron microprobe x-ray analyzer and an x-ray
fluorescence spectrometer. The University is committed to matching the NSF
contribution for this equipment. The equipment will be used in a University
undergraduate course in petrology, where it will be incorporated in a series of
hands-on laboratory exercises in modern geochemical analytical techniques.
