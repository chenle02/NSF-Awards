The earliest phase of nervous system development is characterized by large
scale movements of cells. First, these cells must separate from the outer layer
of the early embryo; secondly, they must obtain specific positions within the
embryo. To reach these positions, the cells in many cases must migrate
considerable distances. Upon reaching their proper location, they become
stationary and form stable contacts with each other. It is of great importance
to understand on a molecular level how these cellular processes are controlled.
This project will use the embryonic optic lobe as a model system to analyze the
molecular basis of morphogenetic movements during neuronal development. Using a
variety of markers, the position and movement of these cells can be readily
followed throughout normal and mutant development. Experiments will focus on the
phenotypic and molecular characterization of a gene called sine oculis (so),
which is necessary for the development of the optic lobe. Mutations of so cause
failure of optic lobe invagination. Most recent analyses show that so encodes a
putative transcription factor, that is a protein that is capable of turning on
or off the expression of other genes. It is anticipated that the analysis of so
and its function during the development of the optic lobe will answer many
important questions.
