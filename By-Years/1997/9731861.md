This research focuses on new and continuing experimental tests of quantum
electrodynamics and relativistic bound-state formalism in positronium. Two
systematic tests at the 200 ppm level will be made to address differences
between the current value obtained by this group and the theoretical value. High
precision spectroscopy of positronium in excited states will be continued with
measurement of the n=2 fine structure intervals.
