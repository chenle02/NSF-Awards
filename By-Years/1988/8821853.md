The contractor will maintain and enhance the computer model used to generate
national estimates of the characteristics of scientists and engineers. The
contractor will also provide for data base management services in support of NSF
and other personnel surveys as well as develop customized table generation
procedures for use on personal computers. The Foundation is responsible for
developing and maintaining a data base of demographic, educational, and
employment information on scientists and engineers. This data base, the
Scientific and Technical Personnel Data System, includes three surveys: the
National Survey of Natural and Social Scientists and Engineers, the Survey of
Natural and Social Science and Engineering Graduates, and the Survey of
Doctorate Recipients. Results of the National Survey of Natural and Social
Scientists and Engineers and the Survey of Natural and Social Science and
Engineering Graduates are combined to produce national estimates of the science
and engineering population in the United States.
