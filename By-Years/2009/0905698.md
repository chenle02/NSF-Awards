This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2009
and is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public
Law 111-5). The fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled
"Comparative genomic analysis of sex-chromosome and sex-biased genes in
Heliconius butterflies" for James Walters. The host institution for this
research is the University of Cambridge, and the sponsoring scientist is Chris
Jiggins. The third year will be spent at Stanford University in the laboratory
of Hunter Fraser.

Several theoretical models exist that predict distinct evolutionary dynamics for
genes differentially affiliated with males than females, either via linkage on
sex chromosomes or sex-specific function. This research synthesizes genomic data
concerning chromosomal linkage, gene expression, and sequence divergence to
examine the molecular evolutionary effects of sex-linkage and sex-biased gene
expression in Heliconius butteflies. This research provides a novel test of
these theories in butterflies, where females have different sex chromosomes (XY;
heterogametic) and males have homologous sex chromosomes (XX, homogametic). This
work thus provides an important independent contrast to previous studies
conducted in male heterogametic groups of organisms such as flies and mammals,
and another female heterogametic group (birds).

Training goals include computational and analytical skills associated with the
analysis of genomic-scale data. Specifically, the fellowship allows the Fellow
to gain 1) exposure to genomic methods and data structure, 2) familiarity with
software packages for analyzing biological data, and 3) experience with
programming skills, statistical methods and theory. The broader impacts of this
work include development of Heliconius butterflies as a genomic model system,
promoting international collaborations between the United States and the United
Kingdom, and collaborating with commercial butterfly exhibits to use Heliconius
butterflies as a focus for public science education and outreach.
