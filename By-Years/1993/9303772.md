9303772 Burke This project comprises three areas of study: (1) robust methods in
nonlinear programming, including development of algorithms for problems
involving infeasibility and lack of regularity; (2) least-squares methods for
nonlinear complementarity, and development of globally defined algorithms based
on a least-squares methodology, and (3) eigenvalue optimization and eigenvalue
problems. This research can significantly expand the traditional domain of
applications for nonlinear programming methods. For example, techniques for
infeasible nonlinear programs can be applied to guide a system through a
catastrophic event; e.g., the maintenance of power flow in a power grid that can
no longer meet demand due to a downed transmission line or a damaged switching
station. Global strategies in nonlinear complementarity may permit the solution
of discrete infinite dimensional nonlinear variational inequalities; e.g., the
variational inequalities found in liquid crystal simulation. The research into
variational principles in eigenvalue optimization has wide application in the
optimal design of stable structures having nonlinear dynamics. ***
