Chemistry (12) The Peer-Led Team Learning workshop chemistry model is being
adapted to an environment where peer leaders who have previously taken the
workshop course are unavailable. In particular, two institutions, Northampton
Community College and the Berks Lehigh Valley campus of Pennsylvania State
University, which only offer two years of chemistry courses are using the PLTL
model in the second year organic chemistry course. Since neither institution has
students who took the course in the previous year, students who are currently
taking the course serve as "in-class" peer leaders. This implementation is also
being tested on the Lehigh University campus as well. Comparisons will be made
between student performance with and without in-class peer leaders. Also on the
Lehigh University campus a comparison between using an in-class peer leader and
a peer leader who completed the course in a prior semester will also be made.
Results of these comparisons will be submitted to the Journal of Chemical
Education and presented at national meetings.
