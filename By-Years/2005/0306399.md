Brook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many computation problems, including program analysis
and model checking problems in particular, are most clearly and easily specified
using relational rules. Yet, developing and implementing
efficient&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for these problems is a nontrivial, recurring
task. This project proposes to develop a unified method for transforming rule-
based specifications into efficient algorithms and characterize the
specifications and the transformations to provide time and space guarantees for
the derived algorithms. The project will focus on rule-based specifications for
program analysis and model checking problems and develop fully automatic methods
for the transformations and the time and space analysis in this
domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development will use a general transformational
method that makes computation proceed in an iterative and incremental fashion,
analogous to integration by differentiation in calculus. The method will
also&lt;br/&gt;exploit sophisticated structures for storing and accessing
complex data. The project also proposes to implement these methods, apply them
to existing and new analysis problems, and evaluate them by&lt;br/&gt;comparing
automatically generated implementations with other algorithms and
implementations. The research results will enable faster and better development
and implementations of computer software&lt;br/&gt;for solving practical
analysis problems. The transformational approach will help assure the
correctness and efficiency of the implementations.&lt;br/&gt;
