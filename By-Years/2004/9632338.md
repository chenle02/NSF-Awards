9632338 Antonovics The laws of genetics predict that the genes contributed by
each parent to their progeny will again reappear in a 50:50 ratio in the gametes
of the progeny. However, increasingly it has been found that some genes are
"selfish" and alter the pattern of transmission so as to favor their
representation in future generations. This study will investigate a possible
example of such biased transmission involving the gene determining the mating
type of a fungus that infects and sterilizes the flowers of a common plant
species. Since fusion of cells of opposite mating types is necessary for the
fungus to cause disease, the bias should be disadvantageous, but instead it has
spread in natural populations. The cause of the bias and possible reasons for
its spread will be investigated. The study is important in understanding disease
spread in natural and agricultural plant populations, and in understanding
unusual mechanisms in genetic transmission. These mechanisms may prove useful
for engineering the rapid spread of particular genes that either limit pathogen
growth, or enhance the spread of pathogens used in the biological control of
weeds.
