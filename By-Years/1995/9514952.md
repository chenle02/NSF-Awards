9514952 Rosenau This project, the sixth phase of a long-term collaborative
project, will seize the opportunity offered by the dramatic developments that
have transformed world politics in the years since the end of the Cold War. The
purpose is to advance understanding of the dynamics whereby the United States
responds and adapts to a world that is no longer marked by the euphoria of the
Cold War's end. While Phase VI of the Foreign Policy Leadership Project (FPLP)
is partially designed to assess the stability of earlier findings, its primary
intent is to explore how the belief systems of American leaders have been
affected by the continuing disarray of world affairs and the diminishing
prospects for a new global order founded on multilateral principles. The earlier
studies of the American leadership community found that a) a pre-Vietnam foreign
policy consensus had been replaced by several internally consistent, largely
mutually exclusive and durable belief systems; b) for the most part these sharp
cleavages were not bridged in the face of numerous challenges; c) discernible
ideological and partisan differences prevail between the foreign and domestic
policy belief systems of leaders; and, d) nonetheless certain issues, notably
those involving Israel and trade, stand out as anomalous with respect to the
overall findings. Using the same survey methods employed in the earlier
research, this project applies and tests a theory of political adaptation
designed to account for 1) any major changes that have occurred in leadership
belief systems as a result of such seminal events as the recent failures of the
United Nations, the intensification of tensions with Russia, the outbreak of
conflict in Chechnya, and the advent of tensions over trade with Japan; 2) how
the long-standing habits of thought developed during the decades prior to the
collapse of the USSR have been affected by the end of the Cold War; 3) the
degree to which unilateralist and isolationist tendencies have been fostered by
di sappointments abroad as well as domestic terrorism and mounting tensions over
the country's social and economic agenda; 4) those dimensions of the various
belief systems that have remained stable in the face of changes in world and
national politics; and, 5) the ways in which the transformations at home and
abroad may have induced tendencies toward a more widespread consensus or toward
ever deeper cleavages within the American leadership community. This is a data
resource that will be used widely by scholars interested in the topic. ***
