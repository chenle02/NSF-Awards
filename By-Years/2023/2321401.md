This project -- Setting Up Research Foundations Multiple Organization Regional
OneOklahoma Friction Free Network (SURF-MORe-OFFN) -- connects Mid-America
Christian University, Northwestern Oklahoma State University, Oklahoma State
University Biomedical Imaging Center, Rose State College and Western Oklahoma
State College to the OneOklahoma Friction Free Network (OFFN). SURF-MORe-OFFN
enables a wide-range of research and education activities in cybersecurity,
natural science, biomedical engineering, nursing and STEM-related fields that
meet workforce needs. Faculty and students across the state will have access to
new research and education opportunities through the enhanced
cyberinfrastructure resources. SURF-MORe-OFFN leverages existing statewide
partnerships to provide students access to researchers and cyberinfrastructure
practitioners, creating substantial collaboration opportunities. Collectively
these institutions educate a diverse student population including Hispanic,
military, first-generation, and adult learners as well as traditional students
who transfer to four-year universities.

SURF-MORe-OFFN extends the OneOklahoma Friction Free Network to under-resourced
campuses and a biomedical research center by implementing Science DMZs, Data
Transfer Nodes and network performance monitoring capabilities to support
research and education drivers. SURF-MORe-OFFN engages technical personnel at
each campus to facilitate adoption of new technology and provide access to
network infrastructure, computing tools and scientific equipment. The project
also engages faculty and students in the larger OneOklahoma CyberInfrastructure
Initiative (OneOCII), which enhances research computing throughout Oklahoma.
OFFN is managed by OneNet, Oklahomaâ€™s research and education network. Scientific
leadership is provided by the University of Oklahoma.

This award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by
the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
