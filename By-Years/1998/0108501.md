The cereal crops foxtail millet and pearl millet, and noxious
weeds&lt;br/&gt;such as green foxtail and sandbur are all closely related
members of the&lt;br/&gt;grass family, and are part of a group of 310 species
descended from a&lt;br/&gt;single ancestor. These plants are all characterized
by odd "bristles"&lt;br/&gt;interspersed among their flowers; the bristles are
highly modified&lt;br/&gt;branches. This project will determine the precise
relationships among as&lt;br/&gt;many species as possible in the "bristle group"
using DNA sequences from&lt;br/&gt;the nucleus and the chloroplast. At the same
time, the development of the&lt;br/&gt;seed head (inflorescence) and flowers
will be studied for a precise&lt;br/&gt;description of how the species differ.
Along with this, the graduate&lt;br/&gt;student supported on the grant will
determine how many species are in the&lt;br/&gt;foxtail millet group, what the
species look like, and will write&lt;br/&gt;identification guides to them.
Because there is already information on&lt;br/&gt;the species in North and South
America, this part of the project will focus&lt;br/&gt;on Asia and
Africa.&lt;br/&gt; The information gained in this project will connect directly
with&lt;br/&gt;other information already available on foxtail millet and the
panicoid&lt;br/&gt;grasses. The genes that control morphological variation in
foxtail millet&lt;br/&gt;are under active investigation, and some of these are
similar to known&lt;br/&gt;genes in maize. It should soon be possible to
describe morphological&lt;br/&gt;variation in the clade in terms of the genes
involved. This will help&lt;br/&gt;answer questions about how species and larger
groups are formed. The&lt;br/&gt;resulting study will provide a direct and
explicit link between phylogeny,&lt;br/&gt;developmental morphology, and
taxonomy, and will provide a framework for&lt;br/&gt;work on the evolution of
development
