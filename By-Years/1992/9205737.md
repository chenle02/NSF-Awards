Massively parallel computers show promise in several computational areas. In
this project a commercial massively parallel computer is being used for several
large-scale computational problems, including the architectural simulation of
the P3, a proposed experimental massively parallel computer. Other applications
of the commercial machine come from physics, chemistry, and discrete
mathematics.
