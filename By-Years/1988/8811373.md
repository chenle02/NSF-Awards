This proposal represents a pilot project for a longer term research program.
The long term goal of the program is an elucidation of morphogenetic mechanisms
in developing multicellular animals. The proposed work will examine the
morphogenesis of the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs), a population of migratory
cells in the sea urchin embryo. These cells undergo a dramatic sequence of
movements that can be observed directly in the living embryo. Dr. Ettehsohn's
studies will combine an analysis of cell behavior in situ with biochemical and
immunological approaches. Specifically, he will focus on three aspects cell-cell
and cell-substratum interactions during PMC morphogenesis: 1) He will examine
the mechanisms that underlie the directionality of PMC migration by a
combination of approaches, including micromanipulation of PMCs, isolation and
modification (biochemical and immunological) of embryonic extracellular
matrices, cell ablation, and electron microscopy, 2) He will analyze the
molecular interactions that take place between the PMCs and their substratum,
the embryonic basal lamina, by using antibodies and peptides to interfere with
the function of putative basal lamina adhesion molecules, 3) He will examine
cell-cell interactions during PMC morphogenesis, focussing on the mechanism by
which the PMCs prevent other mesenchyme cells in the embryo form expressing a
skeletogenic phenotype. %%% This proposal addresses a central question of
embryonic development: what mechanisms are responsible for organizing cells into
highly complex tissues and organs? This process is known to involve extensive
cell movements and rearrangements. Dr. Ettensohn is using the developing sea
urchin to examine the mechanisms that regulate these types of ordered cell
movements.
