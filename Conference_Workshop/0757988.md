Abstract

The purpose of the project is support of the US participants of the conference
"Groups generated by automata", which will take place at the conference center
Centro Stefano Franscini of the Swiss Technical University (ETH) in Ascona,
Switzerland from February 10 to February 14, 2008. The conference is devoted to
an active branch of modern Algebra: groups generated by automata(transducers).
The conference will focus on applications of groups generated by automata to
other topics of Mathematics: automatic sequences, Galois Theory, dynamical
systems, etc. It will bring together specialists of different areas, will be a
venue for sharing ideas between them and provide a comprehensive introduction to
the subject to all interested in it.

Groups generated by automata where discovered in 1970's, as interesting examples
of groups with exotic properties. An important recent development is a strong
link with dynamical systems, which has made them an important tool in
holomorphic dynamics and analysis on fractals. A thorough introduction to these
topics will be provided at the conference, so that experts from different fields
(in particular from Holomorphic and Symbolic Dynamics) may get quick in-depth
knowledge of groups generated by automata.
