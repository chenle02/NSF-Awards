Prior work has documented a change in host-plant preference over the last ten
years in a population of an herbivorous butterfly. This population has
incorporated a European weed into its diet. Comparing the preference of insects
for plants maintained in laboratory culture for ten years will test whether the
change is due to adaptation by the insect or to a change in the plant that has
increased its acceptability. Similarly, the fact that different populations of
this insect exhibit different preferences could be due to genetic variation in
the insect (already shown) or variation in the plants, or both. The potential
contribution of variation in plant acceptability to this geographic variation
will be quantified. The results of this research will show how the complexity of
insect diet in time and space arises from past and present insect-plant
interactions. The information has implications for biological pest control as a
model for insect invasions of agricultural habitats.
