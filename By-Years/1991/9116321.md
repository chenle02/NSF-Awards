This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the College of Environmental Science and Forestry of
the State University of New York acquire a high-brillance, rotating anode X-ray
generator unit. This instrument will be equipped for computer-controlled X-ray
diffraction in both wide angle and small angle modes, complete with control and
data processing software, for use in diffraction analysis of powders, fibers,
and films. The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the
acquisition are the following: 1) Crystallinity studies of materials for the
construction of energy efficient membranes used in organic and azeotropic liquid
separation; 2) Structural characterization of membrane mimetic systems for
energy conversion; 3) Crystallinity and morphology characterization of composite
materials such as polymer alloys and blends, and surfaces of catalysts; 4)
Crystal structure analysis of fibrous polymers used in membranes and polymers
blends; 5) Crystal structure analysis of polymers used in enhanced oil recovery
programs. Single crystal X-ray is the most powerful analytical method for
structure determination of solids. In synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic
and organometallic chemistry, single crystal X-ray diffraction is an invaluable
tool to characterize molecular structure. The information gained from the
knowledge of the intermolecular composition and structure helps to develop new
reactions of potentially general interest in catalysis or organic synthesis.
