The central aim is to advance biosensing of DNA, such as the human genome, in
support of personalized medicine, clinical diagnostics, and basic life science
research. A technology termed pulsed-field hybridization will be developed by
combining electric field control of molecular behavior with optimized sensor
designs, based on synthetic DNA analogues, to eliminate errors and to
significantly shorten analysis time. The project also encompasses educational
goals centered on design of learning software that illustrates molecular
properties and on organization of publicly accessible science lectures and
demonstrations.

Biosensing applications must handle complex sample matrices in which the
analyte of interest needs to be distinguished against a background of other
molecules. In nucleic acid diagnostics, background interference most often
involves cross-hybridization from DNA or RNA molecules with a degree of
similarity to the desired sequence. Cross-hybridization leads to multiple
detrimental consequences including blocking binding of the perfectly matched
analyte, markedly slowing down approach to equilibrium so that assay endpoints
are defined by kinetic history rather than path-independent thermodynamics, and
loss of precision due to contributions from the cross-hybridized species. These
concerns become amplified for sequence-rich samples comprising larger genomes,
mixtures of genetic material from multiple sources, or when the sequence of
interest is one of several closely related sequences. This project proposes a
bioanalytical method termed pulsed field hybridization (PFH) to solve these
challenges. Through use of charge-neutral DNA analogues called morpholinos and
modulated electric fields, PFH seeks highly efficient, field-based manipulation
of hybridization to dramatically reduce equilibration timescales and to enable
"distilling", through a stage-wise operation, of the purity of the hybridized
product. The project will develop a thorough fundamental understanding of how
surface fields influence thermodynamics and kinetics of hybridization on
morpholino-derivatized sensors, and of the impact of analyte characteristics
including excess nucleotides, unhybridized tails, and variously placed
mismatches. These fundamental studies will be accompanied by application to
complex sample matrices typical of clinical situations to demonstrate a fully
functional, practical method. Project participants will in addition assist with
research exhibitions open to the public, engage in organizing lectures on
nanoscience, and collaborate on development of learning software to provide a
fun, informative look into the behavior of molecules.
