This ground-based program of millimeter spectroscopic observations of the upper
stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower thermosphere investigates a wide range of
photochemical and isotopic processes. Through the previous grant, the PI
obtained spectral line observations of this poorly explored atmospheric region
point to a number of surprises, including large variations in the D/H ratio of
mesospheric water. Most of these millimeter line emissions, however, were weak,
and the PI needs long integrations under good observing conditions for
sufficiently accurate measurements. Thus, the investigator proposes a three-year
program of millimeter spectral line observations at the significantly upgraded
Kitt Peak detector configuration. Kitt Peak's improved sensitivity of millimeter
spectral line measurements, increased by a factor of four, will enhance these
unique constituent measurements of the upper middle atmosphere. Finally,
analysis of the resulting data will improve understanding of the mesosphere and
attack outstanding problems understanding transport, photochemical and solar
cycle processes within the entire middle atmosphere.***
