This project is designed to provide students with experience in three important
areas: a sense of three-dimensional structures of molecules; hands-on experience
with bonding theories in relation to molecular properties; and understanding
reactions at the molecular level. The course modifications associated with
interfacing computers are bringing about a systemic change across the chemistry
curriculum and allowing students to engage in discovery-based experiments
fostering curiosity. The goal is not to train students in theoretical organic
chemistry, but to use computational methods to foster a cooperative and inquiry
based learning atmosphere. Molecular modeling is being implemented as a tool for
clarifying misconceptions, leading students through the inquiry process,
providing the opportunity to test hypotheses, and finally allowing students to
assert ownership of the knowledge. The major impact is in the area of organic
chemistry. A faculty member at the University of Missouri-Columbia is serving as
an advisor for the project, assisting in developing experiments, co-authoring
experiments submitted for publication, and implementing newly developed
experiments into the organic chemistry curriculum at the university. The
collaboration between Graceland College, a rural liberal arts college, and the
University of Missouri-Columbia, a large research university, is serving as a
model for enhancing the chemistry curriculum and expanding the opportunities for
undergraduate students. *
