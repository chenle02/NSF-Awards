A Penrose Conference "Plume IV: Beyond the Plume Hypothesis" will be run in
Iceland, August 2003. The overall objective of the Conference is to develop
alternative models for large volcanic provinces. This will be achieved through
critical examination of the plume hypothesis in the light of the three decades
of research since its original proposal, discussion and assessment of
alternative models, and identification of the major tasks ahead in the field.
The Conference will last a week, be limited to 60 participants and have a
dominantly discussion-based format. It will be the first conference to be held
on this subject, and will provide focus and definition to an embryonic subject,
that of alternative mechanisms for large volcanic provinces. The plume
hypothesis [Morgan, 1971] has been invoked, largely uncritically, for 30 years,
to explain the origin of voluminous, long-lived volcanism at intraplate and
near- ridge locations such as Yellowstone, Hawaii and Iceland. It is popularly
adopted as a fundamental premise of geology and presented as isfactle in
educational settings at all levels. However, with the acquisition of ever-
superior data, e.g. radiometric ages and whole-mantle tomography, it is becoming
increasingly clear that large volcanic areas are far more complex than initially
supposed, and it has been necessary to elaborate increasingly the original
simple plume hypothesis in order to fit the new data. This conference will
provide a foundation forum for the subject.
