This award provides funds to continue a successful Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site program in the Department of Biological Sciences at the
University of Missouri-Columbia. The Department will work in partnership with a
select group of undergraduate institutions, including predominantly minority
institutions, to provide students with the kind of research experience only
available at a major comprehensive research university. This REU program will
complement an internship program for MU students funded through a grant from the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Faculty participant's research programs center
on the theme "Cellular, Molecular and Genetic Approaches to Biological
Problems," and utilize methodology raging from recombinant DNA technology, to
immunocytochemistry, to sophisticated electrophysiology. All participating
faculty are personally involved in their research projects, are well-funded, and
have a history of successful partnerships with undergraduates interns. While the
research experience is the cornerstone of the summer program, multiple and
varied opportunities for the students to develop their communication skills, and
the opportunity to present their research at local and regional scientific
meetings are provided. Finally, a number of enrichment activities including
seminars by research faculty, an informal evening program "Science and
Scientists," and a panel discussion on selecting and applying to graduate
schools have been developed.
