The Herbarium Pacificum is the world's most important resource for botanical
collections representing Hawaii and the Pacific, particularly Polynesia,
Micronesia, and Melanesia. It is, without question, the best collection of the
flora of the Hawaiian Islands. This representation of the unique flora of the
Hawaiian Islands stands as the most central and vital resource for conservation
and biodiversity studies in these islands. This project will provide support for
the expansion of Herbarium Pacificum into an additional facility of
approximately 1320 sq.ft. That space will be equipped with a compactor system
and cases, and the entire algal, moss, fungal and lichen collections of
Herbarium Pacificum, as well as the special collection of Pandanus (screw pine)
that is now scattered in three separate locations, will be moved into the cases.
these changes will relieve present crowding of the collections of flowering
plants and ferns in the main herbarium by expanding them some 33%. Finally, the
flowering plant, algal, Pandanus and fungal collections will be brought into a
fully curated condition.
