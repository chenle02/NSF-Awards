The Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center proposes a two-week intensive
training/education session for twenty students. In addition to instruction in
the mechanics of effective use of a vector supercomputer, students will be
exposed to other aspects of the field such as multiprocessing, numerical
methods, data communications, graphics, and an assesment of future trends.
Lectures from practicing computational researchers will be included. The course
will focus on the use of the PSC's Cray XMP48 supercomputer. Each student will
have a DEC Vaxstation 2000 graphics workstation which will be connected to the
PSC system. The students will be divided into three teams, each of which will
have a major coding project to complete during the two weeks of the Institute.
To insure the interest of all students, the projects will focus on the solution
of partial differential equations in fluid dynamics, a mathematical technique
used in many scientific and engineering disciplines and common in advanced
computations. This is a strong proposal; an award in the amount of $40,000 is
recommended.
