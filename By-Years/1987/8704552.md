This grant will support a program of heavy-ion nuclear physics experiments by
faculty and students from Western Kentucky University. The research will be
carried out using accelerators and instrumentation at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, and will involve collaborations with Oak Ridge scientists. Inelastic
scattering of a variety of heavy ion beams from targets of Pb-208 will be
measured and analyzed. The grant is made under the auspices of the Research at
Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program.
