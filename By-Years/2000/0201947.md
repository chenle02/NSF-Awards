The PI's are requesting funding from NSF to support the attendance of US
students and young scientists to the "8th International Conference in X-Ray
Lasers", that will be held at the Aspen Institute, in Aspen Colorado during the
last week of May of 2002. This bi- annual international conference is recognized
as the most important in the field of X-Ray lasers, and constitutes a forum to
report the most recent advances in one of the frontiers of laser research. The
conference will cover advances in ultrashort wavelength laser development,
theory, and applications. Advances in the field of soft x-ray lasers have a
synergistic effect in several disciplines. After decades of research these
sources have now reached the point at which they are making important
contributions to numerous disciplines, including plasma physics, material
surface characterization, nanoelectronic metrology, and biology. The
continuation of advance of this field is therefore of significant scientific and
industrial interest. The conference has historically changed locations, to give
at different times the maximum opportunity for attendance to scientists and
students from different countries. In May 2002 it will be 8 years since the
conference was held in the United States, in Williamsburg (Virginia), in May
1994. The 2002 Aspen conference follows very successful meetings in Sweden
(Lund, 1996), Japan (Kyoto, 1998) and France (Saint Malo, 2000). The Aspen
meeting will offer the United States scientific and broad technical community
the opportunity to actively participate in this international forum. National
Science Foundation support will be important in assisting the participation a
maximum number of US students and young scientists, and to make the
presentations at the meeting accessible to the scientific community in general
through the rapid publication of the conference proceedings. More than 250
scientists from all over the world are expected to attend.
