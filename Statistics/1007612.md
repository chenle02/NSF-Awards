This proposal describes plans for the Thirteenth Meeting of New Researchers in
Statistics and Probability to be held in the campus of British Columbia,
Vancouver, during July 27--July 30, 2010. Housing, meals, and conference
facilities will be provided on campus. This conference series is organized by
and held for junior researchers. The primary objective is to provide a much
needed venue for interaction among new researchers. In contrast with large
meetings, this conference will be restricted in size, with a target of 85-90
participants. Sessions will be followed by panel discussions and breaks to
facilitate interactions. Participants will be statisticians and probabilist who
have received their Ph.D. within the past five years or are expecting to receive
their degree within the next year. Each participant will present a talk or
poster. Topics will range across a variety of areas in statistical research from
theory and methods to applications. Senior speakers will discuss topics of
particular interest to new researchers. Panel discussions during the conference
will cover the topics of journal publications, opportunities in statistics
laboratories and industry, funding, mentoring, and teaching.

The intellectual merit of this proposal is based on its human resource
development. The professional development of new researchers is stimulated by
promoting their interaction, creating networks of colleagues (which is usually
difficult at a large meeting, such as the Joint Statistical Meeting).
Participants present their work in a smaller, more controlled conference
environment, maximizing their intellectual interaction and growth. The primary
goals of the conference are professional education of new researchers and to
help create a network among these junior researchers, both are vital parts of
professional growth. Women, minorities, and the disabled are explicitly
encouraged to attend, and we have an established track record of attracting
participants from these categories.
