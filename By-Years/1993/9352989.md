9352989 Narayan SUNY College at Oswego will initiate a four week summer
residential Early Alert project for 32 eighth graders. The disciplinary focus
will be mathematics and physics. The project challenges students to develop new
ways of thinking about mathematics and physics. Exploratory sessions, workshops
and hands on activities will focus on such topics as: graph theory and its
applications, Logo, mathematical patterns in number theory elementary mechanics,
and the physics of light. All students work on group and individual projects
suitable for a regional science fair. Follow up activities include six Saturday
workshops and conferences. ***
