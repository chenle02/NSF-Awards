The University of Florida Herbarium (FLAS) is the largest herbarium in Florida
and the fourth largest in the southeastern United States. It is nationally and
internationally known for its collections from Florida, North America, the
Caribbean, and Latin America. The vascular plant collection has over 216,000
specimins and over 250 types. Taxonomists at the University of Florida are
engages in a wide diversity of projects in Florida, North America, Central and
South America, and the Caribbean. The collection is used by entomologists and
other zoologiests studying host plants, by ecologists, and by a wide range of
systematic botanists. The collection is currently overcrowded and lacks space
for expansion. The vascular plant collection is being moved into larger space
and compactors are being installed. This project will support the purchase of
102 new herbarium cases to use on the compactor and in adjacent room to help
alleviate problems associated with over crowding, as well as to meet anticipated
growth for the next decade.
