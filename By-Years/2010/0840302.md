WGBH's newest mission is to develop the Children's Sustainability Project - a
daily animated series for kids ages 8-11 that will teach the STEM concepts
underlying systems and sustainability. Our promise is that 7-8 kids from around
the world become trapped, one by one, in an inventive, multi-leveled video game.
The kids, unlikely heros all, are initially happy to be stuck but eventually
want desperately to get out of the home. To do this they must become inventive
and creative and play the game to the end. Stakes are high and only systems
thinking and sustainable actions can save the day.
