Partnership with Industry for Engineering Cooperative Experiences and
Scholarships (PIECES) builds on existing programs and relationships with
regional employers and professional organizations to provide financial
assistance, academic and social support, and opportunities for work experience
to talented students entering the School of Engineering. The objectives are to
increase the quality and diversity of engineers, computer scientists, and
construction managers entering the regional workforce. PIECES provides financial
assistance for the first two years in order to include more students in the
program. Afterwards, students have opportunities to work as interns in area
firms to gain valuable experience and to provide continued financial support. In
addition to internships, students have a variety of other opportunities to
interact with practicing professionals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PIECES funds three
cohorts of approximately 16 students (48 total). The areas that are served are
economically-depressed rural counties and the inner-city schools of a large city
which provides a diverse applicant pool. Recruitment strategies build on
existing recruitment efforts and scholarship programs. Recipients are selected
based on financial need, academic merit, communication skills, and professional
motivation. PIECES also benefits the general population of students in the
School of Engineering as the culture of partnership with industry during
students academic careers becomes established and local employers increasingly
seek these graduates. In addition, commitments from local employers to consider
funding the program after the NSF grant ends provide much-needed long-term
scholarship assistance to attract freshman into engineering when the employers
see the benefit of PIECES and are more willing to invest in student early
academic careers.
