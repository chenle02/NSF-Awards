9415404 Stavola Hydrogen is a common and highly reactive impurity in
semiconductors. It has been known for more than a decade that hydrogen forms
complexes with deep level impurities and modifies their electrical properties,
but these hydrogen containing complexes have remained poorly understood because
it has not been possible to obtain structure sensitive data. Previously the PI
discovered that complexes of hydrogen with transition metal impurities in
silicon can be formed in sufficient number. This research will take advantage of
this finding to use structure sensitive methods like infrared absorption and
electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies. The microscopic structures and
electrical properties of several hydrogenated deeplevel defects will be
investigated using these techniques. The primary goal of this work is to develop
a fundamental understanding of several model systems that will provide a
foundation for understanding complexes with deep-level defects in
semiconductors. %%% Hydrogen is frequently introduced into semiconductor
materials where it modifies the electrical properties of defects an impurities.
This is particularly true, for example, in the polycrystalline or amorphous
semiconductors used in solar cell or flat panel display technologies where the
presence of hydrogen is necessary to improve material characteristics. It has
not been understood at a fundamental level how hydrogen affects defect
properties because, previously, it had been difficult to determine the
microscopic structures of the hydrogen defects. In this work, structure-
sensitive measurements will be made to elucidate the properties of several
hydrogen containing defects in Si that can be used as models to help understand
how semiconductor defects interact with hydrogen. ***
