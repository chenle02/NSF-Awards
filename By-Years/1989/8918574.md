Extratropical planetary Rossby waves are known to propagate energy upward and
equatorward from their tropospheric source region. Much of this wave activity
reaches the equatorial middle atmosphere, where relatively little is known about
its fate. Satellite data reveal that, around the solstices, when the equatorial
middle atmosphere is inertially unstable, vertically layered disturbances (so-
called "pancake structures") appear over the equator, but only when a burst of
Rossby wave activity is impinging on the region. In this fundamental
hydrodynamic study, the PI will use a high vertical resolution middle atmosphere
version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate
Model (CCM) to test the hypothesis that the pancake structures are caused by
Rossby waves entering an inertially unstable region. A hierarchy of experiments
will be performed in which high latitude wave forcing is controlled and the mean
flow is specified successively to be inertially stable, inertially unstable, and
finally allowed to evolve with the wave field. In addition to gaining insight
into the fate of Rossby waves at low latitudes, this study will improve
understanding of interhemispheric tracer transport. Cross-equatorial transport
diagnosed in the CCM will be parameterized in a two-dimensional middle
atmosphere assessment model currently used to model ozone distribution.
