BSCS proposes to conduct a design study on capstone biology at the high school
level. In U.S. high schools biology has traditionally been the science course
that students take first, followed by chemistry and physics. Some schools
recently have been implementing physics first and biology as the final (or
capstone) course. This design study brings together experts in science,
teaching, science education, professional development and curriculum development
to study how biology as a capstone course must differ from an introductory
course. To provide informed results BSCS will use multiple techniques for
acquiring reliable and relevant information. These techniques include national
surveys of teachers, administrators and biologists; case studies of capstone
course implementation; a comprehensive review of the literature and commissioned
essays. After collecting this data BSCS will develop a coherent framework,
present prospective models and make evidenced-based recommendations for a
capstone biology course. The findings of the study will be compiled in a
monograph and an executive summary, which will be disseminated widely.
