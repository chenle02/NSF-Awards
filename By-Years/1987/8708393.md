The structure of the ribosome will be investigated as a source of information
for reconstructing the evolutionary history of vertebrates, especially
salamanders. The evolutionary relationships inferred from these data will permit
evaluation of the mechanisms of molecular evolution, organismal evolution and
speciation that have been utilized during vertebrate evolution. This information
will be particularly useful for investigating the developmental mechanisms by
which novel, adaptive features are produced by the evolutionary process.
Resolution of evolutionary relationships will permit the construction of a more
stable and useful taxonomic classification for the species studied. This study
will identify which parts of the ribosome are likely to be most informative for
evaluating evolutionary relationships across a broad spectrum of evolutionary
time, thereby facilitating evolutionary studies of additional taxa.
