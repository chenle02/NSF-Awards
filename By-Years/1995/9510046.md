9510046 Van Stryland The PI proposes to apply the knowledge he has gained in
understanding the nonlinear response of inorganic materials (both semiconductors
and dielectrics) to organic materials. In particular he will concentrate on
specific classes of organic materials such as macrocyclic dyes that have been
shown to exhibit strong nonlinearities. He will also investigate resonant
nonlinearities in these materials. For example, metallophthalocyanines and
metallo-naphthalocyanines exhibit increasing absorption from excited state
absorption (reverse saturable absorbers). Such nonlinearities are proving useful
for optical limiting. In addition, he will further develop a numerical modeling
for determining the propagation of light through thick nonlinear media. This
modeling allows optimized use of nonlinear absorption and nonlinear refraction
for applications such as optical limiting. His past research investigated two-
photon absorption (2PA), bound electronic nonlinear refraction characterized by
n2, and free-carrier effects in semiconductors and dielectrics. He has recently
extended these measurements to molecular species and observed analogous
nonlinearities. ***
