Active volcanoes provide a uniquely exciting environment in which students can
learn how to conduct field-based geologic research. A new course, Field
Volcanology, is based in the southern Cascades, a region containing three active
volcanoes with contrasting eruptive styles. The course extends the traditional
geology field camp curriculum by teaching how mapping can be used in conjunction
with other skills to address specific research questions. Through a series of
integrated projects the participants learn how to prepare detailed geologic maps
and cross sections; install equipment in the field; collect, analyze and
interpret a variety of original data; use field criteria to evaluate different
eruption models; and assess the state of activity and potential hazards of each
volcano. By using this environment and teaching approach we seek to produce
motivated and well-trained young scientists who will be better prepared for a
professional career in whatever subdiscipline they choose to pursue. The
proposed five-week Field Volcanology course builds upon two of the major
strengths of the Geology Department at Arizona State University: its
internationally recognized program in volcanology and its undergraduate and
graduate curricula that are centered upon a variety of field courses. It also
takes advantage of some equipment purchased through an earlier ILI grant for
development of a field geophysics course.
